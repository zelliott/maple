zzso species zzso zzso are a group of zzso zzso zzso that are highly specific to freshwater fish of the family zzso zzso species were sampled from 19 zzso and one zzso collected in zzso Using partial zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso of 51 zzso species was reconstructed to investigate the patterns of zzso zzso and zzso Three main zzso lineages were recognized from all zzso trees, that is, analysis of zzso zzso alone and combined zzso and zzso The first lineage associates the zzso species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso the second associates zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and the third associates zzso species of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is of quite recent origin and that these three lineages separated from each other in a very short period of zzso Host zzso mapping onto the zzso tree zzso from analysis of the combined zzso showed that the zzso could be zzso hosts for zzso zzso zzso would have zzso zzso the zzso and representatives of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of host and zzso zzso relationships indicated that a very high number of zzso zzso occurred within two of the three zzso zzso zzso diversification can be mainly explained by zzso zzso zzso events that seem to be correlated to strict host zzso Moreover, the present study shows that the zzso zzso zzso within one host tend to occupy niches within hosts differing at least in one niche zzso
