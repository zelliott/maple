The rat zzso cell line zzso appears a good candidate for the large-scale production of low zzso zzso zzso due to its lower expression of zzso gene than other commonly used zzso cell zzso However, important variations of the zzso content of zzso zzso are observed in production culture zzso To improve our knowledge on the zzso zzso capacity, we have cloned and characterized the rat zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso cells by zzso chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid sequence showing zzso and zzso identity to human and pig zzso zzso The zzso protein expressed in zzso cells exhibits a zzso activity toward human zzso The rat zzso gene is located on zzso 6 zzso and spans over 140 zzso It contains 9 coding zzso and four zzso zzso FISH analysis shows a zzso copy number of zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso mean copy zzso The zzso zzso gene is expressed as two main transcripts that differ in the first untranslated zzso by the usage of distinct promoters and alternative zzso zzso zzso allow defining the minimal promoting regions governing the initiation of the two zzso which are zzso expressed in zzso as shown by duplex zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the minimal promoter regions upstream zzso zzso and zzso governing the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, evidenced several consensus sequences for potential zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso factor expression zzso allowed identifying zzso as a putative zzso of zzso transcript in zzso zzso 

Altogether, these data contribute to a better knowledge of zzso expression in zzso that will be useful to better control the zzso of zzso zzso produced in these zzso
