Acquisition as well as zzso of zzso are essential processes for plant zzso In many plants, zzso zzso by roots and distribution within the plant are presumed to occur via a zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the isolation of two zzso zzso and zzso from potato zzso zzso that show zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The predicted products of both zzso share zzso identity with the zzso zzso The deduced structure of the zzso proteins revealed 12 zzso zzso with a central zzso zzso The molecular mass was calculated to be 59 zzso for the zzso protein and 58 zzso for the zzso zzso When expressed in a zzso zzso strain, zzso both zzso zzso the zzso zzso of radioactive zzso by the zzso zzso expressing either zzso or zzso was dependent on pH and reduced in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso cyanide zzso The zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins was determined to be 280 and 130 zzso zzso zzso is expressed in roots, zzso and source leaves as well as in floral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and sulfur changed spatial expression as well as the expression level of zzso zzso expression was detected mainly in root zzso when plants were deprived of zzso and to a lesser extent under sulfur deprivation zzso No expression was found under zzso nutrition conditions or when other zzso were zzso
