The zzso zzso zzso system was used for in zzso synthesis of unmodified versions of the zzso coli zzso zzso that insert zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were used to zzso explore the role of some zzso bases and the zzso zzso in the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso zzso with data from earlier studies, these new results essentially complete a survey of all zzso coli zzso with respect to the involvement of zzso bases and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso It is found that in the vast majority of zzso both of these elements are significant components of zzso zzso This is not universally true, zzso zzso sequences are zzso in zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso base is inconsequential in zzso and zzso The significance of these results for zzso studies is zzso
