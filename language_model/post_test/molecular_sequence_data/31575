zzso zzso is a widespread zzso Some bacteria and zzso have been reported to degrade zzso but the gene clusters responsible for zzso zzso have not been zzso In this study, a zzso of the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was amplified from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain zzso with zzso zzso The zzso disruption zzso strain zzso could not degrade zzso but could degrade the green intermediate zzso zzso zzso which was generated during zzso zzso by strain zzso The zzso sequences of zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso genes constitute a gene zzso zzso and zzso are closely related to the zzso family zzso regulator and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso strain for the zzso strain zzso recovered the ability to degrade zzso and the strain zzso coli zzso which expressed the zzso gene zzso had the ability to transform zzso to zzso indicating that zzso is a key gene in the initial step of zzso degradation and that zzso zzso zzso to zzso A library of zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso was obtained by random zzso zzso The fragments zzso the zzso zzso were amplified and zzso and the zzso gene cluster was zzso zzso could transform zzso to yield an intermediate product, zzso acid zzso which was further zzso by zzso zzso and zzso are closely related to the zzso family zzso regulator and the MFS family zzso zzso
