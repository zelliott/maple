To understand the spectrum of proteins affected by diabetes and to characterize molecular functions and biological processes they control, we analyzed the zzso cortical zzso of zzso mice using zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso This approach yielded zzso high confidence identifications whose expression levels were significantly increased or decreased zzso by diabetes, of which 170 mapped to gene identifiers representing 147 zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of these proteins modulated zzso functions, zzso involved zzso approximately zzso involved zzso and organic acid zzso zzso involved zzso or zzso and zzso involved fatty acid zzso zzso molecular functions were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, and zzso and zzso binding zzso Twenty eight percent of the proteins identified as significantly altered by diabetes were zzso zzso The top-ranked network described by zzso zzso Analysis indicated zzso was the most common zzso of interaction for the numerous zzso whose expression levels were influenced by zzso These zzso regulated proteins create a foundation for a systems biology exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of diabetic zzso
