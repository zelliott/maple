The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods zzso zzso (a zzso dough from the zzso of zzso and zzso (a zzso dough from zzso zzso was studied by a zzso approach using zzso to separate the amplified target zzso region of the zzso zzso gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and zzso zzso Three different extraction methods were zzso zzso zzso DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by zzso in zzso zzso By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for zzso samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food zzso zzso of DNA bands from zzso gels corresponding to zzso zzso samples revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The following bacteria were identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
