Previously our laboratory identified zzso as a potential downstream target of zzso by utilizing zzso analysis and promoter data base mining zzso zzso zzso zzso George, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso directly regulates zzso zzso by binding to zzso elements within its zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso bound to the zzso elements on the zzso promoter zzso mark zzso number zzso Both zzso zzso activity zzso in transient zzso experiments and zzso shift zzso supported the idea that zzso regulates zzso by directly binding to its zzso zzso Additionally, by using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso elements between zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind zzso zzso and are associated with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso elements between zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso with zzso zzso and zzso also associated with zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso and quantitative real time reverse zzso showed diminished levels of zzso transcripts in zzso mouse zzso (whose zzso is characterized by neural tube zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso day zzso 30 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso may play a pivotal role during early embryonic zzso
