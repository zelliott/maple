zzso zzso the rat liver regulatory protein of zzso were cloned and zzso The deduced protein contains zzso zzso acids for a molecular mass of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of a major zzso species of zzso zzso in rat zzso No signal was observed with muscle, brain, heart, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso regulatory protein expressed in zzso coli was zzso and zzso and was presumably contained in inclusion zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein was recognized by zzso raised against regulatory protein zzso from rat zzso
