Display of peptides on zzso zzso zzso display, is an in zzso selection technique well suited for identification of therapeutic zzso zzso for a huge variety of protein zzso The peptides are identified in a process where zzso libraries are subjected to affinity selection towards a particular protein zzso A successful outcome of an affinity selection is dependent on proper surveillance of the zzso life cycle, to make sure that the selection is based on affinity for the target, not on bias in zzso propagation zzso In this chapter we present two approaches for protein target presentation and a protocol for zzso rescue and zzso which includes several controls to ensure that all zzso initially zzso from the protein target are given equal conditions during the following amplification and selection zzso
