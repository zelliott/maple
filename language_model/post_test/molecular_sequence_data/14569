zzso zzso 1 zzso repairs zzso I zzso complexes zzso by zzso their zzso DNA bonds and repairs zzso DNA damage by zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been implicated in the repair of zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is involved in the repair of various DNA zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso cells in chicken zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells with human zzso We found that zzso cells were not only hypersensitive to zzso and zzso but also to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show they were deficient in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso human zzso was found to process zzso DNA ends when they mimic the zzso of zzso zzso also processes zzso zzso generated from zzso of zzso sites, which is consistent with the hypersensitivity of zzso cells to zzso and zzso Because recent studies established that zzso together with zzso also repairs zzso DNA damage, we generated dual zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso act in parallel pathways for the repair of zzso and zzso zzso but are zzso for zzso Together, our findings reveal a broad involvement of zzso in DNA repair and clarify the role of human zzso in the repair of zzso DNA zzso
