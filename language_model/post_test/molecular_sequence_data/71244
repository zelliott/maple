zzso zzso are highly abundant surface membrane proteins that coat the surface of zzso zzso While their function is unknown, recent studies with the common fish zzso zzso zzso suggest their involvement in a novel mechanism of zzso immunity involving an effect of zzso on zzso zzso To gain further insight into the nature of these zzso we have cloned a gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the gene zzso zzso reveals a single, uninterrupted reading frame that predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso Based on its deduced zzso acid zzso the protein contains zzso zzso acid zzso at its zzso and zzso that are characteristic of signal zzso and zzso addition sites, zzso The most striking feature of the predicted zzso however, is a series of tandem repeats that spans most of its zzso The repeats themselves are characterized by periodic zzso zzso that fall into register when the zzso segments are zzso Interestingly, the spacing of zzso zzso within a framework of larger zzso motifs is entirely consistent with the structure of known zzso zzso Finally, comparison of the coding sequence of the zzso zzso gene with a partial zzso previously thought to zzso this protein reveals nearly complete identity except at their 3' ends, suggesting that alternative forms of the zzso zzso
