zzso belonging to the newly identified zzso zzso family have been shown to have zzso activity in inducing disease resistance responses in various zzso In this study, we characterized a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso a putative small protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed not only in different zzso growth stages but also during its infection process in rice zzso zzso transient expression of zzso in zzso resulted in hypersensitive response in the infiltrated local leaves and enhanced disease resistance against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso in upper leaves of plants, zzso by zzso expression of defense genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants expressing zzso under control of a zzso zzso promoter were zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic plants was induced by zzso application of zzso zzso plants showed normal growth with application of zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso plants showed enhanced disease resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso expression of some of defense zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso oxygen species was observed in zzso zzso These results collectively suggest that zzso expression of zzso in transgenic plants zzso zzso resistance against different types of zzso Our study also provides a novel strategy to generate zzso crops with enhanced zzso resistance through zzso expression of zzso disease zzso zzso
