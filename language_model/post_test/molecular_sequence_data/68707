Evidence has recently been mounting suggesting that a number of zzso components previously thought to primarily or exclusively have structural function, also have a regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence has been shown to be required for promoter zzso of certain genes in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso or in zzso (which has some sequence similarity to zzso are able to suppress zzso zzso and zzso zzso restoring zzso to HO as well as a number of other zzso In this paper we report the identification of a novel protein or protein complex that specifically binds a short sequence in the HO regulatory region on the one hand, and on the other somehow appears to contact the zzso zzso We have shown that the DNA binding activity itself does not contain zzso since extracts from zzso delta strains retain the zzso Interestingly, extracts made from cells carrying the dominant zzso point zzso lack the binding zzso Furthermore, zzso produced zzso protein can zzso a zzso complex while a similarly produced zzso protein has no effect on the complex at similar zzso When the DNA sequence to which the protein complex binds is placed in a zzso promoter lacking a zzso zzso zzso zzso it can serve as a weak zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Our data imply that a sequence specific DNA binding zzso may mediate between the zzso protein and the zzso zzso apparatus zzso zzso
