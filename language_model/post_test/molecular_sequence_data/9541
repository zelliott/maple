zzso research requires large samples for statistical zzso typically hundreds or thousands of individuals, which are most efficiently gathered by zzso zzso For the study of zzso zzso molecular zzso analysis enables detection of zzso zzso with minimal disruption of community zzso Field experiments have demonstrated that standard zzso methods, such as sweep zzso vacuum sampling and foliage zzso sometimes lead to contamination of predators with zzso DNA, thereby compromising zzso zzso zzso We deliberately contaminated immature zzso zzso and zzso zzso that had been fed larvae of zzso zzso by zzso applying zzso of the alternate prey zzso zzso We then attempted to remove zzso DNA by washing in ethanol or zzso A zzso wash with zzso rotation in zzso zzso did not reliably reduce external DNA zzso zzso treatment with zzso commercial zzso removed most zzso zzso DNA without affecting the zzso of the target prey DNA in the zzso Use of this zzso zzso perhaps with minor modifications tailored to different zzso systems, should reliably eliminate external DNA contamination, thereby alleviating concerns about this possible source of zzso for zzso zzso predators destined for molecular zzso zzso
