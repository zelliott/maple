zzso formation in the zzso plant zzso zzso is strictly dependent on an zzso light zzso zzso screening of an zzso zzso library prepared 10 days after flower induction against zzso from zzso zzso has identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which represent transcripts expressed zzso between day 10 and day 20 after induction and which disappear before flowers reach zzso The corresponding full-length zzso which were isolated, zzso and zzso display zzso overall sequence zzso These zzso zzso zzso with predicted molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso points of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso portions of the open reading frames have characteristics of signal zzso In zzso zzso reveals that both transcripts are localized exclusively in the zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso expression is observed in flower buds of approximately zzso zzso length zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrates the presence of zzso closely related genes in the zzso zzso as well as the occurrence of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
