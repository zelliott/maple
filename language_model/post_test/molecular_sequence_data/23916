zzso system formation requires the zzso of a complex series of differentiation events in both a zzso and zzso zzso A fundamental question is how zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression are controlled within maturing zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso acid type A zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and is part of an intrinsic program directing their zzso We have employed a zzso approach to examine the zzso mechanisms controlling zzso zzso expression of this zzso These studies demonstrated that nuclear factor I zzso proteins are required for both transgenic zzso promoter activity as well as zzso expression of this gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso proteins are bound to the zzso promoter in these cells in zzso Furthermore, analyses of gene knockout mice revealed that zzso is specifically required for normal expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and DNA binding activity are highly enriched in zzso zzso implicating this zzso factor family in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso These studies define a new role for zzso proteins as zzso zzso zzso regulators that participate in an intrinsic zzso program directing the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso
