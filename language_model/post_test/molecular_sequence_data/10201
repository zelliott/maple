zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso coli and exported to the zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso expression system, growth zzso and temperature on expression levels in LB medium were zzso A stretch of zzso rare in zzso coli, was identified and replaced with highly expressed zzso increasing the yield by at least zzso zzso was more efficiently expressed under the zzso promoter than under the zzso zzso zzso yields were obtained at 37 degrees C when growing the cells for 16 h after zzso The zzso expression system produced 38 zzso zzso per liter zzso In this system it was also possible to express zzso in minimal zzso at a yield of 10 zzso per zzso zzso sequencing and mass zzso showed that zzso was correctly zzso The expressed zzso was zzso to zzso as shown by an zzso ratio of zzso and together with zzso acid analysis and the determination of oxidized and total copper zzso both the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso
