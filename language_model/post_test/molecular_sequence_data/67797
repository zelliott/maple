zzso zzso are products of the zzso pathway, which also leads to the production of zzso and zzso Many zzso have zzso properties and may have beneficial effects for human zzso zzso are found in the seeds and fruits of many zzso In apple fruit zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is most active in the skin, with the zzso zzso and zzso acting as the initiating units for the synthesis of PA zzso This study examined the genes involved in the production of zzso in three apple zzso two heritage apple zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a commercial zzso Royal zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso fruit from zzso and zzso zzso had a higher zzso content than Royal zzso zzso and zzso zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time quantitative zzso analysis showed that the expression levels of Royal zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher than those of both zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that a zzso feedback mechanism may be active, zzso low zzso of zzso may induce higher expression of gene zzso Further investigation is required into the regulation of these key zzso in zzso
