The function of zzso B1 zzso and zzso B2 zzso during zzso zzso maturation was investigated by injecting zzso with their zzso zzso zzso At first, protein levels of both zzso zzso were examined by zzso revealing that immature zzso had only zzso at a level comparable to zzso to zzso of that detected in first zzso zzso Both zzso B zzso were started around zzso zzso breakdown zzso zzso and zzso peaked at the second zzso and first zzso zzso We obtained a zzso zzso zzso fragment, which was zzso zzso with human zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using total zzso of immature zzso zzso and a primer set of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were prepared in zzso Then one, the other, or both were injected into the zzso of immature zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis zzso the injected zzso underwent first zzso normally but could not arrest at the second zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis specifically, but had almost no effect on the maturation of injected zzso When both zzso and zzso zzso were injected, synthesis of both zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was significantly suppressed but occurred zzso These results suggest that zzso is the principal zzso for regulation in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso has only an accessory zzso They also show that in zzso zzso zzso B synthesis is not necessary for zzso induction itself, but synthesis of at least one zzso B, zzso or zzso is necessary for zzso induction in a normal time zzso
