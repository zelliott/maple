zzso zzso zzso zzso form symbiotic associations with the roots of most zzso plants, including many zzso important crop zzso The zzso colonize the zzso of the root to obtain carbon from their plant host, while assisting the plant with the zzso of zzso and other mineral nutrients from the zzso This association is beneficial to the plant, because zzso is essential for plant growth and development, especially during growth under zzso zzso zzso genetic studies of these zzso and their interaction with plants have been limited zzso to the zzso symbiotic nature of the VA zzso so the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and zzso of zzso from the soil to the plant remain zzso Here we begin to investigate this process by identifying a complementary DNA that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a VA zzso zzso The function of the protein zzso by zzso was confirmed by zzso of a zzso zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso was localized to the external zzso of zzso zzso during zzso associations, these being the initial site of zzso zzso from the zzso
