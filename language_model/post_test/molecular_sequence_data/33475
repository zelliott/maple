zzso zzso channels zzso are involved in a number of zzso processes in the cell that regulate muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, gene regulation, and zzso zzso They consist of a central zzso zzso zzso together with a number of associated auxiliary zzso including a zzso beta zzso With the aid of X-ray zzso it has been found that the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact strongly with the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso Here we discuss the potential interaction sites of zzso with its zzso zzso as well as the skeletal zzso zzso We suggest that not only can zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso loop, but more subtle interactions may be possible through the zzso loop via the zzso zzso zzso Such findings could have important implications with respect to zzso zzso
