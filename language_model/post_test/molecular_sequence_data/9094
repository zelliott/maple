Our ultimate goal is to detect the entire human zzso in health and in disease, in a single reaction tube, and employing only commercially available zzso To that end, we adapted molecular inversion zzso to detect bacteria using solely a zzso multiplex molecular zzso This molecular probe technology does not require growth of the bacteria in zzso Rather, the molecular probe technology requires only a sequence of zzso sequential bases unique to the zzso of the zzso of zzso In this communication, we report the first results of employing our molecular zzso to detect bacteria in clinical zzso 

While the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the zzso of the detection of the bacteria in each clinical sample, one zzso zzso zzso array must be used for each clinical zzso To multiplex the clinical samples, we introduce a second, independent zzso for the molecular zzso employing zzso by zzso zzso and zzso By adding one unique zzso zzso for each clinical sample, we combine the samples after processing, but before sequencing, and sequence them zzso 

Overall, we have employed 192 molecular zzso representing 40 bacteria to detect the bacteria in zzso zzso zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of those by the zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The correlations among the zzso were zzso
