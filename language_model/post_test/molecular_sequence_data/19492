zzso a zzso zzso with copies scattered over the zzso arms of zzso zzso is in the process of being lost from the zzso arms of most natural populations of the sister species zzso zzso In an attempt to clarify the dynamics and evolution of zzso we have studied the regulatory and reverse zzso regions in copies of the nine closely related species of the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is mainly vertically transmitted in these species, with the exception of a horizontal transfer event from an zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso We propose that, in four of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the observed patterns of evolution of the regulatory region vary with zzso constraints and with the history and zzso of the zzso
