zzso evidence confirms that certain cancer cells have the capacity to produce multiple peptides as growth factors and that expression of their zzso may act in zzso cell zzso and/or zzso loop mechanisms, either by zzso release of the growth factor or by the zzso zzso To study the possibility of an zzso growth mechanism in zzso zzso we investigated the ability of various zzso zzso cell lines to zzso in zzso zzso A rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso demonstrated exponential and zzso growth in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso medium from zzso cells induced zzso activity for zzso cells zzso zzso and further characterization of this activity was performed by zzso methods, zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso Finally, we have identified that a zzso zzso protein is found to be the main zzso factor in this zzso zzso In addition, specific zzso against zzso and the zzso inhibit the in zzso growth of this cell zzso Our data suggest that this zzso factor possibly acts as an zzso growth factor for cancer zzso
