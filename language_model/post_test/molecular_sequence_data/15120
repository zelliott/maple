zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor currently used in chronic zzso leukemia zzso may also affect the growth of other cellular systems besides zzso zzso Because it has been reported that IM may affect bone tissue zzso we evaluated the effects of IM on zzso differentiation of human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso After 21 days of culture, zzso treated with IM (1 zzso alone or zzso medium zzso + IM showed changes in zzso with evidence of zzso zzso and increased zzso expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso protein zzso We also observed that levels of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were increased in the zzso of the zzso culture with IM or zzso + IM compared to controls zzso In addition, we found that in 46 serum samples collected from zzso patients treated with IM for 3 to 24 months, the zzso ratio increased after 3 and 6 months zzso returning back to the zzso level after 24 months of IM zzso In these patients, zzso levels were low at diagnosis but they increased throughout the IM treatment, approaching normal levels at 24 months of IM zzso In zzso our data show that IM increases zzso expression of zzso markers in zzso and increases the zzso ratio and the zzso levels both in zzso of zzso cultured with IM and in serum of patients treated with zzso thus indicating that IM potentially favors zzso
