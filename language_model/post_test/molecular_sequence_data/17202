A new zzso zzso zzso technique based on broadband tailored noise zzso zzso zzso of zzso stored in a linear zzso trap has been zzso In comparison with the conventional sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso method commonly used in zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso this zzso technique increases zzso by eliminating the long zzso delay associated with gas introduction into the high vacuum zzso cell zzso In addition, the zzso method speeds spectrum acquisition since it does not require zzso zzso calculation of resonant zzso and generation of the zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso for the identification of zzso The experimental results are compared with data obtained using conventional zzso zzso trap zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso
