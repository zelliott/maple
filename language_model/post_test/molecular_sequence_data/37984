More than 20 near full-length zzso sequences have been reported for human zzso zzso zzso These have previously been classified into seven zzso and additional zzso which exhibit geographical zzso One of these zzso Type 4, has been suggested to be a zzso of zzso 1 and zzso We have investigated the pattern of diversity, and evolutionary zzso among these zzso In direct contradiction of a recent report, we found that different zzso methods gave consistent results for the zzso relationships among zzso The single known strain representing Type 5 was shown to be a mosaic of sequences from zzso 2 and 6, although whether this zzso occurred in zzso or in zzso is not zzso In contrast, there was no substantial evidence that Type 4 strains are zzso rather they seem to be simply divergent examples of Type zzso On the assumption that the major zzso of zzso zzso with human zzso the rate of synonymous zzso substitution was estimated to be around zzso per site per year, about 10 times higher than a previous estimate for zzso zzso
