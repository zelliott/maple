The reliability of the competitive zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for the detection and zzso of gene expression in small tumor samples was zzso DNA zzso gene expression was detected in human zzso cancer cell lines displaying a different degree of zzso zzso The level of DNA zzso zzso in the resistant cell line was zzso that of the parental sensitive zzso Our results indicate that competitive zzso is a zzso and sensitive method to detect differences in gene expression in small samples and open the possibility of using this approach to detect DNA zzso beta zzso in small samples from clinical zzso
