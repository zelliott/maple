There is now much evidence to suggest that the zzso zzso zzso protein functions to monitor the integrity of the zzso When DNA damage is zzso zzso suppresses cell growth to allow repair or directs the cell into zzso The mechanism of action of zzso is as yet unclear but recent evidence has accumulated to suggest that zzso might act by regulating gene zzso zzso with this model, zzso can both activate and repress a number of viral and cellular zzso zzso has also been shown to bind to the zzso Factor and zzso protein zzso and there is direct evidence that zzso zzso in zzso zzso by preventing zzso from binding zzso We now provide evidence that zzso can repress zzso from the zzso promoter by zzso zzso complexes involving zzso factor zzso
