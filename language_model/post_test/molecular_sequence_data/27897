We have previously reported the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor from zzso zzso of zzso rats by sequential gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This inhibitor is not detected in normal rat zzso but is induced in zzso zzso following zzso stimulation of zzso In this study the complete zzso acid sequence and the position of zzso bridges of the zzso protein were determined by automated zzso degradation of the protein and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and were as zzso zzso see zzso Computer analysis revealed the presence of zzso sequence identity between zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso from human zzso human zzso C, bovine zzso and chicken zzso all members of Family 2 zzso The inhibitor has little sequence similarity with rat liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso which belong to Family 1 zzso
