We attempted to screen a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins among several zzso strains by using a highly sensitive zzso system established by zzso Of six randomly tested zzso four were found to produce zzso zzso as their major zzso zzso suggesting that they might be distributed in a high frequency among this zzso Three zzso exhibited zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso terminal sequences of these isolated proteins with those of other reported zzso zzso revealed that the beta zzso and beta zzso in zzso were highly zzso
