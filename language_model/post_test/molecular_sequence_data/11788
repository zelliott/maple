We report the DNA sequence of a segment located on the right arm of zzso II from zzso zzso zzso near the zzso zzso The sequence was determined using a random cloning strategy followed by an zzso zzso The segment contains four zzso open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two overlapping ones zzso and zzso Three of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of the zzso locus previously zzso The three other zzso are zzso Another zzso locus zzso has been localized on zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso cannot be explained by zzso zzso
