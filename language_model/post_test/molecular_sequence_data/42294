The zzso gene of zzso coli zzso is involved in the activity of zzso zzso the zzso responsible for the conversion of zzso IX into zzso IX during zzso and zzso zzso The gene is located at zzso 87 on the genetic map of zzso coli zzso The zzso gene was isolated by a zzso in zzso cloning zzso As expected, the zzso gene is able to restore normal growth to the zzso zzso and the transformed cells display strong zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene allowed us to identify an open reading frame of 546 zzso zzso zzso zzso within the minimal zzso able to complement the zzso The presumed molecular mass of the zzso protein is zzso zzso in agreement with values found by zzso in a zzso coupled zzso zzso The identity of the first 18 zzso acids at the zzso end of the protein was confirmed by zzso To our knowledge, this is the first cloning of a gene involved in the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso
