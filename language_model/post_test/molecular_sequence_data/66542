The prion protein gene of African zzso zzso zzso was first cloned and zzso zzso The results suggest that the prion protein gene of eight African lions is highly zzso The zzso acid sequences of the prion protein zzso of all samples tested were zzso Four single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the prion protein gene zzso of African zzso were found, but no zzso acid zzso zzso analysis showed that the higher zzso is observed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and to sheep number zzso zzso zzso zzso With respect to all the zzso prion protein sequences zzso the African zzso prion protein sequence has three zzso acid zzso The zzso might in turn affect the potential zzso interactions critical for cross species transmission of prion zzso
