A zzso containing a single zzso bond was zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with a high mass resolution zzso tandem mass zzso equipped with a zzso laser zzso zzso This mass zzso which has spiral zzso zzso allowed both high mass resolution and high precursor zzso zzso It is difficult to obtain sufficient product zzso from peptides containing zzso bonds using zzso due to the single collision in the gas zzso To compensate for insufficient zzso the zzso bond was zzso via an zzso reduction process using zzso a reducing zzso After applying the reduction in the zzso subsequent sequencing using zzso provided the detailed structural information of the zzso containing the single zzso zzso
