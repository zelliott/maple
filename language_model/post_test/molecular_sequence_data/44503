zzso zzso protein of 94 zzso acids zzso has shown the potential to be a diagnostic zzso and a therapeutic agent for prostate zzso zzso have been the main animal models for studying the biology of this zzso We have cloned and analyzed the zzso and promoter region of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso divergence among zzso zzso zzso and human, in both the zzso and zzso region indicates rapid evolution of the zzso zzso There are zzso steroid hormone response elements zzso in the promoter region of all three zzso zzso zzso alternative transcripts starting near these zzso and upstream to the zzso box were identified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This differential zzso initiation may be linked to zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso zzso transcripts were detected by zzso in a wide variety of zzso zzso However, the alternative transcripts were found only in the zzso The distribution of the zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso was also examined by Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso against the human zzso A positive zzso band was zzso but it was weak, due probably to zzso divergence between the two zzso In all young, healthy zzso animals tested, the level of zzso zzso in prostate zzso was lower than zzso In addition, zzso combined with Southern zzso analysis on prostate zzso in these animals failed to detect the zzso zzso produced by alternative zzso of zzso primary zzso These observations can be explained by the sexual zzso and incomplete prostate development in these young zzso This explanation was supported by zzso examination of their prostate during zzso zzso
