We have isolated, by zzso and differential zzso from a library constructed from zzso zzso cells zzso a zzso coding for the rat zzso zzso heat stable zzso zzso a zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso and zzso is highly expressed in zzso located in the zzso area of the rat zzso which contains the most zzso zzso is also expressed in the outer zzso sheath of human hair zzso and in zzso zzso However, its expression is not restricted to zzso as demonstrated by cell sorting experiments, and it is thus not a specific marker of zzso zzso Rather, its preferential distribution in zzso located in the most zzso area of the rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso suggests that is function could be related to the tactile role of the hair zzso
