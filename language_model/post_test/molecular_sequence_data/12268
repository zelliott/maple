A zzso high-level expression cloning zzso designated as zzso was constructed by inserting a DNA zzso zzso the signal zzso of zzso protein into zzso 220 zzso Any foreign DNA zzso can be inserted into the zzso cloning sites located after the zzso signal zzso The cloned foreign gene is under the control of the zzso promoter while the expression of the gene is regulated by the zzso zzso The products are zzso into the zzso space of bacteria or into the zzso A zzso zzso zzso was constructed by inserting the 210 zzso from zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso zzso into the zzso site of zzso The zzso coli cells transformed with zzso were zzso at 30 degrees C, then incubated at 42 degrees C for several zzso The cloned gene product was zzso into the culture medium at a high zzso The yield was about 60 zzso of gene product per liter of cultured zzso
