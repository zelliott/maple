In primary cultured mouse zzso cells, protein zzso C zzso zzso consists of multiple zzso a low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 79 and 85 zzso and a high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 79 and 85 zzso by zzso column zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso responses during terminal differentiation of zzso cells, which were induced by the increase of zzso in culture zzso were zzso After 24 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the particulate fraction was apparently shifted to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of this zzso zzso was increased in association with the zzso These results suggest the pivotal role of zzso zzso in the particulate fraction in the zzso zzso cell differentiation zzso
