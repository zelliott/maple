zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been done by error prone zzso zzso with modified zzso activity were isolated, the zzso zzso proteins zzso and the zzso activities of each one determined and compared with the wild type zzso Two of the isolated single point zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso increase in specific activity towards zzso compared to wild type zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in specific activity of zzso with respect to the wild type zzso These zzso are mainly located in the beta zzso of the zzso the region showing the main structural zzso within family 10 of zzso This study shows the usefulness of random zzso to point out some key zzso not directly involved in the active center, but in which zzso produces subtle structural zzso affecting the zzso zzso
