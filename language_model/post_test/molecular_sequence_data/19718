zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is an essential zzso cell specific zzso zinc finger zzso factor that binds zzso box elements in promoters and distant regulatory elements to activate zzso zzso expression of zzso arrests cell zzso The zzso dependent zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was identified as a potential novel zzso target gene from an expression profiling zzso The zzso protein functions as an inhibitor of zzso and zzso activity during early zzso phase of the cell cycle, thus acting as a zzso brake on cell zzso We confirmed zzso is zzso in zzso zzso mice by real-time zzso and Western zzso and identified three closely associated and highly zzso zzso binding sites zzso approximately 1 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso We showed that zzso binds to one of these elements by gel shift zzso and demonstrated this site is capable of driving zzso dependent zzso We also determined by zzso zzso zzso that this region of the zzso promoter is bound by zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a direct regulator of zzso gene zzso and much of zzso role in driving zzso cell differentiation may occur via zzso
