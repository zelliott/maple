Four zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso library derived from zzso of zzso acid zzso rice zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that the four zzso were derived from different alpha Amy zzso zzso of the individual alpha Amy gene in zzso seeds and cultured suspension cells of rice was studied using zzso zzso In zzso seeds, expression of the alpha Amy genes is positively regulated by zzso in a temporally coordinated but zzso distinct zzso In cultured suspension cells, in contrast, expression of the alpha Amy genes is zzso and zzso regulated by zzso present in the zzso In addition, one strong and one weak zzso alpha Amy genes have been zzso zzso between the promoter region zzso of a rice alpha Amy gene and zzso DNA binding proteins in rice zzso cells were also zzso A DNA zzso zzso showed that the zzso proteins interact with two specific DNA fragments within zzso One zzso is located between zzso zzso to zzso and contains two imperfect directly repeated zzso elements and a putative zzso zzso The other zzso is located between zzso zzso to zzso that contains a putative zzso zzso The interactions between zzso proteins and these two fragments are zzso and zzso
