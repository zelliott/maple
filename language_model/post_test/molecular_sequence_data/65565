zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso dominant disease characterized by progressive zzso zzso resulting from abnormal deposition of cholesterol and zzso Recently, six different zzso on the zzso gene on zzso zzso were found to result in zzso The purpose of this article is to further characterize the zzso spectrum of zzso and identify structural and functional consequences for zzso protein zzso DNA sequencing was performed on samples from 36 individuals from 14 zzso zzso One affected individual was African American and zzso has not been previously reported in this ethnic zzso We identified zzso zzso in all 14 families which had 30 affected and 6 unaffected zzso Eight different zzso zzso 5 novel zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 1, zzso and zzso in zzso 2) were zzso In four families with DNA samples from both affected and unaffected individuals, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso In combination with our previous report, we have identified the genetic zzso in zzso in 20 unrelated families with 10 (including 5 reported zzso having the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may be a zzso hot spot because the affected families were unrelated including Caucasian and Asian zzso There was no zzso zzso correlation except for the zzso zzso which demonstrated prominent diffuse zzso zzso typically without zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed structural and functional implications of zzso zzso which may affect zzso function, zzso binding and interaction with binding partners, like zzso zzso
