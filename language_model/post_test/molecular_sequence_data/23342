zzso are potent zzso and toxic substances that are produced primarily by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that a zzso remarkably inhibited production of zzso acid, a precursor of zzso by zzso zzso This zzso was identified as zzso zzso based on its zzso zzso DNA sequence and was designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains commonly showed similar zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into the medium and was stable after heat, acid, or alkaline zzso Although the zzso appeared to produce several zzso zzso we finally succeeded in zzso a major zzso substance from the culture medium using zzso zzso column zzso zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso substance was identified as zzso based on zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration for zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso as determined by the tip culture zzso High zzso (more than zzso zzso zzso of zzso further inhibited zzso zzso Similar zzso activities were observed with zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso showed weaker zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is the first report of a zzso that affects zzso zzso
