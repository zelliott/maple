We have developed an efficient method for zzso zzso using two zzso rounds of zzso In this method, zzso conditions are zzso to favor high zzso of zzso DNA zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the reaction mixture zzso zzso This method makes use of a pair of universal zzso and the multiple cloning site of zzso zzso Only one zzso primer is required per target zzso In the second round of zzso the 3' extension of the zzso DNA strand is blocked by the presence of a segment of zzso sequence at its 3' end, and as a consequence, the zzso full-length DNA zzso is chiefly from the zzso zzso Furthermore, because the zzso DNA zzso has zzso restriction sites different from those of the zzso DNA fragment, the zzso DNA zzso is totally excluded in the step involving selective cloning of the zzso DNA zzso This method was successfully used to introduce four, nonadjacent zzso in the zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso All 20 analyzed clones from these four cases of zzso carried the desired zzso and no zzso zzso were zzso We observed that the larger the number of mismatched zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the higher the concentration of zzso was necessary for successful zzso zzso Our experimental results indicate that this method offers improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and zzso
