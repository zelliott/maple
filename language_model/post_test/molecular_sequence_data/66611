zzso zzso applied zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso to zzso enhances the maximum current zzso and greatly zzso the zzso zzso In this zzso we focused on identification of zzso zzso responsible for zzso effects on channel gating using the zzso rat zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and two zzso zzso zzso with zzso receptors revealed that the zzso but not the zzso zzso sequence is important for the effects of zzso on channel zzso zzso zzso placed in the zzso and zzso regions showed the importance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso regulation of the rate of channel zzso but not on the maximum current zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso and the nearby zzso region contribute to the effects of zzso on channel zzso
