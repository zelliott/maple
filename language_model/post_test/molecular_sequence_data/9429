zzso is a zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso and neurological zzso To identify the molecular basis of zzso we performed zzso sequencing on five genetically independent zzso Three different zzso zzso in zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso in three of the zzso Two of the zzso were demonstrated to have occurred de zzso providing strong genetic evidence of zzso Two additional cases were zzso for de zzso zzso zzso in zzso which encodes the zzso regulatory zzso of protein zzso A and which has been recently reported to be the cause of a form of zzso resistant to multiple zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is genetically zzso and underscore the exquisite sensitivity of many zzso to zzso in zzso zzso
