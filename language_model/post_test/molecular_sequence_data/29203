zzso of the highly zzso zzso protein 1 zzso family have been found to function in the dynamic organization of nuclear architecture and in gene regulation throughout the zzso zzso In addition to being key players in zzso gene zzso zzso proteins may also contribute to the zzso repression of zzso genes via the recruitment to specific zzso To investigate the role played by these different activities in specific zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and used zzso interference to study their zzso We show that one of the zzso zzso is required for the formation of a functional zzso and for the development of the zzso by acting in an zzso zzso We suggest that, by acting as zzso of gene zzso zzso proteins may zzso specific functions in both zzso and zzso differentiation processes throughout zzso
