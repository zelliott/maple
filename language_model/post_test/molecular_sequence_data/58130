zzso of T helper cell 1 zzso and zzso results in zzso of the zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas many of the regulatory elements and factors responsible for zzso zzso in T cells are well zzso little is known about parallel mechanisms that drive zzso of the zzso zzso Here we have analyzed the zzso zzso promoter, both in zzso and in a zzso zzso 3 zzso of zzso upstream sequence is shown to be sufficient to achieve zzso and zzso expression of a zzso zzso reporter gene in zzso in a manner that mirrors the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression is also demonstrated in a zzso zzso but not in a B cell zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso promoter demonstrated that sequences from zzso to zzso were necessary for a zzso response to zzso A or zzso zzso zzso An zzso yet smaller region, spanning the sequences from zzso to zzso zzso was shown to be required for the response to zzso zzso of an zzso region from zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter completely zzso zzso gene zzso in response to all stimuli zzso In addition, our results show that the effects of the zzso agent zzso A map to the same DNA sequences as the positive control zzso These results identify DNA sequences that are functionally important for the control of zzso gene zzso both in zzso and in zzso Although these sequences are highly zzso in the human and zzso zzso zzso they are largely not present in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso elements may be one mechanism by which these two zzso genes are zzso zzso
