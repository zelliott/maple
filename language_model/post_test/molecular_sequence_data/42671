Two types of zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso 2) zzso the alpha zzso of zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso were cloned by the reverse zzso chain reaction for zzso zzso The zzso sequences showed that the zzso alpha 1 zzso was 380 zzso long, zzso 119 zzso zzso and that zzso alpha 2 zzso was 365 zzso long, zzso 114 zzso zzso The zzso salmon alpha zzso types had a few differences between the zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso The structural difference between the alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso was predicted using zzso zzso The evolutionary zzso between zzso and zzso salmon was estimated to be zzso and zzso million years by comparing their zzso alpha 1 and zzso 2 zzso zzso These time values are roughly consistent with the evolutionary time zzso zzso million zzso estimated from fossil records and an zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso were constructed and used for zzso Southern zzso zzso The restriction zzso sizes of the zzso alpha 1 and zzso 2 genes were similar, and when their patterns were compared with those from four other zzso each species showed a different pattern from the others, but no difference between their respective alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso the structural features of the zzso alpha 1 and zzso 2 genes may have zzso in a similar manner in these five zzso
