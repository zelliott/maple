The finding that two zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the major zzso complex zzso has linked the zzso which represents a major zzso zzso system to the processing of zzso zzso Here we describe a second form of the human zzso zzso zzso which has been identified during the characterization of novel genes in the zzso The analysis of the zzso organization of zzso revealed that zzso and zzso arise by alternative zzso zzso Using specific zzso against zzso and zzso we show that they are zzso with class I zzso molecules as well as a putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso and zzso undergo zzso processing when incorporated into zzso and the zzso precursor is derived mainly from zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that zzso and zzso are mutually dependent for their incorporation into the zzso zzso
