We have detected a common zzso frequency zzso single base pair zzso zzso 675 base pairs upstream from the start of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the chemical zzso mismatch zzso zzso shift zzso suggest that the zzso with the single base pair zzso contains an additional protein binding site which is not present in the del zzso Competition experiments confirmed that the binding was specific to the sequence of the zzso zzso and suggest that proteins bound to this site may be zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso containing the zzso promoter zzso to zzso showed that the deletion zzso produced six times more zzso than the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso In a sample of 107 young patients with previous zzso zzso and 95 healthy zzso subjects, the del zzso was associated with increased zzso levels, zzso higher than the sample mean in the del zzso zzso zzso zzso This study also suggested that individuals zzso for the del zzso may have an altered response to the acute phase zzso Taken together these results suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso promoter is of functional importance in regulating the expression of the zzso zzso
