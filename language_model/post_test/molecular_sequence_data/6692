We have previously identified a locus on rat zzso 10 as carrying a major hypertension zzso zzso The zzso odds support zzso for this gene extended over a zzso zzso region of the zzso that included the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus as demonstrated in a cross between the zzso spontaneously zzso rat zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the further characterization of zzso using a zzso strain, zzso zzso animals carry a zzso zzso zzso zzso identical with zzso on zzso 10, 26 zzso away from the zzso zzso Higher blood pressures in the zzso strain compared with the zzso strain, as well as absence of linkage of the zzso 10 region to blood pressure in an zzso zzso zzso zzso population suggested the existence of a quantitative trait zzso termed zzso that lies within the zzso region in zzso zzso analysis in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cross revealed that zzso is linked to zzso blood pressure, whereas a second locus on zzso 10, termed zzso that maps closer to the zzso locus zzso predominantly with blood pressure after exposure to excess dietary zzso Thus, we zzso that the previously reported effect of zzso represents a composite zzso that can be dissected into at least two specific components on the basis of linkage data and zzso zzso One of the zzso identified, zzso represents the most precisely mapped locus affecting blood pressure that has so far been characterized by zzso zzso zzso
