A zzso zzso zzso or zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from sludge of domestic wastewater in Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the cluster zzso zzso species, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with which it shared zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso properties of strain zzso were consistent with those of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso type was based on zzso acid, the zzso zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited levels of zzso zzso of zzso % to the type strains of zzso related zzso species and could be differentiated from these species based on differences in zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
