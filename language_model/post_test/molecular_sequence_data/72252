We show that in animal zzso zzso genes that differ in zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso content code for proteins differing in zzso acid content in a manner that relates to the G + C content of the zzso DNA sequences were analyzed using square zzso a new method that combines zzso zzso and statistical analysis of compositional differences in both DNA and zzso Square plots divide zzso into four groups based on first and second position A + T zzso plus zzso and G + C content and indicate differences in zzso acid content when comparing sequences that differ in G + C zzso When sequences are compared using these zzso the zzso acid content is shown to correlate with the zzso bias of the zzso This zzso acid effect is shown in all zzso genes in the zzso zzso including zzso I, zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso genes which are commonly used for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso content differences are shown to affect the content of all zzso acids with A + zzso and G + zzso zzso We speculate that zzso analysis of genes so affected may tend erroneously to indicate zzso (or lack zzso based only on zzso acid zzso
