zzso binding 1 zzso is a zzso protein with a putative role in zzso zzso Single zzso have been found in zzso zzso and zzso In birds the situation is different as they possess two zzso One is known to be zzso we show the second, closely related gene is linked to the Z sex zzso The basic structure of the zzso gene is similar to the zzso zzso however, it does possess an zzso internal 88 zzso acid zzso domain, rich in zzso acid and zzso Studies on pairs of genes zzso in zzso suggests rapid divergence of DNA sequence and zzso We suggest the DNA sequences of zzso and zzso do not follow this zzso
