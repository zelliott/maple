In this study, we describe the development of a fast and accurate molecular identification system for zzso liver fluke species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso analysis of the zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso Based on sequence variation in the target zzso region, we selected three zzso restriction zzso within the zzso regions, generating different restriction profiles among the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso Each restriction zzso generated zzso fragments specific to the species zzso but no zzso zzso or zzso between the species was detected in their restriction zzso These results indicate that zzso restriction analysis of the zzso region allows for the rapid and reliable molecular identification among these zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso sequences using different methods zzso zzso NJ, and zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a sister group, but this relationship was not strongly zzso The failure of recovering a robust zzso may be due to the relatively small number of zzso characters shared among the species, yielding weak zzso zzso zzso rapid zzso within a very short period time could be another explanation for the relatively poorly resolved relationships among these zzso Our data are insufficient for discriminating between sudden zzso and other potential causes of poor zzso Further information from independent zzso might help resolve this zzso
