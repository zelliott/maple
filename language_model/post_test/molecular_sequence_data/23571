Genes that zzso for divergent zzso traits may have zzso that contrast with those from zzso that are not functionally involved in zzso Here, we examine DNA sequence variation among the species of the eastern Caribbean zzso zzso zzso at two zzso yellow and zzso zzso zzso which both play integral roles in pigmentation patterning of adult zzso zzso analyses of these zzso produce gene zzso with zzso that mirror those described for other nuclear zzso the six zzso distinct species within the zzso are divided into only three zzso with one lineage containing four species that share extensive ancestral zzso At the zzso locus these major lineages are delineated only by silent site zzso We observe a significantly higher rate of synonymous site divergence than zzso zzso consistent with strong zzso selection acting on the zzso In contrast, the yellow locus exhibits patterns of zzso acid divergence and zzso diversity that are consistent with recent diversifying selection acting in two different zzso This selection appears to be targeting zzso acid zzso in the signal sequence of the Yellow zzso a region which is tightly constrained among members of the larger zzso zzso zzso This result highlights not only the potential importance of yellow in the evolution of divergent pigmentation patterns among members of the zzso zzso zzso but also hints that variation in signal zzso sequences may play a role in zzso zzso
