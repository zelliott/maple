zzso profiles of leaf zzso of Rosa zzso zzso zzso Beauty collected from in zzso greenhouse plants, in zzso zzso shoots at different passages, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso from zzso callus zzso zzso zzso and zzso callus were investigated using an amplified zzso zzso zzso detection zzso Three types of zzso bands were zzso Type I bands were observed with both zzso zzso and zzso while type II and type III bands were observed only with zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the three types of zzso bands revealed that a zzso zzso site zzso resulted in a type I band, while an inner zzso generated most type II and type III zzso About zzso of inner and zzso of outer zzso in zzso sequences were fully zzso and only a few zzso outer zzso were zzso Changes in types of zzso bands among different zzso were frequently observed, including appearance and disappearance of type I, II, and III zzso bands, as well as exchanges between either type I and type II or type I and type III zzso zzso zzso zzso of outer zzso in zzso sequences triggered appearance and disappearance of type I and II zzso zzso zzso changes of both outer and inner zzso resulted in either removal or generation of type III zzso zzso zzso zzso of an inner zzso was responsible for exchange between type I and type II, while zzso of an outer zzso accounted for exchange between type I and type III zzso zzso During UC zzso a significant zzso zzso was detected in both inner and outer zzso Variations in zzso profiles significantly differed between zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of outer zzso occurred at a high frequency during zzso zzso and most altered zzso bands in zzso callus were passed on to its zzso However, most zzso zzso bands during zzso were recovered in shoot zzso derived via zzso zzso Seven zzso bands were isolated, zzso and zzso zzso search revealed that two of these might be derived from functional zzso
