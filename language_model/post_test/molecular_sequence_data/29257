We have isolated three major zzso fragments of protein zzso zzso from human brain and liver by zzso The 536 zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso while two other fragments were alternative zzso products of the zzso zzso which was confirmed by partial zzso DNA zzso The 380 zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso named zzso and the deletion occurred from zzso 84 to zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso termed zzso was derived from an internal deletion of 536 zzso zzso This deletion resulted in an out of frame shift, allowing the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the partial sequence of zzso Based on the reported zzso sequence of zzso and evidence from our zzso we suggested that zzso consisted of 132 zzso acids of which the zzso 61 zzso acid sequences were identical to zzso while the sequence after zzso was markedly zzso
