The pathogen zzso zzso zzso the expression of many genes in order to transition from its environmental zzso to its niche in the human zzso Among these are genes zzso two related Type IV zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which aids zzso zzso persistence in aquatic environments but causes clearance of bacteria by host immune zzso and the toxin zzso zzso zzso required for zzso These zzso effects are resolved zzso by the regulator zzso which zzso zzso genes while zzso zzso genes during zzso We show that these two zzso systems are also intertwined zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the major zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In a zzso zzso coli system, zzso can recognize both zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso but that processing by zzso causes the degradation of zzso Through zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis, we show that this process targets a combination of zzso zzso motifs and depends on the zzso activity of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso partially restored the ability of bacteria unable to zzso zzso zzso genes to colonize infant zzso These findings describe zzso zzso as a regulatory mechanism in zzso zzso and illustrate this zzso zzso in the face of dramatic environmental zzso
