zzso contribute significantly to the evolution of zzso zzso They replicate by producing DNA copies of their own zzso which are integrated at new locations in the host cell zzso In the zzso zzso of the social zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso avoids zzso zzso by targeting the zzso factor zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso 50 zzso upstream of zzso zzso We generated synthetic zzso zzso zzso that were zzso with a selection marker that zzso resistance to zzso after a complete zzso zzso We found that the zzso elements were efficiently mobilized in trans by proteins expressed from the zzso zzso population found in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein translated from zzso elements significantly enhanced zzso We observed that the zzso untranslated region of zzso could be replaced by an unrelated promoter, whereas the 3' untranslated region of zzso was essential for zzso A predicted secondary structure in the zzso of the 3' untranslated region of zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso The zzso elements were capable of identifying authentic integration targets in zzso including formerly zzso putative binding sites for zzso on the zzso DNA element that carries the zzso zzso zzso
