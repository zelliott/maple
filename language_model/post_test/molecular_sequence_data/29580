Conventional zzso are cortical zzso proteins that form an zzso zzso underlying the plasma zzso We report here the unusual structure of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is required for proper zzso guidance in zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso repeat and zzso zzso found in other zzso but differs from all others in that the zzso zzso region contains six blocks of zzso zzso rich zzso repeats separated by seven zzso zzso The zzso repeat blocks are composed primarily of sequences related to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso contain sequences related to zzso which includes a potential zzso domain (in zzso zzso protein fragments of zzso zzso were used to prepare zzso zzso against the zzso domain zzso zzso the conventional zzso regulatory domain zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso + zzso domain zzso zzso and against two zzso terminal domain fragments zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with these zzso zzso demonstrated multiple protein zzso By zzso zzso the zzso and regulatory domain zzso and zzso zzso recognized many cell types, including zzso and stained the junctions between zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso restricted pattern, zzso nerve processes and the periphery of neural cell zzso These results are consistent with a role for zzso zzso in neural zzso
