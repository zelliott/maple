The mechanisms involved in the zzso action of zzso in the zzso of zzso still remain poorly zzso Among the major zzso present in oxidized zzso zzso we show here that zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and/or zzso events in human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso This specific effect of zzso is zzso by a robust zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was highlighted by zzso zzso expression with a specific small interfering zzso which significantly reduced the zzso production of zzso and abolished zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso included an early triggering of zzso zzso stress, as assessed by transient zzso zzso zzso and the induction of the expression of the cell death zzso zzso and of zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso all hallmarks of the unfolded protein response zzso We also showed that zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and subsequently prevented the zzso cell death induced by zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso death, which is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso
