Two cortical rod proteins having molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from the mature zzso of zzso zzso using gel zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso acid zzso zzso corresponded to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso showed that 21 zzso acids out of 29 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and 14 out of 29 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were identical to that of the zzso cortical rod proteins of zzso zzso Positive zzso reaction to zzso raised against the zzso zzso protein was observed on cortical rods forming around the periphery of zzso at the maturation zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules stained with the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were both zzso as evidenced by positive zzso zzso using zzso A and production of positive zzso zzso These results indicate that the cortical rods are comprised of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We subsequently cloned two full-length zzso based on the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 276 zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso revealed that the location of the processing site and sequence of signal peptides zzso indicating that the two zzso are products of two separate genes and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both proteins possessed one potential zzso zzso zzso It is considered that both molecules are components of the cortical zzso forming a jelly layer after zzso
