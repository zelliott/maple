We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso coding for a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso during zzso zzso In the present study, we describe the disruption of zzso gene zzso called zzso to gain insight into its potential role during zzso The ability of disrupted zzso zzso to filament was affected by several solid zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso gene may be involved not only in conditions of cell zzso but also during the process of zzso In agreement with the putative zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso we observed a strong zzso repression of zzso gene and, on the contrary, high level of zzso by carbon sources that induce the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed the existence of two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are also induced during zzso zzso
