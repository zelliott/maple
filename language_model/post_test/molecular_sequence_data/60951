zzso protein zzso forms complexes with various nuclear proteins and plays roles in all zzso zzso We previously identified zzso protein 120 zzso from rat zzso zzso stimulates in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso exist in various higher zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we isolated zzso of a novel rat zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso acids and was zzso identical to the original zzso zzso zzso However, zzso gene was expressed specifically in the muscle zzso which was contrary to the ubiquitous expression of zzso Moreover, zzso protein was observed exclusively in the muscle zzso zzso is therefore suggested to be a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of the mouse zzso revealed that the expression of zzso was temporarily increased during the zzso whereas zzso maintained a constant expression zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso specifically associated with zzso in the nuclear zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso family protein and can also interact with zzso zzso is supposed to have a specific role in muscle zzso which may be zzso from that of zzso
