A zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso insect zzso The zzso contains an zzso zzso a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence suggests 12 zzso zzso a structure similar to that of all other cloned zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows high identity with a zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso exhibited a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Several zzso of zzso zzso were used to determine the pharmacological profile of zzso Although most similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in its kinetic properties, zzso of zzso dependence and pharmacological properties, zzso may be distinguished from zzso zzso by the inability of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid and its zzso to inhibit zzso zzso by the insect zzso The unique pharmacology of zzso suggests that the zzso transport system in the zzso zzso could be a useful target in the future development of zzso zzso agents used to control zzso zzso
