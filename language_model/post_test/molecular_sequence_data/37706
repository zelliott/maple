zzso family zzso proteins are best characterized as regulators of membrane traffic, but recent studies indicate an additional role in zzso zzso An zzso zzso protein of the zzso beta family, zzso (also known as zzso zzso binds zzso and two other known regulators of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we show that zzso zzso to focal zzso and cycles with focal zzso proteins when cells are zzso to zzso zzso of zzso altered the zzso of focal zzso and blocked both cell spreading and formation of zzso zzso induced by zzso growth factor zzso On the other hand, zzso with a zzso that disrupted zzso protein activity, had a reduced effect on cell spreading and increased the number of cells forming zzso zzso in response to zzso These data support a role for an zzso zzso zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso and raise the possibility that the zzso zzso is a target for zzso zzso
