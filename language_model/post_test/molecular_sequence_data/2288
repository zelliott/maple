Cloning and sequencing of the zzso gene of a zzso cell anemia patient zzso for the zzso zzso has revealed a gene conversion that involves the replacement of an A gamma sequence by a G gamma sequence in the promoter area of the A gamma zzso This event is similar to another gene conversion believed to be responsible for the very high zzso between zzso zzso suggesting that the promoter area of these genes is prone to this type of genetic zzso Further analysis demonstrated that the zzso bearing this gene conversion has a very high frequency among zzso zzso and a very low or zzso frequency in other zzso linked to the beta s zzso No correlation was found between the G zzso gamma ratio and the presence of the gene conversion among zzso zzso patients, thus excluding a portion of the gamma gene sequence in the determination of this zzso
