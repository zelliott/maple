Human zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of a number of cellular proteins involved in signal zzso zzso to structural and zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as to several transforming zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso from an zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso has no associated zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso kinetic zzso we examined the effect of zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on initial zzso zzso plots excluded a double displacement zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso was a zzso inhibitor against zzso and a zzso inhibitor against zzso zzso Together these results are consistent with a sequential ordered mechanism where, in a typical zzso cycle, zzso binds to zzso before zzso followed by release of the zzso and then zzso zzso This kinetic mechanism is identical to that described for zzso zzso zzso zzso and emphasizes the impact that regulation of zzso pool size and accessibility may have in modulating protein zzso in these two zzso Comparative studies of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso using a panel of 12 zzso revealed distinct differences in their tolerance for zzso acid zzso at positions 3, 4, 7, and 8 of parental peptides derived from the zzso sequences of known zzso This finding contrasts with our recent observation that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are highly zzso and suggests that these differences in zzso recognition provide an opportunity to develop zzso zzso zzso
