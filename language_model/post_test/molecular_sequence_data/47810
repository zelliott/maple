A zzso approach towards improving the zzso of, and vaccination zzso tuberculosis faces the problems of zzso restriction of T cell recognition and the poor zzso of peptides in the absence of zzso We sought to compensate this by the use of synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso type, containing a zzso acid zzso zzso and further modified either by zzso zzso or zzso zzso These carriers were zzso to two zzso recognized peptides of zzso zzso The zzso - zzso zzso enhanced zzso production more than zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells from healthy subjects, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells from tuberculosis zzso The effect was dependent on the carrier used and on zzso linkage of zzso to zzso - zzso An increased response occurred best in cells from subjects bearing at least one zzso zzso for which zzso - zzso had high binding affinity and required cellular processing of the zzso as zzso zzso and zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso - 110 did not significantly increase zzso production, indicating that the ability of zzso to enhance the response was zzso structure zzso These data indicate that the use of zzso zzso coupled with zzso recognized peptides could contribute to the development of an improved zzso or vaccine zzso for zzso
