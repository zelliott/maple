The presence of zzso zzso virus C zzso also known as zzso G virus zzso and zzso C virus zzso were investigated in zzso from 45 zzso from nine locations in zzso using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso used to detect zzso and zzso derived from the zzso region and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were positive for zzso zzso in serum by zzso Twelve zzso patients were positive for zzso zzso by zzso Six zzso of these were zzso with zzso zzso was detected in all the 12 zzso zzso positive zzso and in another 14 zzso individuals, in whom zzso zzso was found in zzso Ten patients zzso lacked markers for both zzso and zzso The mean age of the patients positive for zzso but negative for zzso by zzso was significantly lower than for those negative for zzso but positive for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the risk for this group of zzso to acquire zzso infection is higher as compared to the risk of acquiring zzso zzso Eleven zzso strains were zzso in the zzso zzso comparison to previously published zzso strains revealed that all 11 strains were more similar to Asian strains than to strains of European and African zzso zzso in the zzso region were available for 8 zzso zzso all of which were found to belong to zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso zzso strains to strains from Asia indicates that the zzso strains in the region presumably have an zzso zzso It is also considered that the zzso II strains in the New World zzso populations are ancient and brought there by the ancestral zzso populations from zzso Further, the zzso F of zzso B virus, known to represent the strains in populations with zzso background, zzso in Central American populations with Hispanic zzso It remains to be clarified why zzso strains of zzso as well as of zzso predominate also in populations with mixed ethnic background in Central zzso
