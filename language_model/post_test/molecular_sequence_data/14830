zzso receptors zzso one of the most important pattern recognition receptors zzso play a crucial role in innate immune responses in both zzso and zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso a Toll gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis predicted that zzso contained one open reading frame of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso domain protein of zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso could be clustered into one branch along with other zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso transcripts could be detected by zzso from all zzso examined including the heart, zzso zzso stomach, zzso muscle, zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso after zzso The profile of single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso repeats zzso domain of zzso in three healthy zzso was then zzso Two hundred and zzso zzso with a frequency of about zzso were identified in zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso to zzso transition at position zzso zzso had a frequency of about zzso Finally, the results showed that challenge with zzso zzso zzso the appearance of two sets of zzso in zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso could contribute to a low mortality after zzso zzso infection and introduce variation of charge and secondary structure into the zzso zzso In zzso these studies suggested a novel Toll zzso in crab and identified a zzso with potential zzso zzso The result will be important for the investigation of crab immune defense zzso
