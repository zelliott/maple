The complement system represents an evolutionary old and significant part of the innate immune system involved in protection against invading zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are zzso demonstrating a previously unknown direct zzso effect of complement zzso The zzso zzso as well as functional zzso in the zzso efficiently killed the zzso bacteria zzso coli, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In mice, a zzso zzso suppressed infection by zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence and electron zzso demonstrated that zzso binds to and zzso breaks in bacterial zzso zzso was also found to induce membrane leakage of zzso These findings provide an interesting link between the complement system and zzso zzso which are two important branches of innate zzso
