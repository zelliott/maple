This is a report of in zzso zzso zzso and we successfully identified a novel zzso to target the multiple zzso tumors of gastric zzso A zzso display library was injected directly into the abdominal cavity of mice bearing zzso tumors of human gastric cancer, and zzso associated with the tumors were subsequently reclaimed from isolated zzso The zzso zzso were amplified and the zzso cycle was repeated five times to enrich for high affinity zzso binding zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso which showed zzso with zzso 5 (a zzso for zzso zzso was identified as a binding zzso for zzso tumors of gastric zzso zzso clones displaying the sequence zzso showed zzso higher binding to zzso tumors than control zzso and were zzso distributed in tumors rather than in normal zzso after zzso injection into zzso In addition, the zzso zzso were more likely to bind to cancer cells in zzso zzso derived from a patient with zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso containing the motif zzso zzso also showed a strong binding activity to zzso tumors without cancer growth zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso appeared significantly more often in tumors than control zzso after zzso injection into zzso Furthermore, modification of zzso with zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso on gastric cancer zzso The zzso motif zzso seems a potential targeting zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso of gastric zzso
