We have used the zzso chain reaction technique to clone the small multiply spliced zzso species produced after infection of human cells by a molecular clone of human zzso virus type 1 zzso We identified six zzso zzso which were generated by the use of two zzso zzso located immediately upstream of the rev zzso The class of small zzso included 12 zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso produced other multiply spliced zzso that used alternative zzso sites identified by cloning and zzso All of these zzso were found in the zzso and should be able to produce additional zzso The coding capacity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso of the cloned zzso into human zzso The zzso zzso produced high levels of zzso but very low levels of Rev and zzso All the rev zzso expressed high levels of both Rev and zzso and were essential for the production of sufficient amounts of zzso zzso zzso uses both alternatively spliced and zzso zzso for the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
