A comparison of zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows that the spatial organization of their zzso tunnels agrees with that determined by X-ray for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed trend in the zzso of product length distribution shifted from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso and to zzso in zzso This suggests a significant increase in the size of the zzso zzso tunnel from approximately 1000 zzso of zzso coli zzso to approximately zzso zzso required to accommodate zzso in zzso and to zzso zzso for zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso products reaching zzso indicate the failure of a strict zzso chain length zzso On the basis of zzso coli zzso zzso structure the zzso zzso model was zzso In the model three zzso acid zzso inserted into the sequence corresponding to the zzso region of the tunnel extends the bottom loop what results in the required increase of the tunnel zzso Moreover, zzso fluctuations of this loop occasionally create a hole in the tunnel floor, making escape of zzso omega end out of the tunnel possible what switches off the control mechanism of product length thereby allowing a practically unlimited zzso process leading to an exponential distribution of longer chain zzso
