The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that is zzso expressed in a zzso manner in various zzso zzso When zzso protein is expressed in zzso zzso the zzso AA transport properties are similar to the zzso defined transport system zzso The zzso protein sequence is closely related to another zzso AA zzso zzso these related proteins elicit virtually identical zzso AA transport in zzso zzso The two genes differ in their tissue expression and induction zzso Here we report the presence of diverse zzso untranslated region zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso analysis of 22 independent zzso zzso clones reveals that the zzso sequences zzso precisely 16 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, analysis of zzso clones shows that the zzso gene zzso zzso are dispersed over 18 zzso Classical promoter and zzso elements are present in appropriate positions zzso of the zzso and their zzso results in regulated zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and liver following partial zzso The zzso adjacent to the most zzso promoter is found in all zzso and cell types previously shown to express zzso while the other zzso zzso zzso are more tissue specific in their zzso zzso of some or all of five putative promoters was documented in zzso cell zzso liver, and skeletal zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoters appear to control zzso gene zzso The data indicate that the several distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso result from zzso initiation at distinct promoters and permit flexible zzso regulation of this zzso AA zzso zzso
