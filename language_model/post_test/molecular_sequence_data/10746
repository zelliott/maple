The zzso activity locus affects expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of zzso within the mouse zzso gene locus revealed two major zzso in 19 of 22 zzso strains zzso of either high or low zzso zzso gene zzso zzso mice, a zzso strain, and two other zzso strains contain less common zzso No coding sequence differences were found in zzso zzso sequences from representative high and low zzso activity zzso thereby excluding kinetic abnormalities as the basis for zzso zzso activity zzso zzso of approximately 10 zzso of potential regulatory DNA, including all eight known and three of four newly identified zzso zzso sites, by restriction zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso the length of which was also zzso of the zzso activity zzso This zzso repeat is located in the first zzso of the zzso zzso unit and lies close to a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso activity zzso are a zzso locus associated with the zzso gene zzso
