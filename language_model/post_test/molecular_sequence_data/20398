Using a combination of PAGE and mass zzso for protein zzso we obtained evidence that a putative zzso zzso designated hypothetical protein zzso occurs in bovine zzso This zzso termed as a putative bovine zzso zzso protein zzso consists of zzso AA zzso including a putative zzso signal zzso The theoretical zzso point value and molecular mass of the full-length sequence of zzso were calculated to be zzso and zzso zzso The highest sequence similarity zzso was observed with a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso d zzso An zzso protein derived from bovine zzso zzso showed relatively low sequence similarity zzso against zzso Its biological function is zzso but zzso transport could be zzso This is the first report of a putative zzso protein in bovine zzso
