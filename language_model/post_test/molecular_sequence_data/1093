zzso transfer across zzso species is a valued methodology because de zzso development for each species is costly and there are many species with only a limited commodity zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso regions provides valuable information on zzso and evolutionary processes affecting these zzso We tested 19 nuclear zzso markers from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on seven zzso hard pine species ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Transfer rates to species in zzso zzso zzso were slightly higher than those to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Half of the zzso zzso were found to be zzso over evolutionary times of approximately 100 million years zzso million zzso zzso of three zzso zzso showed zzso repeat and zzso zzso Both a decrease in the number of perfect repeats in the zzso species and a polarity for zzso the latter defined as a higher substitution rate in the zzso sequence regions close to the repeat zzso were observed in the zzso zzso The transfer of zzso among hard pine species proved to be useful for obtaining highly zzso markers in a wide range of species, thereby providing new tools for population and quantitative genetic zzso
