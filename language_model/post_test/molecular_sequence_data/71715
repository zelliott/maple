zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strong zzso zzso Six zzso of zzso and two natural forms were zzso Of them, all zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a higher selectivity index than did other, zzso or zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso showed both lower zzso and higher zzso activity than did zzso against zzso infection of zzso cells, an zzso T cell zzso To clarify the zzso mode of zzso and its zzso we used a zzso replication zzso zzso zzso in which different zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells via zzso All of the zzso inhibited T cell zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso zzso zzso infections zzso by zzso but had no effect on zzso strain zzso zzso or zzso zzso infections zzso by zzso The zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also stronger than that by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso T cell line zzso was more efficiently blocked by zzso and zzso than by zzso Taken together, zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso exerted their zzso by specific binding to zzso The marked increase in the zzso activity of zzso and zzso was ascribed to an enhancement in their ability to bind to zzso
