The most potent foreign zzso for natural killer T cells zzso zzso are zzso zzso whereas zzso cell zzso involves weaker recognition of structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso Here we provide the mechanism for the zzso of T cell zzso receptors zzso on zzso cells to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In binding these disparate zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso onto zzso similarly, achieving this by zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso regardless of the size of the zzso head zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was attributable to its terminal sugar group making zzso interactions with zzso Thus, the zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso self zzso to resemble the zzso of foreign zzso zzso which shows that zzso molecular mimicry can zzso the zzso of zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso
