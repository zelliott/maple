The alpha zzso of zzso zzso harbors two zzso zzso zzso (at positions 16 and zzso that serve as protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the alpha zzso of zzso provide binding surfaces for the zzso zzso We used three zzso zzso of zzso to investigate the functional importance of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso zzso with different receptors and zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, and zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso was examined in a setting where all zzso alpha zzso of zzso were zzso by zzso zzso Replacement of one or both zzso zzso by zzso did not alter the ability of zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso or zzso A1 zzso Its capacity to inhibit zzso and type VI zzso zzso was also zzso zzso release of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was not impaired because they zzso zzso stimulation of type II zzso zzso zzso active zzso of all four zzso zzso were constructed by the introduction of a zzso zzso The activated zzso showed differential abilities to inhibit human zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso hormone zzso zzso Loss of both zzso zzso but not either one alone, impaired the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Thus, replacement of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso has no apparent effect on zzso responses, but these zzso zzso may be essential for ensuring transition of zzso into the active zzso
