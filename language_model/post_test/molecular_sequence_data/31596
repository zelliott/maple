We report a simple yet extremely efficient platform for systematic gene targeting by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The system comprises two transgenic zzso one expressing zzso protein from the zzso zzso promoter and the other zzso expressing a custom guide zzso zzso that targets a unique site in the zzso The two strains are crossed to form an active zzso complex specifically in germ cells, which zzso and zzso the target zzso We demonstrate rapid generation of zzso in seven zzso and two zzso genes in which no zzso have been zzso Founder animals zzso expressing zzso transmitted zzso zzso to an average of zzso of their zzso a dramatic improvement in efficiency over the previous methods based on transient zzso zzso zzso zzso of two sites by zzso of two zzso efficiently induced internal deletion with zzso of zzso Our method is readily zzso to zzso gene zzso thereby accelerating comprehensive functional zzso of the zzso zzso
