zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily expressed by zzso in the central nervous system zzso where it functions as a zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previously, we identified an zzso central component in zzso to experimental allergic zzso zzso the principal zzso model of multiple sclerosis zzso related to zzso control of blood brain barrier zzso and peripheral T cell zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso as a zzso candidate for the zzso zzso locus zzso Here, we characterize zzso zzso between zzso and resistant zzso and zzso mice, respectively, and show that zzso zzso expression in the zzso is zzso regulated by acute peripheral inflammatory stimuli in an zzso zzso Next, we show that zzso is not expressed in any zzso of the immune zzso and that secondary zzso tissue is zzso poised to be regulated by central zzso zzso zzso using zzso analysis, we show that, inflammatory stimuli elicit unique zzso profiles in the zzso zzso of zzso mice compared to zzso mice, which is indicative of negative regulation of peripheral immune responses by central zzso zzso These results further support a functional link between the zzso control of T cell responses and zzso to zzso zzso disease zzso with acute and/or chronic peripheral zzso zzso targeting of zzso may therefore be useful in preventing the development and formation of new zzso in zzso thereby limiting disease zzso
