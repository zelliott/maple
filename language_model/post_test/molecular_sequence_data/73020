zzso zzso is a catalyst for an irreversible step in the degradation of zzso and its activity is regulated by a highly specific protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso protein zzso unique from other zzso protein zzso We cloned a zzso zzso a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso consists of 413 zzso acids and shares up to zzso zzso with human and rat zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed two major transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso transcript was expressed throughout zzso whereas the zzso transcript was specific to zzso and adult zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is zzso distributed in the zzso The zzso gene was zzso mapped to the zzso region on the right arm of the second zzso
