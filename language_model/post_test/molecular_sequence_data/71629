The arrangement of zzso zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the junction of the zzso zzso II and zzso 8 genes was determined in a range of zzso zzso This indicated that the ancestral arrangement for the order is zzso as found in the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso that evolved after the appearance of zzso also have the zzso arrangement, including zzso zzso However, most zzso zzso have either a zzso or a zzso arrangement (where zzso refers to the zzso gene for zzso In both cases, the zzso zzso gene is zzso on the zzso zzso rather than the zzso as is usually the zzso This zzso identified a zzso group not previously zzso consisting of zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso retained the zzso arrangement, suggesting this to be the most zzso of the zzso zzso consistent with zzso being zzso for the zzso However, the zzso also retained the zzso arrangement, leaving unresolved the issue of whether they should be included within the zzso
