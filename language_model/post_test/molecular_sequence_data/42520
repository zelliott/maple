In the classic model of zzso processing and zzso viral zzso must be zzso within the zzso of infected cells to be processed and presented to zzso zzso class zzso zzso T zzso zzso We have examined the utility of a zzso zzso zzso expressing the human zzso virus type zzso zzso protein for the development of target cells to study zzso zzso zzso zzso B cell lines zzso zzso zzso with zzso were efficiently zzso by zzso lines from donors capable of zzso zzso cells infected with a zzso zzso virus zzso expressing zzso Also, the zzso cells were efficient zzso cells for the generation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso lines thus generated recognized the same zzso as zzso lines from the same donor generated by zzso zzso The use of similar cell lines zzso with zzso zzso expressing zzso proteins may be useful in the study of zzso in zzso donors and in the study of the ability of candidate vaccines, including zzso to induce zzso zzso As zzso cells, the cell lines may be useful in the generation of zzso zzso zzso
