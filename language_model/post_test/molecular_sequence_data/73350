zzso of tumor formation in the anterior zzso has been zzso zzso but the common mechanism involved in zzso cell transformation and zzso remains zzso In this study, we used zzso differential display zzso to identify zzso that are zzso expressed in rat zzso tumor cells compared with normal zzso zzso An zzso exclusively expressed in zzso tumor but not in normal zzso was zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso product as a probe to screen a zzso library constructed from rat zzso tumor zzso cells, a zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This zzso encodes a novel protein of 199 zzso zzso which contains no well characterized functional zzso The zzso of this zzso is detected in normal adult zzso and in embryonic liver, where the transcript is about 300 zzso shorter and expressed at a much lower level than that detected from zzso tumor zzso zzso of this protein in mouse zzso zzso shows that it zzso cell proliferation and zzso cell transformation in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells into zzso nude mice resulted in tumor formation within 3 weeks in all zzso These results indicate that zzso tumor cells express a unique and potent transforming gene zzso which may play a role in zzso zzso
