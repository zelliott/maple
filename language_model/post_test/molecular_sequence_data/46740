zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso is coupled to the zzso zzso zzso cascade and is selectively activated by a zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly concentrated at the zzso terminals and is thought to play an important role in zzso of zzso synaptic transmission by zzso zzso of zzso zzso To gain further insight into the zzso signaling mechanisms of zzso with the aid of zzso zzso fusion affinity zzso we attempted to identify proteins that interact with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso directly binds to the zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso domain is located immediately following the 7th zzso zzso We also show that the zzso domain of zzso is zzso by protein zzso C zzso This zzso is inhibited by the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso binding is prevented by zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso serves to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
