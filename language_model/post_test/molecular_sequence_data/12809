A zzso zzso gene was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso The zzso gene was identical to the zzso and it was located in the space between an zzso gene and an zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence for the putative zzso gene showed considerable identity zzso to that of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso and an zzso zzso element containing a zzso zzso repeat zzso which were peculiar to the zzso zzso were also zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso These findings imply that the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso is carried by a novel zzso element that is zzso by a zzso large zzso
