The DNA sequence of a zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso and 3' regions has been determined for zzso zzso The sequence encodes only the beta zzso domain, indicating that alpha and beta zzso are specified by separate zzso The gene contains four zzso and encodes 470 zzso acid zzso The plant zzso acid sequence is highly zzso with respect to corresponding microbial zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is characteristic of zzso transit zzso zzso of the sequences of the zzso zzso and a zzso clone and the presence of cellular zzso corresponding in size and zzso sequence to the gene indicate that the gene is zzso Analysis of zzso zzso DNA suggests the presence of a second gene for the beta zzso
