In a zzso screen for zzso coiled zzso motifs aiming at structurally defined vaccine candidates we identified zzso This protein is exported in the zzso stage and was named accordingly zzso exported protein 1 zzso In an extensive zzso evaluation of its coiled zzso peptides zzso was identified as promising novel malaria vaccine candidate providing the rational for a comprehensive cell biological characterization of zzso zzso generated against an zzso zzso zzso region of zzso and against a coiled zzso domain were used to investigate zzso zzso zzso and expression zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is exported across the zzso zzso membrane and located to zzso zzso Change in location is accompanied by a change in zzso from a soluble state within the zzso to a zzso state after export to zzso zzso No classical export motifs such as zzso signal zzso or zzso domain was identified for zzso
