To determine whether the limited V gene usage by the zzso zzso delta zzso chain is dictated by preferential zzso or by zzso selection, we characterized and compared the zzso gene repertoire of the productive with that of the zzso zzso in 80 human zzso zzso Six different V genes were found on the expressed zzso two of them, zzso named zzso and zzso have not been described before on the surface of zzso T zzso Overall, six V genes and six zzso elements were isolated from the zzso zzso Interestingly, the same set of genes was rearranged both in the productive and in the zzso zzso These findings seem to suggest that zzso mechanisms play a major role in the restriction of the zzso gene zzso
