The zzso protein zzso which is thought to couple zzso to zzso contains three binding sites zzso for zzso a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell zzso and whose activity is modulated by an zzso interaction between the zzso head zzso and zzso tail zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso zzso zzso containing the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each bind tightly to the same or overlapping sites within zzso A short synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to inhibit binding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that this zzso forms a zzso complex in slow exchange with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was markedly temperature dependent, but was not inhibited by 1 M salt or zzso zzso zzso Attempts to further define the zzso site within zzso using a zzso zzso were zzso but near zzso zzso activity was retained by a construct spanning zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor of the zzso interaction, and the zzso synthetic zzso was able to expose the zzso site in intact zzso which is otherwise masked by the zzso zzso The results suggest that under certain conditions, zzso may be an effective zzso of zzso
