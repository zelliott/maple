The zzso gene is involved in nuclear fusion during zzso and zzso transmission and zzso pole body zzso separation during zzso cell division in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also independently identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of DNA strand zzso or zzso activity in zzso or zzso affecting zzso zzso To understand the various functions suggested for zzso and to identify other genes with functions similar or related to those of zzso we have characterized the zzso gene which was isolated as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the smallest zzso with the suppression activity revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence contains highly zzso zzso found in the DEAD protein family of zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for viability and is closely linked to zzso on zzso zzso
