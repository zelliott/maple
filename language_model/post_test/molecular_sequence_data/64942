The zzso class of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso base zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of hairpin 35 of zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso coli zzso at zzso resolution, providing zzso structure information for the zzso class of zzso zzso The zzso protein structure exhibits features that provide new insights into its molecular zzso Each zzso zzso has a zzso domain, responsible for specific recognition and binding of its zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso observed in the crystal structure has a well defined zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso molecules are located at the two valleys of the zzso zzso zzso The unique shape of the zzso zzso different from that of known zzso zzso is highly specific and structurally zzso the zzso structure of hairpin 35 of bacterial zzso zzso Apart from the hairpin 35, parts of zzso 33 and 34 also interact with the zzso zzso
