We show that zzso zzso 2 zzso and more specifically just its intact zzso domain, binds to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and promotes its cell surface zzso This interaction is specific as zzso has no zzso zzso 32 to 58 of the zzso zzso domain are required for zzso surface zzso zzso scanning zzso of the zzso membrane zzso region reveals two modes of zzso zzso A continuous block of zzso zzso is required for functional, zzso binding to zzso and cell surface zzso zzso whereas four specific zzso are essential in switching on zzso zzso after zzso zzso Thus, in addition to its zzso activity required for zzso zzso zzso zzso is also an essential zzso required for surface expression of zzso zzso
