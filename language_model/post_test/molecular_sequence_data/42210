It has previously been established that skeletal muscle development is accompanied by changes in the composition of intermediate zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso and zzso in adult zzso We show that the intermediate filament transitions during muscle development are more complex, and involve a transient expression of the recently discovered intermediate filament zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly early, in a zzso pattern, and is markedly zzso in adult rat muscle, whereas zzso zzso becomes more abundant throughout zzso zzso protein was found up to the zzso zzso stage, where it zzso with zzso in Z zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso before and after in zzso zzso Despite its more distant evolutionary and structural relationship to the other two intermediate zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso network indistinguishable from that of zzso and zzso both in zzso zzso and after differentiation to zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that zzso is an integrated component of the dynamic intermediate filament network during muscle development and that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso at stages of zzso
