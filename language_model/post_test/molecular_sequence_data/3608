The accurate zzso of skeletal muscle fiber types according to zzso heavy chain zzso zzso remains a difficult task in the zzso Combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were performed on serial zzso sections of pig zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles at 100 zzso body weight to give a new insight into muscle fiber typing in the zzso Several zzso zzso zzso either specific for a single zzso zzso zzso or zzso or of multiple zzso zzso + zzso or I + zzso + zzso were zzso No zzso zzso zzso was available for the zzso All three adult Type II zzso were expressed in the white L muscle, whereas no zzso was observed in the red R muscle, which was confirmed using zzso protection zzso In most zzso the distribution of the transcripts closely matched that of the corresponding zzso When observed, zzso of zzso mostly zzso for zzso and zzso in L muscle, and was more common at the protein zzso than at the zzso zzso zzso A minor proportion of zzso showed a mismatch between zzso zzso and zzso According to the type grouping distribution of zzso encountered in pig muscle, zzso zzso expression followed the rank order of zzso from the center to the periphery of the zzso zzso with a decrease in zzso metabolism and an increase in fiber zzso The zzso origin and functional significance of the type grouping distribution are zzso
