zzso combination therapy is a major advance in the treatment of zzso infection, but development of zzso resistance is still an important cause of treatment zzso zzso resistance testing was recommended recently for follow-up of zzso infected zzso The aim of this study was to develop a new zzso resistance zzso because simple and affordable zzso with sufficient sensitivity for different genetic zzso and low copy number samples are still zzso Different methods and zzso for zzso extraction from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing on an zzso automated zzso were evaluated and zzso The zzso was designed to amplify a zzso covering the zzso and the first half of the reverse zzso zzso which zzso most known resistance zzso to licensed zzso zzso Resistance zzso were identified using resistance analysis tools available over the zzso The zzso zzso had a sensitivity of approximately 200 zzso copies per zzso The method was evaluated on plasma samples from treated patients infected with different zzso of zzso and appeared to have similar sensitivity for all zzso zzso that had failed previously in routine testing were zzso successfully with the new zzso The new zzso is more sensitive and robust than the current routine zzso
