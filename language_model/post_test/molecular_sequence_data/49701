In order to zzso the characteristics of different zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of the interaction zzso zzso between zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso A was determined at different pH by zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and coupled to a zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso or zzso A was injected and the interaction was measured in real zzso zzso showed a faster zzso and a higher affinity for zzso than zzso regardless of zzso The values for both zzso and zzso decreased with increased pH from zzso to zzso except for the zzso for zzso which was only influenced by the pH change from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso obviously proceeds by a different mechanism than zzso of the zzso Association appears to be coupled to zzso of a zzso zzso acid zzso consistent with reduced zzso values at higher zzso In contrast, the stability of the complex is reduced at lower pH due to reduced hydrogen bonding capacity of zzso acid zzso acting as hydrogen bond zzso zzso in the number and distribution of charged zzso site zzso in zzso and zzso evidently result in different zzso properties of the binding sites, primarily influencing the association zzso
