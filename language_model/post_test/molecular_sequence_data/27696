zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso in the zzso of the zzso structures of zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso representing segments of the published partial zzso sequence for bovine zzso were used as molecular zzso to isolate from zzso zzso libraries overlapping zzso clones that span zzso zzso and potentially code for the entire zzso chain of bovine zzso The zzso sequence for bovine zzso reveals a zzso open reading frame that codes for 402 zzso zzso including a zzso zzso membrane zzso domain of 20 zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the zzso sequence and 29 zzso zzso acid zzso which were positively identified by zzso sequencing of two zzso isolated from the soluble form of the zzso was consistent with the translation frame and confirmed the authenticity of the zzso zzso The finding of an zzso zzso segment which serves as the membrane anchor and signal sequence suggests that the zzso region of the zzso zzso is oriented within the zzso of the zzso zzso This conclusion is in agreement with previous zzso studies which indicated that the zzso and zzso soluble forms of the zzso which zzso the zzso 324 and 297 zzso acid zzso of the entire zzso zzso respectively, include the zzso zzso
