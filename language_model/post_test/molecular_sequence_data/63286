We provide the complete zzso zzso sequence for the African zzso which is different from the previously published sequence and more similar to other zzso zzso The newly obtained prion protein sequence differs from the domestic cat sequence at three zzso acid positions and contains only four zzso zzso We recommend that this sequence be used as the reference sequence for future studies of the zzso gene for this zzso
