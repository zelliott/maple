Rice blast disease resistance to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R zzso zzso zzso and the pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso variation and zzso zzso at the zzso locus of wild rice zzso zzso the zzso of cultivated rice zzso zzso was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the zzso zzso The low zzso zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso but greatly differed from what has been reported for other zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be subdivided into two divergent zzso named zzso and zzso zzso is derived from zzso with nearly no variation and at a low zzso zzso is common and is the ancestral zzso The zzso repeat zzso domain has a high zzso ratio, and the low zzso of the zzso gene might have primarily been caused by zzso selective sweep and constraint by other putative zzso zzso Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the zzso acid zzso of zzso in the zzso domain has a close relationship with the resistant zzso zzso might have recently arisen during rice zzso and may be associated with the scenario of a blast zzso shift from Italian zzso to zzso
