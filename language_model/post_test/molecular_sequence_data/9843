We have examined the repertoire and relative expression levels of zzso zzso channels in zzso rat zzso These studies have revealed the zzso and abundant expression of zzso zzso an inwardly zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso identified in zzso outer zzso within the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transcripts undergo dynamic zzso zzso they are zzso in virgin zzso reach a maximum level by Day 12 of zzso decline thereafter zzso by term, they are again zzso zzso cells also express zzso transcripts at high levels but do not undergo apparent changes during zzso zzso analyses (by zzso amplification of zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of two zzso zzso which are likely to arise from distinct zzso sites within the same zzso zzso chain zzso assessments of zzso zzso from other species revealed the expression of zzso transcripts in the zzso as zzso zzso expression of zzso therefore represents a generalized phenomenon, characterized by both zzso and zzso regulation, and the zzso mechanisms of this channel protein are potentially zzso From the zzso properties of this channel in zzso and the observed zzso profile, we zzso that this channel zzso both the resting membrane potential and cellular zzso of zzso cells, and in turn contributes to the observed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
