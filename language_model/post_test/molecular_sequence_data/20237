zzso with high affinity for the surface of a solid material would be advantageous in zzso science as a protein zzso A human zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso a zzso zzso matter, was generated by a zzso display zzso zzso zzso was isolated after several rounds of selection and prepared as a zzso of zzso variable regions zzso The zzso crystal zzso technique showed that zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso degradation by competing with zzso zzso zzso analysis based on surface zzso resonance demonstrated that zzso zzso bound to the zzso film with an equilibrium zzso constant of 14 zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso was resolved to zzso A, revealing that the zzso determining regions zzso in the zzso zzso form a relatively flat surface on which zzso polar and aromatic zzso acids are distributed in zzso The structure of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso in the orientation of aromatic zzso in the binding zzso zzso scanning zzso demonstrated that these aromatic zzso especially zzso zzso in zzso were critical in the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest the possible selection of an zzso zzso that binds a material surface in a manner similar to zzso zzso
