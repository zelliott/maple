zzso zzso the zzso of a small family of zzso tandem zinc finger zzso domain zzso is a zzso zzso of instability of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso factor in certain cell zzso zzso stimulates zzso turnover after binding to class II zzso elements zzso within the zzso regions of both zzso In turn, this binding is dependent upon the key zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To evaluate other primary sequence requirements for ARE binding in this novel zzso domain, we zzso many of the zzso zzso within the zzso domain of human zzso and evaluated the effects of these zzso on zzso binding in a zzso system and zzso zzso instability in cell zzso zzso These zzso revealed a number of zzso zzso acids that were required for binding and begin to define the primary protein sequence requirements for this novel zzso zzso zzso all of the point zzso that prevented zzso binding to zzso also caused an increase in zzso levels of zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso zzso D experiments suggested that this effect was due to zzso of zzso zzso Although expression of the zzso form of zzso could also inhibit the destruction of tumor necrosis zzso zzso by zzso zzso the primary mechanism did not involve zzso with zzso zzso because the zzso cells used in these studies express no zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may act, at least in part, by physically interacting with an zzso activity or protein complex and functionally stimulating its ability to zzso class II zzso zzso
