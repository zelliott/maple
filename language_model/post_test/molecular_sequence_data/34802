zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso was performed on zzso DNA of the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso Two distinct zzso fragments, zzso and zzso were isolated and used to identify two DNA zzso zzso of these two zzso revealed that we had obtained the full-length DNA sequence including the promoter, zzso untranslated region, open reading frame zzso and 3' untranslated regions for two distinct zzso zzso These two zzso DNA sequences exhibited 51% identity at the zzso acid zzso level and were designed as zzso zzso and basic zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso for zzso gene is zzso zzso with a predicted protein of 370 zzso and molecular mass of zzso zzso and its zzso was uninterrupted in its corresponding zzso DNA zzso The zzso for the zzso gene is zzso zzso a predicted zzso of 423 zzso and molecular mass of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso was interrupted by three zzso in its corresponding zzso zzso The basic zzso gene zzso was successfully expressed in the zzso zzso system; optimum zzso activity was observed at 22 degrees C and at pH zzso zzso and zzso were clustered into two different zzso groups according to their sequence alignments with 28 other zzso zzso A zzso domain, zzso two zzso that exhibit similarities at the zzso level to zzso binding zzso in bacteria, was identified in 30 zzso zzso sequences zzso
