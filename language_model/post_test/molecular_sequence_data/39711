zzso of the human growth hormone zzso gene in zzso zzso is zzso by a locus control region zzso This zzso is composed of zzso zzso sites zzso located zzso zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso is the dominant zzso of zzso expression and is essential for establishment of a zzso domain of zzso zzso that encompasses the active zzso zzso This activity is zzso by three binding sites for the zzso domain zzso factor zzso These zzso elements are sufficient to activate zzso expression in the mouse zzso In contrast, zzso sites at the zzso promoter are consistently unable to mediate similar zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the functional difference between the zzso and the zzso zzso binding sites can be attributed in part to a single base zzso This base affects the zzso of the zzso complex, and zzso exchange of the divergent bases between the two sets of zzso elements results in a partial reversal of their transgenic zzso These data support a model in which the zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso program the bound zzso complex for zzso zzso zzso
