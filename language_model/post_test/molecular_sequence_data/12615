zzso of zzso libraries from human melanoma, zzso cancer, zzso and zzso disease in zzso coli and screening for clones zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso patient serum lead to the discovery of at least four zzso with a restricted expression pattern in each zzso Besides zzso known to elicit zzso responses, such as zzso and zzso numerous additional zzso that were zzso or specifically expressed in tumors of the same type were zzso zzso analyses suggest that many of these zzso besides being the target of a specific immune response, might be of relevance for tumor zzso zzso to a given zzso were usually confined to patients with the same tumor zzso The unexpected frequency of human tumor zzso which can be readily defined at the molecular level by the zzso analysis of zzso tumor zzso expression zzso indicates that human zzso elicit multiple specific immune responses in the zzso host and provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to human zzso
