Common zzso within the human zzso gene locus are associated with zzso and zzso zzso To uncover additional functional variation across this gene zzso zzso sequence comparisons were zzso zzso zzso segments (a total of zzso zzso were zzso in 24 African-American, 24 zzso and 24 Asian individuals, and zzso segregating sites (including 123 zzso were zzso zzso zzso coding sites were less likely to be zzso than zzso sites zzso but this pattern was not observed at zzso sites zzso Among coding zzso the distribution of those zzso predicted to affect function was skewed toward low zzso Some zzso occurred at similar zzso in each population; others had wide zzso Although strong linkage zzso was detected among the zzso expressed zzso the degree of linkage zzso varied among zzso These results suggest that rare functional gene zzso and zzso zzso must be considered in the interpretation of association studies between zzso and drug zzso zzso
