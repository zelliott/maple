The zzso replacement of the zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso from zzso modular zzso resulted in zzso strains that produce both 12- and zzso ring zzso with predicted structural zzso In all cases, novel zzso were produced and further modified by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to biologically active zzso zzso These results demonstrate that hybrid zzso in zzso zzso can produce a zzso of new zzso that are modified further by the highly flexible zzso zzso and zzso zzso tailoring zzso This work demonstrates the unique capacity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to expand the zzso of zzso zzso and to accelerate the creation of novel biologically active natural zzso
