An zzso zzso zzso was isolated based on its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso is expressed in flowers, leaves, stems and zzso The promoter region of zzso has several zzso elements associated with response to zzso and zzso stress conditions, and the zzso of the zzso transcript was found to be regulated by cold and salt zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso interaction zzso indicated that zzso interacts with zzso through the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to activate expression of the zzso reporter gene in zzso through recruitment of zzso Such recruitment was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso zzso at the promoter driving zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso A higher level of zzso gene expression was detected in the zzso zzso knockout zzso as compared to wild type zzso indicating that zzso expression is regulated by zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a zzso factor that zzso the expression of target stress regulated genes through involvement in recruiting zzso to their zzso
