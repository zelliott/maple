Mass zzso identification of zzso acid resulting in restoration of activity of chemically modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso This zzso unexpectedly occurred during attempts to zzso the zzso zzso zzso using three different zzso zzso However, mass zzso zzso mapping did not show the presence of zzso of the zzso zzso but suggested an zzso to zzso acid based on the observed mass zzso The presence of zzso acid was confirmed by employing zzso laser zzso mass zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, strong enhancement of zzso fragmentation was observed for peptides containing oxidized zzso in comparison with zzso zzso
