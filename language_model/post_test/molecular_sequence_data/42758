This paper using the synthesis of zzso bean zzso inhibitor gene as an example, presented a new method for gene zzso The principle of the method was based on the combination of the single strand strategy and the zzso zzso The synthesis was very simple, convenient and zzso The zzso bean zzso inhibitor is a protein composed of 72 zzso acid zzso Its zzso acid sequence has been determined, but the DNA sequence of gene still zzso The synthetic zzso bean zzso inhibitor gene was 248 zzso in zzso It contains the zzso zzso the start and stop zzso the restriction sites of zzso and zzso at both ends, The zzso selection of the synthetic gene was carried out according to the zzso usage of other plant zzso inhibitor gene or plant zzso The synthetic zzso DNA was zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso first, then cloned into zzso zzso The synthetic gene was proved to be correct by the restriction map and the sequence analysis using the zzso chain termination zzso
