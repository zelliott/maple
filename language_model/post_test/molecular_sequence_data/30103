The zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso requires zzso or zzso for specific recognition of the zzso sequence zzso & Coleman, zzso An zzso zzso consisting of the first 63 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso has been obtained by partial zzso zzso of a cloned and zzso zzso domain of 149 zzso zzso We show that zzso contains the minimal zzso DNA binding zzso zzso binds tightly 1-2 zzso of zzso or 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveals structural identity between the metal binding zzso of zzso and that of the larger precursor zzso zzso can be zzso for the zzso in zzso and two zzso zzso signals are observed at zzso and zzso zzso both suggesting coordination of zzso to three or four zzso zzso With the exception of the zzso zzso the only zzso zzso are the six highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso show the two proteins to have almost identical zzso and to be present as zzso in solutions up to zzso zzso This leads us to zzso that zzso does not possess a zzso zzso but forms a zzso metal cluster involving all six zzso in a zzso zzso zzso contains about zzso zzso estimated from circular zzso zzso of the native zzso causes substantial unfolding of the secondary zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso is not induced to zzso by zzso of zzso at low zzso
