zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso responsible for zzso acid synthesis in the zzso cycle, which functions to convert stored lipids to zzso by zzso the zzso zzso reaction with zzso in the zzso In this study, the cloning of an zzso zzso designated zzso from the banana fruit is zzso zzso was 1801 zzso in length zzso a single zzso of 556 zzso acid zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso possessed the zzso zzso domain and a putative zzso targeting signal zzso at the zzso zzso zzso also shared an extensive sequence zzso zzso with other plant zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that zzso might be present as multiple members in the banana zzso In Northern analysis, zzso was expressed specifically in zzso fruit tissue and transcripts were not detected in other zzso such as roots, zzso leaves, zzso male zzso and in fruit at different stages of zzso However, the transcript abundance in fruit was affected by stage of zzso during which transcript was barely zzso at the early stage of zzso zzso and zzso but the level increased markedly in zzso and in other fruits at advanced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression in zzso fruit could be zzso by treatment with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso effect was abolished by the application of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of this study clearly show that zzso expression in banana fruit is temporally regulated during zzso and is zzso
