zzso a gene zzso a protein with high sequence identity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified from a zzso library from the zzso organ zzso lateral zzso of the zzso lobster zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso is 1801 zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso with three zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (named for a class of compounds including zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bone zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso showed that zzso is predominantly expressed in the lateral zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso around auxiliary cells zzso that surround the inner zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso outer zzso We propose that zzso is expressed and zzso by auxiliary cells, associates with zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso via the zzso domain, and has zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is associated with cells surrounding zzso between zzso of the zzso zzso zzso functions in the zzso organ and zzso are zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report from any zzso system of a gene zzso a protein with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
