zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso is a potentially zzso zzso able to inhibit differentiation and induce transformation of zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso differs from that of zzso in zzso zzso A change of zzso at the zzso site results in loss of the restriction site in the zzso zzso gene from zzso and this of zzso is designated as the Taiwan zzso In this study, we further investigated the Taiwan zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and throat zzso of zzso patients and normal zzso 

DNA was extracted from zzso zzso of 22 zzso patients and 40 normal controls, and from throat zzso of 28 zzso patients and 78 normal zzso The DNA was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso zzso then the zzso zzso was identified by analysis with the zzso restriction zzso 

The zzso gene was detected in all zzso tumors, in only 25 of 40 normal zzso zzso and in 12 of 28 and 44 of 78, respectively, throat zzso of zzso patients and normal zzso The Taiwan zzso was detected in zzso to zzso of zzso zzso The distribution of Taiwan zzso zzso was not statistically different between the zzso group and normal controls in either zzso zzso or throat zzso 

The results indicate that, based on zzso restriction site analysis, the Taiwan zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso strain in zzso patients and normal individuals in zzso
