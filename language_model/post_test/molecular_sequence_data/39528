Gene zzso has been recognized as a major route to supply raw sequences for zzso novelty in evolution, but the mechanism underlying the retention of duplicate genes is not fully understood zzso zzso in spatial expression patterns was investigated here and in response to stimuli of the four members of a rice zzso protein gene family zzso which zzso a class of zzso zzso The four zzso are zzso organized within a 20 zzso range of zzso 10 without any zzso of other open reading frames and with a median zzso value of zzso These zzso showed little similarity in their regulatory regions but high conservation in coding zzso Search of an zzso zzso database predicted their promoter regions with divergent zzso zzso Further expression analyses involving different zzso and nine types of stimuli by a zzso strategy revealed that the four zzso were expressed mainly in vascular zzso of different zzso and showed diversity in zzso specificity and in response to these zzso with some overlapping zzso Furthermore, these data show that zzso appeared to inherit most of the functions from their zzso zzso whereas the other three genes zzso after zzso zzso Thus, the retention of zzso in a zzso family seems to require a more complicated diversification process than originally zzso In addition, the zzso strategy is a powerful way to explore function divergence of a zzso gene zzso
