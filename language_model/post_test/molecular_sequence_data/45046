zzso dominant zzso zzso is a form of blindness, due in part to zzso affecting the zzso zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso families exhibit variable zzso and incomplete zzso The purpose of this study was therefore to determine if the background zzso zzso acts as a genetic modifier for the expression of this zzso 

To find novel zzso zzso zzso we performed complete zzso gene zzso sequencing in 30 zzso To assess the possibility that zzso DNA zzso acts as a genetic modifier, we determined the zzso DNA zzso in 29 Caucasian zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso distribution between patient and control groups were determined by statistical zzso 

Seven new zzso zzso zzso were zzso Most were detected in the zzso targeting zzso or in the zzso domain at the zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated that the European zzso distribution was different between Caucasian patients and zzso Further, zzso J was zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Overall, our results support zzso as a genetic mechanism in zzso cases and also suggest that zzso genetic background may influence disease expression in a subset of zzso
