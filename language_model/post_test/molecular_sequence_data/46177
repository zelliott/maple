zzso virus zzso isolation is recommended by the WHO zzso and zzso zzso for studying the zzso and epidemiology of zzso However, the absence of zzso effects zzso in many of the cell lines used commonly makes it difficult to confirm RV zzso In this study, two zzso amplifying RV zzso were developed and validated in order to confirm and zzso RV zzso after cell zzso A zzso Green zzso real-time zzso zzso was established for initial rapid detection of RV in zzso cells and a zzso zzso zzso was used for amplifying further the zzso zzso window of the E1 gene for the identification of RV zzso as recommended by the zzso zzso of the two zzso were evaluated using eight RV zzso two from infants with the zzso zzso syndrome zzso and six from patients with acute zzso All the zzso had cycle threshold zzso values zzso after the third passage, which is recommended as the zzso for the confirmation of a viable RV zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso window generated by the zzso showed that the eight RV zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso can be carried out in local public health laboratories, which would extend the molecular surveillance of zzso and contribute to the WHO goal of zzso zzso zzso
