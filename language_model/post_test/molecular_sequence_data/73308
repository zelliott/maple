A zzso region of the zzso D3 zzso which contains the immunity functions has recently been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the presence of a putative zzso gene zzso whose protein product functions to maintain the zzso zzso as a zzso integrated zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso was constructed that zzso zzso C1 protein under control of zzso in zzso zzso C1 protein was subsequently zzso and characterized as a 223 zzso acid protein with specific binding affinity for zzso imperfect zzso operator sequences located on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein sequence data obtained from automated zzso degradation (16 zzso of zzso zzso protein were identical to the predicted sequence based on DNA sequence analysis of the zzso open reading zzso
