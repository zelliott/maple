zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso coli strain zzso revealed that besides the zzso and zzso zzso genes that control the type 1 zzso zzso phase switch, there are three additional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences showed that the five zzso range in sequence similarity from 63 to zzso An zzso survey indicates that zzso and zzso are present and linked next to the zzso locus in 24 of 67 zzso zzso coli strains but are found in only 1 of 15 normal human zzso zzso The zzso sequence located next to the zzso locus was found in 42 of 67 zzso zzso and 8 of 15 of the zzso zzso We show that two of these zzso those zzso by zzso and zzso can function at the type 1 zzso zzso zzso In a zzso deletion zzso lacking all five zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso provided in trans zzso the zzso element from the off state to the on zzso When a zzso OFF zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the urinary tracts of mice, a switch to the zzso on state was detected within 24 h in bacteria recovered from zzso the zzso and the zzso A zzso OFF zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated the ability to switch from the zzso off state to the on state during mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso in either the zzso on or off state showed a zzso relationship for zzso zzso from a zzso to a zzso zzso and from a zzso on to off zzso were observed in zzso ON zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso or zzso was provided in zzso Together these results indicate that zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso switching activity and that zzso has the ability to switch zzso from the off to the on zzso
