It has previously been shown that excess wild type zzso zzso can repress the zzso activity of a variety of promoters in intact zzso To determine whether this zzso repression represented a direct effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared from zzso zzso zzso and from insect cells infected with a zzso zzso When added into an in zzso zzso system, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso reduced markedly zzso from the zzso promoter, as well as from an array of other zzso with the exception of an zzso class I gene zzso The presence of zzso zzso seemed to affect specifically the formation of the zzso zzso complex because zzso initiation complexes were completely zzso to zzso zzso as was also the process of transcript zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with the stable binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso although both zzso and zzso zzso could associate in zzso with zzso zzso We propose that upon binding to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso specifically blocks the ability of zzso to engage in interactions required for efficient zzso zzso This may account, at least in part, for the ability of excess zzso zzso to inhibit cell proliferation and to interfere with zzso zzso
