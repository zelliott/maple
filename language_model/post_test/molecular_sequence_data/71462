zzso zzso results in significant brain damage, but the molecular mechanisms associated with zzso brain injury are not well zzso We have adopted an improved zzso method to search for new zzso zzso Among the different zzso isolated following transient zzso zzso in zzso zzso was selected for further zzso The search for zzso revealed that it is the rat zzso to human zinc finger motif 1 zzso also called zzso zzso factor 1 zzso With Northern zzso zzso zzso with three zzso species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased at 6 h and 5 days after the zzso zzso These findings were extended also to another animal zzso In zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was induced in the zzso zzso as early as 4 h zzso zzso peaked at 2 days in the whole zzso and cortex, and then progressively decreased towards sham zzso By day 4, expression had disappeared almost entirely from the cells in the zzso region of the zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso has been recently identified as activated following zzso zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso may play two roles in the zzso zzso The primary role of zzso is to activate DNA repair zzso but if repair fails, zzso will be zzso Thus, zzso may represent a relevant link between zzso and the zzso processes which follow cerebral zzso
