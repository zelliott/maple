The various functions of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso are similar, so it may be assumed that the overall structure of the folded proteins will be zzso To preserve structure there must be constraints on sequence zzso The majority of zzso tolerated will be involved in immune escape but changes at some positions are known to have direct effects on zzso expression and zzso This allows the virus to change its zzso and escape immune zzso These properties will influence the fitness of the virus to zzso and replicate in potential zzso A better understanding of the zzso relationships of zzso zzso will assist in the development of vaccines and zzso Here, we identify similarities and differences between zzso zzso and zzso types that may be relevant to the zzso of the various zzso The results are discussed in relation to what is known of zzso associations for zzso zzso
