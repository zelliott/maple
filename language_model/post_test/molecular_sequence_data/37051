Genes expressed specifically in a tissue are often involved in the defining functions of that zzso We used zzso difference analysis of zzso to amplify 20 zzso fragments representing transcripts that were more abundant in the lobster zzso organ than in brain, zzso zzso zzso or second zzso We then independently confirmed that the transcripts represented by these clones were enriched in the zzso zzso The 20 zzso fragments represent between 6 and 15 different zzso Six of the zzso contained sequences highly similar to known gene zzso We performed in zzso zzso with these six and found that all were expressed in zzso of cells associated with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso an alpha zzso were specific to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso was expressed only in the outer auxiliary zzso zzso a zzso zzso was specific to the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was expressed by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso inner auxiliary cells, and zzso zzso The identities and expression patterns of these six transcripts predict involvement in both known and novel properties of the lobster zzso zzso
