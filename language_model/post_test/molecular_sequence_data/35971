A zzso zzso member of the zzso gene family has been isolated and characterized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso two species previously shown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Steele, zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso to differ in their stress zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of predicted molecular mass 70 zzso with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso zzso accumulate significantly less zzso zzso after heat shock than zzso of zzso zzso In nuclear zzso experiments, we found that zzso induction of zzso expression in response to stress is similar in both zzso Thus, the previously reported inability of zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins in response to stress is at least in part due to reduced stability of zzso zzso during heat zzso
