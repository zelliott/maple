We recently developed the zzso End zzso zzso strategy for efficient characterization of zzso zzso and zzso The paired end nature of short PET sequences derived from long DNA fragments raised a new set of zzso challenges, including how to extract zzso from raw sequence reads, and correctly yet efficiently map zzso to reference zzso zzso To accommodate and streamline data analysis of the large volume PET sequences generated from each PET experiment, an automated PET data process pipeline is zzso 

We designed an integrated zzso program package, zzso to automatically process PET sequences and map them to the zzso zzso The zzso was implemented as a zzso application composed of four zzso the zzso module for PET zzso the zzso module for zzso evaluation of PET sequence zzso the zzso module for locating PET sequences in the zzso zzso and the Project Manager module for data zzso The performance of zzso was evaluated through the analyses of zzso million PET zzso It was demonstrated that zzso is accurate and efficient in zzso PET sequences and removing artifacts from large volume zzso Using zzso mapping criteria, over zzso of quality PET sequences were mapped specifically to the zzso zzso With a zzso zzso zzso machine, it takes approximately six hours to process one million zzso from extraction to zzso 

The speed, zzso and zzso have proved that zzso is an important and useful component in PET experiments, and can be extended to accommodate other related analyses of zzso zzso The zzso also provides zzso functions for data quality check and system for zzso data zzso
