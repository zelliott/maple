A zzso link between zzso induced zzso change and functional activity has been previously suggested for the triggering of zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis an zzso with greatly restricted zzso flexibility has been created by zzso zzso zzso a zzso at the elbow in the first heavy chain constant domain of a zzso zzso zzso was replaced by zzso The resulting zzso zzso had an additional zzso zzso bond connecting the two heavy zzso This newly introduced zzso bond between zzso binding arms gave rise to a compact zzso zzso which displayed lowered zzso flexibility as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the ability of this zzso zzso to initiate zzso of target cells via the complement cascade was zzso zzso it is likely that zzso or zzso mechanisms of zzso change induced complement zzso which require zzso zzso and/or zzso motions of zzso are zzso
