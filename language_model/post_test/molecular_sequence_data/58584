We have used the zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso techniques to design two genetic markers for blue zzso in the zzso zzso species zzso Both of these markers target the gene zzso the zzso zzso adhesive zzso The first marker, zzso is highly differentiated among and can be used to identify the three blue zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The second marker, zzso can identify zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using these markers we have demonstrated that hybrid zzso from zzso Bay, UK carry zzso for this gene that are the products of zzso zzso The high frequency (10 per zzso of these zzso zzso within the hybrid population suggests that zzso is fairly frequent within this gene or that zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is substantial and has been occurring over considerable evolutionary zzso The two novel genetic zzso zzso and zzso will be invaluable in additional studies regarding the importance of zzso among blue zzso
