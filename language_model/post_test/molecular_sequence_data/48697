Human zzso virus type 1 zzso has a biased zzso composition different from human zzso This raises the question of how evolution has chosen the zzso sequence of zzso that is observed today, or to what extent the actual zzso contributes to virus replication capacity, zzso and zzso Here, we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering zzso approach to zzso 

Using synonymous zzso pairs, we rationally zzso and zzso zzso and zzso different zzso of the zzso gag and pol zzso zzso viruses had significantly lower viral replication capacity in zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso degrees of ex zzso zzso were zzso depending upon both the specific zzso region and the number of zzso zzso A zzso zzso virus carrying 38 synonymous zzso was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the zzso virus in zzso cells and zzso Although zzso is based on several tens of zzso changes, zzso zzso reverted to zzso zzso after serial passages in zzso zzso zzso no zzso was observed in the zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso is a useful strategy to zzso affect the zzso properties of zzso
