Certain peptides derived from the zzso domain of the major zzso class I zzso complex zzso inhibit zzso zzso increasing the zzso number of active receptors on the cell surface and thereby enhancing the sensitivity to hormones and other zzso These peptides zzso and they also bind to zzso at the same site from which they are zzso suggesting that they could bind to zzso sites with significant sequence zzso zzso affected by zzso peptides do, indeed, have such sequence zzso as illustrated here by insulin zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso A synthetic zzso with sequence identical to a certain zzso zzso domain binds to that zzso in a zzso manner and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, each such zzso is selective for its zzso zzso An zzso to the zzso zzso not only binds to zzso and competes with the zzso but also zzso zzso zzso of zzso These zzso and binding studies with deletion zzso of zzso indicate that the sequence zzso zzso by zzso 10 plays a key role in zzso zzso Our results illustrate a principle for identifying zzso sites of importance for zzso zzso and for enhancing sensitivity to hormones and other zzso
