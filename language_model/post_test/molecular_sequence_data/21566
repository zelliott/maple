zzso sequences are the major components of the zzso zzso Association of these repeats with zzso sequences and their regulation in buffalo zzso zzso has remained largely zzso 

We cloned and zzso zzso repeat fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 339 base pairs, respectively from the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso these fragments were found to represent zzso and part of some functional zzso The zzso clones showed cross zzso only with zzso zzso goat and sheep zzso zzso Real Time zzso detected zzso zzso zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso copies of zzso and zzso and zzso 1000 of zzso in zzso zzso goat and sheep zzso zzso zzso repeats are zzso active in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed maximum expression in zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and zzso in zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso showed repeats to be distributed all across the zzso 

The data suggest that zzso repeats have been incorporated into the zzso regions of various zzso zzso possibly contributing towards the architecture and evolution of the buffalo and related zzso zzso of our present work in the context of comparative and functional zzso are zzso
