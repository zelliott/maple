Twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso against the fish zzso infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso were used to select 20 zzso escape zzso The zzso sequence of the entire zzso zzso gene was determined for six zzso representing differing zzso patterns and each had a single zzso change leading to a single zzso acid substitution within one of three regions of the zzso These data were used to design zzso zzso zzso to amplify portions of the G gene of the 14 remaining zzso When the zzso products from these zzso were zzso they also had single zzso zzso coding for zzso acid zzso at the same, or nearby, zzso Of the 20 zzso for which all or part of the zzso gene was zzso two zzso selected zzso with zzso at zzso acids zzso zzso site I) and the remaining zzso selected zzso with zzso at zzso acids zzso zzso site zzso Two zzso that selected zzso mapping to zzso acids zzso selected other zzso that mapped to zzso acids zzso raising the possibility that this portion of the N zzso of the protein was part of a zzso zzso defining zzso site zzso zzso alignment of the zzso of rabies virus, zzso zzso virus and zzso revealed similarities in the location of the zzso zzso and a high degree of conservation among zzso zzso indicating that the zzso of three different zzso of animal zzso may share a similar three-dimensional structure in spite of extensive sequence zzso
