The protein zzso zzso zzso are a large and structurally diverse family of zzso The zzso zzso domain held in common by each member of this family is a self-contained zzso zzso acid unit bearing zzso highly zzso linear sequence zzso several of which have been shown to be important to the zzso activity of this zzso The zzso activity of the zzso is clearly an zzso successful theme, and at least 10 distinct zzso have been zzso Many of these resemble cell surface receptors for growth factors, and for a small zzso of these receptors a zzso has been zzso The remainder are located zzso and presumably sense and respond to appropriate zzso cues by exerting their zzso powerful zzso zzso A detailed examination of the zzso relationships of the zzso and their zzso zzso is particularly revealing in trying to establish the roles that these proteins play in signal zzso in zzso zzso
