In zzso cells, the zzso are zzso zzso with zzso specifically enriched at the cell zzso within zzso structures, such as zzso while zzso shows no specific zzso To understand the sorting and regulation of zzso within moving cells, we previously isolated zzso a novel zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso Here, we have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso contains six predicted zzso repeats at the zzso zzso and is partially zzso to three previously reported sequences of unknown zzso Northern analysis reveals zzso expression in all zzso tested, with highest levels in skeletal zzso zzso with previously demonstrated interactions between native zzso and zzso filament zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly in an zzso zzso Compared to stationary cells zzso zzso is down regulated in crawling zzso Similarly, zzso cells have increased zzso zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso the formation of novel membrane zzso that are enriched in zzso while zzso of zzso zzso alters cell zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso dynamics to regulate the zzso zzso required for cell growth and zzso
