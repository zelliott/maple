To evaluate whether an zzso canine zzso influenza A virus was capable of infecting and zzso disease to zzso 

20 influenza zzso 12- to zzso zzso 

5 zzso were zzso via zzso exposure with zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso A second group of 5 zzso zzso control zzso was zzso via zzso exposure with a contemporary zzso virus zzso and 4 zzso zzso served as a negative control zzso To evaluate the potential for virus transmission, zzso zzso zzso were introduced 2 days after zzso exposure and housed with zzso and zzso zzso to serve as zzso zzso Clinical signs, zzso virus zzso and zzso responses to zzso were monitored in all zzso for up to 21 days after viral zzso Growth and infection characteristics of viruses were examined by use of zzso canine kidney cells and primary zzso and canine respiratory zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso had mild changes in clinical appearance, compared with results for zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso induced significantly lower numbers for copies of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and lower systemic zzso responses in zzso than did zzso zzso The zzso isolate was not transmitted to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso with the canine zzso isolate resulted in mild clinical disease, minimal zzso virus zzso and weak systemic zzso responses, compared with responses after zzso with the zzso zzso influenza zzso These results suggested that zzso has not maintained zzso for zzso
