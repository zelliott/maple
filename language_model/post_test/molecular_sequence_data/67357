zzso and its zzso are highly zzso in all zzso zzso In this paper, we show that zzso transcripts were detected from 6 to 48 h zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to both the zzso and the zzso of infected cells but was not a viral structural zzso To determine the function of zzso in the viral life cycle, an zzso knockout zzso zzso was zzso Compared with zzso and repair zzso zzso exhibited an approximately zzso reduction in infectious virus zzso Further investigations showed that the zzso deletion did not affect the replication of viral DNA, zzso formation, or zzso assembly but delayed the expression of late zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso was unable to establish a fatal infection in zzso zzso larvae via per zzso zzso Few infectious progeny viruses were detected in the zzso of the infected larvae, indicating that the replication of zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso protein that promotes late gene expression and is essential for the zzso of zzso
