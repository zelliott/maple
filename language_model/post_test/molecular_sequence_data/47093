zzso zzso a zzso for the B7 zzso molecules zzso and zzso is considered a fundamental regulator of zzso zzso In this paper, we present the complete primary structure of the mouse and human zzso gene zzso zzso comparison between the mouse and the human zzso gene zzso revealed a high degree of sequence conservation both for zzso zzso regions zzso zzso and for coding regions zzso zzso with an overall score of zzso over the entire length of the two zzso Of the zzso zzso regions zzso five simple repetitive elements were found in the mouse zzso whereas two simple repetitive sequences were localized on the human zzso zzso zzso analysis of mouse and human primary zzso indicated that both zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were found in most zzso with generally higher levels in zzso zzso The conservation of zzso gene patterning raises the possibility that constrained gene evolution of zzso may be linked to zzso zzso control of this zzso
