The zzso infrared zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso representing the zzso repeating domain of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso have been zzso In the absence of zzso zzso both zzso adopt predominantly zzso zzso with minor amounts of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in opaque solutions, and in the case of the zzso zzso zzso The infrared zzso of the zzso reflect the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The infrared spectrum of the solid zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso shows zzso component bands at zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso The high intensity of the zzso component suggests extensive zzso The data reported zzso give an infrared zzso support to our previous findings that upon zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments undergo a marked zzso change which gives rise to partial zzso formation and zzso This observation may have relevance to the molecular events which lead to the zzso of abnormal zzso structures in Alzheimer's zzso
