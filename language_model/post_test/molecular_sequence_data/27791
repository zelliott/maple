The structural gene of the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently zzso downstream of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso Both constructions included DNA zzso for the predicted leader sequence of the zzso zzso which was inserted between the zzso promoter and the structural zzso zzso coli containing the plasmids zzso for zzso and zzso zzso produced a zzso that reacted with zzso toxin zzso and had a molecular weight corresponding to that of the cloned zzso some degradation of zzso was zzso zzso of zzso coli containing plasmids zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso and the zzso zzso were present in the zzso indicating that zzso coli recognized the zzso toxin zzso leader zzso The protein sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was identical to that of authentic zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso which showed that zzso coli leader zzso correctly processed the zzso toxin zzso leader zzso Two single zzso acid zzso at zzso 26 zzso and zzso 139 zzso which were previously shown to reduce zzso activity were introduced into the zzso zzso zzso possessed approximately zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso 26 functions in the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso possessed essentially the same level of zzso activity as the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acid 139 does not function in the interaction of zzso but plays a role in a later step in the zzso zzso
