The zzso zzso zzso has rearranged both of its zzso zzso zzso using the same J beta region zzso beta zzso in each, but with different V beta gene zzso Although the two zzso are expressed approximately equally in zzso zzso the principle of zzso exclusion is maintained because only one zzso is zzso and capable of zzso a functional zzso In zzso made with zzso as the fusion partner, this protein may combine with the zzso protein derived from the normal cell to form new zzso zzso An analysis of the sequences upstream from the zzso zzso and additional V regions suggests that two zzso zzso 10 and nine zzso in length and located adjacent to each other 70 to 100 zzso zzso of the initiation zzso may be important in the expression of zzso zzso zzso Although B and T cells derive from common stem cells, no sequences are observed in T cells that are zzso to the zzso located zzso of all zzso zzso This implies that at least some of the sequences that regulate zzso are not shared in the two major types of zzso A survey of zzso and six other zzso zzso using zzso for 10 of the 18 known V region families indicates a distribution of V beta zzso in the tumors consistent with that found in zzso Four of these tumors have apparent zzso zzso on both zzso with the deletion of other V beta gene zzso These data suggest that the primary mechanism of zzso beta zzso is by looping out and zzso of the intervening DNA and that most of the V regions are located zzso to the C zzso These data were also used to develop a deletion order of the V beta gene segments in the zzso zzso zzso
