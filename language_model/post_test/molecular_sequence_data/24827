The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is involved in zzso to zzso and acts as a zzso protein for the zzso zzso zzso Other results indicate that zzso acts through zzso and that this action occurs downstream of zzso and through zzso Our results indicate that the interaction of zzso with zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso and is independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain results in an zzso increase in recovery from zzso zzso zzso of either intact zzso or the zzso domain leads to partial suppression of a zzso growth zzso and this suppression is dependent on zzso indicating that zzso function occurs downstream of zzso and through zzso Combination of an zzso zzso with the zzso zzso which zzso zzso from zzso results in zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso and promotion of recovery by zzso of zzso is dependent on both zzso and the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso protein and that the zzso domain acts through zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso family members from other zzso contain zzso zzso with sequence similarity to the zzso zzso domain, suggesting that zzso function may be zzso
