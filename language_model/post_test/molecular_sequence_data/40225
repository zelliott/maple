zzso outer membrane zzso proteins in zzso zzso like zzso zzso are poorly zzso In zzso and higher zzso zzso is responsible for the assembly of zzso proteins in the zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso has considerable similarity in its primary and secondary structure to zzso from other zzso zzso is localized in zzso zzso zzso and is essential for zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased the level of the zzso zzso channel zzso within 48 zzso Although the primary effect is on zzso induction of zzso zzso for 96 h or more also decreased the levels of other nucleus zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso membrane potential was reduced at this later time point possibly due to a reduction in the level of the proteins involved in zzso zzso However, zzso structure was not altered due to depletion of zzso In zzso protein import of zzso into zzso with a zzso reduction of zzso was reduced about zzso in comparison to zzso zzso In addition, the import of zzso proteins such as, zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso alternative zzso zzso was affected by about zzso under this zzso zzso of zzso levels by zzso did not affect the import of either zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso over expression increased the steady state level of zzso as well as the level of the assembled protein complex of zzso suggesting that similar to other zzso zzso is involved in assembly of zzso zzso proteins and plays an indirect role in the zzso of zzso zzso destined for the zzso inner zzso
