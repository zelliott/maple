zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of increasing medical zzso It has been regarded as asexual since it was first described in 1917, yet zzso analyses have revealed that it is more closely related to sexual zzso than other zzso zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso contains many genes apparently involved in sexual zzso 

By zzso survey sequencing, we find that genes involved in mating and zzso are as numerous in zzso zzso as in the sexual species zzso zzso which is its closest known zzso zzso zzso has a putative zzso zzso locus and a zzso gene zzso as well as zzso of at least 31 other zzso zzso genes that have no known roles apart from mating or zzso including zzso zzso and zzso 

We zzso that zzso zzso is likely to have an undiscovered sexual stage in its life cycle, similar to that recently proposed for zzso zzso The two zzso species represent two zzso related zzso lineages that have independently become both zzso and zzso Parallel evolution in the two lineages as they adopted zzso hosts resulted in separate but analogous switches from overtly sexual to zzso sexual life cycles, possibly in response to defense by the host immune zzso
