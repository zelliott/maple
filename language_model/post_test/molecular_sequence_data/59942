zzso was investigated in zzso zzso patients not zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso because the zzso protein binds zzso and in mice zzso gene knockout causes zzso iron zzso Six unrelated patients with zzso zzso were zzso Five patients had normal zzso coding sequence and the sixth was zzso for zzso We show that the spectrum of zzso zzso includes two distinct familial zzso juvenile zzso zzso zzso and a novel form of familial iron overload, with apparently zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and possible minimal zzso on bone zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso showed normal levels in all zzso Southern zzso analysis showed normal zzso gene structure, excluding major gene zzso Several corrections to the published zzso sequence were identified, but all six patients had normal zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of serum showed zzso protein of normal zzso In conclusion, we found no evidence to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two forms of familial iron overload appear unrelated to either zzso or zzso zzso studies are required to identify the genes involved, which may zzso novel proteins crucial to the regulation of iron zzso Identification of these zzso will aid the diagnosis, zzso and treatment of iron overload zzso
