Satellite DNA specific to the zzso C zzso was zzso and located on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using in zzso zzso The sequence was present on all seven C zzso zzso pairs and zzso to the entire length of each zzso with the exception of the terminal segments of some zzso zzso Three zzso pairs belonging to the A zzso showed zzso signals near the zzso of their long zzso The existence of zzso zzso zzso and the deletions of the repeated units are deduced from these zzso The number of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the satellite and zzso zzso was used to assign the SAT zzso of these species to their correct zzso
