While a number of growth factors have been described that are highly specific for particular cell zzso neither a factor nor a zzso uniquely specific to the skeletal muscle lineage has previously been zzso Here we identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific to skeletal muscle, which we term zzso for zzso zzso zzso is expressed at low levels in zzso zzso and is induced upon differentiation and zzso In the zzso it is specifically expressed in early zzso and developing zzso zzso is then dramatically zzso in mature muscle, where it remains prominent only at the zzso zzso zzso is thus the only known zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is dramatically induced throughout the adult zzso after zzso block of electrical activity, or physical zzso In humans, zzso maps to zzso zzso which zzso with the region reported to contain the zzso muscular zzso zzso Identification of zzso introduces a novel zzso system that seems sure to play an important and selective role in many aspects of skeletal muscle development and zzso
