A zzso zzso for a 68 zzso zzso protein was isolated from zzso zzso zzso This clone is a member of a gene family that codes for a class of large zzso zzso This includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence was found to have high sequence conservation in the zzso zzso domain sharing zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid identity to rat zzso and 38% identity to the zzso zzso zzso The northern analysis shows expression in zzso zzso stem and flower zzso but in mature leaves at lower zzso Southern analysis indicates that it may be a member of a small gene family or the gene may contain an zzso
