zzso zzso interactions are important to understand various biological processes in living zzso One of the important issues in zzso binding is how the protein identifies the target zzso and recognizes its zzso zzso zzso water molecules are expected to play a critical role not only in zzso the recognition process but also in maintaining the structure of the zzso We carried out zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations of an zzso solution of the zzso complex formed between the zzso binding domain zzso of the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the protein and the zzso and the microscopic structure and ordering of water molecules around them in the zzso form have been zzso It is revealed that the formation of the complex is associated with significant zzso of the zzso units of the zzso zzso that are involved in zzso Further, reduction in water zzso around the binding zzso of the two molecules in the complex with respect to their free forms clearly demonstrated that the recognition between the protein and the zzso is facilitated by removal of a fraction of water molecules from regions around the binding zzso
