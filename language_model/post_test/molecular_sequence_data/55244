zzso a zzso zzso of zzso belongs to a new class of zzso drugs, the zzso and shows good efficacy against zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although putative receptors for zzso have already been discovered, its mode of action is still not fully zzso The involvement of the zzso acid zzso on the zzso mode of action has previously been zzso zzso a possible role of the zzso zzso in the mode of action of zzso was investigated using two different zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a development zzso It was found that there is a clearly reduced sensitivity against zzso of strains carrying a zzso zzso loss of function zzso compared with zzso wild type zzso zzso To transfer these results from the model system to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was identified and used in a rescue zzso The zzso zzso could be fully rescued by injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We believe that this is the first functional rescue of a zzso zzso zzso strain with a gene from a zzso III zzso zzso These findings, together with the earlier data on zzso binding of zzso suggest that the zzso zzso is associated with the zzso mode of zzso However, the only partially resistant zzso of the loss of function zzso indicates that other pathways play a more significant zzso
