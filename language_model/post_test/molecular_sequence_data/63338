Here we describe the first reported use of a zzso bacterial system for the selection of affinity proteins from large zzso libraries displayed on the surface of zzso zzso An zzso library of 3 zzso zzso zzso based on a 58 zzso domain from zzso protein A, was zzso for binding to human tumor necrosis zzso zzso using one cycle of zzso display and thereafter transferred to the zzso host ( approximately zzso zzso The zzso library was subjected to three rounds of zzso zzso and the selected clones were screened and ranked by zzso analysis for binding to zzso and further characterized using zzso analysis and circular zzso zzso The successful sorting yielded three different zzso zzso zzso from 95 zzso to zzso zzso and constitutes the first selection of a novel affinity protein using zzso bacterial zzso The method combines the simplicity of working with a bacterial host with the advantages of displaying zzso proteins on robust zzso bacteria as well as using powerful flow zzso in the selection and characterization zzso
