In zzso zzso zzso culture zzso we have chemically characterized three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We have identified, cloned and zzso two pairs of zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso In zzso coli at 37 degrees C, zzso and zzso both zzso zzso although zzso is responsible for zzso and zzso for zzso synthesis zzso However, in a zzso zzso zzso background, zzso appears capable of adjusting the AHL profile from all three zzso at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C to the absence of zzso at 28 degrees zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso leads to the loss of zzso at 22 degrees C, which suggests that at this temperature the zzso protein is involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso When compared with the parent strain, the zzso and zzso zzso exhibit a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso (both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are both temperature zzso These data are consistent with a zzso zzso cascade in zzso zzso that is involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso
