We cloned a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso signal recognition particle zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso in length and encodes a zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein shared zzso zzso and zzso identity with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso coli zzso zzso The protein contains three zzso zzso elements like the other three zzso zzso zzso though the zzso portion of the putative zzso zzso protein was shorter than the zzso Secondary structure prediction showed than an zzso zzso is positioned in the zzso zzso A zzso in zzso inhibited cell growth and protein zzso
