zzso zzso of the zzso synthetic zzso zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso were zzso The data obtained are consistent with an extended zzso zzso of the free zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso allowed us to determine the spatial structure of the zzso bound to the zzso The zzso has an zzso surface with zzso and zzso zzso acid side chains clustered on the opposite sides of its zzso zzso The zzso and zzso clusters are located on the opposite sides of the bound zzso zzso The zzso side chains contact the zzso surface, while the zzso ones are oriented into the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso slowly zzso in the presence of the zzso This process does not alter the zzso of the zzso bounded with the zzso though decreases the zzso affinity to the zzso
