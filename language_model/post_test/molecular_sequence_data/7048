The ability to identify and characterize low zzso quantities of zzso proteins has greatly benefited from recent zzso in mass zzso analysis methods, particularly zzso search zzso We are investigating the use of zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso to gain as much mass information as possible from a single zzso protein zzso This report details results obtained from one-dimensional sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions, of known quantities of three zzso followed by zzso to zzso Three methods were used to obtain zzso data from a single zzso protein band: zzso direct zzso of approximately zzso of the band, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of another approximately zzso of the band, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the remaining approximately zzso of the band followed by zzso At the level of 50 zzso of protein loaded onto the zzso data was obtained from all three zzso At levels down to 5 zzso of protein loaded onto the zzso zzso data was obtained from the latter two methods, zzso and zzso zzso but not direct zzso zzso zzso masses were obtained from the 5 zzso loads to identify two of the three test proteins using four mass search zzso Only limited zzso mass data was obtained from zzso a zzso zzso with six zzso and no zzso but it was zzso
