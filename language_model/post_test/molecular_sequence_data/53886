The plant zzso zzso zzso genes are known to play important roles in the maintenance of shoot zzso zzso zzso determination of cell fate and differentiation of zzso zzso To study structural diversity of the three zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein in the zzso wheat zzso we isolated clones from a zzso library of young spikes of Japanese common wheat zzso zzso zzso Three different but highly zzso zzso were isolated and their sequences were zzso The mean zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences was zzso as compared to the barley zzso zzso The wheat zzso zzso proteins named zzso are zzso by a single set of zzso genes on the zzso group 4 zzso in the three component zzso of common zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence data and the Southern zzso pattern suggested that the three zzso zzso of zzso genes are highly zzso through zzso evolution of zzso They were expressed in zzso shoots and young spikes but not in developed leaves, zzso and zzso and callus zzso The zzso expression of the zzso was observed in zzso of wheat zzso zzso zzso The result suggested that the zzso gene is a dominant zzso of the zzso locus on zzso zzso
