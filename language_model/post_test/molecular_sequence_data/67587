zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide zzso zzso for the zzso Most bacteria and all zzso lack a zzso zzso zzso instead, zzso is produced via an indirect zzso a zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso zzso to zzso and an zzso converts zzso to zzso The human pathogen zzso zzso encodes two zzso zzso with zzso specifically zzso zzso onto zzso It was proposed that zzso is evolving into a zzso zzso zzso we have combined rational design and directed evolution approaches to test this zzso We show that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso an engineered zzso zzso zzso with seven zzso acid changes is able to rescue growth of the zzso zzso coli zzso strain zzso at its zzso zzso In zzso kinetic analyses reveal that zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso over zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso faster in the presence of zzso than zzso suggesting that an editing activity has evolved in this zzso to discriminate against zzso These data imply that zzso is a few steps away from evolving into a zzso and provides a paradigm for studying zzso zzso evolution using directed engineering zzso
