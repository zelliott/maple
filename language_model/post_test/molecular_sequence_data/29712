The role of zzso acid sequence in zzso switching observed in zzso and proteins associated with zzso diseases is not well zzso To study alpha to beta zzso zzso we designed a series of peptides with structural zzso zzso peptides with sequence features of both an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso The parent zzso zzso was designed to be a zzso zzso motif and was confirmed as such using circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso To introduce zzso character into the zzso zzso zzso at sites away from the zzso zzso interface were replaced by zzso to give zzso Unlike the parent zzso zzso underwent a zzso switch to zzso which zzso formed gels containing zzso zzso In contrast to certain other natural proteins where zzso of the native states facilitate transitions to zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso did not promote a zzso zzso the zzso of the peptides compatible with the alternative zzso design, however, did promote the zzso Furthermore, despite screening various conditions, only the internally zzso form of the parent, zzso zzso formed zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that, in addition to general properties of the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso that favor zzso promote zzso zzso
