A massive proliferation of zzso occurs in the zzso zzso zzso when methanol is zzso as the sole carbon zzso these zzso contain the zzso which catalyze the initial steps of methanol zzso The most abundant zzso zzso protein has an apparent molecular mass of 20 zzso and is termed zzso We report the isolation of two genes that zzso very similar forms of zzso this is the first report of genes that zzso proteins associated with zzso zzso Southern analysis demonstrates that the two genes are on different zzso although there are several zzso regions of both zzso and zzso zzso One of the areas of zzso zzso is within the untranslated region of the zzso Within the coding region there are 35 base differences between the two genes that are reflected in only five zzso acid zzso The zzso representing both genes of zzso are induced in cells grown in zzso medium and are below detection in cells grown in zzso zzso zzso protection analysis indicates that there is a zzso difference in zzso expression between the two genes when zzso The predicted sequences of both zzso genes show the absence of a zzso zzso leader sequence and the presence of only 1 zzso zzso In agreement with previous zzso data suggesting a peripheral association of this protein with the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Silver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sanders, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there are no obvious membrane spanning regions predicted in the zzso Both zzso gene products contain the zzso sequence zzso similar to the putative zzso zzso sorting sequence zzso zzso zzso Keller, zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso
