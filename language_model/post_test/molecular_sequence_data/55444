zzso of zzso zzso is well known as a phase I zzso reaction in various zzso zzso Regarding zzso organisms, however, no individual species involved in such reaction have been specified and characterized so zzso Here we successfully isolated a zzso that mediates zzso transformation of zzso including zzso and zzso from river zzso The isolate was found to be closely related to zzso zzso at the zzso zzso gene sequence level zzso zzso However, based on some differences in the zzso properties of this zzso we determined that it was actually a different species, zzso zzso strain zzso The isolate zzso zzso of zzso to yield a zzso zzso zzso zzso as the primary degradation zzso The zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso analysis revealed that the isolate possesses high zzso favoring the formation of zzso (nearly zzso zzso by the sequential zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the side chain zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso followed by the formation of multiple unidentified polar degradation zzso The breakdown proceeded more rapidly when zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied as the initial zzso The zzso zzso acids and polar degradation products are likely further zzso by ubiquitous zzso The isolate possibly plays an important role for complete degradation zzso of zzso by providing the readily zzso zzso
