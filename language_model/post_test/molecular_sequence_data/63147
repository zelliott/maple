The labeling of products containing genetically modified organisms zzso is linked to their zzso since a threshold for the presence of fortuitous zzso in food has been zzso This threshold is calculated from a combination of two absolute zzso zzso one for the specific zzso target and the second for an zzso reference gene specific to the zzso Thus, the development of reliable methods to zzso zzso using zzso reference genes in complex zzso such as food and feed is zzso Plant identification can be difficult in the case of closely related zzso which zzso are subject to zzso zzso Based on the zzso of zzso sequences obtained from public databases, two couples of consensus zzso were designed for the zzso zzso and differentiation of four zzso potato zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso pepper zzso zzso and eggplant zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied first using lines and zzso zzso sequence zzso then using zzso involved in gene zzso and finally, using zzso close zzso zzso sequence zzso This study allowed us to design four highly specific zzso zzso A duplex real time zzso zzso was developed for simultaneous zzso of tomato and zzso For eggplant and pepper, only zzso real time zzso tests were zzso The results demonstrated the high specificity and sensitivity of the zzso We therefore conclude that zzso can be used as an zzso reference gene for zzso zzso
