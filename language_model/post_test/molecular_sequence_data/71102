zzso is not present in zzso A isolated from zzso coli grown at 30 degrees C or higher, but it comprises approximately zzso of the fatty zzso chains of zzso A in cells grown at 12 degrees zzso The appearance of zzso at 12 degrees C is accompanied by a decline in zzso from approximately zzso to approximately zzso We now report that zzso zzso coli shifted from 30 degrees C to 12 degrees C acquire a novel zzso carrier protein zzso zzso that acts on the key zzso A precursor zzso zzso The zzso zzso is induced more than zzso upon cold zzso as judged by zzso extracts of cells shifted to 12 degrees zzso The induced activity is zzso after 2 h of cold zzso and then gradually declines but does not zzso zzso harboring an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso that normally transfers zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not defective in the zzso zzso zzso Recently, a gene displaying zzso identity and zzso similarity at the protein level to zzso was found in the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso designated zzso encodes the cold zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells containing zzso on the zzso zzso zzso exhibit a zzso increase in the specific activity of the zzso zzso zzso compared with cells lacking the zzso The elevated specific activity of the zzso zzso under conditions of cold shock is attributed to greatly increased levels of zzso zzso The replacement of zzso with zzso in zzso A may reflect the zzso of maintaining the optimal outer membrane fluidity at 12 degrees zzso
