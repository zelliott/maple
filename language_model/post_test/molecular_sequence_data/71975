The alternating host cycle and persistent zzso infection may zzso the evolution of zzso To test this hypothesis, eastern zzso encephalitis virus was zzso in zzso or zzso cells, as well as in alternating zzso host cell zzso High and low zzso were used to examine the effect of defective interfering zzso zzso zzso and persistent zzso cell infections were also zzso Fitness was measured with zzso growth zzso and competition zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso sequencing and zzso zzso All passages and zzso were done at 32 degrees C to eliminate temperature as a selection zzso zzso zzso in either cell type alone exhibited fitness declines in the zzso cells, while zzso and zzso passages caused fitness declines in both types of zzso zzso cell fitness losses were zzso and zzso specific and were not restricted to individual cell zzso Fitness increases occurred in the cell line used for zzso passages and in both cells for alternately zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso passage increased fitness in that cell type no more than alternating zzso However, zzso adaptation resulted in more zzso than alternating cell zzso zzso cell adaptation invariably resulted in replacement of the stop zzso in zzso with zzso or zzso In one case, zzso cell adaptation resulted in a zzso deletion in the 3' untranslated zzso Many zzso zzso were shared among more than one zzso or zzso cell passage series, suggesting positive zzso zzso Our results suggest that alternating host transmission cycles zzso the evolutionary rates of zzso but not their fitness for either host zzso
