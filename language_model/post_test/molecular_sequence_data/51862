The sequence of the zzso toxin gene of zzso zzso type D was determined and compared with that of the previously reported type B zzso It showed two zzso changes in the open reading frame, giving rise to one zzso acid zzso The promoter sequences were not zzso and different putative zzso and zzso regions have been identified in zzso The sequence information was used to develop zzso zzso which were specific for the zzso toxin zzso The utility of this system for identifying type B or D strains of zzso zzso was zzso
