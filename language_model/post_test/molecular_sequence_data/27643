The distribution of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells was investigated by flow zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso positive for the zzso zzso zzso present in normal peripheral blood zzso are natural killer zzso cells since the positive cells had an zzso activity toward zzso cells, and most of the zzso zzso cells were simultaneously positive for zzso zzso and zzso Essentially, no T and B cells, defined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were positive for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso samples taken from healthy donors and patients with disorders unrelated to zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso cells, many zzso zzso cells were observed in large zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells and some acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso but not in zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also positive in some cultured human zzso cell zzso We conclude that expression of the zzso zzso zzso is strictly limited to a distinct population of zzso cells among the mature zzso in normal zzso but the zzso is present in a wide range of immature zzso of zzso and zzso lineages as well as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso disappears from the surface of immature zzso of zzso and zzso lineages during the course of zzso
