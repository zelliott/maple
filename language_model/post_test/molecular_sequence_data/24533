zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso in cancer zzso zzso is a sequence specific zzso factor that is activated in response to various forms of zzso stress to induce cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso of zzso is subjected to complex and strict control through several zzso as it will often determine cellular zzso The zzso protein shares strong structural and functional similarities with zzso such as the potential to activate zzso responsive genes and the ability to induce zzso In addition to alternative zzso at the zzso zzso which yields several zzso zzso a zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso was described in zzso In this study, we report the cloning and zzso of the human Delta zzso zzso their regulation by zzso and their possible role in zzso As in mice, human Delta zzso lacks the zzso domain and starts with an alternative zzso zzso zzso Its expression is driven by a second promoter located in a zzso region upstream of this zzso supporting the idea of two independently regulated zzso derived from the same zzso As anticipated, Delta zzso is capable of regulating zzso and zzso function since it is able to block their zzso activity and their ability to induce zzso Interestingly, expression of the Delta zzso is strongly zzso by the zzso zzso and by zzso thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of zzso and more zzso of zzso The regulation of Delta zzso is exerted through a zzso responsive element located on the Delta N zzso zzso of Delta zzso not only regulates the function of zzso and zzso but also shuts off its own zzso once again finely regulating the whole zzso Our data also suggest that increased expression of Delta zzso functionally zzso zzso could be involved in zzso An extensive analysis of the expression pattern of Delta zzso in primary zzso would clarify this zzso
