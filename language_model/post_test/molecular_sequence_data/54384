zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso forms zzso assembly in zzso rendering its structural characterization highly zzso To probe the core of the zzso zzso we performed zzso exchange in native state and analyzed the residual zzso following zzso by zzso zzso zzso The data indicated a hierarchy in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by the remaining zzso This reflects the chain packing in the core of the zzso The segment zzso in the zzso half is largely in the interior of the core, while the zzso segment zzso zzso into and out of the zzso Next, we characterized the structural and zzso behavior of the zzso zzso The stretches zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen to display alternate zzso in slow zzso In the major population, both zzso and zzso zzso were seen along the zzso zzso zzso density analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso effect collected at 600 and zzso suggested the presence of four zzso of slow motions, zzso A zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso two of which flank the region zzso for which no zzso are seen in the zzso single quantum zzso zzso These zzso would identify folding and association initiation sites of zzso Interestingly, they also coincide with the zzso domain in the native state, suggesting that zzso formation leads to zzso of zzso
