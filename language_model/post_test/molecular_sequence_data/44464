Two zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from feeding females of zzso zzso The library was screened with a zzso zzso gene zzso originally amplified from zzso of zzso zzso Database searches predict that 1 zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso while the second zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso Both predicted proteins contain a short zzso signal zzso a long zzso and a mature protein of 219 zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso gene in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which may have 2 zzso The regions zzso the mature zzso were cloned into an expression zzso and zzso protein produced in zzso zzso zzso was zzso after zzso to cleave the synthetic zzso zzso and this activity could be inhibited by the engineered rice zzso zzso delta zzso zzso showed no activity against the synthetic zzso zzso The knowledge gained from these studies will improve our understanding of plant zzso zzso and aid the development of a rational zzso zzso approach to plant zzso zzso
