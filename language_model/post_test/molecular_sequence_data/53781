zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor alpha zzso gene expression in zzso cells and previous studies have identified a 53 zzso zzso to zzso sequence containing two imperfect zzso responsive elements zzso that contribute to zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene promoter in this study identified a second upstream region of the promoter zzso to zzso that is also zzso zzso This sequence contains three zzso sites and an imperfect zzso zzso and the specific zzso and zzso factors were determined by promoter analysis in transient zzso experiments, gel mobility shift zzso and in zzso DNA zzso The results are consistent with an zzso zzso alpha zzso complex interacting with an zzso zzso zzso zzso motif in which both zzso and zzso bind promoter zzso The zzso complex is formed using nuclear extracts from zzso cells but not with zzso human zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that other nuclear zzso are required for complex zzso The zzso zzso motif identified in the zzso gene promoter has also been characterized in the zzso D and heat shock protein 27 gene zzso however, in the latter two promoters the numbers of intervening zzso are 23 and 10 zzso
