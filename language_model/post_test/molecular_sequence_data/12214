zzso repeats zzso are present in proteins with diverse zzso The zzso structure of a zzso inhibitor zzso with a parallel beta sheet lining the inner circumference of the zzso and alpha zzso zzso its outer zzso is the only X-ray structure containing these repeats to be zzso Despite the fact that the lengths and sequences of the zzso repeats differ from those of the most commonly occurring zzso it was deemed worthwhile to derive a three-dimensional structural framework of these more typical zzso zzso using the zzso structure as a zzso 

zzso alignments of zzso zzso from 68 proteins were obtained by a profile search and used in a comparative sequence analysis to distinguish between zzso with a probable structural role and those which seemed essential for zzso This knowledge, along with the known atomic structure of zzso was used to model the three-dimensional structure of the most common zzso zzso These modeled units were then used to build the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The modeled zzso structure adopts a zzso arrangement, similar to that in zzso The beta regions of this typical zzso protein are the same as in the zzso structure, whereas the alpha zzso are shorter and the zzso of the alpha beta and beta alpha connections are zzso As a result of these differences it was not possible to pack together typical zzso units using repeats such as those found in zzso This mutually exclusive relationship is supported by sequence zzso The predicted structure of the typical zzso obtained here can be used to build models for any of the known zzso proteins and the approach used for the prediction could be applied to other proteins containing internal zzso
