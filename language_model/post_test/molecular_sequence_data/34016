zzso associated zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is, well established for its role as an inhibitor of zzso outgrowth in nerve injury, zzso by binding to zzso acid containing zzso on the zzso zzso Because disruption of zzso interactions promotes zzso zzso we have sought to develop potent zzso based zzso using natural zzso as zzso Although natural zzso of zzso are zzso terminating in the sequence zzso we previously established that synthetic zzso zzso zzso with the same sequence zzso to zzso exhibited zzso increased affinity zzso Attempts to increase potency by introducing a zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso zzso acid afforded only a zzso increase, instead of increases of zzso observed for other zzso zzso of zzso Surprisingly, however, introduction of a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso acid increased affinity zzso resulting in a potent inhibitor with a zzso of zzso zzso this zzso to a model of zzso based on known crystal structures of other zzso suggests that the zzso positions the zzso such that zzso substitution of the zzso zzso acid produces a zzso clash with the zzso while attaching an zzso zzso to the other zzso acid positions the zzso near a zzso pocket that accounts to the increase in zzso
