In zzso zzso roots, the zzso fungus zzso zzso initially zzso living cells, which die as the colonization zzso We aimed to clarify the molecular basis of this zzso cell zzso Our zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso zzso swelling and zzso collapse in invaded cells, indicative of zzso stress and cell death during root zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso plants were hypersensitive to the zzso stress zzso zzso By clear contrast, zzso stress sensors zzso and zzso as well as zzso markers for the zzso stress response pathway, termed the unfolded protein response zzso were suppressed at the same zzso zzso zzso compromised in zzso zzso activity, zzso by cell zzso zzso processing zzso zzso showed reduced colonization and decreased cell death zzso We propose a previously zzso microbial invasion strategy during which zzso zzso zzso zzso stress but zzso the zzso zzso This zzso results in a zzso zzso cell death, which is required for the establishment of the zzso Our results suggest the presence of an at least partially zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death zzso in plants as has been reported for zzso
