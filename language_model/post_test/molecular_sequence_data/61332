The zzso zzso a zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso is an essential factor for both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of the human zzso protein zzso directly interacts with zzso Based on a zzso zzso analysis, it has been reported that the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso protein binds zzso zzso zzso and zzso both activate the zzso pairing and strand exchange zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso region, which zzso to the zzso region of zzso does not exhibit strong binding to the human zzso protein zzso To investigate its function, the zzso region of zzso was randomly zzso Although this region includes the two segments corresponding to the putative zzso sites of zzso all seven of the zzso did not decrease, but instead slightly increased, the DNA zzso In contrast, we found that some of these zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso zzso zzso we conclude that these zzso acid zzso are required for the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso pairing between zzso and zzso and higher zzso pairing activity was observed in the presence of both zzso and zzso than with either zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which strongly impaired the zzso zzso decreased the zzso pairing in the presence of both zzso and zzso without affecting the zzso pairing by zzso zzso This result suggests the importance of the zzso interaction in zzso zzso
