zzso oxygen species, the zzso of zzso energy zzso are considered a main zzso cause of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso can zzso lifespan of zzso zzso in the zzso However, the role of zzso as a main zzso of lifespan has been challenged on the grounds that zzso might be effective only in compromised genetic zzso Moreover, zzso comparisons show lower levels of zzso activities in zzso species, suggesting that zzso extension may evolve through less zzso oxygen species generation from the zzso rather than higher expression of zzso The tremendous variation in lifespan between zzso zzso ranging over 2 orders of zzso coupled with the fact that all individuals share the same zzso provides a system to investigate the role of zzso in the zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso as a model system, because queens can reach the extreme age of 28 years, whereas workers and males live only 1-2 years and a few weeks, zzso We cloned zzso and found that zzso queens have a lower level of expression than workers and zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed higher zzso activity levels in males and workers compared with zzso which had zzso activity levels similar to that of zzso zzso Altogether, these data show that increased expression of zzso is not required for the evolution of extreme zzso even in a system in which differential gene expression is the only way to express zzso with great lifespan zzso
