In zzso zzso a zzso arrest coordinates the completion of zzso with zzso zzso zzso maintains the zzso II arrest of mature zzso and prevents DNA replication between the zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso of zzso and showed it to be the zzso zzso by two additional zzso The zzso transcripts are present in zzso zzso but not zzso and injection of zzso into zzso zzso blocks zzso and zzso active zzso zzso In zzso zzso is activated in zzso consistent with a role in zzso We generated deletions of zzso and found that, as in zzso zzso is responsible for the majority of zzso zzso zzso the zzso that do mature complete zzso normally and produce zzso zzso that zzso although there is a reduction in female fertility and loss of some zzso by zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso that activates a zzso cascade during zzso and is zzso for zzso This could be because there are redundant pathways regulating zzso because zzso low levels of active zzso are zzso or because active zzso is zzso for zzso in zzso These results highlight the complexity of zzso regulation that evolved to ensure accurate control over the zzso zzso
