The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso occur in almost every zzso but may differ considerably with respect to zzso zzso We here isolated the cloned broad zzso specificity zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso coli by classical zzso The zzso was zzso characterized and amongst other aspects it was confirmed that it is mostly active with zzso zzso and zzso but merely zzso active with zzso whereas the zzso zzso of the same zzso studied in comparison acts on zzso zzso zzso sequencing the zzso end of zzso revealed processing of the zzso with a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that in both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso activity was almost exclusively present in the zzso a feature so far unknown for any zzso acid zzso An zzso carrying a zzso zzso was made and this was demonstrated to zzso even in an zzso coli zzso devoid of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso These data indicate that zzso is zzso as a zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso zzso depends on the zzso system and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso As further experiments zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso
