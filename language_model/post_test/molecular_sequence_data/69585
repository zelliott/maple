A zzso zzso gene was isolated from the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of promoter and coding regions of the gene revealed that it was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso translated sequence of the gene with a partial zzso acid sequence of the adult zzso chain from zzso zzso provided evidence that the gene was not expressed in adult zzso In addition, Northern analysis of zzso isolated from an zzso zzso young, and adult bone zzso indicated that the gene was expressed predominantly in embryonic zzso and that there was a significant reduction in the expression of the gene within a day of zzso These results provide strong support for the hypothesis of zzso and Goodman zzso zzso zzso & Goodman, zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso that an embryonic zzso zzso gene existed prior to the divergence of the zzso and zzso lineages and that this gene was already differentiated with respect to its promoter regions and zzso zzso The observation that zzso zzso was present at least until day 4 zzso suggests that the zzso chain may play some role in influencing the zzso properties of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
