The zzso reporter gene system was used to zzso the zzso and zzso induced promoter activity of the human zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso Based on the results from clones of zzso zzso both zzso and induced reporter gene activity fell to zzso levels between zzso containing 79 zzso zzso and 41 zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The zzso zzso was shifted in zzso mobility zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso induced and zzso cells while the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso These data suggest that the 38 zzso region between these zzso is necessary for the zzso activity of the zzso gene and is involved in specifically binding zzso factors from the zzso of induced and zzso zzso Several potential zzso factor binding sites in this region were zzso
