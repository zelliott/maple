Growth hormone release is under tight control by two zzso zzso growth zzso hormone and zzso In addition, synthetic growth hormone zzso have also been shown to regulate growth hormone release through the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso suggesting the existence of an additional zzso regulator for growth hormone zzso To understand the zzso role of the zzso in more detail, we mapped the expression of zzso for the zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso using rat and human zzso In the rat brain, the major signals were detected in multiple zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso zzso signals were also observed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Other brain areas that displayed localized and discrete signals for the zzso include the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso area, and zzso and median zzso zzso In resemblance to the results from rat brain, zzso protection zzso using human zzso revealed specific signals in zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, a weak signal was noted in the zzso The demonstration of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso is consistent with its role in regulating growth hormone zzso The expression of the zzso in other central and peripheral regions may zzso its involvement in additional as yet undefined zzso zzso
