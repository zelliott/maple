We have determined the effects on zzso of sulfur substitution of the zzso zzso in the zzso bond at the zzso zzso site of a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso pure zzso and zzso zzso zzso were produced by zzso of a chemically zzso modified zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso When these modified zzso zzso were tested for in zzso zzso activity in a zzso cell nuclear extract system, the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was not spliced while the zzso zzso zzso spliced zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso reaction of the zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso with a zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso was zzso during the zzso reaction to the zzso zzso a finding previously obtained for a Group I zzso zzso This inversion of zzso is consistent with a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso The lack of zzso of the zzso modified zzso also suggests that the zzso oxygen at the zzso zzso site is involved in a critical chemical contact in the zzso zzso Additionally, we have found that the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is inactive on branches containing an zzso zzso
