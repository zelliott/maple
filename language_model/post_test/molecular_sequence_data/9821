zzso zzso prepared from zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso were studied with respect to their abilities to specifically bind zzso zzso The zzso point zzso had previously been found to be associated with zzso deafness induced by zzso It is shown here that the zzso zzso analog zzso binds zzso with high zzso while the zzso construct does not bind zzso at zzso zzso zzso in a zzso bacterial zzso construct show the opposite zzso zzso zzso zzso constitutes the functional target for zzso zzso While the zzso zzso zzso decoding region construct binds zzso zzso with binding affinities in the zzso range, the zzso is unable to specifically bind zzso These results demonstrate the importance of a specific zzso base pair in zzso binding in both the human and the bacterial zzso zzso These studies also provide quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that the zzso point zzso in human zzso zzso zzso causes zzso induced zzso
