zzso zzso zzso two controlled zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso species that contain these compounds is a criminal zzso in North zzso Some related species that are zzso similar, do not contain the controlled zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso to the species level is critical in determining if a mushroom is zzso We investigate a zzso approach for the identification of species that contain the psychoactive zzso We analyzed 35 North American specimens representing seven different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We amplified and zzso the internal transcribed zzso region of the zzso zzso and a zzso portion of the nuclear large zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso locus sequence data was highly variable and produced a zzso resolution that was not consistent with zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso data clustered zzso from the same species and separated zzso containing and zzso containing zzso into distinct zzso With this information, we propose an approach that combines the specificity of zzso detection and the resolving power of zzso analysis to efficiently and zzso identify zzso zzso specimens for legal zzso
