We have identified and characterized a 55 zzso nuclear protein zzso to as zzso from human breast tumors and zzso human zzso breast cell line, using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso by zzso binding zzso in zzso of 63 human breast tumors permitted zzso of these tumors into four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear protein zzso expression in these tumors, as determined from Western zzso zzso showed a statistically significant association zzso zzso zzso with tumor hormonal zzso Review of the zzso characteristics of tumors analyzed suggested that lack of zzso expression was significantly associated with mean tumor size zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not associated with tumor stage, grade, or zzso To further study this zzso we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso to zzso The complete predicted open reading frame encodes a protein with zzso zzso acids and a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited unique regions rich in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from zzso cells and zzso human breast tumors showed a zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested the presence of a single copy of this zzso zzso zzso using fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso located zzso gene to the X zzso region zzso The extensive zzso between zzso and zzso binding proteins suggested that zzso may be involved in zzso zzso The strong association observed between expression of zzso tumor hormonal zzso mean tumor size, mean zzso and mean zzso content suggests that loss of zzso expression may be related to events involved in hormone zzso tumor zzso and zzso tumor cell growth and zzso
