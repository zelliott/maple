zzso of the zzso machinery of the cell, including zzso zzso are generally considered to be clear examples of zzso genes with a zzso ubiquitous distribution of zzso zzso during embryonic zzso Here we present data based upon in zzso zzso experiments as well as zzso protection zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso protein gene zzso is zzso expressed in a complex and zzso distinct pattern during zzso We observed dramatically high levels of expression in some zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and virtually no expression in other zzso such as the cement zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso protein genes zzso zzso and zzso display expression patterns nearly identical to zzso Our data is consistent with a model of zzso gene expression according to which zzso protein genes (or perhaps a subset of zzso protein zzso may be expressed at low levels in all zzso but are abundantly expressed in other cell types reflecting a dynamic and complex pattern of zzso control throughout embryonic zzso
