To study the role of zzso growth factor 8 zzso in human development and zzso we have isolated and characterized its zzso The gene spans zzso zzso and is comprised of five zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction, we were able to show that zzso is expressed in two of the seven human zzso zzso cell lines tested and in only one of nine breast zzso In contrast, both of the two normal breast zzso tested express zzso zzso was previously shown to be present in adult zzso and zzso Surprisingly, only one of the seven zzso zzso and one of 12 zzso zzso express zzso whereas all three kidney zzso tested express zzso We further showed that fetal brain and lung express zzso whereas fetal zzso and liver do zzso Finally, we showed that a zzso cell line, zzso can be induced to express zzso zzso by fetal bovine zzso
