A novel and multiple zzso strain zzso zzso zzso with a high zzso resistance level zzso was zzso To understand the molecular basis for the high zinc resistance, whole zzso sequencing was performed and revealed a large number of genes zzso putative zzso resistance zzso mobile genetic elements zzso and horizontal gene transfer zzso events that may have occurred to adapt to a zzso zzso In particular, 9 putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso cell division protein zzso zzso protein complexes were zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the four zzso genes were all induced by zzso while zzso genes were either zzso or zzso by zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulator and a zzso zzso was studied in zzso The zzso deletion strain zzso displayed intermediate resistance to zzso zzso and accumulated more zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso indicated that zzso responded to zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being the best zzso Gene zzso analysis indicated that zzso was a regulator for zzso of zzso while other putative zzso regulators may also regulate the zzso expression of zzso
