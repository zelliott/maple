The zzso acid sequence of Egyptian goose zzso zzso from zzso and its zzso properties were zzso The established sequence had the highest similarity to wood duck zzso zzso with five zzso acid zzso and had zzso zzso difference from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found at zzso E and F of the active site when compared with zzso The experimental zzso characteristics of zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed higher production of zzso and lower production of zzso when compared with zzso The zzso ability of zzso zzso in zzso was also found to be weaker than in zzso An analysis of the zzso reactions of five zzso in respect of positions 34, 37 and 71 in zzso indicated the zzso characteristics of zzso to be caused by the combination of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso A computer simulation of the zzso reaction suggested that the zzso characteristics of zzso resulted from the difference in the binding free energy for zzso A, B, E and F and the rate constant of zzso between zzso and zzso
