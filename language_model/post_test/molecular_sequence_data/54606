A diverse class of zzso proteins called zzso play important roles in shrimp innate zzso A novel zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned from the zzso of banana shrimp zzso zzso by means of zzso and zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso consists of zzso zzso with one zzso zzso open reading frame, zzso zzso zzso zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence contains a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso recognition zzso zzso and zzso that share only zzso identity with each zzso The first zzso comprises a zzso motif with specificity for binding zzso and a single zzso binding site, while the second zzso consists of an zzso motif for a zzso binding zzso zzso had a close evolutionary relationship to other zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso results showed that transcripts of zzso were detected only in the zzso none was found in other zzso After challenging either whole shrimp or zzso tissue fragments with zzso the expression of zzso was zzso This indicates that zzso is zzso and may be involved in a shrimp immune response to recognize potential bacterial zzso
