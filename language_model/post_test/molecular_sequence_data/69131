We present the first isolation of the terminal DNA of an intact zzso zzso It differs from those isolated from other zzso by the lack of short tandem repeats at the zzso The terminal zzso zzso is composed of four tandem elements derived from two families of zzso terminal repeat zzso and is subject to slow terminal zzso One of these zzso families, zzso zzso zzso is described for the first time zzso The other element, zzso has previously been shown to transpose to broken zzso zzso Our results provide key evidence that these elements also transpose to natural zzso zzso We propose that the zzso repetitive DNA is maintained by zzso expansions, including terminal zzso of specialized zzso which serve to balance terminal zzso
