Several genes zzso proteins critical to the zzso zzso such as the brain type II sodium channel zzso are expressed to high levels only in zzso This cell specificity is due, in part, to long-term repression in zzso cells zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso a newly identified human zzso functions as a zzso for zzso A single zinc finger motif in zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso of the motif that disrupt binding also abrogate zzso When fused to a zzso zzso domain, zzso functions as a zzso zzso is present in cell lines that express zzso and the proteins are found in the same zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso a structural feature of the nuclear zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso human receptors zzso zzso that mediate zzso repression by steroid hormone zzso Together, zzso and zzso mediate repression of the type II sodium channel promoter in zzso cells, and the zzso complex may mediate long-term repression essential to maintenance of cell zzso
