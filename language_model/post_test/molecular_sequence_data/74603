zzso bacteria have come to be zzso as important components of zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso a range of other inherited bacteria are known to act either as zzso zzso or as secondary zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso is relatively well established, the current knowledge of other inherited bacteria is much zzso Here, we tested 136 zzso species for a range of inherited bacteria known to demonstrate zzso zzso sampling each species more zzso than in past zzso 

The inclusion of inherited bacteria other than zzso increased the number of infections recorded in our sample from 33 to 57, and the proportion of species infected from zzso to zzso Thus, whilst zzso remained the dominant inherited zzso it alone was responsible for around half of all inherited infections of the bacteria zzso with members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each occurring in zzso to zzso of all zzso The observation that infection was sometimes rare within host zzso and that there was variation in presence of zzso between populations indicates that our survey will itself underscore zzso 

This extensive survey demonstrates that at least a third of zzso species are infected by a diverse zzso of zzso inherited bacteria that are likely to strongly influence their zzso biology, and indicates an urgent need to establish the nature of the interaction between zzso bacteria and their zzso
