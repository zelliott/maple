The zzso position of an zzso strain zzso isolated from a clinical human source was determined using a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on almost complete zzso zzso sequences showed that this zzso consistently formed a distinct line with the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and shared moderately low zzso zzso similarity zzso zzso with other zzso The zzso was also found to have chemical and zzso properties typical of members of the zzso zzso A range of zzso characteristics readily distinguished this strain from representatives of all species of zzso with zzso published zzso On the basis of these data, a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
