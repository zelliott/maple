A retrospective analysis of DNA restriction zzso length zzso zzso of zzso disease zzso virus zzso from England and Wales over a 22-year period revealed considerable zzso of zzso restriction zzso sites, both in number and zzso The appearance of a new DNA zzso in 1981 coincided with a marked increase in the number of new outbreaks of zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso method was developed to discriminate between the established strains and the new zzso By relating these results to pig movement records it was possible to trace the spread of the new type virus which was isolated from zzso zzso of the new outbreaks of zzso in England and Wales in zzso The study suggested that airborne spread of up to 17 zzso was the most likely route of transmission in many of the new type zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be a useful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of zzso zzso virus in zzso
