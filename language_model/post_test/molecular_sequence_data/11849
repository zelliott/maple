zzso human cells in zzso zzso zzso the zzso pool of reduced zzso zzso and increases the concentration of zzso free zzso We found that zzso zzso stress reduced the ability of zzso to bind its consensus recognition sequence and to activate zzso of a zzso reporter zzso Nevertheless, zzso treatment induced expression of zzso but not zzso zzso The fact that zzso a precursor of zzso that blocks zzso stress, prevented zzso induction by zzso suggests that zzso induction probably was a consequence of the ability of zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, both of which lack functional zzso zzso zzso treatment did not produce an increase in zzso protein zzso C, but zzso a zzso protein zzso was zzso in a manner consistent with zzso zzso zzso treatment also produced a zzso delay in cell cycle zzso which at low zzso zzso zzso consisted of a zzso arrest and at higher zzso (1 zzso also involved zzso and S phase zzso Our results indicate that zzso stress zzso zzso expression and arrests cell cycle progression through a mechanism that is independent of zzso This mechanism may provide for cell cycle checkpoint control under conditions that zzso zzso
