Despite mounting genetic evidence implicating a recent origin of modern humans, the zzso of early migratory zzso episodes remains zzso zzso distribution of zzso may show traces of ancestral zzso However, such evolutionary signatures can be erased easily by zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso 21 region near the zzso zzso which contains nine sites frequently zzso in human zzso has been zzso It is unaffected by zzso and zzso zzso and thus reflects only migratory history, genetic zzso and possibly zzso zzso distribution of contemporary zzso implies distinctive prehistoric human zzso one to zzso one to Asia and subsequently to America, and a third one predominantly to zzso The findings with zzso 21 are confirmed by independent evidence from a Y zzso zzso zzso of this type will help to decipher the evolutionary history of modern zzso
