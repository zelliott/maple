We recently identified Pam (for protein associated with zzso as a binding partner for the zzso sclerosis complex zzso protein zzso in zzso The highly zzso Pam zzso in zzso and zzso zzso are zzso proteins that regulate synaptic zzso The Pam gene contains 83 zzso and encodes a zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 510 zzso In a previous study, we demonstrated that Pam is expressed as two forms, approximately 450 zzso in rat embryonic and a approximately 350 zzso in rat adult zzso Here we have extended that work to show the approximately 450 zzso form is expressed in rat embryonic zzso heart, and lung and in rat cell lines, and the approximately 350 zzso form is expressed in adult rat zzso as well as in human and mouse brain and human and mouse cell zzso To understand the size difference, we investigated alternative zzso of Pam in brain and detected six zzso in the zzso region resulting from zzso of zzso 53, and three new zzso zzso 56, and zzso We also demonstrate that the presence of zzso zzso in Pam significantly enhances binding to zzso suggesting functional importance of this alternative zzso The presence of Pam in many cellular zzso its spliced zzso as well as its multiple binding partners, including zzso make it a complex, yet intriguing protein in the nervous zzso
