We investigated the structure and zzso pattern of expression of two genes clustered at the zzso zzso located at zzso Data obtained from zzso and zzso sequencing and from a combination of zzso mapping and primer extension experiments indicated a very unusual organization of this zzso which appeared to be composed of two partially overlapping zzso designated zzso and zzso These two genes were found to be transcribed in the same zzso zzso zzso one minor and two major zzso The zzso end of the zzso zzso mapped within the 3' untranslated region of the zzso transcribed zzso The overlapping region was 118 bases zzso zzso observed between these two genes with respect to both zzso sequence and zzso position strongly suggested that this locus originated from the zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso However, each of the resulting genes has acquired its own specificity of expression linked to sex zzso The zzso transcript was detected only in zzso and its expression at the adult stage was restricted to germ line zzso The zzso gene displayed a much more complex zzso one of the major zzso was found in both sexes and at all zzso whereas the two other zzso transcripts were expressed only in zzso
