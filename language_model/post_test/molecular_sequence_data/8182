The zzso zzso proteins are implicated as zzso in zzso signal zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso protein zzso has been determined in solution in the zzso state by zzso zzso and a zzso strategy that incorporates a systematic zzso zzso This structure reveals a zzso zzso fold that is unique among zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso contacts from several highly zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso fold identified for zzso will serve as a structural paradigm for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
