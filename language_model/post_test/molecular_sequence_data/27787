The gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The gene occurs as a single copy within the zzso and encodes an zzso zzso approximately 300 zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a strong similarity to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in terms of overall secondary structure, while the primary sequence is zzso to a lesser zzso All zzso zzso molecules possess a specific structural domain which is highly zzso in terms of both primary sequence and secondary structure, possibly representing a functional site of the zzso Conservation of the zzso zzso zzso suggests that it is the descendant of a zzso structure present before the divergence of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is flanked both zzso and 3' by regions of extremely A + zzso zzso The zzso region contains several potential promoter sequences for zzso zzso zzso One such sequence occurs as three direct repeats and bears a strong similarity to sequences found upstream of other zzso zzso The zzso region contains a strong signal for the termination of zzso
