An zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso from the zzso B zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified previously from the genetic fusion of this sequence to the B zzso of zzso zzso The resulting zzso protein was used to raise zzso in zzso This zzso was shown to recognize the native zzso zzso and to inhibit its zzso The zzso inhibited the synthesis of zzso zzso by approximately zzso and the synthesis of zzso zzso by greater than zzso The zzso was shown to partially inhibit zzso activity as zzso The ability of this zzso zzso to inhibit several zzso from zzso zzso suggests that these zzso share an zzso related to zzso zzso
