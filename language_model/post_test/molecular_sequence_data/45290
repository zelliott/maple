zzso zzso is a model plant for studying gene function using a knockout zzso To establish a zzso database for zzso zzso we resolved over 1,500 soluble proteins from zzso and zzso zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso and obtained zzso mass fingerprints zzso by zzso laser zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using expressed sequence tags zzso we were able to predict the identities of 90 protein zzso Most of these were related to energy or primary zzso Comparative zzso analysis was used to identify proteins specific for each of the tissue zzso One of these was a zzso zzso zzso protein that was highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso was induced in both the zzso and zzso following culture on solid media and in response to various zzso stresses such as copper, cadmium, cold, zzso acid, and zzso We suggest that zzso is not only involved in metal binding and detoxification, but also in many biological aspects as a metal zzso or a protein with additional zzso
