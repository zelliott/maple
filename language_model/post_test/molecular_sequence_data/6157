A human case of infection by zzso zzso has recently been zzso Some zzso anomalies of the muscle larvae, however, raise the possibility of an incorrect zzso zzso A molecular zzso approach has therefore been applied for the identification of the zzso Random amplified zzso zzso were obtained from a single zzso extracted from a muscle biopsy of the suspected case of zzso zzso infection, and compared with those derived from 27 reference strains of zzso zzso Nearly identical amplification patterns were obtained from the suspected zzso and from reference strains of zzso zzso thus supporting the original zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso and Western blots carried out on zzso and zzso zzso provided further zzso
