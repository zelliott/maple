The S zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli comprises nine genes situated on a stretch of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here the zzso sequence of the genes zzso B and zzso C situated zzso to the main structural gene zzso is zzso zzso zzso show that the two genes are transcribed in opposite zzso The isolation of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene zzso the construction of zzso gene zzso and subsequent zzso studies indicated that the genes zzso B and zzso C play a role in regulation of the zzso zzso In addition the zzso sequence of the genes zzso D, zzso E and zzso F situated between the genes zzso A and zzso G responsible for S zzso zzso were zzso It is suggested that these genes are involved in transport and assembly of zzso zzso Thus the entire genetic organization of the zzso zzso is presented and compared with the gene clusters coding for P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and type I zzso zzso The evolutionary relationship of zzso zzso zzso is zzso
