zzso II is a major target of the protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in zzso All major zzso zzso sites in the zzso zzso are found in the zzso zzso The zzso sites are generally clustered such that there is more than one modified zzso or zzso within a short zzso zzso of the predicted zzso sites have confirmed that five of the eight predicted sites are targeted in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso to zzso neutral zzso provokes at most a zzso increase in zzso doubling zzso zzso of the zzso leaves the zzso zzso active, but slightly lengthens the doubling time during zzso growth and zzso progress through zzso Since this could reflect the loss of interaction with an important zzso we have examined whether the zzso domain of the zzso zzso mediates interaction with the regulatory beta zzso of zzso zzso which was previously reported to bind zzso zzso We find that point zzso of the zzso sites does not abrogate the interaction with a small region of zzso zzso while zzso at zzso or zzso zzso The site of interaction within zzso zzso does not coincide with the highly zzso charged zzso binding zzso
