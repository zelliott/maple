zzso in the human zzso of the patched gene are associated with the zzso (and cancer zzso condition zzso zzso Cell Carcinoma zzso zzso as well as with sporadic zzso cell zzso Most zzso that have been identified in the zzso of zzso patients are zzso or zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso rarely zzso We show that a zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso acts as a dominant negative when zzso in zzso in zzso zzso expression of a zzso patched zzso carrying the analogous zzso to zzso causes zzso zzso of zzso target genes and zzso membrane zzso of zzso The zzso zzso behaves in a manner similar, except in its zzso distribution, to a zzso zzso that has been zzso previously as a zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso identical to the zzso zzso but the zzso truncated zzso zzso is zzso predominantly to the plasma zzso This finding suggests that zzso function can be zzso by interruption of different aspects of zzso protein zzso Another zzso at the same zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso activity, suggesting that simple removal of the zzso at zzso is not sufficient to impart zzso zzso
