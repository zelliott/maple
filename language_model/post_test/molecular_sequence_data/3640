The role of the zzso zzso salt bridge that is zzso zzso in all known zzso zzso zzso except those of animal zzso zzso zzso and plant zzso zzso zzso origins, was evaluated in the zzso coli zzso Two zzso cycles, to zzso and the charge reversed zzso were characterized with the context dependence zzso and impact zzso zzso previously defined for functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso fixed are generally more deleterious than the converse zzso of zzso with zzso zzso showing that buried negative charges have greater effects than buried positive charges in this zzso Replacement of the charged zzso with the zzso neutral pair introduces relatively small effects on the kinetic zzso The differential sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to salt bridge zzso replacements is shown by a zzso energy relationship, in which the zzso of the latter second order rate zzso are generally decreased by a factor of two more than are those of the zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are 133 and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso respectively, but their relative order is reversed in the more severely compromised zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso A zzso zzso illustrates apparent forced zzso of groups of zzso acids that accompany the naturally occurring salt bridge replacements in the zzso and zzso zzso The more deeply rooted tree indicates that the zzso zzso was the ancestral zzso
