A method for DNA sequencing that combines limited chemical degradation of zzso DNA with zzso analysis using an automatic zzso is zzso The DNA sequence is determined in a single zzso lane by monitoring the zzso of bands representing products of zzso at the four bases obtained by zzso in hot zzso zzso zzso followed by treatment with hot zzso An application of the method for the detection of point zzso is zzso
