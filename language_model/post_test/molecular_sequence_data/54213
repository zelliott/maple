zzso zzso near or within zzso gene is often associated with zzso male zzso zzso Its influence on the expression of the zzso gene was proposed as one of the possible causes of zzso In sugar beet zzso zzso whose downstream zzso region contains zzso an apparently zzso open reading frame zzso was deleted in zzso zzso In our previous study, normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be zzso The present study was conducted to determine whether the deletion affected gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso of zzso and zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, the zzso and 3' zzso of the zzso and the zzso transcripts were zzso The results suggested that the zzso transcripts were the zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso untranslated region zzso and zzso 3' zzso whereas no functional zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the 3' zzso of the zzso transcripts was reduced to zzso zzso However, no difference in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso editing was detected by protein gel zzso analysis and zzso zzso Although the deleted region zzso the zzso that was zzso no influence on the pattern and frequency of zzso editing of genuine zzso was zzso The results eliminated zzso as a candidate for the zzso zzso making zzso a unique zzso fused with zzso zzso the sole zzso region in sugar zzso
