The effect of gel pore size on the anomalous mobility of certain curved DNA restriction fragments in zzso gels was studied by comparing the zzso zzso of normal and anomalous fragments in gels of varying composition but constant zzso zzso zzso weight ladders were prepared from two 147 base pair zzso rich restriction fragments, called zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso of the two fragments increasingly zzso with increasing molecular zzso The anomalous mobility of zzso zzso was essentially independent of gel pore size, regardless of whether the pore size was varied by increasing the zzso concentration at constant zzso concentration or by increasing the zzso concentration at constant zzso zzso The anomalous mobility of higher zzso of zzso zzso decreased with increasing gel pore size when the pore size was varied by changing the gel zzso However, when the gel pore size was changed by varying the zzso concentration at constant zzso zzso the anomalous mobility of higher zzso of zzso zzso went through a maximum and then decreased as the pore size was zzso zzso zzso with high molecular weight linear zzso had no effect on the anomalous mobility of the zzso zzso zzso even though the apparent absolute zzso of all fragments increased zzso Only by incorporating charged zzso into the gel zzso or by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso could the difference in mobility between the zzso and zzso zzso ladders be substantially reduced or zzso Similar results were observed with a molecular weight zzso containing 78 base pair repeats of the zzso locus of zzso zzso These results suggest that pore size alone is not responsible for the zzso slow migration of curved DNA molecules in zzso zzso
