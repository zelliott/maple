The core zzso protein of zzso C virus zzso appears to be a zzso protein that is involved in many viral and cellular zzso Although its effects on host cells have been extensively discussed in the literature, little is known about its main function, the assembly and packaging of the viral zzso We have studied the in zzso assembly of several deleted versions of zzso zzso C protein expressed in zzso zzso We demonstrated that the 75 zzso zzso of the C protein were sufficient to assemble and generate zzso particles zzso in zzso However, homogeneous particles of regular size and shape were observed only when zzso were produced from at least the first 79 zzso zzso acids of the C zzso This small protein unit fused to the zzso zzso domain also generated zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso half of the C protein is important for formation of zzso zzso between the zzso C protein and C proteins of other members of the zzso are zzso
