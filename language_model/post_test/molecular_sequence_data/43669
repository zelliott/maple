In order to improve our understanding of the zzso zzso reaction zzso by zzso coli DNA zzso I, we have constructed expression plasmids and developed zzso methods for whole DNA zzso I and its zzso zzso domain that allow the production of large quantities of highly zzso material suitable for zzso and other zzso We have studied the zzso properties of the zzso zzso both as an isolated domain and in the context of the whole zzso using a variety of model zzso to explore the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is known to be a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso displaced strand at the junction between zzso and duplex zzso Since the isolated domain shows the same structure specificity as the whole zzso the correct geometry of zzso binding is achieved without the assistance of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso reaction has a strict requirement for a free zzso end on the displaced zzso however, the upstream template and primer strands are zzso zzso zzso of the ten zzso zzso that are highly zzso among bacterial and zzso zzso zzso indicates that nine of them are important in the zzso This finding is discussed in relation to structural and zzso data for related zzso zzso
