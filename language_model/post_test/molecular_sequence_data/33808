The cultivated Pacific oyster zzso zzso has suffered for decades large scale summer mortality phenomenon resulting from the interaction between the environment zzso the oyster zzso and/or genetic status and the presence of zzso zzso including zzso zzso To obtain a general picture of the molecular mechanisms implicated in zzso zzso immune responsiveness to circumvent zzso infections, we have developed the first deep sequencing study of the zzso of zzso the zzso zzso Using Digital Gene zzso zzso we generated a transcript catalog of zzso genes from oysters surviving infection with virulent zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to an zzso one, zzso zzso zzso zzso For that an original experimental infection protocol was developed in which only animals that were able to survive infections were considered for the zzso zzso We report the identification of cellular and immune functions that characterize the oyster capability to survive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso highlight genes related to signal zzso of immune response, cell zzso and communication as well as cellular processes and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell trafficking and zzso but also zzso and zzso zzso In addition, quantitative zzso analysis reveals the first identification of zzso signatures in oyster gene regulation, which opens the way for in depth molecular studies of zzso interaction and zzso This work is a prerequisite for the identification of those zzso traits controlling oyster capacity to survive a zzso infection and, zzso for a better understanding of the phenomenon of summer zzso
