The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso comprises three genes concerned with the triggering of spore zzso by zzso and its zzso The expression of this zzso has been characterized using zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso promoter is switched on zzso hours after the initiation of zzso in parallel with zzso zzso A high proportion of the zzso zzso detected in zzso cells is found in the mature zzso the zzso promoter is therefore active in the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter is not expressed in zzso zzso or zzso B, E and G zzso backgrounds, but is expressed in zzso and D and in zzso and V zzso The in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso has been mapped by primer extension zzso sequences upstream from this zzso show significant zzso with recognition sequences for zzso zzso containing zzso G zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was transcribed in zzso by E zzso G with a zzso identical to that used in zzso and expression of the zzso zzso was rapidly induced in zzso cells by induction of zzso G zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso is an additional member of the zzso G zzso which includes a number of genes expressed in parallel only in the zzso compartment of zzso zzso zzso zzso
