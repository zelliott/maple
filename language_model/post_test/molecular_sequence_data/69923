We have used an zzso zzso approach to target the zzso alpha gene in zzso embryonic stem zzso 105 zzso located zzso zzso upstream of a zzso zzso marker in zzso 3 were deleted and replaced with an engineered Not I site, that served to zzso the zzso The 105 zzso deletion served as a primer zzso site in a zzso chain reaction zzso designed to detect the gap repair associated with zzso zzso Both target conversion and zzso zzso events were obtained zzso zzso zzso that had inserted the entire targeting zzso were taken into zzso zzso zzso to select against a zzso zzso zzso marker zzso the zzso zzso sequences and thus for cells that had excised the zzso and the zzso marker by zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional selection in zzso reduced the number of drug-resistant colonies at least zzso Thus, the zzso marker zzso the zzso sequences allows for a more specific selection of the desired zzso zzso event in tissue zzso This modified zzso and zzso strategy represents a novel approach for zzso design and the use of the zzso chain reaction to detect zzso It may be particularly useful for targeting genes that display a low frequency of zzso zzso zzso line transmission of the zzso zzso alpha zzso is also zzso
