In order to improve our understanding of the role of the zzso zzso gene in error avoidance in zzso DNA, two zzso zzso were constructed, which zzso proteins with zzso acid zzso in an zzso domain that is highly zzso among zzso zzso Here, we report that moderate zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso in strains which also carry the zzso zzso zzso slightly increases the frequency of zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso the frequency of zzso within a zzso tract present in zzso DNA zzso This result indicates that the zzso zzso zzso a dominant zzso zzso zzso and strongly suggests that the zzso domain plays a crucial role in the in zzso function of zzso Interestingly, we have found that zzso of zzso zzso has opposite effects on the stability of zzso zzso zzso tracts present in zzso excess of zzso slightly increases the stability of zzso zzso whereas the stability of zzso tracts is dramatically zzso We show that although zzso of zzso or zzso also results in a marked overall increase in the frequency of zzso in zzso zzso the spectrum of zzso differs from that found in cells zzso zzso large deletions predominate in the latter case, while zzso deletions are generated in cells that zzso the zzso zzso This result strongly suggests that the zzso in the zzso binding domain change the specificity of the protein with respect to the recognition of potentially zzso structures in zzso
