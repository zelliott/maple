We have previously shown that three high density zzso zzso proteins in liver, of 90, 110 and 180 zzso are structurally zzso In this study, these proteins are identified as zzso This protein is known to occur as a zzso and has a dual zzso zzso it is both an zzso zzso resident zzso where it is supposed to act as a zzso and a plasma membrane zzso whose significance is zzso In zzso studies the plasma membrane zzso of the zzso form was zzso The zzso protein was abundantly present at the zzso of the zzso zzso as well as at the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso protein is scarcely present at the zzso membrane of the zzso but could be demonstrated in coated pits, suggesting involvement in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was virtually zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso However, the expressed protein was exclusively localized in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in which the zzso zzso sequence had been deleted, resulted in plasma membrane localized expression of zzso but only in an extremely low percentage of zzso In order to evaluate the zzso capacities of this zzso zzso zzso cells were generated, using several cell zzso It appeared to be difficult to obtain a prolonged high level expression of zzso In these cases, however, a marked increase of zzso activity compared with the control cells could be zzso
