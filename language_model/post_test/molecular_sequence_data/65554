The thermodynamics of proteins designed on three common folds zzso zzso inhibitor 2 zzso and protein zzso is studied with a simplified zzso model and compared with the thermodynamics of proteins designed on zzso zzso The model allows to design sequences to fold within a zzso ranging from zzso to zzso A from the zzso native zzso and to study properties that are hard to be measured zzso It is found that the zzso state of all of them is not random but is, to different zzso partially zzso The degree of structure is more abundant for zzso and protein G, giving rise to a weaker stability but a more efficient folding zzso than zzso and, even more, than the zzso zzso zzso the features of the unfolded state seem to be as important in the determination of the zzso properties of these proteins as the features of the native zzso
