A large scale zzso zzso zzso from the African malaria zzso zzso zzso was used to monitor gene expression in zzso resistant and susceptible strains of the Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at slightly reduced stringency yielded approximately zzso significant zzso zzso putative genes were zzso transcribed between the zzso zzso and the susceptible zzso zzso The expression profiles of selected transcripts were verified by real-time zzso A gene zzso involved in the zzso of the adult zzso showed the most striking zzso in zzso A more specialized zzso containing 231 zzso zzso genes zzso involved in zzso zzso was used to further zzso classical zzso resistance zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso and a zzso zzso were zzso in the resistant strain, while two zzso were zzso
