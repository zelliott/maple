zzso clones zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso have been investigated by differential screening of zzso libraries of zzso cells and corpus zzso A clone corresponding to zzso zzso expressed in the functional stage of corpus zzso was found to zzso a protein similar to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso which had been originally identified in male zzso zzso The expression was detected widely in the functional zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso but the signal was most prominent in the zzso cells surrounding blood zzso In contrast, despite the structural similarity in their products, the expression of this newly identified gene was not detected in zzso zzso suggesting that these structurally related proteins play different roles in zzso zzso zzso
