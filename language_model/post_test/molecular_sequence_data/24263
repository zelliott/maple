zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and regulate the zzso of zzso genes critical for the immune zzso The activity of zzso proteins is tightly regulated by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is required for zzso nuclear zzso Current zzso drugs such as zzso A and zzso block zzso activity thus zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso of zzso in cells outside of the immune system may contribute to the zzso associated with zzso A zzso In a search for safer zzso drugs, we identified a series of zzso zzso zzso derivatives that block zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso compounds block the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso as determined by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso compounds block zzso movement of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso was selective because the zzso compounds did not affect the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of intact T cells with the zzso compounds prior to calcium zzso zzso of zzso caused zzso to remain in a highly zzso zzso However, the zzso compounds did not directly inhibit the zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso nor did the drugs block the zzso of other zzso zzso including the type II regulatory zzso of protein zzso A and the zzso factor zzso The data suggest that the zzso compounds cause zzso to be maintained in the zzso in a zzso state and block the nuclear import of zzso and, zzso zzso zzso gene zzso by a mechanism other than direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso described zzso will be useful in better defining the cellular regulation of zzso zzso and may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso disease and transplant zzso
