The zzso cassette (ABC) zzso are one of the largest zzso zzso families of zzso They are characterized by the presence of zzso zzso zzso which are highly zzso among zzso In the present study, we used human and zzso ABC zzso and zzso consensus motifs to screen the zzso zzso zzso predicted proteins zzso We identified 24 ABC open reading frames zzso whose deduced zzso acid sequences exhibited all the typical zzso features of the ABC family zzso Fifteen of them clustered into five of the seven families of human ABC zzso six zzso zzso peptides and zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and drug zzso one zzso zzso L zzso zzso zzso resistance and translation zzso one zzso zzso resistance and regulation of gene zzso and five zzso zzso export and zzso The nine other zzso were represented by four zzso zzso zzso four zzso zzso maintenance of zzso and one member of unclear origin, whose closest zzso was the zzso zzso protein zzso export zzso A notable feature of the zzso ABC zzso seems to be the absence of genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of ABC genes in zzso and zzso stages revealed the presence of ABC transcripts for all genes zzso Further research on the implication of these ABC proteins will increase our knowledge of the basic biology of zzso and provide the opportunity to identify novel therapeutic zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of ABC zzso in zzso zzso
