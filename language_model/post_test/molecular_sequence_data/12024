Previously we have identified an zzso zzso zzso core sequence zzso from the 19,000 zzso protein of zzso zzso which is recognized in the context of multiple zzso I-A zzso In this study, the role of zzso zzso this zzso zzso core was zzso using a series of 20 zzso analogue peptides in which the native zzso zzso were progressively replaced with zzso zzso peptides were tested for their capacity to stimulate a zzso 19,000 zzso zzso zzso line, revealing that all but one zzso zzso zzso could be replaced collectively by zzso without significant loss of zzso zzso However, clear zzso differences in the requirement for zzso zzso were demonstrated with zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso were much more stringent in their requirement for zzso zzso than were zzso zzso All zzso peptides bound zzso zzso with affinities similar to the native zzso zzso In contrast, significantly reduced binding to zzso was observed with several analogue zzso although without a clear relationship to the degree of zzso Furthermore, in zzso mice, neither zzso nor zzso with the native zzso showed a clear inverse relationship with respect to the degree of zzso zzso The results presented in this paper indicate that zzso zzso can influence zzso specificity and that these effects may be controlled by major zzso complex zzso zzso
