zzso zzso of zzso G zzso zzso gene transcripts were found to be zzso in the peripheral blood B cells of a patient initially diagnosed with common variable zzso who later developed raised zzso whereas no zzso rearranged transcripts were found in the cells of seven healthy control zzso All the patient's zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were functional, suggesting that either zzso zzso were being selectively zzso to zzso or that zzso editing was rendering genes zzso after zzso The functional zzso sequences showed a normal rate of zzso zzso while zzso sequences contained few zzso zzso suggesting that most came from cells that had no functional gene and therefore were not receiving signals for zzso However, zzso of peripheral blood zzso was not zzso No defects have been found in any of the genes currently known to be responsible for zzso syndrome but the zzso fits best to type zzso
