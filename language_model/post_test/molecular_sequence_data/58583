Four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to exist on the Atlantic island of zzso We have obtained DNA sequences for 61 individuals from these zzso across the island for a 200 zzso long zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, a restriction site zzso in the nuclear zzso zzso sequence was identified and screened in a sample of these individuals using the zzso zzso The results were zzso using approaches which allow zzso to be made about the population genetic structure and the zzso zzso of these closely related zzso The zzso zzso distribution and the estimates of sequence divergence revealed the presence of two ancient zzso lineages which coincide with the zzso volcanic evolution of the zzso The zzso zzso was found to be diagnostic of these two zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso We argue that this is possibly the result of rapid zzso change, produced by selection in different zzso which has been recently superimposed on an older zzso DNA zzso
