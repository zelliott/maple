Over the past few years, the genetic zzso available for use with zzso zzso zzso has expanded zzso Here a further advance is presented and demonstrated, an zzso expression system that allows expression of genes from a stable, unmarked zzso zzso This system has been used to better understand the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Previously, it has not been possible to generate zzso zzso lacking either zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso An unmarked strain was generated that expressed the analogous zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso In this strain, zzso zzso could be obtained that grew normally on zzso zzso but were defective for growth on C1 zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso could also be generated in the zzso by supplementing the zzso medium with zzso These strains were unable to grow on C1 compounds but were not zzso These approaches have demonstrated that the apparent zzso of zzso and zzso is due to the need for zzso for zzso of zzso and other compounds, and have provided clear genetic evidence that the zzso zzso is required for zzso
