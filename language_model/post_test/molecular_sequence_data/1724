The zzso gene zzso is implicated as a factor in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and Williams zzso zzso zzso two diseases involving pronounced complications in mental or physical zzso Although the complete spectrum of functional roles of the processed gene product remains to be established, these roles are zzso to be analogous in human and zzso This view is supported by zzso sequence comparison, in which there are no large-scale differences in the zzso zzso sequence block encompassing the common region deleted in zzso with the exception of an overall reversed physical orientation between human and zzso 

zzso zzso around zzso does not translate to a high level of conservation in the gene zzso In fact, zzso zzso in zzso show more sequence divergence than expected for a gene with a critical role in zzso The pattern of divergence is zzso due to an unusually high ratio of gaps to zzso Specifically, zzso alignments of eight zzso sequences reveal numerous zzso regions caused by zzso insertions and zzso in spite of the fact that the vast majority of aligning sites appear to be zzso and undergoing zzso zzso 

The pattern of zzso zzso zzso in the coding zzso of zzso zzso genes is unusual and has led to unique features of the gene in each zzso These differences may indicate that the gene has a slightly different functional mechanism in zzso zzso or that the corresponding regions are functionally zzso zzso regions that undergo zzso selection reflect a functional importance associated with evolutionary pressure to retain those zzso
