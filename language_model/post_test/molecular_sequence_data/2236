Three African zzso fever virus structural proteins of relative molecular weights zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are derived from precursors with relative molecular weights zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso after the second zzso zzso in the sequence zzso A search of the National zzso Research Foundation Data Bank revealed that several zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso protein are also derived from precursors that are zzso at the sequence zzso where X is often an zzso acid zzso with a zzso side zzso The sequence zzso together with other physical properties of the protein seems to be a recognition sequence for the processing of a variety of viral and cellular zzso
