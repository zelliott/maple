zzso only proteins that exhibit highly similar domain zzso should be compared with one another as zzso or be classified into a single zzso By combining three different zzso the zzso index, the zzso gamma function and the domain duplicate index, into a single similarity measure, we propose a method for comparing proteins based on their domain zzso 

zzso of the method using the zzso zzso groups of proteins zzso database indicated that it allows the automatic and efficient comparison of zzso zzso which are usually zzso to classic approaches based on sequence similarity zzso As a case study, the zzso and zzso zzso are used to demonstrate how proteins containing zzso zzso can be clearly compared using our zzso For the convenience of users, a web server was set up where three different query zzso were implemented to compare different domain zzso or proteins with zzso and to identify the relationships among domain zzso within a given zzso from the zzso of zzso Groups of zzso zzso 

The approach we propose is suitable for zzso the similarity of domain zzso of zzso especially those of zzso zzso
