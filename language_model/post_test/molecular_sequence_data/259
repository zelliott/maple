Two novel zzso moderately zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso sludge of a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that these strains belonged to cluster III within the zzso zzso zzso The close relatives of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The closest relative of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso zzso growing zzso at 60 degrees zzso zzso was zzso and zzso formed zzso colonies on solid media, and grew on a relatively narrow range of carbohydrates including cellulose and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso formed glossy white colonies and grew on zzso and various carbohydrates except zzso Major fatty acid compositions were 16 : 0 zzso 16 : 0 and 16 : 0 zzso zzso zzso and 15 : 0 zzso 16 : 0 zzso 15 : 0 zzso and 17 : 0 zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso data and zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
