Since the identification in 1984 of the zzso beta protein zzso as the major component of senile plaques and cerebrovascular zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso it is well accepted that the production of this protein is a crucial factor in the zzso of zzso zzso is produced by zzso from the zzso precursor protein zzso and can form zzso in zzso and in zzso The formation of these zzso is influenced by proteins that are found in association with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Several of these proteins arise by an inflammatory response of the brain to zzso zzso The distribution of different zzso of zzso varying at the zzso of the zzso varies among the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Such variations may have consequences for the zzso of zzso because the various zzso zzso differ in their capacity to form zzso and they have different toxic effects on zzso and vascular cells, zzso The experimental data indicate that the zzso of senile plaques is different from the generation of cerebrovascular zzso Summarizing models for either type of zzso pathology are zzso
