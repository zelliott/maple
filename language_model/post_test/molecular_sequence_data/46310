In a number of zzso zzso screens, we have found clones that contained parts of the human zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso All of these clones were zzso relative to the zzso coding sequence and activated the zzso reporters in the presence of the zzso DNA binding domain but irrespective of the bait zzso zzso gene zzso was abolished when zzso domain and zzso coding sequences were brought zzso In light of these findings, we evaluated all recently reported interactions with zzso because our zzso zzso protein might have been the actual interaction partner in some of these zzso
