zzso a ubiquitous low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso binding zzso regulates the formation of zzso structures in zzso and is localized to specific cellular regions through interaction with zzso zzso Here we report the zzso A X-ray structure of the complex between human zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso adopts a left-handed type II zzso zzso zzso and binds to a highly zzso patch of aromatic zzso acids on the surface of zzso The zzso and zzso binding sites reside on zzso surfaces, and zzso binding does not result in a zzso zzso of zzso This structure suggests a mechanism for the zzso of zzso and its zzso activities to sites of zzso filament assembly in zzso
