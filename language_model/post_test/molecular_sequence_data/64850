We have shown previously that zzso targeting of zzso zzso virus zzso F and H protein is dependent on single zzso zzso in the zzso tails of the zzso and is essential for fusion activity in polarized zzso zzso Here, we present data on the functional importance of polarized zzso expression for the zzso properties of infectious zzso in culture and for zzso in zzso By the introduction of single point zzso we generated zzso viruses in which the zzso targeting signal of either one or both zzso was destroyed zzso zzso As a consequence, the zzso zzso were predominantly expressed on the zzso membrane of polarized zzso canine kidney zzso In contrast to parental zzso none of these virus zzso was able to spread by zzso formation in polarized cells showing that the presence of both zzso zzso at the zzso cell surface is required for zzso fusion in zzso Using cotton rats as an animal model that allows zzso replication in the respiratory zzso we showed that zzso zzso targeting is also of importance for the spread of infection in zzso Whereas parental zzso was able to spread zzso within the respiratory zzso and from there to cells in the underlying zzso zzso zzso infected only single zzso and very few zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso targeting of zzso zzso helps to overcome the zzso barrier and thereby zzso the systemic spread of zzso infection in zzso
