We have identified a zzso zzso consisting of zzso within the first zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso and have used this to investigate the segregation of the zzso gene and idiopathic zzso in 7 affected and 21 unaffected members from three zzso An association between the zzso locus and zzso dominant idiopathic zzso in one family was excluded by observing zzso between the two zzso In the remaining two families with zzso zzso idiopathic zzso the zzso locus was not similarly zzso We had previously demonstrated a donor zzso site zzso of the zzso gene in one of these families, and zzso gene abnormalities were therefore sought in the second of these zzso DNA sequence analysis of the three zzso together with 4 zzso boundaries and the promoter region of the zzso gene revealed no zzso thereby indicating molecular pathology at another zzso Thus, our analysis of idiopathic zzso reveals genetic zzso for this zzso In addition, our identification of a zzso zzso of the zzso gene should help further segregation studies of this locus in families with zzso zzso
