The presence of the zzso protein zzso has previously been demonstrated by zzso to be specifically confined to the primordial zzso layer, the early cortical plate and zzso zone cells in the developing zzso of a number of zzso In order to investigate its origin there, we have applied in zzso zzso in zzso sections of zzso fixed zzso sheep brain, using a short zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso has been compared with that of the protein by using zzso zzso and zzso This allowed us to confirm that zzso is zzso initially in cells of the primordial zzso layer and subsequently cortical plate and zzso zzso On the other hand, cells in the zzso zone that are zzso zzso positive do not contain zzso zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso expression in the developing zzso follows closely the previously described pattern of zzso zzso distribution in the sheep brain, apart from its absence from the zzso zone where its origin is probably by zzso from zzso zzso
