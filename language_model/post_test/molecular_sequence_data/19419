Plant plasma membrane zzso proteins play important roles in signal zzso during defense response to an attacking zzso By using an improved method of PM protein preparation and zzso green fluorescent protein fusion protein as a visible marker, we conducted PM zzso analysis of the rice suspension cells expressing the disease resistance gene zzso to identify PM components involved in the early defense response to bacterial blight zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 20 regulated protein spots were observed on zzso gels of PM zzso at 12 and 24 h after pathogen zzso of which some were zzso regulated between the incompatible and compatible interactions zzso by zzso with good correlation between biological zzso Eleven protein spots with predicted functions in plant defense were identified by zzso including nine putative zzso proteins zzso protein zzso zzso response protein zzso zzso zzso zinc finger and C2 domain zzso universal stress protein zzso and heat shock zzso zzso was modified by the microbial challenge, leading to two zzso accumulated protein zzso zzso analysis showed that most of the genes were also regulated at zzso zzso Our study would provide a starting point for functionality of PM proteins in the rice zzso
