zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso zzso soluble versions of zzso have been used successfully to promote zzso zzso in animal models of zzso injury, raising interest in this protein as a potential therapeutic zzso The zzso zzso zzso regions in zzso are flanked by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present work we show that, although functionally active, the zzso fusion protein contains zzso and zzso zzso patterns in the zzso domain, and we report the generation of a series of zzso molecules specifically designed to prevent this zzso Using these zzso we explored the effects of zzso the zzso zzso site or the spacing between the zzso and zzso zzso or replacing zzso within the zzso or zzso hinge zzso One zzso which incorporates replacements of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso completely eliminated zzso scrambling while maintaining functional in zzso and in zzso zzso This modified zzso zzso represents a significantly improved candidate for further pharmaceutical development, and may serve as a useful model for the zzso of other zzso fusion proteins made from zzso zzso
