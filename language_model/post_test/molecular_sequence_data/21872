zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strains were subjected to zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Eight of these strains had been received as cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but they showed close relationships with the type strain of zzso zzso as did two other strains received as zzso zzso All strains underwent further zzso analysis by zzso and other zzso tests and fatty acid zzso zzso analysis, and selected strains were zzso for their polar lipids and for DNA zzso The 11 strains that formed the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster also showed some zzso similarities, and DNA zzso data support the zzso of the strains received as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one of the zzso zzso zzso as members of the species zzso zzso Four other strains received as zzso zzso were zzso two were identified as zzso zzso and two appeared to be closely related to zzso zzso One strain received as zzso zzso remained zzso On the basis of a single strain, zzso zzso was shown to represent a distinct species, but study of the type strain of zzso zzso showed this species to be a later zzso synonym of zzso zzso zzso descriptions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are therefore zzso
