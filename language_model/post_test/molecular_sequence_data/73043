The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain I, a central zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies attributed collagen IV and high affinity calcium binding of zzso to its zzso zzso which was shown by zzso zzso to consist of an zzso pair surrounded by several zzso and loop zzso This module was now shown by surface zzso resonance zzso to bind with similar affinities to zzso I, III, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso module by zzso zzso A and B, zzso and zzso showed similar zzso patterns, whereas zzso was zzso Some differences were, however, observed in zzso rates and the preference of certain zzso zzso zzso degradation of fragments demonstrated only three to four major zzso sites in the central region of domain I and a single uniform zzso in zzso C of the zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by a zzso increase in binding activity for zzso I, IV, and V but revealed only small effects on zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso The data were interpreted to indicate that zzso C zzso is mainly responsible for enhancing collagen affinity by exposing the underlying zzso A of the zzso zzso A similar zzso may also occur in zzso as indicated previously for zzso zzso
