Modeling the binding sites for zzso and zzso on the regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was carried out after measuring zzso stimulation and zzso zzso at receptors containing zzso and zzso R domain zzso Models were constructed based on the published crystal structure of the zzso and zzso R zzso which form a zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental results and modeling suggest that a binding site for zzso was formed by the zzso near the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso R domain zzso together with zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso lobe of the zzso R domain zzso The zzso binding site included zzso on the surface of the zzso lobe zzso zzso of zzso together with zzso near the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso It was confirmed using a Western zzso analysis that zzso and zzso formed a zzso Models of zzso and zzso binding to the zzso were zzso The modeling suggests that an open space between the two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is promoted through zzso binding and that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso approach each other through zzso zzso effect opposite to that seen with the binding of zzso
