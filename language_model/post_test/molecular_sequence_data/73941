A zzso sequence in the liver fatty zzso protein gene zzso has been identified that interacts with nuclear proteins present in adult mouse liver, zzso stomach, small zzso and zzso The binding site consists of a direct zzso repeat zzso separated by five zzso Both zzso are required for formation of stable complexes with nuclear proteins in gel mobility shift zzso The in zzso functions zzso by the repeats were determined by comparing the expression of four zzso growth hormone fusion genes in multiple zzso of adult transgenic zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso linked to the human growth hormone reporter, zzso 4 additional copies of the zzso pair element placed at zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4 additional copies of the sequence placed just upstream of its zzso site at zzso zzso and zzso a sequence identical to zzso but with all zzso repeats zzso within each of the 4 additional copies of the zzso pair zzso zzso expression was defined by zzso zzso zzso and by light and electron microscopic zzso The zzso repeat functions to suppress expression in zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso in zzso in the zzso pit cells of the gastric zzso and in zzso zzso located in the zzso small zzso There is a zzso of escape from zzso suppression as one moves from the zzso to zzso small zzso This escape zzso to involve successively less differentiated cells located closer and closer to the stem cell zone in zzso of zzso The zzso repeat activates gene expression in the zzso zzso so that all zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso distributed from the zzso to the zzso support zzso zzso The zzso has no obvious sequence similarities to known zzso factor binding sites, suggesting that zzso of its in zzso activities are likely to be zzso One candidate factor is a zzso protein identified in zzso zzso The zzso protein also binds to an element in the zzso zzso gene that functions as an zzso in zzso cells, shares sequence zzso with the zzso and generates zzso complexes in gel mobility shift zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso repeat represents a target for identifying zzso factors that regulate gene expression between gut and zzso zzso and that also regulate the differentiation program of the zzso principal zzso lineage as a function of its location along the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso regulatory elements described in this report should be useful for delivering a variety of gene products throughout the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso
