zzso to the first loop zzso of zzso have been identified in human zzso virus zzso zzso individuals zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Thus, these zzso may zzso resistance against zzso zzso To define which zzso acids are involved in zzso binding to zzso we performed a zzso zzso and studied the zzso of peptides in animal zzso A panel of synthetic peptides spanning the zzso region and displaying zzso or zzso zzso was zzso for zzso binding with a pool of natural zzso zzso We used mice and chickens to study the zzso of zzso zzso zzso characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to better understand the structural and zzso features of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in positions zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso binding compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown to zzso in mice and zzso zzso displaying biological activity at very low zzso zzso chicken zzso to the zzso zzso specifically recognize human zzso zzso zzso receptors from zzso inhibit zzso zzso and prevent infection by several zzso zzso displaying 50% zzso zzso of less than 3 zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations proved the high flexibility of isolated zzso and suggested that zzso zzso determine a slightly higher tendency to generate zzso zzso combined with a lower zzso hindrance of the side chains in the zzso These findings may be relevant to the induction of strong and efficient zzso zzso
