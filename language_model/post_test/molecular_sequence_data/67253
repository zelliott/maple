A novel zzso zzso zzso leading to the substitution of zzso for the zzso zzso acid zzso was identified by zzso sequencing of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of a patient with zzso cell zzso This zzso is located in the third zzso repeat in the zzso of the zzso In zzso expression studies demonstrated that this zzso results in reduced zzso binding and signal zzso of the zzso Studies of zzso zzso in which various zzso acids were zzso for the zzso zzso showed that zzso activity is sensitive to changes in size, shape, and charge of the side zzso A zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso was made, illustrating the packing of zzso zzso side chains in the protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso might disrupt zzso contacts between hormone and zzso This zzso might also affect an zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso reduces zzso binding and signal zzso by the zzso and it is partially responsible for zzso cell zzso in the zzso
