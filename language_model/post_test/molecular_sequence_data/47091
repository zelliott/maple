Several publicly zzso large-scale sequencing efforts have been initiated with the goal of completing the first reference human zzso sequence by the year zzso Here we present the results of analysis of zzso zzso of zzso sequence from zzso zzso The apparent gene density varies throughout the region, but the number of genes predicted zzso suggests that this is a zzso zzso This result may also suggest that the total number of human genes is likely to be at the lower end of published zzso One of the most interesting aspects of this region of the zzso is the presence of highly zzso recently duplicated tracts of sequence distributed throughout the zzso Such zzso have implications for mapping and gene analysis as well as the predisposition to zzso zzso structural zzso associated with genetic zzso
