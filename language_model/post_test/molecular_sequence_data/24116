We propose a statistical mechanics model for DNA melting in which base stacking and pairing are explicitly introduced as distinct degrees of zzso Unlike previous approaches, this model describes zzso zzso of DNA secondary structure in the whole zzso accessible temperature zzso Base pairing is described through a zzso model, base stacking through an zzso zzso We present experimental data on the zzso transition, obtained exploiting the observation that at moderately low pH this transition is moved down to zzso accessible zzso These zzso confirm that the zzso model approach is indeed a good description of base zzso On the other hand, comparison with the experiments points to the limitations of the simple zzso model description of base zzso
