The aim of this project was to investigate the retinal zzso zzso zzso at the molecular level by identification of novel zzso zzso that may zzso proteins of signal zzso pathways or other proteins that are expressed zzso in the zzso 

A bovine zzso zzso library was constructed in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso The library was screened by differential zzso to bovine zzso and kidney zzso zzso 

A member of the zzso zzso family was identified in bovine zzso by molecular zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence predicts a protein that has zzso zzso acid zzso and resembles most closely the family of visual zzso A zzso zzso analogous to the zzso attachment site in zzso is zzso in the seventh zzso segment of the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso the putative G zzso zzso was detected by in zzso zzso in the zzso inner nuclear layer, and specific cells of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso showed that the zzso protein is localized in zzso cells, as well as in the zzso 

A novel zzso zzso defines a distant evolutionary branch of the visual zzso zzso The selective zzso of this putative zzso its abundance in zzso and zzso and its zzso to the visual zzso suggest that the function of this zzso is important in a visual process involving the zzso and zzso zzso
