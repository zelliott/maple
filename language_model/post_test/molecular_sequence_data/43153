A zzso responsive zzso zzso was generated by cloning the acute phase promoter of human serum zzso zzso zzso upstream of a zzso reporter zzso The construct responds to the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a manner that closely mimics the response of the zzso zzso gene to such zzso zzso single treatments induce zzso zzso by zzso beta and zzso to a greater extent than by zzso at zzso zzso However, zzso experiments show that the zzso of induction generated by zzso beta and zzso are quite distinct from zzso zzso having a much greater effect at 3-6 zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso with zzso to give a zzso increase in zzso zzso over single zzso zzso The zzso of this synergistic response resembles that generated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can specifically block the zzso beta driven zzso zzso of zzso but not that driven by zzso or zzso Furthermore, in synergistic zzso combinations, it blocks only the zzso beta driven component indicating that the effect is biological and not attributable to zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso will be useful both for the investigation of the zzso of inflammatory zzso in a zzso specific manner, and for the evaluation of the zzso and zzso properties of novel natural and synthetic zzso
