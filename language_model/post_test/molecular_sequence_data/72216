During the recent cloning of the mouse zzso gene we developed both a high-resolution genetic map and a complete zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso critical region on mouse zzso zzso We also report the mapping of the human zzso of the mouse zzso gene zzso to zzso These data are consistent with zzso being the gene for the human zzso zzso and strengthen the zzso relationship between zzso and human zzso
