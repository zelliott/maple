zzso zzso zzso based on the growth factor zzso of both human and zzso zzso which show zzso affinities for their zzso receptors have been expressed as zzso zzso Further modification of these molecules by preparing zzso with the constant region of human zzso has led to molecules with high affinities and long in zzso zzso Smaller zzso zzso have been obtained by a combination of zzso display and zzso analog zzso All of these molecules inhibit the binding of the growth factor domain of zzso to the zzso zzso and enhance binding of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested in an in zzso tumor model using the human breast zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both human and zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso of primary tumor growth, demonstrating that in zzso both tumor and zzso cell zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso can zzso tumor zzso
