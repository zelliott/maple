zzso zzso is a large, zzso modular zzso that is a major constituent of zzso alpha zzso zzso is also zzso by a wide variety of zzso and zzso cells in patterns that reflect zzso changes in the zzso and response to injury in the zzso In addition to its role in blood zzso zzso has been reported to serve both adhesive and zzso functions, to foster zzso zzso stimulate and inhibit cell growth and migration, and inhibit zzso Although this diversity in apparent function can be zzso in part, to the ability of a single zzso to interact with several different zzso zzso it is now known that the zzso are zzso by at least three zzso genes in both human and zzso zzso the commonly recognized protein isolated from zzso is similar to zzso in zzso Both proteins contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and type I zzso or zzso type II zzso and type III zzso zzso However, the two zzso differ in zzso acid sequence and in the regulation of their zzso zzso is rapidly induced by serum and growth zzso An zzso and a binding site for zzso have been shown to mediate the serum response of the human zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso is far less responsive to serum than zzso and lacks the promoter elements that mediate the serum responsiveness of zzso zzso resembles zzso and zzso in its zzso domain and type III repeats, but contains four rather than three type II repeats and lacks type I repeats and a zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso also differs from that of either zzso or zzso All three zzso demonstrate characteristic patterns of expression in the developing and adult zzso It is therefore likely that each protein zzso a discrete zzso In the future it will be necessary to distinguish among the three zzso in addressing the function of these zzso
