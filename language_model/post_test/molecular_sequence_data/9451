zzso 3 specific zzso zzso containing 180 zzso linking clones associated with 188 genes were zzso to zzso representation zzso prepared using matched zzso samples from major zzso zzso breast zzso zzso lung (40 zzso cervical zzso zzso kidney zzso pairs of clear cell zzso cell zzso colon (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate (18 zzso In all tested primary tumors zzso to normal zzso zzso and/or deletions was zzso For the first time we showed that the gene zzso was frequently zzso and/or deleted in breast zzso - zzso of samples, cervical - zzso lung - zzso zzso - zzso zzso - zzso colon - zzso and prostate cancer - zzso To check these results zzso sequencing using cloned zzso products with representative two breast, one zzso two zzso two zzso and two colon cancer samples was zzso In all cases zzso was zzso zzso analysis using zzso showed that zzso is strongly zzso at the latest stages of zzso and zzso zzso In addition we showed that zzso exhibit strong cell growth zzso activity (more than zzso in colony formation experiments zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso All these data suggest that zzso gene could be involved in the process of zzso as a tumor zzso zzso
