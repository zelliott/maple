The aim of this study was to zzso the zzso sequences of regions zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso zzso from 14 selected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in zzso 

zzso and zzso chain termination sequencing were zzso 

Analysis of zzso profiles showed that the zzso zzso zzso strains belonged to six different zzso patterns including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso international zzso however, 8 of the 14 strains belonged to the zzso zzso These strains showed the typical changes in zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and had 10 unique changes in the zzso region of zzso as described zzso Transformation experiments tried to incorporate the zzso domain of zzso including the zzso region associated with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes revealed that part of the 3' region of the zzso sequence zzso a region of the domain zzso zzso acid zzso to the C zzso of zzso did not recombine with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis showed that 6, 6 and 2 zzso zzso zzso strains had zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, strains with zzso or zzso zzso showed a single zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso while strains with the zzso zzso had 12 unique zzso 

Ten unique changes in the zzso region of zzso and no specific zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso strains isolated in Spain with an zzso zzso zzso zzso from 6 to 12 zzso by 1 zzso step zzso In addition, the presence of specific zzso in zzso seems to play a key role in the presence of different zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso
