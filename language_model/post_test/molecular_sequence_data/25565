The upstream zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains an zzso box, and mediates the increase in expression of a zzso fusion gene during growth on zzso zzso replacement experiments indicate that the zzso box functions as an absolute zzso of zzso but other elements zzso zzso zzso are required for carbon source regulation, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso competition experiments suggest that the DNA binding factor zzso interacts with the zzso box in the upstream region of zzso zzso of zzso factor is not carbon source dependent in in zzso experiments, and is probably not responsible for zzso induction of zzso zzso
