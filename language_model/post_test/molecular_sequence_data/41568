The bacterial zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli has been suggested to zzso the zzso potential, such that the depletion of zzso levels zzso the formation of dormant zzso cells which can eventually form zzso We studied the structure and membrane interactions of zzso to find out whether it forms pores or other zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso structure when zzso in zzso zzso and oriented circular zzso showed that the zzso assumes a zzso zzso The addition of zzso to zzso zzso caused leakage only at very high zzso zzso notably with a Hill zzso of 2, which suggests that zzso must be zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations showed that membrane binding of zzso zzso is rapid and spontaneous, and zzso zzso is energetically zzso When zzso zzso are assembled as zzso zzso these channels collapse during the simulations, but zzso zzso are found to be zzso Given the pattern of charges on the zzso zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso could be assembled via a zzso of salt zzso This zzso zzso could enable zzso to pass along a wire of trapped water molecules across the zzso zzso
