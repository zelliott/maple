zzso new zzso receptors zzso are unique single domain zzso found in the serum of zzso The individual variable zzso zzso bind zzso independently and are candidates for the smallest zzso immune recognition units zzso 13 zzso Here, we first isolated and zzso the zzso of a mature zzso zzso from the spotted zzso shark zzso zzso and confirmed the independent nature of the zzso zzso by dynamic light zzso Second, we asked which of the reported zzso zzso zzso strategies could be applied to zzso zzso to produce small zzso proteins with high functional affinity zzso In contrast to single chain zzso zzso fragments, separate zzso could not be linked into a tandem single chain format, with the resulting proteins exhibited only zzso binding due solely to interaction of the zzso domain with zzso Similarly, incorporation of zzso zzso zzso zzso while resulting in efficiently zzso zzso resulted in only a modest enhancement of zzso probably due to an insufficiently long hinge region linking the zzso to the zzso zzso Finally, generation of zzso containing zzso zzso at the zzso zzso produced zzso zzso proteins exhibiting high functional affinity for the target zzso but at the cost of zzso decreased protein expression zzso This study demonstrates the potential for construction of zzso or zzso zzso binding zzso of relatively small size zzso 26 zzso equivalent to a zzso zzso zzso fragment, for zzso into future diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
