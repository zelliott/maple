zzso has a central role in the zzso of cholesterol zzso in part because of its ability to bind zzso lipids and accelerate cholesterol crystal appearance zzso Previous studies have localized these properties to zzso zzso zzso and we have recently shown that these zzso contain a series of zzso acid, zzso zzso The aim of this study was to express a zzso zzso zzso containing these repeats and investigate its zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso coli, zzso by affinity zzso and compared with native bovine gallbladder zzso in zzso and cholesterol crystal appearance time zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso bound a zzso fluorescent probe and cholesterol in a zzso zzso It accelerated the appearance of cholesterol zzso from zzso model zzso an effect that was both time and concentration zzso 

The zzso repeats in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso identified in earlier zzso zzso Further zzso of the zzso zzso in these repeats will provide new insights into the mechanism of cholesterol crystal nucleation and stone zzso
