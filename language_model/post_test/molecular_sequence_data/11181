A zzso mapping procedure has been developed for a zzso zzso zzso using an immobilized zzso zzso zzso is passed through the zzso zzso and the products of the zzso are captured directly onto an zzso zzso zzso zzso The peptides are then separated using a zzso zzso This new procedure is rapid and zzso and can be fully zzso The total time of analysis is less than 2 zzso The mapping of zzso produced an unexpected zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It appears that the zzso may occur through zzso followed by zzso at a newly generated site next to the site of zzso This mapping procedure can be a useful tool for research and routine analysis of zzso
