The zzso I zzso protein is a zzso component of active zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso protein specifically binds to the zzso region of the zzso beta zzso zzso promoter localized upstream of the zzso zzso element zzso zzso to what has been described for the human promoter, zzso protein did not specifically bind to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters carrying zzso on this zzso binding site displayed delayed zzso zzso of zzso When integrated into zzso the zzso promoter remained zzso and never reached normal zzso zzso Such a phenomenon was not observed with zzso zzso promoters upon which zzso was only partially zzso Using zzso zzso we show that the upstream zzso sequences of the zzso zzso promoter constitute a preferential binding region for zzso zzso zzso with a zzso carrying scaffold attachment regions as well as incubation with zzso led to the zzso of the zzso promoter zzso integrated into zzso In zzso zzso protein was able to zzso zzso zzso from the upstream zzso region of the zzso promoter but not from the promoter carrying zzso on the upstream zzso zzso binding zzso Our results suggest that the binding of zzso zzso to the upstream zzso region of the promoter might be partly responsible for the zzso repression of the zzso The displacement by zzso protein of zzso zzso could help to convert the zzso promoter from a zzso to an active zzso
