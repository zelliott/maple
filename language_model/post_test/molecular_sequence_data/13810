zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso fragments reverse acute zzso toxicity in a rat experimental model by inducing a zzso of drug from cardiac tissue into serum and zzso zzso In order to investigate the use of smaller zzso zzso fragments such as single chain zzso zzso as an antidote, an efficient zzso zzso myeloma expression system was zzso The variable light zzso and variable heavy zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was prepared by overlapping zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso with heavy chain leader zzso zzso and the zzso This construct was zzso into a zzso expression zzso which zzso the zzso alpha promoter, a hybrid promoter consisting of the zzso early promoter with portions of the human zzso leukemia virus type I long terminal repeat and also containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso myeloma cells were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were screened for expression of zzso using reverse zzso to detect zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso from clones capable of growth to a cell density of 2-4 zzso zzso viable zzso was zzso in a single step using a zzso affinity column resulting in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had comparable zzso binding activity to zzso when evaluated by competitive zzso
