During the viral life cycle zzso produce excess zzso zzso Human zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso predominantly an excess of free zzso the complexes of zzso zzso base and zzso fiber zzso which are responsible for virus zzso In infected cells zzso zzso spontaneously assemble into zzso zzso zzso containing twelve zzso They also form in insect cells during expression in the zzso zzso Similarly, in the absence of fiber protein zzso particles built of 12 zzso base zzso can be zzso Both kinds of zzso show remarkable efficiency of zzso penetration and can be engineered to deliver several millions of foreign cargo molecules to a single target zzso For this reason, they are of great interest as a delivery zzso In order to successfully manipulate this potential zzso for drug and/or gene delivery, an understanding of the molecular basis of zzso assembly and integrity is zzso zzso data in conjunction with zzso zzso and zzso analysis provide a model for the molecular zzso of zzso particle assembly and the requirements for zzso The zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso base zzso zzso shows that the zzso structure is stabilized by zzso between neighboring zzso base zzso Such zzso zzso does not occur for zzso of zzso a zzso which does not form zzso under zzso zzso This unique stabilization of the zzso zzso is controlled by zzso 59-61 located at the site of strand zzso the zzso involved in putative salt bridges between zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by site directed zzso and zzso analysis of zzso and wild type zzso We also provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso are zzso exposed and available for attaching zzso
