Three strains of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso can tolerate 5 % zzso zzso and up to 150 zzso zzso but optimal growth was observed without addition of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso The optimum temperature for growth was 37 degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso and the optimum pH was zzso zzso pH zzso A comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence demonstrated that the isolated strains were closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was greater than 97 % among the isolated strains and zzso % with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso analyses and zzso zzso indicated that the three strains belong to the same species, that was characterized by a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso system and zzso : zzso (32 % of the total) as a major cellular fatty zzso In contrast to the type species of the zzso zzso the strains contained zzso with zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso Based on the distinctive zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso the strains are assigned to a novel species within a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also proposed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso be transferred to this zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
