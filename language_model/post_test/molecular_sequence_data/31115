The zzso sequence of the zzso at the right end of linkage group V zzso in the standard zzso strain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals the following zzso At the zzso zzso tandem repeats of the zzso zzso are zzso Immediately zzso to the simple sequence repeat is a more complex element called zzso that is reiterated zzso times in the zzso of various zzso zzso The element possesses several features characteristic of a zzso zzso direct repeats of zzso zzso flank the element, there is a long internal open reading frame zzso and a zzso zzso is found at its zzso However, zzso has other structural features that are more difficult to reconcile with the standard model of a zzso zzso A second zzso from zzso was also cloned by screening a zzso zzso library with a synthetic zzso zzso to the simple sequence zzso This zzso is entirely zzso with the zzso zzso except for the zzso repeats, has no associated copy of zzso and has no nearby zzso There are no long stretches of zzso repeats present in the zzso zzso at zzso zzso
