zzso peptides composed of alternating zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we report a new zzso type that is formed from zzso zzso of zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that these peptides do not zzso and assemble into zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso but rather zzso into zzso that contain alternating zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates an zzso advantage for rippled zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso assembly of zzso zzso
