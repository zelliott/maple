To analyze the relationship between zzso gene expression and zzso proliferation and maturation during zzso zzso Day zzso chick zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and serial sections were processed for zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso located in four distinct areas of the developing zzso all contained high levels of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso (such as zzso zzso contained zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by Northern zzso analysis and by the observation that zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited proliferation in cultured zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in immature zzso cultures zzso zzso maintained the cells in a zzso state and blocked their maturation into zzso zzso The lack of maturation in the zzso cultures was zzso by analysis of type X collagen gene zzso Control immature cultures contained strong zzso activity for the type X collagen gene promoter, as revealed by zzso zzso zzso activity was lost upon maturation and zzso of type X collagen zzso In the zzso cultures, however, zzso activity zzso Thus, zzso zzso in the normal changes in proliferation accompanying zzso maturation in zzso and in zzso The decreases in zzso expression and cell proliferation appear to be required for completion of zzso
