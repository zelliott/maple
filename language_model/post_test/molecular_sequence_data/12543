We have defined a zzso pair zzso promoter for the zzso zzso transfer protein zzso gene that contains a nuclear hormone zzso response element essential for zzso zzso zzso protection and zzso mobility shift zzso showed specific binding of nuclear extracts from zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso cell zzso to 3 sites zzso A zzso to zzso B zzso to zzso and C zzso to zzso within the zzso pair minimal promoter element between zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that the function of the promoter was dependent upon synergistic interactions between zzso factors bound to these zzso zzso of site C reduced zzso by 50 and zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso cells, and zzso mobility shift zzso showed that nuclear hormone zzso including zzso and its zzso zzso were occupants of site C in both of these cell zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene reporter plasmids zzso zzso activity of the zzso promoter containing sequences up to zzso but activated zzso in the context of larger zzso containing sequences up to zzso Thus zzso may assume a zzso role as both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso dependent on the promoter zzso In addition, the architecture of the zzso gene promoter suggests that its expression is under the control of multiple zzso signaling pathways zzso by zzso zzso factors as well as nuclear hormone zzso
