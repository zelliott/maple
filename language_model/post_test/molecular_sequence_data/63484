The zzso are zzso zzso pumps, found in virtually all cells, responsible for zzso of zzso and energizing of plasma zzso Its role in diseases, such as osteoporosis and zzso cancer, makes the zzso a potential drug zzso Short synthetic peptides that are presented here mimic the 7th zzso domain zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso an essential part of the zzso zzso domain, where zzso zzso takes zzso The peptides adopt a zzso zzso only in zzso containing zzso zzso stressing the importance of strong zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains the essential zzso zzso is zzso whereas zzso zzso which lacks this extra charge, tends to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which is a highly potent inhibitor of zzso does not show any interaction with the zzso indicating that zzso alone is not sufficient for inhibitor zzso
