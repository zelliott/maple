A detailed investigation of the zzso zzso mobile dispersed repetitive element jockey was zzso This is similar in its structural organization and coding potential to the long zzso elements zzso of various zzso A complete copy of jockey zzso 5 zzso is terminated with an zzso zzso sequence preceded by two long open reading frames zzso overlapping with a zzso Judging by the sequence zzso zzso codes for a zzso zzso and zzso for a reverse zzso which is most similar in its sequence to putative reverse zzso of other zzso As demonstrated by sequencing two deleted jockey copies, they contain only a small part of zzso however, other regions, including the terminal zzso are highly zzso The existence of a large number of jockey copies with a deletion in the second frame may indicate that they can use reverse zzso in zzso
