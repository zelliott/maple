To identify zzso features in the rapidly zzso portions of a zzso zzso completely zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso method based on recurrence analysis was zzso At the level of the zzso zzso in both species, zzso and zzso zzso subject to rapid zzso not drift without constraints, but rather zzso in the sense that they maintain not only an zzso base zzso but also a consistent use of recurring zzso zzso One of the two genes present in the zzso locus encodes a protein that exhibits blocks of high similarity to the first zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso but bears long zzso zzso absent in other zzso From an analysis of the zzso zzso different constraints appear to act on the borders and on the central part of the zzso zzso maintaining a strong bias toward zzso zzso central portions diverge more rapidly than borders, through point zzso and differential presence of entire zzso
