We have investigated the previously zzso human zzso zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a member of the rapidly evolving zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso the absence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis studies suggest that zzso may have originated by the zzso of an zzso gene from the zzso cluster zzso zzso and zzso zzso similarity searches against human zzso zzso proteins revealed that zzso zzso shows significant similarity to the cellular zzso zzso zzso protein family zzso zzso domain, which is responsible for zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is transcribed during the late phase of the viral replication cycle in both zzso and zzso strains of zzso We characterized the protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso type I zzso zzso which becomes zzso at 48 h zzso In infected human zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site of zzso assembly and secondary zzso together with zzso a marker for the zzso network, and viral structural zzso including the envelope zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, analyses of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a novel constituent of the zzso zzso zzso the deletion of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in reduced growth in a cell zzso manner, suggesting that zzso may be implicated in regulating zzso cell zzso
