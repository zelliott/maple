zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso To detect and enhance the affinity for complementary zzso of zzso the zzso zzso domain was fused with the zzso region of zzso which contains the zzso domain of this zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein was designed to contain the last downstream zzso attachment site and was expressed as a zzso In zzso overlay blots carried out with brain zzso it recognized zzso The interaction was abolished by the addition of zzso or zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso the fourth and fifth zzso type III zzso The fusion protein directly reacted with this zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were retained on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which in zzso binding studies yielded a zzso value of 17 zzso for zzso zzso We conclude that a zzso zzso interaction between the zzso domain of zzso and those zzso type III repeats is substantially involved in the binding of zzso to zzso
