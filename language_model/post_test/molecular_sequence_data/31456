A zzso zzso zzso pale zzso zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample from a salt mine in zzso zzso zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso of between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The optimum temperature and pH for growth of the strain were 28 zzso and pH zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The polar zzso profile was composed predominantly of zzso zzso and one unknown zzso Minor amounts of other lipids were also zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain zzso zzso was related to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso experiment between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated levels of zzso of zzso zzso data supported the placement of strain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso characterization allowed strain zzso zzso to be differentiated from zzso zzso It is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
