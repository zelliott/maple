A physical map of a zzso region of zzso 5 containing a zzso zzso locus and spanning approximately 1000 zzso was established using the zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso were resolved in this zzso zzso by zzso analysis and we have mapped different types of sequences between these three zzso zzso zzso units from each of these three zzso of zzso 5, and from zzso 3 and 4, were isolated by zzso A total of 38 new DNA sequences were zzso Two types of zzso zzso repeated units zzso the major zzso with zzso repeats and one with short repeats zzso zzso only detected on zzso zzso from zzso zzso Although the 38 sequences displayed noticeable zzso we were able to group them according to their zzso array zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso was confirmed with the restriction zzso study of all the zzso carrying zzso zzso
