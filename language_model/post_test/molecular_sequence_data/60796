zzso is unable to carry out de zzso fatty acid synthesis and has to obtain these compounds from their host for subsequent zzso by zzso with zzso zzso This activity is zzso by a fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel gene from zzso zzso whose zzso zzso product from zzso insect cell line had the zzso activity of a zzso fatty zzso zzso It was named zzso zzso since it belongs to a zzso gene family as revealed by the sequence of several clones and a zzso pattern in Southern zzso The sequence specifies a product of 820 zzso acid zzso It was transcribed and expressed in infected zzso having an apparent molecular mass of 100 zzso zzso of infected zzso with a specific zzso against the zzso part of the zzso localized the product early after the zzso invasion in zzso structures budding off the zzso membrane toward the red cell zzso Its unique zzso terminal structure of 70 extra zzso acid zzso longer than any other reported zzso zzso is probably related to its zzso in the zzso of the host zzso The zzso relationship among other zzso zzso placed zzso closer to zzso zzso sharing significant zzso acid zzso especially in the zzso signature motif that zzso fatty acid zzso specificity and zzso zzso Taking into account the importance of this zzso activity for the zzso its zzso location inside the infected zzso and the divergence with respect to the zzso human zzso it may be an important protein as a potential target candidate for zzso zzso zzso
