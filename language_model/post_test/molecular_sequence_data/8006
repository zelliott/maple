In order to test the zzso preference of short zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso and carried out zzso zzso studies of it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso system, space group zzso cell zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, alpha zzso 90 degrees, beta zzso zzso degrees, gamma zzso 90 degrees, V zzso zzso A3, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso R index of zzso for zzso reflections zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso takes up the zzso rather than a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The three methanol molecules and the water zzso that constitute the zzso of zzso form a network of hydrogen bonds to the zzso molecules and to one zzso It is rather remarkable that though A and L have stronger zzso preferences than G, neither AAA nor zzso form the zzso zzso but zzso does, indicating that the zzso preferences depend on the sequence zzso The zzso zzso in zzso A and the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso B do not show the preferred zzso for forming zzso Further, very zzso zzso exhibits a unique zzso feature of the protein folding zzso namely the twisted zzso whereas most short peptides show only the classical zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
