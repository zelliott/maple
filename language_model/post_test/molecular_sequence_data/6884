The zzso tumor zzso gene zzso encodes a zinc finger zzso factor, whose expression zzso the growth of the zzso zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso or zzso cells results in zzso repression of a number of zzso promoters containing the early growth response gene 1 consensus zzso We now show that zzso has properties of a zzso zzso in zzso cells, an effect that may be associated with the presence of a zzso zzso gene in these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells results in induction of zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso but not of other previously zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso is dramatically enhanced by zzso zzso zzso an altered zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a potentially zzso target gene for zzso and that its induction may contribute to the zzso effects of zzso zzso
