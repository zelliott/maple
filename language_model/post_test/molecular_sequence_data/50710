zzso zzso was induced in rats to determine whether chronic coronary artery zzso resulted in impairment of cardiac pump performance, zzso in alpha zzso signal zzso and inadequate zzso zzso and these parameters were examined 6 zzso zzso A 50% reduction in coronary diameter was associated with an zzso in left zzso zzso pressure, whereas left zzso peak zzso pressure, rate of pressure rise and zzso were zzso The zzso response was modest, since statistically significant increases of zzso and zzso in left and right zzso weights were zzso zzso binding documented an zzso and a 38% statistically significant reduction in alpha zzso density of the left and right zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso toxin showed a zzso significant decrease of this zzso in the left zzso Moreover, a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso turnover was seen in zzso and this change was statistically zzso The depressed generation of zzso second zzso linked to the alpha zzso was found in conjunction with a zzso significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the long-term effects of coronary zzso involve impaired zzso of zzso signals, which, in combination with constraints on zzso growth, may participate in the onset of zzso dysfunction in this zzso
