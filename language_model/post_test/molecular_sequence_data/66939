Two zzso zzso from zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso at the molecular zzso Both zzso showed normal levels of zzso zzso indicating that they were affected zzso Complete sequencing of full-length zzso zzso revealed the presence of a single point zzso on each zzso leading to zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Different types of experimental approaches, including zzso expression and zzso tests in zzso coli, showed that both zzso zzso proteins completely lacked of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it was also shown that while zzso zzso protein was assembled into a less stable inactive zzso zzso zzso protein was unable to acquire a proper zzso structure and was rapidly zzso zzso the zzso zzso are the first of their type affecting the stability and/or the zzso structure of the zzso zzso The kinetic parameters of zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso showed positive zzso towards ammonium and zzso zzso compounds zzso by twofold the zzso activity but not the zzso activity of zzso zzso and were able to alter the zzso towards zzso of the zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso by more than tenfold by the presence of free zzso
