A zzso zzso in zzso coli contained an approximately zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso that included the genes responsible for the metabolism of zzso to zzso zzso Three zzso open reading frame 10 zzso 10) zzso of zzso zzso lost their abilities to catalyze zzso zzso expressed zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso under a zzso promoter in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of a zzso group of zzso to an zzso group, resulting in the production of zzso and this gene was designated zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso had the highest identity zzso to a hypothetical protein of zzso zzso zzso and likely contained a zzso zzso zzso incorporation of an oxygen zzso from water into zzso using zzso experiments indicated stereo preference of zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, unlike the narrow zzso range of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which contain the zzso functional group on the aromatic ring zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso cell extracts of zzso coli zzso increased the activity of zzso Due to the relaxed zzso range of zzso it may be zzso for the production of various fragrance compounds from plant zzso in the zzso
