zzso begins with interaction between the zzso and the zzso The surface of the zzso zzso is covered with the egg zzso which is composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have identified two zzso zzso and zzso as the major components of the chicken egg zzso In the present study, another 42 zzso zzso designated zzso has been found as a new major component of the chicken egg zzso zzso was specifically released from the egg envelope by zzso treatment without zzso zzso zzso was cloned using a chicken zzso cell zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed that zzso of zzso is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso with four potential zzso sites and includes a zzso domain, common in zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso belongs zzso to a distinct group from known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In two-dimensional gel zzso zzso proteins were identified to be several zzso with different zzso values between 5 and zzso zzso zzso and the newly identified zzso were confirmed to be the major components of chicken egg envelope by zzso of zzso zzso of whole egg zzso The in zzso incubation of chicken zzso with calcium zzso zzso induced zzso zzso resulting in the fragmentation and release of a 41 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the decrease or loss of zzso zzso The incubation with zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso also induced the decrease or loss of zzso zzso suggesting the in zzso zzso zzso by these zzso zzso zzso zzso might bind loosely to egg envelope zzso and play a key role in the zzso zzso on avian zzso zzso
