The zzso acid sequence of human zzso zzso was determined in part (about zzso by zzso zzso Using a region of overlapping zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso were constructed and used to screen a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of a number of positive zzso one containing a zzso insert was characterized further by restriction mapping and determination of its zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is in perfect agreement with the zzso sequence data, confirming that the clone encodes for zzso The sequence contains a 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso and an zzso frame of zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso is missing from the zzso end of the coding zzso While exhibiting no more than zzso sequence zzso with other zzso zzso zzso it contains the highly zzso zzso domain, thus confirming the essential structural requirements for this class of zzso Two zzso fragments containing sequences coding for the zzso and zzso of the protein were used to probe for the human zzso gene by Southern zzso The results of these studies suggest the existence of at least two human zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso we cloned was assigned to human zzso 15 using zzso cell zzso This gene was mapped to band zzso by in zzso zzso zzso
