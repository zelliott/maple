Two families of zzso factors mediate zzso zzso zzso The first family, signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is activated within minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso events lead to their zzso to the nucleus, formation of zzso complexes, and the induction of the second family of zzso factors termed zzso regulatory factors zzso zzso consensus sequence binding protein zzso is a member of zzso family that is expressed only in cells of the immune system and acts as a zzso zzso zzso binds DNA through the association with other zzso factors such as zzso or zzso In this communication, the domain that is involved in zzso interactions was mapped to the zzso zzso of zzso This domain is also important for zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that direct binding of zzso to DNA is prevented by zzso zzso zzso Yet, zzso zzso can bind target DNA only through the association with zzso and zzso This type of zzso is essential for the formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are detected in expressing cells zzso and zzso zzso is induced by zzso These results strongly suggest that like the zzso the zzso are also modulated by zzso zzso that affects their biological zzso
