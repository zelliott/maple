Despite all the achieved benefits and potential promises from zzso DNA technology of plants, the potential of zzso spread to wild relatives and to zzso crops is still of a zzso zzso We continue to develop zzso block of function zzso technology for gene flow control in transgenic zzso zzso consists of two zzso blocking construct zzso and recovering construct zzso Natural expression of the BC zzso in zzso and sprouts blocks a zzso function essential for survival or reproduction of the transgenic plant zzso synthesis and zzso zzso induced zzso shock zzso zzso zzso recovers the blocked function enabling transgenic plant to zzso In natural conditions without artificial induction of zzso the transgenic plant can not reproduce zzso However, a single zzso may still fail because of the potential for zzso and gene zzso of the inserted zzso To minimize the frequency of such an zzso we developed a double zzso in which a single insert zzso two zzso zzso a zzso of interest, was constructed and transferred into tobacco zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso gene driven by a heat shock or zzso promoter as a zzso and two different promoters were used for zzso genes in the zzso One BC contained a seed zzso specific zzso zzso promoter zzso and the other contained the zzso promoter zzso which is active during fruit development and zzso Three alternative zzso of double zzso are zzso and a segregating zzso as well as a zzso zzso were zzso zzso system zzso two BC with different zzso sequences but zzso zzso that expressed the same zzso protein appeared to be the most reliable zzso The biological and molecular data obtained suggest that double zzso is a potent zzso zzso technique that can safely be applied in zzso
