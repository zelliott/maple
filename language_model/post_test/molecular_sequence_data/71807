The zzso zzso contains a large number of small zzso molecules that, in the form of small zzso zzso complexes zzso are involved in the processing and modification of zzso One of the zzso that has been shown to possess zzso activity is the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in the formation of the zzso end of zzso zzso In this study the association of the zzso protein with the zzso zzso complex was zzso The zzso protein seems not to be directly bound to the zzso zzso but requires zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso to associate with the zzso zzso complex via zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso treatment and zzso with zzso zzso revealed three human proteins of about 20, 25, and 40 zzso that can associate with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins appear to bind to zzso I of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein requires the central part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for association with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that the human zzso P proteins zzso and zzso are also associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versions of these proteins in zzso cells followed by zzso zzso resulted in zzso of both zzso P and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso protein we detected in zzso zzso is probably identical to zzso
