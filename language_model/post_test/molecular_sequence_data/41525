Some short peptides discovered by zzso display are found to be able to inhibit cancer growth and induce cancer cell zzso In this study, a novel zzso short zzso which was composed of 22 zzso acids zzso zzso as zzso and specifically bound to human zzso was screened from a zzso zzso display library so as to counteract tumor immune escape zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in inducing zzso of zzso cells was zzso The results suggested that zzso could lower zzso expression level, zzso zzso zzso activate zzso and zzso and finally increase zzso cell numbers of zzso zzso However, zzso had no obvious influence on normal human embryonic lung zzso In addition, the effects of zzso zzso gene on zzso expression and zzso cell zzso were explored using the zzso zzso zzso It showed that zzso gene was efficiently expressed in zzso zzso zzso Compared with normal zzso cells, zzso cells zzso with zzso displayed reduced zzso and protein expression levels of zzso increased sensitivity to zzso zzso decreased cell survival ratio, changes of the expression of zzso associated zzso increased number of zzso cells and the appearance of zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso protein could bind to zzso and inhibit the expression of zzso The zzso activity of complement on tumor cells strengthened and zzso signal was zzso transferred which might be a potential way to kill tumor zzso
