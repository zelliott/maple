zzso are widely and abundantly distributed in the vicinity of standing zzso zzso of zzso and some other zzso are known to contain zzso which have been described as a major zzso and the adults that have no zzso also have been reported to contain zzso In this study, we tried to establish the role of zzso zzso and characterize the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso tests using zzso zzso adult extracts were performed on patients with allergic zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso adults was screened with zzso zzso immune mouse zzso to identify zzso and results were confirmed using skin zzso human zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso using zzso acid zzso to investigate its zzso zzso Out of 275 allergic patients zzso showed a positive reaction to zzso zzso adult crude extracts in the skin zzso The zzso was cloned by zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a high zzso at the zzso acid level with zzso which were previously known to be zzso in various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso reacting to zzso zzso were detected in 17 zzso of 21 patients whose skin test results were zzso zzso against house dust zzso and other insects was noticed with mouse zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso adults were shown to be an important source of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cloning of zzso zzso zzso was performed and zzso zzso was demonstrated using skin zzso human zzso zzso zzso will be useful for further studies or clinical zzso
