Recent studies have shown that zzso in the zzso factor zzso nuclear factor zzso alpha are the cause of one form of zzso diabetes of the young zzso These studies have identified zzso in the zzso and protein coding regions of this gene that result in the synthesis of an abnormal zzso or zzso Here, we report an Italian family in which an zzso substitution at zzso of the promoter region of the zzso alpha gene zzso with zzso This zzso is located in a highly zzso region of the promoter and zzso the binding site for the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso alpha being another cause of zzso zzso This result demonstrates that decreased levels of zzso alpha per zzso can cause zzso Moreover, it indicates that both the promoter and coding regions of the zzso alpha gene should be screened for zzso in subjects thought to have zzso because of zzso in this zzso
