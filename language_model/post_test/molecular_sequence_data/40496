Cancer cells are often associated with secondary zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which could be the consequence of zzso DNA double strand breaks zzso zzso DNA end joining is one of the most common pathways to repair zzso in higher zzso By using zzso DNA zzso mimicking various zzso zzso in a zzso system, we studied end joining zzso in different cancer cell zzso We found that the efficiency of zzso varies among cancer zzso however, there was no remarkable difference in the mechanism and expression of zzso zzso Interestingly, cancer cells with lower levels of zzso possessed elevated expression of zzso and vice zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or protein zzso led to elevated zzso More importantly, we show that zzso of zzso or the addition of zzso zzso led to the zzso of zzso Further, we found that zzso interacts with zzso proteins both in zzso and in zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso in cancer cells could be zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and this may contribute toward increased zzso abnormalities in zzso
