zzso on activated zzso contain the zzso zzso As part of an effort to characterize this zzso we examined the zzso relationship for each of its 12 zzso zzso A preliminary map of zzso zzso bonding was derived by analysis of zzso zzso fragments of the zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso bonds linked zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso The contribution of the zzso zzso to an active protein zzso was tested by zzso zzso followed by expression of the modified molecules in zzso L zzso The results indicated that zzso and zzso could be replaced without affecting zzso zzso In contrast, modification of any of the other 10 zzso zzso either zzso or in combinations corresponding to the predicted zzso bonds, greatly reduced the ability of the corresponding protein to bind zzso or either of two zzso zzso and zzso which recognize the zzso zzso Each of the latter zzso also zzso with the zzso zzso modification and zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso of the L cells with zzso containing truncated zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso fragments capable of zzso binding when the zzso chains terminated after zzso (the 10th zzso zzso in the full length zzso but resulted in inactive fragments of zzso which were poorly zzso when they terminated before zzso These findings emphasize the remarkable sensitivity of the active zzso of the zzso zzso to each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
