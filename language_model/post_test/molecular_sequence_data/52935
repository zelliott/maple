The zzso of 78 strains of zzso zzso from zzso India (55 from zzso patients and 23 from zzso zzso were zzso with a focus on putative zzso genes and neutral DNA markers that were likely to be zzso zzso zzso tests indicated that 80 to zzso of zzso strains carried the zzso zzso island zzso and potentially zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso independent of disease zzso This was higher than in the West (where zzso zzso zzso zzso are disease zzso but lower than in east zzso The zzso gene was zzso disease associated in zzso whereas in the West the alternative but unrelated zzso gene at the same locus is zzso disease zzso DNA sequence motifs of zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a cluster that was distinct from those of east Asia and the West, whereas the zzso sequences of zzso and Western strains were closely zzso An internal deletion found in zzso of zzso zzso genes was not seen in any of approximately 200 strains studied from other geographic regions and thus seemed to be unique to this zzso zzso zzso Two mobile zzso that were rare in east Asian strains were also common in zzso About zzso of zzso strains were zzso zzso These findings support the idea that zzso zzso gene pools differ regionally and emphasize the potential importance of studies of Indian and other zzso zzso zzso populations in developing a global understanding of this gastric pathogen and associated zzso
