zzso zzso is a critical regulatory zzso New tools are necessary which may be used to interrogate and are responsive to the activities of protein zzso and zzso We have used protein design to develop a protein zzso termed a protein zzso domain, whose structure is dependent on its zzso zzso Based on an zzso hand zzso loop, the key design element is the replacement of a structurally critical zzso zzso which binds metal in a zzso manner, with a zzso zzso which is expected to bind metal tightly when zzso but poorly when not zzso The design comprises an zzso hand consensus zzso a zzso at zzso 7 to sensitize zzso zzso and the recognition sequence of a zzso zzso Designed zzso which contain minimal zzso recognition motifs of the protein zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso form complexes with zzso when zzso showing strong zzso zzso zzso at 544 zzso but show weak zzso when not zzso The change in zzso on zzso is comparable to or greater than that observed in described zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was confirmed by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain peptides comprise an zzso zzso potentially enabling their use as genetically zzso tags of protein zzso zzso The motif is general and potentially zzso to the majority of zzso zzso
