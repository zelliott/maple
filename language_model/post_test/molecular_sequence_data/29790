zzso rod and cone zzso zzso zzso zzso function as the zzso zzso in the zzso visual zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso In addition to the zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso sites, zzso is known to stimulate a zzso binding of zzso to the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso The latter role of zzso has been attributed to its zzso zzso To zzso the structural basis for the regulation of zzso binding to the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso probe corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso was specifically zzso to rod zzso The site of zzso zzso was localized to zzso within the zzso zzso domain using mass zzso zzso zzso between zzso and cone zzso containing zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso have been generated to probe a potential role of the zzso zzso in binding to zzso Analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso supported the role of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in the interaction with zzso Our results suggest that a direct binding of the zzso region of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso may lead to a stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso
