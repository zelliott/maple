Using an zzso zzso zzso array to screen for gene copy number changes in breast cancer, we detected a zzso amplification of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso at zzso A subsequent tissue zzso analysis of more than 2,000 clinical breast cancer samples showed zzso amplification in zzso of breast zzso Ninety-nine percent of tumors with zzso amplification showed zzso zzso protein zzso compared with zzso zzso without zzso amplification zzso zzso zzso In 175 women who had received zzso tamoxifen zzso survival was significantly longer for women with cancer with zzso amplification than for women with zzso zzso zzso without zzso amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso we also found zzso amplification in benign and zzso breast diseases, suggesting that zzso amplification may be a common mechanism in zzso breast disease and a very early genetic zzso in a large subset of breast zzso
