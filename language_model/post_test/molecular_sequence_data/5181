The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso CBS zzso Unlike some other zzso organisms the zzso gene is represented by a single copy in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the coding, as well as the zzso zzso regions was zzso The zzso sequence of zzso predicted six zzso and a zzso chain of 339 zzso zzso The zzso usage in the zzso gene of zzso zzso was highly biased and was significantly different from the zzso usage in other zzso zzso analysis of different zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences indicated that the zzso gene of zzso zzso forms a cluster with the corresponding genes of zzso zzso
