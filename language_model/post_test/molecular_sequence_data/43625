The sequences of two locust zzso have been determined by zzso zzso sequencing of zzso products from zzso derived from zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso and 380 zzso acid zzso respectively, with zzso profiles and placement of key zzso acid zzso suggestive of a typical zzso zzso zzso The sequence alignment of zzso reveals significant zzso to zzso zzso These zzso contain retinal as their visual zzso and have similarity to the zzso type sequences from zzso and zzso which use zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to the zzso type of visual zzso from zzso The zzso zzso show reduced numbers of charged zzso acids in the loop region connecting zzso segments V and VI compared to the zzso retinal zzso zzso alignment of all the known insect visual zzso has shown that only those with zzso sensitivity in the zzso spectral range, zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso have three charged zzso acids in zzso segments II, IV and zzso The charged zzso in zzso zzso is two zzso turns away from the positively charged Schiff base and could act directly as a zzso to zzso From the secondary structure analysis of zzso the two charged zzso in zzso II and IV would be in close proximity to form a zzso These polar motifs in zzso and zzso could act in wavelength zzso of short wavelength sensitive zzso and substantiate the proposed external zzso charge model which accounts for the spectral sensitivity of visual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Journal of the American Chemical Society, 101, zzso
