The zzso zzso factor belongs to the family of zzso proteins which function as essential and alternative zzso zzso Here, we report that the human zzso locus is zzso zzso Double in zzso zzso experiments have allowed simultaneous detection of sense and zzso zzso in human zzso cells, suggesting that expression of the corresponding genes is not mutually zzso We have characterized three main classes of zzso zzso zzso by the opposite strand of the zzso gene and containing zzso zzso zzso overlapping sequences or a combination of zzso We show that their expression results from the use of alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso overlapping zzso zzso species potentially zzso two protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and are expressed from the zzso promoting zzso Northern blots and zzso protection analyses indicate that zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in several human cell zzso Similar studies performed in the mouse have revealed that the zzso zzso of the zzso locus is a zzso mechanism and that the open reading frame identified in a subset of human zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses performed with several zzso zzso confirmed the differential expression of the zzso gene and revealed that it is predominantly expressed in the zzso
