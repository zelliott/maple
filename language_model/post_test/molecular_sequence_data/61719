zzso of the steroid hormone zzso trigger the major zzso transitions in zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The zzso signal is zzso by the zzso nuclear zzso zzso that binds to specific response elements in the zzso and directly regulates target gene zzso We describe a novel nuclear zzso interacting protein zzso by rigor zzso zzso that is required for zzso responses during zzso zzso zzso zzso display defects in zzso delayed zzso development, zzso zzso duplicated mouth parts, and defects in zzso zzso that resemble those seen in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the expression of these nuclear zzso genes is essentially normal in zzso zzso larvae, the zzso switch in zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso encodes a protein with multiple zzso repeats and an zzso zzso sequences that act as specific zzso interaction zzso zzso with the presence of these elements and the lethal zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein interacts with several zzso nuclear receptors in zzso pull-down experiments, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso binding domain of zzso is sufficient for this interaction, which can occur in an zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso protein is present in the brain and zzso discs of second and third zzso larvae, where it is restricted to the zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, however, zzso zzso between the zzso and nucleus in a zzso and temporally regulated manner, at times that correlate with the major lethal phase of zzso zzso and major switches in zzso gene zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso exerts essential functions during zzso development through zzso effects on zzso transcription, most likely as a zzso for one or more nuclear zzso Furthermore, the dynamic zzso zzso of zzso protein suggests that it may act to refine spatial and zzso responses to zzso during zzso
