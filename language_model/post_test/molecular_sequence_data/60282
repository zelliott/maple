The zzso protein zzso from zzso contains nine zzso and is zzso to the zzso protein 1, zzso from zzso zzso and to related proteins from zzso zzso and higher zzso We show that zzso is localized to dynamic regions of the cell zzso that are enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso In cells expressing green fluorescent protein zzso zzso the protein rapidly redistributes into newly formed cortical zzso zzso of zzso in zzso were assessed using zzso zzso generated by gene replacement, and by zzso zzso zzso cells are impaired in growth and their rates of zzso zzso zzso and movement are reduced in comparison to zzso zzso zzso is prolonged in zzso cells and they tend to become zzso On the basis of similar results obtained by zzso zzso and effects of zzso treatment, we propose a function for zzso in the control of zzso zzso in zzso probably through interaction with zzso Our data suggest that zzso plays an important regulatory role in the rapid zzso of the cortical zzso zzso
