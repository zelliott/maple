The zzso between zzso zzso and trees is an essential part of forest ecology and depends entirely on the communication between the two partners for establishing and maintaining the zzso The identification and characterization of zzso expressed genes is a step to identifying such signals and to understanding the regulation of this zzso We determined the role of zzso produced by zzso zzso in zzso formation and zzso zzso A zzso was zzso from culture zzso and the corresponding gene was zzso The gene is expressed in aerial zzso and in zzso By using a zzso zzso directed against a zzso found in the aerial zzso of zzso zzso we detected a zzso in the zzso between zzso zzso and its native pine host zzso zzso The zzso was found in aerial zzso of the zzso mantle and also in the zzso net zzso which form the interface between both zzso Interestingly, this was not the case in the interaction of zzso zzso with a host of low zzso the spruce zzso zzso The differential expression with respect to host was verified at the zzso level by competitive zzso The differential protein zzso pattern with respect to host zzso seen by zzso zzso can thus be attributed at least in part to zzso control of the zzso zzso
