We zzso analyzed minimal residual disease zzso in 7 children with common acute zzso leukemia zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso with ex zzso zzso followed by systemic zzso zzso After zzso 3 of the 7 patients remained in complete zzso zzso for more than 1 year, and 4 subsequently zzso zzso was estimated by zzso chain reaction amplification to detect the leukemia zzso zzso heavy chain third zzso determining region zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences from the relapsed patients were identical with those determined at each respective initial zzso In 2 patients, the levels of zzso were zzso and zzso in the harvested bone zzso zzso cells, and even after zzso the levels were zzso and zzso cells, zzso One of the 2 patients relapsed 3 months after zzso while the other remained in zzso for 33 months after zzso Among the 4 patients who subsequently relapsed after zzso zzso was not detected in the zzso samples even 1 month before zzso Our results suggest that zzso does not necessarily indicate a lower risk of subsequent zzso zzso of zzso tends to favor the assessment of the therapeutic effects rather than prediction of zzso
