The exact function and trafficking of zzso T zzso are still zzso This study was focused on using zzso analysis as an approach to understanding the zzso relationship of zzso and the trafficking of zzso between cellular zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is present in zzso birds, zzso zebra fish, and green zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso contains a zzso motif in a zzso fold, suggesting a zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the place of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in insects, zzso and zzso The zzso program recognized signal peptides in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was predicted to contain an zzso signal zzso of 19 zzso acid zzso which may be involved in targeting zzso to the zzso zzso Finally, zzso may be localized in the plasma membrane in addition to its presence in the zzso apparatus and the zzso zzso
