Human zzso zzso G zzso zzso appears to be an important zzso of zzso killing of zzso zzso zzso by human zzso zzso zzso Nearly zzso strains of zzso having variations in the structure of zzso protein 2 zzso also exhibit different levels of zzso to the lethal action of cat G in zzso zzso we examined the relationship between zzso zzso to cat G and zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that cat G has the capacity to interact with zzso as evidenced by its ability to inhibit binding of zzso to zzso We also found that changes in the zzso acid sequence within the zzso domain of zzso because of certain zzso zzso modulated such zzso We propose that zzso is an zzso target for cat G and that levels of zzso zzso to cat G may be related to zzso structure and/or zzso zzso
