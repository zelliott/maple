To present the results of the clinical and molecular analyses of a familial case of zzso zzso zzso associated with a novel zzso zzso 

Full zzso examination was performed in two zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was used for assessing anterior segment zzso zzso analysis included zzso amplification and zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso 

zzso anomalies in both affected siblings included zzso zzso glaucoma, and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso a feature that has not been previously associated with zzso was observed in both zzso zzso analysis disclosed a novel zzso zzso deletion in zzso 8 of zzso in DNA from both affected zzso 

The recognition of zzso in two siblings carrying a novel zzso zzso expands the clinical and molecular spectrum of zzso zzso
