The crystal structure of a wild type of the human soluble zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso has been determined at a resolution of zzso The structure shows a zzso in an zzso unit, which is first observed in zzso The assembly of the zzso takes a unique triple interaction mode between three zzso with a zzso network and zzso zzso Through such complicated zzso the zzso of zzso is firmly zzso The structure shows an zzso mode with a unique assembly mechanism by which the zzso of zzso can be performed without any zzso zzso bond zzso It indicated a possibility that zzso may take a unique structural organization distinct from zzso for zzso with zzso zzso In addition, the structure shows distinct zzso states of the zzso region for respective zzso of the zzso which reveal an intrinsic zzso zzso for this significant region in the structural zzso
