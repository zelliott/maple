zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from a zzso library made from zzso zzso zzso of adult rabbit zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso bond of zzso As the rabbits are classically used for the study of diet induced changes in zzso zzso as a prelude to studying the diet and age dependent changes in this zzso we have undertaken to clone it from a rabbit pancreatic zzso Three full length clones were obtained from the rabbit pancreatic library when zzso with a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso portion of the zzso One of these clones is completely zzso and zzso The sequence consists of 606 zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for 147 zzso acids which include a 15 zzso acid leader zzso and a seven zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a major zzso band at zzso When compared to zzso zzso of other species, rabbit zzso exhibited considerable conservation both at zzso and the protein zzso In zzso translation of synthetic zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso yielded a protein of apparent molecular weight of zzso similar to that predicted from its primary zzso
