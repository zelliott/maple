Natural killer zzso cell recognition and function in humans is regulated by multiple cell surface zzso The zzso signal leading to zzso cell triggering is primarily zzso by natural zzso receptors zzso Analysis of zzso cells in zzso animal models is of particular relevance because zzso cells may play an essential role in host defenses against zzso We analyzed zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso cell populations and clones by zzso using a wide panel of zzso and by zzso activity zzso In addition, zzso strategy and transient zzso were used to isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was present on zzso zzso zzso and on zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were functional in both redirected killing and in zzso masking zzso Cloning of zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes showed a high sequence similarity zzso % and 88 zzso zzso with their human zzso Attempts at identifying zzso surface zzso and at cloning the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso are highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests the possibility of a staged appearance of the zzso during zzso and provides a useful tool for the study of natural immunity zzso of protection in zzso zzso infection zzso
