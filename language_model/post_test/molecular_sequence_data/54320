The zzso zzso zzso is patterned by zzso growth factor zzso zzso of Ras to control zzso fate, and zzso fate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a spatial zzso zzso in addition to inducing zzso fate, directly contributes to zzso fate via an unknown zzso We find that in addition to its zzso zzso zzso zzso Ras zzso an exchange factor for the Ral small zzso zzso such that zzso zzso zzso zzso fate zzso zzso with its restricted expression pattern, Ral zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, we have delineated a Ras zzso mechanism zzso position within the zzso zzso dictates that Ras zzso usage is switched to zzso from zzso to promote zzso instead of zzso zzso Our observations define the utility of Ras zzso switching during normal development and may provide a possible zzso basis for cell and zzso differences in zzso dependency and zzso
