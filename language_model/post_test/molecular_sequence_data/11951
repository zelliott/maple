zzso occurrence of zzso zzso virus DNA zzso zzso integration into or in proximity to zzso zzso and in the win locus of cellular zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described by several zzso We report a further cellular locus as a zzso target for zzso integration in zzso zzso A zzso DNA integration and its cellular zzso regions were cloned from a zzso developed in a chronically zzso zzso zzso analysis showed integration of rearranged C, zzso and zzso truncated X regions of the zzso zzso located in a cellular locus previously described for zzso integration in another zzso zzso The two integration sites are only about zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso repeats and a zzso coding region, previously zzso we found several features of zzso zzso attachment zzso zzso sequences in the normal cellular zzso leading us to predict that part of it might be a previously zzso zzso
