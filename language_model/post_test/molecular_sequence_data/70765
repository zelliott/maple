zzso During routine sequencing of our mouse muscle alpha zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso we detected a zzso with the zzso database entry zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the database lists zzso which encodes a zzso while our putative zzso zzso had the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso No other sequence differences were zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso DNA confirmed that the zzso mouse alpha zzso gene has a T zzso at position zzso and, therefore, that the protein has a V at position 433 in the zzso zzso zzso In order to determine the functional consequences of this difference, either zzso zzso or zzso zzso alpha zzso were zzso in zzso cells with mouse zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso currents were recorded in zzso patches, and rate and equilibrium zzso were estimated from open and closed zzso obtained from a range of zzso zzso No significant differences were found between the zzso rate zzso or equilibrium zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests that the two zzso binding sites have similar zzso equilibrium zzso for zzso ( approximately 160 zzso in 142 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occupy a closed state that has a lifetime of approximately 1 zzso The rate zzso for entering and leaving this state do not vary with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso that causes a slow channel zzso zzso syndrome, zzso was zzso The properties of this zzso were similar with a V or an A at position zzso
