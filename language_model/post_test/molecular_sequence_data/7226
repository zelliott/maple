In response to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are converted to an zzso zzso expressing both zzso and zzso properties that include the induction of zzso zzso molecules and tissue factor zzso zzso zzso cell zzso requires a soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of zzso and zzso bacteria to induce zzso zzso and tissue factor expression through zzso pathways with cultured human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Both viable and zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not viable or zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced prominent zzso surface expression detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso factor activity on zzso indicated by factor X zzso was induced in response to zzso bacteria but not in response to zzso zzso zzso bacteria induced zzso zzso in zzso indicated by the appearance of zzso zzso and by the demonstration of zzso of zzso B, a zzso factor necessary for zzso and tissue factor gene zzso In contrast, neither zzso zzso nor zzso of zzso B was detected in zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso cell zzso by zzso bacteria in each of these zzso was inhibited with a zzso zzso zzso against zzso Furthermore, zzso cells, zzso with human zzso zzso responded to all strains of zzso bacteria zzso or heat zzso indicated by zzso zzso B zzso We conclude that zzso bacteria induce zzso cell zzso through a common zzso zzso
