zzso zzso of the bovine zzso organ zzso were studied by means of various zzso light and electron zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso Use of zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed to specify the synthesis and release of zzso zzso that bear zzso chains in their precursor forms and probably zzso zzso chains in their mature zzso zzso raised against zzso extracts were characterized by means of various tests and used to purify specific zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso contained numerous zzso zzso with Con A, their apparent molecular weight zzso ranging from 240 to 50 zzso Only two zzso were strongly labeled with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso specific of the zzso zzso at different steps of zzso showed three specific Con zzso zzso at 88, 54 and 34 zzso zzso Only the 34 zzso zzso was strongly labeled with zzso The latter could zzso to the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso fiber material allowed the detection of a zzso zzso in the upper part of the zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso when released into the zzso constitute a stable zzso
