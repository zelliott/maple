Parkinson's disease zzso is thought to be caused by environmental and genetic zzso zzso in four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso inherited forms of zzso The zzso cause for the loss of zzso cells in zzso patients, however, remains to be zzso Due to the rarity of zzso in humans with zzso the analysis of animal models might help to further gain insights into the zzso of familial zzso For zzso zzso has been described in zzso mice leading to zzso zzso and formation of zzso bodies in nerve zzso Here, we investigated the gene expression pattern of the brain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice by zzso zzso A total of 146 genes were zzso regulated by at least a zzso change with 103 being zzso and 43 being zzso compared with age and sex matched zzso zzso zzso The gene products with altered expression are involved in protein degradation, cell cycle, zzso zzso cellular structure, signal zzso and zzso zzso Most of the genes were modestly zzso which is in agreement that severe zzso of these pathways might be zzso Among the genes most significantly zzso is the zzso zzso factor which might be one aspect of the zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso of the zzso factor zzso binding protein are zzso which plays a central role in most altered zzso
