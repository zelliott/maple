The zzso factor zzso plays an important role in the zzso response in zzso coli and many other bacterial species zzso Although the zzso gene is zzso in almost every bacterial group with a wide range of evolutionary zzso its precise functions in each zzso are largely zzso More recently, it has been shown that zzso genes in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso might have distinct functions other than the regulation of the zzso zzso To gain a general understanding of the functions of zzso and its evolution in zzso we conducted the current zzso 

Our analysis indicates that six of 33 zzso zzso zzso do not harbor a zzso gene although they all zzso the key zzso response zzso suggesting that zzso is not an indispensable zzso factor in these zzso and that their zzso responses might be regulated by different zzso Our zzso analysis suggests that zzso was lost during the course of evolution in these six zzso zzso For the 26 zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso we have predicted their zzso sites and zzso using an efficient binding zzso prediction zzso that we developed zzso Our results show that zzso in most of these 26 zzso might still function as the zzso regulator of the zzso response genes as seen in zzso coli and other zzso Interestingly, putative zzso sites were also found in some zzso for some key genes involved in a variety of other biological processes including photosynthesis, drug resistance, zzso suggesting that there is zzso between the zzso response and these biological zzso In particular, zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has largely zzso from those in other zzso in the sequence zzso It is likely that zzso is no longer a regulator of the zzso response in zzso zzso zzso 

In most zzso zzso that we zzso zzso appears to function as the zzso regulator of the key zzso response zzso There are possible zzso between the zzso response and other biological zzso In some zzso zzso has adapted distinct functions, and might no longer be a regulator of the zzso response zzso In some other zzso zzso appears to have been lost during the course of zzso The loss of zzso in these zzso might lead to the degradation of its binding zzso
