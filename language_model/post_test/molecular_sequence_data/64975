This paper describes the chemical synthesis and crystal molecular zzso of a zzso zzso containing model zzso zzso The analysis revealed the existence of two zzso independent molecules A and B, in the zzso zzso zzso while the zzso of the backbone zzso angles in both molecules are remarkably similar, the signs of the corresponding zzso angles are reverse therefore, zzso us to suggest the existence of zzso zzso features in a zzso zzso zzso model zzso The critical zzso zzso angle around zzso bond of the zzso zzso represents a typical zzso orientation zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees in A and zzso zzso zzso degrees in B, providing the zzso an overall zzso shaped zzso The observed zzso contrasts markedly to those determined for the correlated zzso model zzso zzso and zzso signifying the role of zzso elements since the zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are known to strongly restrict the zzso backbone zzso in the zzso ( zzso approximately zzso degrees, zzso approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso angles of the zzso zzso fall outside the zzso regions of the zzso map and exhibit zzso twists for A and zzso The implications of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the construction of zzso novel scaffolds and peptides of biological relevance are zzso Taken together, the results indicate that in short linear zzso containing peptides specific structural changes can be induced by selective substitution of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso reinstating the hypothesis that in addition to zzso zzso the chemical nature of the neighboring zzso zzso and local environments collectively influences the stabilization of zzso behavior of the two zzso units of a zzso zzso
