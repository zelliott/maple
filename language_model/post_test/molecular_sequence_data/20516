zzso zzso is a fundamentally important second zzso for numerous zzso hormones and zzso that control gene zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso works with the zzso zzso protein zzso to regulate gene expression in pancreatic and zzso zzso zzso This zzso expressed zzso factor is known as a stress zzso We found that it also functions as a zzso of zzso a zzso gene zzso Through a mechanism that involves the zzso of exchange protein activated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to enhanced zzso and nuclear exclusion of zzso and reduced interactions between zzso or nuclear zzso and the zzso gene promoter, detected by zzso zzso In rat primary pancreatic zzso cells, zzso zzso also reduces nuclear zzso content, which causes increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our study therefore identifies a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso expression and suggests that zzso expressed zzso may play a role in zzso zzso by functioning as a sensor for zzso
