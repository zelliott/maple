In our attempt to identify zzso receptors that are related to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and are expressed in activated zzso we used zzso resulting in the isolation of a zzso zzso a seven zzso zzso termed zzso The protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of zzso coupled zzso receptors and turned out to be identical to the recently described zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso could be highly zzso in zzso and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso could be detected in all zzso virus positive B cell zzso We show that zzso of the zzso gene could be specifically induced in zzso virus negative zzso 41 cells via zzso zzso of zzso virus nuclear zzso 2, a key regulator of viral and cellular genes in immortalized B zzso Our data suggest an involvement of zzso in the regulation of migration in activated zzso and in viral zzso
