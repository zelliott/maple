We investigated the molecular forms of zzso zzso related peptides in zzso spinal zzso by high performance liquid zzso coupled with zzso using three zzso raised against zzso and zzso fragments of zzso and big zzso zzso and its oxidized form were isolated as major zzso peptides and zzso Furthermore, zzso like zzso and big zzso zzso less than zzso and less than zzso of zzso zzso were detected based on their zzso retention times and characteristics of zzso to the zzso Big zzso was only scarcely zzso zzso study showed the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso horn zzso and zzso and zzso structures in the zzso horn of zzso spinal zzso These results indicate that zzso is present not only in zzso cells but also in spinal cord, and that big zzso is converted into zzso in spinal zzso by specific processing between zzso The data also indicate that zzso may act as a zzso in the central nervous zzso
