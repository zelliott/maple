We have looked for zzso zzso in the zzso gene in 20 unrelated zzso zzso from northern Italy, all members of families in which our previous studies had indicated linkage to zzso Using zzso with primer pairs located in the 3' unique region of the gene and zzso DNA analysis, we have detected novel zzso bands in five affected individuals from the same family, which were absent in 13 other unaffected family zzso Cloning and automated DNA sequencing revealed a C to T transition at zzso position zzso of the published zzso zzso which created a premature stop zzso The zzso destroyed a zzso restriction site, and the abnormal restriction pattern was observed on zzso DNA from all the affected family zzso zzso and restriction analysis performed on peripheral white blood cell zzso showed that in the affected members, both the zzso and the normal transcript are zzso This zzso was not found in the zzso of the other families zzso To our knowledge, this is the first nonsense zzso described in the zzso zzso
