The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso To identify zzso regulated cellular genes and to evaluate their relevance to transformation and zzso in zzso cells, zzso differential display has been zzso One of the recovered zzso zzso to a gene that was highly expressed in zzso zzso Analysis of the isolated full-length zzso of a chicken zzso protein zzso revealed that it encodes a zzso protein that is highly zzso to members of the zzso family, such as human zzso Like other zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso repeats and zzso zzso finger zzso Northern zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso transcript expressed at relatively high levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso a zzso line, and zzso cells zzso the expression of zzso In contrast, zzso expression levels were low in chicken cell lines transformed by several other unrelated tumor zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso induced by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso transformed zzso cells inhibited zzso of these cells at the zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is induced during the zzso transformation process and functions as a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
