Members of the zzso family are zzso zzso zzso that exchange electrons with zzso situated at the outside of the zzso membrane or in the zzso space of many zzso They form a group of zzso zzso zzso that are essential components of several electron transport zzso for example those of zzso nitrate zzso and respiratory zzso zzso zzso of the zzso relationships of zzso proteins is scarce and only one high-resolution structure zzso zzso zzso is zzso In the present study, several zzso zzso zzso that produce zzso of zzso the membrane anchor of the zzso c zzso zzso complex, were constructed and characterized in order to improve the understanding of the putative zzso site, the maturation and function of the four zzso bound zzso c groups and the importance of the zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso acid sequence zzso a zzso model for zzso zzso zzso was constructed that zzso the overall conservation of zzso structure in spite of a low sequence zzso The results support the proposed architecture of the zzso site in zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that each zzso zzso arranged in one of the four zzso zzso zzso motifs is essential for zzso maturation in zzso zzso and indicate a limited flexibility towards the length and structure of the zzso zzso
