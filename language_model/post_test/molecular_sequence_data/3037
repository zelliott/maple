Evidence indicates that zzso of zzso D1 is an important event in zzso transformation of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso D1 is a potential target for zzso zzso of breast zzso Treatment of zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells with zzso zzso blocked progression through zzso and into S zzso Growth arrest of the zzso cells in zzso was associated with changes in the levels of several proteins that control the cell cycle, including a dramatic decrease in zzso D1 protein zzso zzso also decreased the abundance of zzso D1 zzso and nuclear zzso indicating that it regulated zzso D1 expression at the zzso zzso zzso selectively inhibited the activity of the zzso D1 and zzso A promoters but not the activity of several other control zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso response element was located in the zzso D1 core zzso Additional functional studies showed that a sequence within the core promoter zzso located downstream from the zzso zzso played an important role in zzso of the zzso D1 promoter in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated specific binding of the zzso factor zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso response element did not zzso to the zzso site but rather mapped to the zzso element zzso The overall results suggest that zzso interferes with the zzso initiation complex that assembles over the zzso D1 zzso element, leading to selective zzso of zzso D1 gene zzso
