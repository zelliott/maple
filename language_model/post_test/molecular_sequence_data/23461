We present zzso the first complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso species, zzso zzso zzso which is composed of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso along with a comparative analysis with five other zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso grouping of the six zzso zzso zzso it was found that zzso common zzso groups composed of zzso genes zzso are shared by all the zzso whereas zzso genes zzso in the zzso zzso were found to be unique to that zzso We were able to find the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ABC zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso unique zzso these may contribute to zzso by stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso results were obtained from the principal component analysis zzso of the zzso acid composition and synonymous zzso usage for highlighting the zzso signature of the zzso zzso Only in the zzso of the zzso acid composition were the zzso species located near, but were distinguishable from, the borderline distinguishing zzso from zzso on the second principal zzso Further analysis revealed some zzso zzso acid zzso between the zzso and the zzso which are possibly associated with the zzso of the zzso
