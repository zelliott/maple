In the developing zzso neural zzso cells zzso produce projection zzso of the six cortical layers in a zzso zzso Over the course of cortical zzso maintenance of zzso is essential for the generation of distinct types of zzso at the required zzso zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso proteins are central to zzso zzso it remains unclear whether other essential zzso take part in the zzso In this study, we identify zzso a gene expressed in the developing mouse zzso at early stages that encodes a 63 zzso protein that has no known structural motif except a nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso differentiation only in the early zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso causes precocious differentiation of zzso zzso of zzso is activated by the zzso active form of zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso genes without affecting the expression of zzso zzso Finally, we show that the combination of zzso and zzso maintains zzso even when zzso signaling is zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in the maintenance of zzso in the early zzso downstream of zzso
