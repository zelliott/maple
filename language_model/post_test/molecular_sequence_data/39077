The zzso zzso zzso zzso is integrated into signal zzso networks regulating zzso zzso We have identified the zzso trio gene through a zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Trio is an zzso of zzso zzso a protein that contains multiple zzso repeats and two zzso zzso zzso zzso that affect zzso zzso dynamics via the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that trio and zzso cooperate in regulating zzso outgrowth in the embryonic central nervous system zzso zzso interactions between trio and zzso failed zzso connections zzso and enabled zzso indicate that Trio is integrated into common signaling networks with these gene zzso These observations suggest a mechanism by which zzso signaling networks influence the zzso zzso in zzso growth zzso
