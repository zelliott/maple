zzso with the general structure zzso zzso is zzso derived from the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were found to serve as zzso zzso for a zzso zzso from a mouse zzso zzso fraction and implicated in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso yielded zzso for the zzso that acts in concert with the zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso showed broad pH zzso for the two zzso zzso around pH zzso for the zzso and around pH zzso for the zzso The zzso showed an absolute requirement for zzso whereas the zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso but not by zzso The zzso zzso ability of the zzso zzso increased with increasing chain zzso as reflected by the apparent zzso which was 60 zzso for a zzso but 6 zzso for a zzso By contrast, the zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso reaction was higher, approximately zzso zzso and unaffected by zzso zzso After chemical modification of the zzso to obtain mixed zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer was found to be virtually independent of the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso The zzso on the other hand, showed marked preference for an zzso with a zzso zzso zzso which would thus have a lower zzso for the zzso than the corresponding fully zzso zzso These results, along with our previous finding that chain zzso in a zzso zzso system is strongly promoted by zzso zzso of the nascent chain zzso zzso & zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso raise the possibility that the zzso and the zzso act in concert during chain zzso assembled into an zzso zzso
