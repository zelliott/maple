We have constructed a new zzso zzso by making modifications to the commonly used zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso based zzso in the long terminal repeat zzso The changes include replacement of a portion of the zzso region of the zzso zzso with a hybrid regulatory element consisting of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso together with the human zzso virus zzso response element zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso into a variety of human cell lines showed that the hybrid zzso with the zzso zzso exhibited zzso expression levels which were zzso to zzso higher than those obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso was further increased in the presence of the zzso zzso and surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso from both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso containing only the zzso element in the zzso did not respond to zzso When zzso zzso into an zzso packaging cell line, the modified zzso zzso containing the hybrid zzso plus an extended packaging signal consistently gave higher zzso of zzso than did the parental zzso based zzso Higher zzso expression levels which can be further zzso by zzso together with more efficient zzso production, suggests that the modified zzso should be superior for zzso gene therapy applications as well as for other more general applications in human gene zzso
