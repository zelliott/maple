The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a large and diverse group of genes with members found in all forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which can use steroids as carbon and energy zzso In the present investigation, we found a novel zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which is located zzso zzso upstream from zzso with the same zzso orientation in the zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of this putative zzso zzso gene consists of 771 zzso and translates into a protein of 256 zzso zzso Two consensus sequences of the zzso zzso were found, an zzso zzso zzso motif and a zzso segment zzso zzso in the zzso zzso essential for zzso activity of zzso zzso To produce zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was cloned into zzso zzso and the over expressed protein was zzso by zzso sequence on metal zzso zzso To prove that zzso is involved in the zzso zzso of steroid compounds, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Compared to the wild type zzso zzso degradation of testosterone, zzso and cholesterol were decreased in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, growth in the medium with testosterone, zzso and cholesterol was impaired in zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso is involved in steroid zzso
