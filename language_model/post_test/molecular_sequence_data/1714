Among zzso B virus zzso zzso the B and C are most prevalent in zzso To further study on the inside story of the zzso the zzso of 136 sequences from Chinese patients were analyzed either by restriction zzso length zzso on fragments or by zzso analysis and zzso on full zzso The 22 complete sequences of zzso B clustered with different zzso depending on gene fragments zzso which indicated that zzso events occurred during zzso evolutionary zzso To locate the zzso regions, the sequences of zzso entire zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso The zzso regions of B zzso with zzso were mapped in the zzso region with relatively less varied zzso Besides, three sequences of zzso C have zzso with zzso B or D in different zzso However, among all of the 136 zzso none of authentic zzso B was zzso To investigate the possible mechanism responsible for zzso zzso the selection pressure on the zzso region was estimated by using zzso zzso All models allow for positively selected sites suggest existence of positive selection zzso In conclusion, the zzso B with zzso was exclusive zzso of zzso B in zzso The mosaic zzso B might result from immune pressure on the zzso zzso
