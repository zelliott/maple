A zzso strictly zzso slightly curved zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from coastal seawater off the east coast of zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed a clear affiliation of this novel strain with the family zzso zzso zzso formed a robust cluster with the type strains of species of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso gene sequence similarity levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso shared no more than 89 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with the type strains of other species in the family zzso zzso zzso was able to grow in the presence of 2-6 % sea zzso and grew zzso at zzso degrees C and pH zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analyses and zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
