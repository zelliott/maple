zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso and contributes to disease zzso In other acute injuries, such as zzso and cerebral zzso zzso plays a significant role in zzso morbidity and zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso of the potent zzso zzso zzso B signaling zzso in zzso both reduces zzso zzso zzso and zzso a significant survival advantage compared to zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate a therapeutic approach to acutely augment zzso activity in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, activates zzso regulated zzso zzso signaling and protects zzso from numerous zzso stimuli both in zzso and in zzso zzso approaches to activate the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways may provide a novel tool to study these signaling zzso as well as a new zzso strategy for the treatment of zzso and other acute zzso
