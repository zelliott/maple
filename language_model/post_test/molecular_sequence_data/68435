zzso DNA deletion occurs at thousands of specific sites in most zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of this prominent DNA rearranging process, we analyzed one of the deletion elements (the zzso in zzso by making specific zzso in cloned zzso and testing their effects on zzso in zzso We found that a zzso zzso sequence zzso plays a crucial zzso This sequence is located at a short distance zzso 45 zzso outside of the element on either zzso zzso of it zzso the deletion zzso Moving it short distances away causes the deletion boundary to move with zzso zzso of this sequence into a site within the element zzso new boundaries to form near the zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that all new boundaries created are zzso zzso away from the zzso Thus, this sequence is necessary and sufficient to determine the boundaries of DNA zzso and it does so from a short distance outside of the zzso These results offer a possible explanation for the control of DNA deletion in zzso and suggest that a new type of mechanism for zzso DNA zzso is zzso
