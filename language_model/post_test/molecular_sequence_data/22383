Indian zzso zzso zzso is a sweet fruit that is abundantly cultivated in zzso We have previously identified 42 and 30 zzso zzso that are zzso with latex zzso from crude Indian zzso zzso This study aimed to clone the 30 zzso zzso m 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso m 1 zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The protein predicted from the zzso sequence has 330 zzso zzso the first 25 of which constituted a putative signal zzso The deduced molecular mass of the mature protein is zzso zzso while its zzso point is estimated at zzso The zzso zzso m 1 showed zzso activity, possessed zzso binding capacity, and had zzso zzso with the latex zzso Moreover, zzso zzso m 1 zzso zzso was able to detect commercial skin testing latex zzso laboratory prepared latex and Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso m 1 showed zzso skin zzso on eight zzso and Indian zzso zzso Although no sequence similarity was found to other known zzso zzso m 1 was found to have zzso acid sequence identity zzso to many plant zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso class III zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso domain search revealed that zzso m 1 belongs to the family 18 zzso zzso The zzso zzso may therefore be of value for diagnosis and therapeutic purposes, and the further characterization of Indian zzso zzso may help to zzso the mechanism underlying zzso zzso
