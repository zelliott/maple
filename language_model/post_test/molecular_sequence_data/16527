zzso reverse zzso can remove chain zzso from blocked DNA ends through a zzso zzso We show that the zzso efficiency of the removal reaction can vary several zzso in different sequence contexts and is most strongly affected by the nature of the base pair at the zzso zzso and the six base pairs upstream of zzso Similar effects of the upstream sequence were observed with zzso terminated with zzso zzso or zzso However, the removal of zzso or zzso was much less influenced by upstream zzso zzso and the rate of zzso of these zzso zzso was greater than or equal to that of the other zzso zzso in each sequence context zzso These results strongly indicate that the primer zzso and adjacent upstream base pairs interact with reverse zzso in a zzso manner that affects the removal zzso We conclude that zzso sequence context is a major factor to consider when evaluating the removal of different chain zzso by zzso reverse zzso
