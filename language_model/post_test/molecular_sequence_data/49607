In the zzso process, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the reaction of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso Although zzso has been assumed to play important roles for the zzso in zzso carbon cycles, the gene zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we report that an zzso zzso zzso protein functions as zzso in zzso zzso has four genes zzso zzso proteins and two of them zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso targeting signal 1 zzso The expression analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso information suggested that zzso was the major protein in green zzso When zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso was expressed in zzso cells, it was found to be localized to zzso depending on zzso By screening of zzso zzso zzso lines, an zzso knockout line zzso was zzso The activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso was reduced drastically and, zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity also zzso zzso zzso was detected in the wild type but not in zzso The growth rate was zzso in zzso grown under high zzso or without sugar, though differences were slight in zzso grown under low zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso resembled those of zzso zzso zzso levels increased and zzso levels decreased in zzso grown in normal air zzso Based on these results, it was concluded that zzso is targeted to zzso functions as a zzso zzso plays a markedly important role for plant growth and the metabolism of zzso zzso
