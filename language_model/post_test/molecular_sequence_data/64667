The recycling zzso zzso zzso operates as a transport zzso by zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso export of some zzso zzso zzso of cargo to zzso in the zzso requires zzso zzso release occurs in the zzso but the molecular mechanism is zzso Here we report efficient binding of zzso zzso to immobilized zzso at pH zzso the pH of the zzso but not at slightly lower zzso pH sensitivity of the zzso was more prominent when zzso zzso were zzso A zzso zzso in the center of the zzso recognition domain was required for zzso activity suggesting it may serve as a molecular zzso zzso zzso of cells inhibited the association of zzso with the known cargo zzso zzso protein and zzso of this zzso in the zzso was impaired by zzso zzso that did not impair the transport of a control zzso The results zzso the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso interaction and establish the zzso as the earliest low pH site of the zzso zzso
