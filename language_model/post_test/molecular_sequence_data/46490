zzso are zzso zzso zzso and have tolerance to zzso They can survive without food during the zzso period for several months to zzso To understand how ticks obtain energy over a long period of zzso zzso we focused on zzso a crucial zzso system via the zzso for various cellular processes that is induced during zzso in zzso In the present study, zzso databases for several zzso of the tick zzso zzso led to the identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which are essential for the zzso zzso system in model zzso zzso zzso results revealed that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the tick showed higher levels during the zzso period than the feeding period, suggesting that the zzso zzso system is at work in zzso zzso zzso their expression levels were higher in the zzso a zzso organ, of zzso than fed zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that lipids and zzso accumulated within the zzso cells of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso that the zzso of zzso ticks serves as storage of those components as nutrients during zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso The starved condition appears to be associated with the increased expression of zzso genes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso might help compensate for the loss of nutrients derived from host blood components during the zzso zzso
