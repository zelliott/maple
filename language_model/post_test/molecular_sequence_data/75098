A zzso library, prepared from zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells 4 zzso after stimulation with zzso growth factor in the presence of zzso was screened to identify zzso transcripts whose abundance is specifically increased as a primary response to growth zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clones detected by this procedure corresponded to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso One zzso zzso designated zzso was found to be derived from an zzso zzso whose abundance began to increase as early as 30 zzso after zzso DNA sequencing established the identity of this zzso as zzso Several additional zzso were then tested and found to efficiently induce zzso zzso These included fetal calf serum, zzso growth factor, and transforming growth factor type zzso For at least one zzso fetal calf serum, the increase in zzso was preceded by an increase in zzso gene zzso This increase was zzso reaching zzso levels within 10 zzso and was accompanied by zzso increases in both zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a member of a class of zzso zzso typified by zzso and including zzso whose rapid expression may be important in zzso cellular responses to zzso growth zzso
