zzso are positioned at a critical interface to prevent invasion by zzso from the zzso zzso recognition receptors are important components of innate immunity because of their ability to interact with specific zzso structures and initiate immune zzso Several distinct groups of receptors have been zzso One of these, the scavenger zzso has been classified into at least eight separate zzso The class A scavenger receptors are characterized by the presence of a zzso domain and include zzso scavenger zzso type A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These receptors are known to make important contributions to host zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso scavenger zzso zzso which has a structure typical of this zzso The zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso which predict a type II protein that contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scavenger zzso zzso rich zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells confirmed that the zzso assembles as a zzso and is expressed at the plasma zzso zzso cells bound zzso coli and zzso zzso but not zzso in a zzso zzso Unlike other class A scavenger zzso the zzso was unable to zzso zzso or oxidized low density zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrate zzso has a tissue and cellular distribution unique among class A scavenger zzso Because of the restriction of zzso transcripts to populations of zzso cells, we propose that this zzso may play important roles in the innate immune activities of these zzso
