A zzso zzso within the zzso loop of the VS zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso Replacement by any other zzso results in severe impairment of zzso yet folding of the zzso is not zzso and the zzso zzso bind the zzso with similar zzso acting as competitive zzso zzso group substitution shows that the zzso zzso on the zzso is critical, suggesting a possible role in general zzso zzso and this in zzso with the pH dependence of the reaction rate for the natural and modified zzso We propose a chemical mechanism for the zzso that involves general zzso zzso by the combination of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is closely similar to the probable mechanism of the hairpin zzso and the active site arrangements for the two zzso appear zzso zzso This has probably arisen by zzso zzso
