zzso zzso syndrome zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso channel family are associated with an increased risk of cardiac zzso 

The study population involved zzso zzso patients with 54 zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso region of 38 human zzso zzso channels were zzso An adjusted Shannon zzso score for each zzso acid zzso was calculated ranging from 0 (no zzso to zzso (full zzso Cox analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the first cardiac event zzso aborted cardiac arrest, or zzso Patients were zzso into zzso by their adjusted Shannon zzso zzso The lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a reference zzso patients with intermediate zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso had no increased risk of cardiac events zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or aborted cardiac zzso cardiac death zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and those with the highest zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly increased risk of cardiac events zzso zzso zzso P zzso and aborted cardiac zzso cardiac death zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The increased risk in patients with the highest conservation scores was independent of zzso zzso age, and zzso zzso 

zzso in highly zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso gene are associated with a significant risk of cardiac events independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
