Nuclear zzso zzso is a major zzso regulator of immune response, zzso and zzso control zzso and is zzso in inflammatory zzso disease zzso both zzso colitis zzso and Crohn's zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso screens in zzso families show evidence for linkage on zzso zzso where zzso zzso We zzso the zzso promoter, zzso 1 and all coding zzso in 10 zzso zzso and two controls, and identified six zzso zzso including a common zzso promoter zzso zzso Using zzso transmission zzso tests, we observed modest evidence for linkage zzso zzso independent of linkage, between the zzso zzso and UC in 131 out of 235 zzso zzso with UC offspring zzso This zzso was also more frequent in the 156 non-Jewish UC zzso from the 235 zzso zzso than in 149 non-Jewish controls zzso The zzso association with UC was zzso in a second set of 258 zzso non-Jewish UC cases and zzso new, non-Jewish controls zzso Nuclear proteins from normal human colon tissue and zzso cell lines, but not zzso zzso showed significant binding to zzso but not to zzso containing zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso reporter zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso into either zzso or zzso cell lines showed less promoter activity than comparable zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso we have identified the first potentially functional zzso of zzso and demonstrated its genetic association with a common human disease, zzso zzso
