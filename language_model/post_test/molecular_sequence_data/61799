zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso under strict zzso conditions using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was present as a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 67 zzso and contained zzso zzso zzso iron, zzso zzso zzso zzso about zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but no zzso The zzso activity was induced if a zzso excess of electron donors, such as zzso and/or zzso were supplied in the growth medium compared to readily available electron zzso such as zzso zzso Many zzso served as good zzso thus zzso activity obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed by a factor of less than zzso zzso parameters were determined for all zzso zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso acid sequence were used to isolate the zzso zzso gene and adjacent DNA zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso exhibited high similarities to other zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso and started from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso the gene zzso is localized whose product is similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and, thus, zzso is probably involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
