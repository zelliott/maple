Following zzso of T cells, zzso of zzso zzso occurs through a complex signaling process involving protein zzso zzso zzso and a variety of adapter molecules including zzso We have attempted to identify new signaling molecules that are important for the zzso zzso 

Using a protein interaction screening protocol based on zzso display, zzso signaling components that associate with the adapter zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using zzso reporter zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso was studied by zzso of zzso or zzso inactive zzso of zzso 

A zzso fusion containing the zzso zzso domain of zzso bound to the zzso exchange factor zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso fusion bound to the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in zzso cells zzso both zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, zzso was found to be expressed predominantly in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso bone zzso and fetal zzso Two human zzso lines, zzso and zzso expressed both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso activity initiated by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, two other zzso inactive zzso zzso or zzso had no zzso 

These data demonstrate a novel interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and are consistent with a negative regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso
