zzso and zzso species of zzso were examined for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of a zzso internal DNA zzso of zzso by zzso demonstrated the presence of the gene in zzso and in two closely related gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not in the more zzso related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were all negative for zzso An zzso zzso of water extracts with zzso zzso confirmed these zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso termed zzso are very similar, having identical zzso motifs zzso also, the zzso zzso properties of zzso and zzso cells were zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso termed zzso compared to that of zzso contained a zzso zzso substitution zzso to zzso also, there was zzso in five consecutive zzso from 10 to 14 zzso upstream from the zzso We conclude that these zzso zzso in zzso are probably responsible for the difference in zzso recognition of this zzso as evidenced by the resistance of zzso zzso to zzso with zzso These results are consistent with the biological similarity between the natural zzso of zzso and zzso zzso human and zzso zzso and the zzso between these hosts and the zzso host, the zzso
