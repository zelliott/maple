zzso isotope zzso has recently become a popular tool for the quantitative profiling of the zzso especially the emergence and development of the zzso zzso isotope zzso with zzso acids in cell zzso zzso Here we have expanded the application of zzso to comparison of the relative protein expression levels between two different states of zzso based on cultured cells with zzso zzso as an internal standard in mass zzso The zzso ratio of tissue proteins versus zzso cells was determined by the calculation of peak intensity of the pair of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from the mass zzso and the relative expression level of proteins in two groups of zzso was estimated by calculating the ratio of their zzso zzso To validate our zzso differential zzso analysis for zzso we successfully compared two known zzso one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso versus human normal kidney zzso which was previously confirmed by other groups using conventional two-dimensional PAGE zzso Furthermore, we identified a previously unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso 4 zzso 1), in zzso zzso zzso by this zzso quantitative zzso method, which was also validated by zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the application of the zzso quantitative technique can be effectively expanded to comparison of the expression levels for the tissue zzso at different states, which would help us to identify new candidate zzso for zzso
