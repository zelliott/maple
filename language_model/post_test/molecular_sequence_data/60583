A cellular zzso also called zzso and zzso is a recently discovered gene family that encodes protein with zzso and zzso zzso We have reported the identification of human zzso zzso novel zzso family proteins that we named zzso and zzso because of their structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The Human Gene zzso Committee assigned the gene symbols zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso Here we report the isolation of three novel zzso zzso zzso the proteins closely related to the human zzso zzso and zzso Their zzso locations in the mouse were identified by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso genes were in good accordance with the location of each human zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that three zzso zzso that we have isolated are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that all of these three zzso zzso were highly expressed in the mouse zzso The structures of these zzso proteins strongly suggest that they could function as zzso zzso The implications of the cellular zzso in neural development are zzso
