Two distinct zzso zzso genes are isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso and those structures are zzso There are three zzso zzso producing two zzso acid differences between zzso A and zzso B, and those are corresponding to two of the known eight variable zzso among zzso zzso Both zzso A and zzso B are constructed from six zzso and five zzso and the positions of zzso are zzso The positions of zzso of zzso are also identical with those of zzso zzso except third zzso The third zzso of zzso are inserted at zzso upstream when compared with zzso zzso Thus, sliding of the third zzso might have occurred in only the zzso lineage prior to the gene zzso that also occurred only in that zzso In addition, with the comparison of the zzso positions, we attempt to investigate the zzso of zzso during the evolution of zzso zzso
