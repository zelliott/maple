The type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso represents an important zzso in maintaining zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we identified two zzso transcripts of the mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterized by the presence of alternative first zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso structure analysis revealed that the zzso gene comprises of two promoters zzso 1 and 2) and 14 zzso and spans approximately 17 zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso levels of both the zzso markedly decreased in zzso vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso mice compared to normal zzso Interestingly, zzso activity of a reporter zzso containing zzso promoters 1 and 2, was zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso and its zzso The deletion analysis revealed that the zzso box in the zzso promoter 2 is important for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reporter zzso These data suggested that two alternative promoters control the zzso expression of zzso gene and both zzso zzso transcripts are down regulated in zzso zzso
