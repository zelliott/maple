zzso have been shown to play important roles in helping cells to cope with adverse zzso especially in response to zzso In this study a novel zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated from zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a 1965 zzso open reading frame zzso 655 zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein showed high identities to zzso from other zzso zzso studies revealed more significant zzso of zzso transcripts in leaves and stems than in roots, barks and zzso The zzso of zzso was induced by zzso heat treatment and low temperature stress, whereas zzso acid had little zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso the light scattering of zzso zzso revealed that zzso prevents the zzso of zzso during zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed that zzso had protective functions not only against heat stress but also against chilling zzso All these data suggest that zzso may play roles in responses to heat shock and low temperature in zzso zzso
