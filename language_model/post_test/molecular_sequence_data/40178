zzso zzso is one of the major serum proteins in the early life of zzso We have previously identified a novel zzso element designated as zzso at the zzso region of the zzso gene and demonstrated that the zzso sequence can be specifically recognized by nuclear protein zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used DNA affinity zzso to purify the zzso proteins from the nuclear extracts zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex mainly contained five zzso with molecular weights of 45, 42, 32, 30, and 20 zzso zzso The identification of these proteins was determined by zzso mass zzso analysis and a database zzso These proteins were found to belong to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso (30 zzso one of five proteins in an isolated zzso complex, was matched with zzso acid sequence highly similar to zzso The expression of this protein is zzso by zzso and the pattern of the protein expression is the same as zzso proteins in zzso cells after treatment with zzso during zzso Our results suggest that the zzso protein is a novel zzso of zzso family and is the main component of the zzso complex that binds to the zzso zzso
