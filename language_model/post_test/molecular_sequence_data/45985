The zzso protein zzso a component of the zzso zzso system, plays a key role in carbon regulation in enteric bacteria, such as zzso coli and zzso zzso The zzso state of zzso zzso transport and metabolism of a number of zzso When zzso as preferred carbon source is zzso zzso becomes predominantly zzso and zzso zzso several zzso including the zzso zzso cassette transport system zzso in a process termed zzso zzso We have mapped the binding surface of zzso that interacts with the zzso zzso by using synthetic zzso zzso zzso like pep zzso and zzso zzso Three regions zzso two binding sites were identified encompassing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Region III is zzso whereas zzso from regions I and II partly overlap but are not identical to the binding zzso for interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results were fully verified by studying the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso at positions representative of each of the three regions on the zzso activity of the zzso zzso transport complex zzso into zzso Moreover, a synthetic zzso encompassing zzso zzso was demonstrated to partially inhibit zzso zzso We also show for the first time that the zzso domain of zzso is essential for zzso zzso
