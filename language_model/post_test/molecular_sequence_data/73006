zzso are zzso of zzso and potent zzso of liver alcohol zzso They can be used for structural studies and for zzso the metabolism of alcohols that form toxic zzso We studied zzso zzso that bind to the zzso complex and act as uncompetitive zzso against varied zzso of ethanol zzso zzso values, at pH 8 and 25 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lower affinity of zzso and zzso can be explained by zzso hindrance with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with Ala in the zzso zzso zzso which resembles the natural zzso of zzso improved binding of zzso by zzso The structures of horse liver zzso zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso were determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso In both complexes, the zzso zzso of the zzso bind to the zzso zinc and form a hydrogen bond to the zzso group of zzso of the zzso The zzso rings bind in zzso but zzso positions that zzso zzso zzso The binding modes of the zzso zzso appear to resemble the zzso complexes of the analogous zzso with the zzso face of the zzso carbon suitably positioned to accept a hydrogen from zzso
