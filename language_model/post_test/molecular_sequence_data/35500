The zzso zzso zzso encounter structure zzso zzso the zzso to zzso and contains four structural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein may play a role in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains lacking any of zzso zzso or zzso are known to show a variety of zzso defects including altered zzso zzso and defects in the assembly of zzso proteins into the zzso outer zzso Here we examine zzso complex components in zzso zzso and show that zzso is an zzso membrane protein containing a zzso zzso near its zzso that is zzso in the class zzso The zzso occurs in the zzso domain of the protein and is involved in the formation of zzso bonds that give rise to zzso zzso zzso formation is required for efficient assembly of zzso into the TOM zzso However, no effects are seen on zzso assembly or zzso zzso This demonstrates a specificity of function and suggests a direct role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a highly zzso region in the zzso domain of zzso results in moderate defects in zzso and zzso zzso as well as a slight zzso zzso Previous reports have not examined the role of zzso with respect to zzso protein import and zzso Here we show that absence of zzso affects assembly of zzso proteins and that lack of any zzso structural component results in defects in zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso has no effect on the assembly of these proteins but does affect zzso zzso
