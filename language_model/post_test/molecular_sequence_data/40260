Factor zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso by basic pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 185 zzso zzso was zzso more potent than zzso in zzso zzso but both exhibited similar zzso against zzso Studies of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso site swap zzso zzso K, zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso by zzso and zzso site swap zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso conform to a zzso slow zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso by zzso follows a classical, competitive zzso zzso zzso of zzso impaired zzso zzso by zzso K zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso R zzso and had no effect on zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site of either zzso or zzso zzso high affinity and specificity for zzso whereas either zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a highly specific inhibitor of zzso among zzso zzso but the flexibility of zzso renders it susceptible to zzso by both zzso and zzso forms of zzso and zzso
