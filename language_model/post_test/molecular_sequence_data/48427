zzso wheat displays limited genetic zzso As a direct A and B zzso donor of zzso zzso zzso wheat represents an important gene pool for cultivated bread zzso Many disease resistant genes express zzso zzso of the zzso site and zzso repeats zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso gene locating on zzso zzso from zzso wheat variety Italy zzso and designated it zzso Its open reading frame was zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid protein with a complete zzso domain and 18 zzso repeats, sharing zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso expression was continuously seen at low levels and was highest in zzso zzso has another zzso zzso with a 4 zzso deletion at position zzso in other zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso as a B zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were zzso In all six species of zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that all zzso type genes were grouped in one zzso We speculate that zzso was derived from a zzso zzso and it happened in zzso zzso Both types of zzso participated in zzso wheat zzso However, only the zzso was retained in zzso zzso
