With the aid of zzso fusion zzso the in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso It is shown that expression of this gene can be induced with a variety of DNA damaging agents, as well as with agents that interfere with DNA zzso For this zzso the presence of an active zzso protein is zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene showed that its open reading frame is preceded by an zzso suggesting a regulation of its zzso similar to the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso
