zzso zzso is an zzso protein and belongs to the serum zzso zzso It has broad spectrum zzso action, and it is found in zzso zzso including zzso The sequence of the bovine zzso gene promoter was analyzed in five different cattle breeds zzso zzso New Zealand zzso zzso zzso and Norwegian zzso to determine the extent of zzso variation, which exists in this region both within and across cattle zzso Fifteen different single zzso zzso zzso were identified throughout this zzso Numerous zzso were found throughout the zzso zzso New Zealand zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most frequently encountered zzso found in all breeds was at position zzso which is immediately zzso to the zzso box of the zzso The most variable base position was zzso which included three types of zzso including a single base deletion in one zzso and three zzso zzso This zzso occurs in a putative zzso factor binding site, for the nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso A unique zzso was identified in one zzso animal, and three zzso were found in one zzso zzso In general, Norwegian Red cattle displayed fewer zzso than other zzso Most zzso changes in these animals were within the 190 base pairs of the zzso start point, with the exception of an zzso seen in three animals at position zzso In conclusion, zzso were found in abundance throughout this regulatory zzso Whether or not these zzso have an effect on the regulation of the bovine zzso gene is yet to be zzso However, the identification of zzso promoter zzso may serve as a marker for healthier animals, thereby accelerating the improvement of animals through zzso
