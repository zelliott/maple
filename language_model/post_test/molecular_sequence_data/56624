An analogue of zzso has been zzso consisting of two zzso units linked zzso to a zzso zzso zzso by means of two and three zzso zzso zzso to DNA and synthetic zzso of zzso analogue containing three zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso analogue zzso has been zzso It is shown that this zzso analogue zzso a copper zzso with zzso zzso similar to a free zzso zzso It is found that this zzso analogue occupies 3 to 4 base pairs upon binding to zzso and zzso zzso irrespective of whether it binds in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and binding site sizes have been calculated for zzso analogue complexes with DNA, zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso ratio equal to 0 and zzso In the zzso system including zzso and zzso cooperative effects are recognized which can be explained by zzso generation on interaction of zzso and zzso at adjacent binding zzso
