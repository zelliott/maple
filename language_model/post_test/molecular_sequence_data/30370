zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of its own promoter has been zzso At term, zzso of zzso zzso is specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso yet these genes show more than zzso sequence similarity at the zzso zzso By using stable gene transfer of intact zzso and zzso genes into rat zzso zzso cells, synthesis and release of zzso and zzso are zzso This suggests that zzso as well as zzso is zzso during zzso The zzso zzso level is higher than that observed from the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, a hybrid gene containing zzso zzso DNA was less active than a hybrid zzso gene containing equivalent sequences after transient zzso of these zzso This zzso with the binding of a known zzso factor to a zzso region zzso of the zzso promoter, and not the equivalent zzso gene zzso These results indicate that differential expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells is zzso in part, to the strength of their respective zzso and suggest a similar mechanism may exist in the zzso
