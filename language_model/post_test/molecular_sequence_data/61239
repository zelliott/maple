zzso of the plant cell surface occurs during the establishment of cell zzso cellular zzso and organ zzso This report demonstrates the existence of multiple zzso zzso proteins in the model plant zzso Using two-dimensional sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso we also show that zzso proteins are a relatively abundant class of protein and that they are present at the plant plasma zzso Furthermore, some of these proteins are released into the zzso zzso At least one of these is an zzso protein zzso a class of proteins known to be associated with cellular zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequences of two novel zzso proteins from zzso predicts that these proteins contain consensus signals for zzso zzso These findings support a model where zzso proteins are involved in the generation of specialized cell surfaces and zzso signaling zzso
