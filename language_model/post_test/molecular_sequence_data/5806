zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso which are activated by raising the zzso zzso concentration zzso and blocked by zzso We found that zzso zzso inhibited these currents in a zzso zzso manner zzso zzso concentration approximately equal to zzso zzso The zzso effects could be zzso by the zzso zzso The effects of zzso were blunted by the zzso zzso and reversed by removing zzso from the zzso solution zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso based on sequences of known zzso receptors zzso were used in reverse zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products displayed zzso zzso zzso sequence identity to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein was further confirmed by zzso and zzso Thus zzso cells express zzso receptors of zzso and possibly zzso zzso These receptors may couple to zzso zzso currents through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso pathways in these zzso
