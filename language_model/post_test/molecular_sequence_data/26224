In zzso zzso reactions zzso by zzso zzso the right and left arms of the zzso site are always zzso to the correct zzso This poses the problem of how zzso zzso the two sites correctly for the zzso zzso We show that the zzso binding zzso II and III of zzso are important for correct alignment of the adjoining crossover zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II and III from one of the two zzso sites removes a barrier to zzso between incorrectly aligned crossover zzso zzso alignment does not require any DNA sequence asymmetry in the crossover zzso DNA zzso or zzso linkage of the two zzso zzso Our results suggest that correct zzso I alignment is determined by local, zzso interactions of zzso II and III of both partners, consistent with a current model of the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso selectivity for zzso resolution in a zzso zzso does not require zzso II and III in both zzso zzso
