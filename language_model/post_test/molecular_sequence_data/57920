The effects of zzso zzso or terminal zzso zzso or zzso zzso modifications on mouse zzso cell surface zzso zzso and degradation were studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest cell binding and zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso Competition studies indicated that zzso have an increased affinity for cell membrane zzso binding sites, because they could completely block zzso binding at a zzso ratio of just zzso zzso of all zzso was higher in B cells than T cells and was increased by stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso Although our cells had been zzso using conventional techniques to eliminate dead cells, there remained about zzso of cells that were dead or dying, as determined by flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso Of note, zzso association with dead cells was approximately zzso greater than that with living zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso in living cells were zzso and indicated little nuclear zzso by 4 zzso While extensive degradation of zzso zzso was apparent by 4 zzso there was no zzso degradation of zzso zzso or zzso
