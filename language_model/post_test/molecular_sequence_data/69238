A DNA zzso from the zzso zzso zzso cloned in zzso zzso was derived independently from clones zzso 20 and zzso L zzso et zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA to the zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated preferential zzso of the zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and to zzso zzso of zzso II, IV and X at the zzso zzso Copy number per zzso zzso for zzso zzso was estimated as approximately zzso Based on Southern zzso the major portion of this moderate repeat was localized in the region of a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso to zzso zzso from strain zzso zzso revealed that repeats zzso to zzso zzso are located in the zzso zzso which zzso structural reorganization during tissue zzso The zzso sequence of two segments of the clone zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso clone revealed that it contains zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso AT box, recognition sites for nuclear factors zzso and zzso and a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence shares zzso with the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and may code for a zzso of 10 zzso The zzso sequence was found to contain two direct repeats showing zzso to the human zzso zzso
