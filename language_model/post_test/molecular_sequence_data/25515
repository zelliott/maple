We report the molecular zzso zzso zzso sequence and zzso assignment of the zzso zzso gene zzso This gene zzso a zzso protein that was zzso at a low level during growth on zzso and was induced zzso upon zzso zzso When zzso withdrawal was accompanied by the addition of fatty acids the induction was enhanced an additional two- to zzso The zzso gene product was identified as a soluble protein and zzso using a combination of gel zzso and zzso exchange zzso Using zzso as zzso zzso we have isolated the zzso gene and zzso the single, long open reading frame which is zzso zzso in length and is not interrupted by zzso The zzso gene directed the zzso of a zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was further enhanced twofold by the addition of zzso We have localized the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso zzso
