The super induction of zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso response of human solid tumors to the zzso The zzso response is a zzso specific response and is modulated at the level of increased zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso The human zzso region zzso zzso containing the coding sequence of zzso has been cloned and localized to the zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicates the zzso of zzso starts 179 bases upstream from the zzso start site and appears to be under the control of a zzso zzso The availability of this human clone will facilitate the direct functional examination of the zzso zzso
