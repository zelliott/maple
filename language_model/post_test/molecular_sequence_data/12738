We have isolated and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso carry a zzso zzso but beyond that differ considerably in their zzso zzso One obvious distinction resides in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at position 37 in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to study the potential zzso activity of zzso we used in zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts in which an internal zzso stop zzso had been placed in either the tobacco rattle virus zzso or tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso In zzso translation was carried out in a zzso and zzso wheat germ zzso Both zzso zzso stimulate zzso over the zzso stop zzso however, zzso zzso is more efficient than the zzso zzso The zzso in the two viral zzso contexts is suppressed to about the same extent by either of the two zzso whereas zzso in the zzso context is not recognized at zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso requires an unconventional zzso base pair in the zzso position, as zzso earlier for plant zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso stop zzso This is the first case that a zzso zzso has been characterized as a natural zzso zzso
