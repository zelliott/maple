zzso zzso during the zzso period could have had a profound impact on the origin of tropical species by the zzso of zzso isolation and zzso gene flow zzso However, whether tropical zzso involves strictly zzso isolation, or proceeds in the face of zzso gene flow, is relatively zzso Here, we investigated geographical modes of zzso in four closely related zzso zzso species endemic to the zzso and tropical East Asian islands using zzso analyses of a zzso data zzso The reconstructed zzso demonstrated distinct species status for each of the four species and the existence of two sister species pairs, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The species divergence time of the sibling zzso zzso dates back to within the last one zzso of the Middle to Lower zzso The zzso between the zzso zzso zzso of Taiwan and the less numerous zzso zzso of the zzso islands occurred despite significant zzso zzso gene flow, which is strongly inconsistent with a strictly zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the approximately zzso populations of zzso zzso of the southeast Asian mainland and zzso zzso of zzso is zzso to have involved zzso divergence without gene zzso Our findings suggest that differential selection of natural or sexual environments is a prominent driver of species divergence in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas for tropical zzso zzso and zzso zzso at lower latitudes, zzso isolation may well be a pivotal promoter of species zzso
