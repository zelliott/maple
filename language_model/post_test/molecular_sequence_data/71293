We evaluated the effects of in zzso exposure of zzso to synthetic zzso zzso which represents a zzso acid sequence within rat zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which an extract of zzso egg served as the binding zzso zzso suspensions were incubated with zzso zzso (six to eight zzso 0 and zzso zzso at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes, diluted zzso or zzso 20 times, and placed onto zzso zzso After 60 minutes at 37 degrees C, zzso zzso were washed away and the DNA of bound zzso was zzso Percentage of zzso bound was independent of the percentage of zzso zzso but zzso zzso did not zzso For fresh human zzso zzso zzso the percentage of zzso bound was increased by exposure to 640 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For 11 of 25 samples, the percentage of zzso bound for the zzso exposed to 640 zzso zzso was zzso or zzso zzso times the value for a 0 zzso control zzso With zzso human zzso for six of seven samples, binding was zzso or zzso zzso times greater after exposure to 640 zzso zzso For zzso zzso held for approximately 24 hours at approximately 18 degrees C before use zzso zzso there was a higher percentage of zzso bound for zzso previously exposed to zzso zzso zzso than there was for control zzso zzso zzso zzso For 16 of 28 samples, exposure to zzso increased the percentage of zzso bound by zzso or zzso zzso zzso For zzso bull zzso percentage of zzso bound was zzso or zzso zzso times greater for 4 of 10 samples that were briefly exposed to 160 zzso zzso Clearly, human, zzso and bull zzso were zzso modified by brief in zzso exposure to zzso zzso so that for many samples a greater percentage of zzso was bound in zzso As presented in an accompanying paper, fertility of bull zzso was increased by brief exposure to zzso zzso
