zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the soil of a zzso field in South Korea and characterized in order to determine its zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso and had the highest degree of sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that strain zzso possesses a zzso system with zzso as the zzso compound and zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso iso and zzso : 1) iso zzso as the zzso zzso fatty zzso all of which zzso the assignment of the strain to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests clearly demonstrated that strain zzso represents a distinct zzso Based on these data, it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified as the type strain of a novel zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
