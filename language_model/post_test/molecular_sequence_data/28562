The zzso domain containing the zzso binding site of the G zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso consists of two zzso that close upon zzso zzso In this study, we explored the zzso binding pocket of the Group III zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The selection of 16 zzso was guided by a molecular model of zzso which was based on the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso 74 and 405 are present on lobe I of zzso The zzso of zzso 405 to zzso virtually eliminated the binding of the zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso which is zzso in all eight zzso likely represents a fundamental recognition zzso for zzso binding to the zzso Single point zzso of zzso 74 or zzso which are not zzso in the zzso to zzso had no effect on zzso zzso whereas zzso of both zzso together caused a loss of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 74 in zzso or the analogous zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso at this zzso produced a large decrease in zzso The reduction in binding is likely due to zzso hindrance of the zzso side chain of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso which is present on lobe II and is not zzso in the zzso family, caused a loss of zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso of high affinity zzso binding are dispersed across zzso I and zzso Our results define a zzso within the binding pocket that encompasses several positively charged zzso acids that recognize the zzso charged zzso group of zzso or the zzso compound zzso
