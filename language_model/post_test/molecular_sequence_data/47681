zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso to protein zzso A zzso proteins zzso through regulatory zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso determined that zzso zzso acids at three zzso positions are required for binding of zzso to zzso domain B and zzso to zzso zzso A zzso at the middle position reversed the binding specificity of both zzso and zzso at this same position of the zzso domain A of zzso converted it into either an zzso or zzso binding zzso This suggests that zzso zzso acids at three zzso positions within the primary sequence and an zzso zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with the size of the zzso side chain at the middle position determining zzso or zzso binding zzso
