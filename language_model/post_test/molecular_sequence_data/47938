zzso coli zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso acid from zzso and zzso zzso The active site of the zzso zzso acid zzso coli zzso was localized to its zzso zzso The bacterial zzso acid zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso at their zzso Several basic zzso have been identified at or near the active site of the zzso coli zzso by chemical modification and zzso zzso Only one of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso appears to be essential for zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso motif results in an inactive zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso motif appears to be an zzso zzso based on the following zzso Substituting zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in inactive zzso indicating that this zzso is required for zzso zzso The zzso zzso was partially active, demonstrating that a positive charge is required at this zzso zzso kinetic analysis reveals changes in zzso zzso and zzso for zzso which implicates zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
