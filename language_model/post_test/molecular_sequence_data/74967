zzso screening of a zzso library from the zzso rat zzso cell line previously revealed a zzso clone 73, whose corresponding zzso is induced by nerve growth factor zzso zzso parallels zzso zzso differentiation from a zzso zzso to a sympathetic zzso zzso We report that DNA sequence analysis reveals that clone 73 zzso encodes an intermediate filament zzso protein whose predicted zzso acid sequence is distinct from the known sequences of other members of the IF protein zzso The sequence has highest zzso with zzso and zzso and includes the highly zzso central zzso rod domain with the characteristic zzso repeat of zzso zzso but has lower zzso in the zzso head and zzso tail zzso The head domain contains a large number of zzso zzso which are potential zzso zzso The expression of clone 73 in zzso in the nervous system of the adult rat was investigated by in zzso zzso of clone 73 zzso to tissue zzso The zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso of the peripheral nervous system, including the superior cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso root zzso zzso In the central nervous system, motor zzso of zzso nerves III, IV, zzso zzso zzso X, and zzso as well as zzso horn motor zzso and a restricted set of other central nervous system zzso express the clone 73 zzso zzso apart from those of the nervous system did not in general express the zzso with only very low levels detected in adrenal zzso We discuss the implications of these results for the mechanism of zzso zzso cell zzso the pathways of zzso development in zzso and the possible function of the clone 73 IF protein and its relationship to other IF zzso
