zzso of the open reading frame 2 zzso of the human respiratory zzso virus zzso gene zzso at one of the three initiation zzso located upstream of the termination zzso for the first zzso Replacement of zzso with the major zzso of the zzso zzso reporter gene followed by systematic zzso of the putative initiation zzso demonstrated the usage of these zzso as the zzso initiators for zzso expression both in zzso and in zzso While the efficiency of translation was maintained when only the first and second zzso zzso were preserved in zzso there was no apparent preference in zzso for any of the three zzso when only one was zzso zzso studies showed that the location of the termination zzso of zzso protein plays a crucial role in directing translation of zzso from the upstream initiation zzso in zzso This indicates that the second zzso is zzso by the zzso that are departing from the first zzso and that these zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso to the point of translation zzso
