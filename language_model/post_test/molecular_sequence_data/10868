We have investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to the drug zzso in zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to generate resistant zzso which were divided into three different zzso zzso The resistant zzso in these groups was found to be caused by zzso forms of the genes zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene encodes an AAA zzso associated to a variety of cellular zzso protein of unknown function, while zzso and zzso zzso two zzso regulatory proteins involved in zzso drug resistance zzso The isolated zzso and zzso zzso carry zzso that lead to a zzso and a zzso exchange, zzso In addition, we report that zzso of zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso results in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso resistance is dependent on the presence of functional zzso and zzso zzso although zzso had a more pronounced zzso These results provide the first evidence for a functional link between the zzso stress response zzso and zzso development of zzso drug zzso
