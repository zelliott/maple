zzso of zzso zzso that possess improved specificity towards zzso compared with zzso at the zzso position of small zzso zzso were zzso for their ability to bind zzso inhibitor zzso The binding of the inhibitor with zzso zzso and with zzso as the zzso zzso parallels the zzso of zzso zzso There is a linear relationship between the free energy of binding of the transition state of the zzso and the free energy of binding of the inhibitor with a slope of zzso The data suggest that the inhibitor uses predominantly ground state rather than transition state binding zzso
