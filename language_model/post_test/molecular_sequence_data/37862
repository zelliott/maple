We have determined the three-dimensional structure of 6, zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the infectious zzso of the disease zzso in zzso This zzso zzso the formation of 6, zzso the penultimate product in the synthesis of zzso The three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso has been solved and refined at zzso A resolution to a final zzso of zzso zzso The zzso assembly of the zzso differs from that of the zzso from zzso zzso the only other zzso zzso structure zzso While the protein from zzso zzso assembles into a 60 zzso zzso zzso built from 12 zzso units, the zzso from zzso zzso is zzso in its zzso zzso Nonetheless, the active sites of the two zzso are virtually identical indicating zzso to zzso zzso could be effective pharmaceuticals across a broad species zzso Furthermore, we compare the structures of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and describe the C zzso structure which accounts for the differences in zzso zzso
