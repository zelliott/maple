zzso acid binding proteins are considered to be promising vaccine candidates against zzso In order to provide additional information about their function in zzso zzso we performed a comparative analysis of zzso and zzso two zzso with quite different zzso points of zzso and zzso and zzso sequence zzso Both are expressed in the juvenile and adult zzso but differ in their zzso zzso In addition, the sequence of zzso is identical in zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating the zzso functional importance in this zzso zzso zzso produced against soluble zzso zzso reacted with 14 zzso zzso in crude worm, soluble egg, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso were located in the zzso of the zzso but in addition, zzso was abundant in zzso and zzso while zzso was abundant in zzso cells, eggs, and zzso zzso Mass zzso identified zzso and zzso in the zzso product whereas only zzso was identified in egg zzso zzso samples of an zzso infected rabbit reacted from week 6 zzso with zzso and from week 12 with zzso while zzso of infected sheep were not zzso The results suggest differences in the biological functions of these 2 zzso and differences in the zzso interaction that should be considered for their potential as vaccines against zzso
