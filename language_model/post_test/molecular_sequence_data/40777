The identification of zzso zzso for the orphan nuclear zzso zzso will enable studies of its role as a zzso sensor and regulator of zzso and zzso zzso We describe the development of a zzso zzso measuring the interaction between zzso and a zzso from the nuclear zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to identify a small zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso that was competitive with zzso In cells, 1 zzso as a zzso zzso in cells to inhibit expression of the zzso target gene zzso In addition, 1 zzso the expression of zzso genes in liver cells and reduced zzso output in primary zzso zzso 1 is useful as a chemical tool to probe the function of zzso in zzso repression, regulation of zzso biology, and zzso zzso Additionally, 1 may serve as a starting point for design of zzso chemical zzso with in zzso pharmacological zzso
