zzso zzso and zzso arthritis are zzso zzso which are strongly associated with zzso Despite intensive investigation, the basis for this association is not zzso However, in recent years one favored hypothesis to explain this linkage has been that of molecular zzso zzso sharing of linear or zzso zzso common to microbial zzso and host zzso During the past few years several examples of molecular mimicry between zzso and microbial zzso have been zzso Heat shock zzso among others, have been considered as target candidates for zzso phenomena, because of the high degree of zzso between bacterial and zzso zzso zzso arthritis triggered by zzso or zzso provides a unique model for studying the zzso mechanisms underlying human inflammatory joint diseases in general, because the zzso microbes are known and zzso We have described two bacterial proteins that share zzso acid zzso with zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso outer surface proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the area of identity of these zzso acid sequences is located in the same place on the zzso zzso as a zzso identical between zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso shared by a zzso zzso protein and zzso We have investigated immune responses to a panel of synthetic peptides based on the zzso portions of zzso zzso in patients with zzso arthritis and zzso zzso One third of the patients have zzso to the synthetic zzso However, instead of recognizing the zzso portion, the zzso are directed against the zzso sequences of the synthetic zzso The concept of the role of molecular mimicry between zzso and microbial zzso in the zzso of zzso is discussed, with a conclusion that no convincing evidence for its significance exists at the zzso
