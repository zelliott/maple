During the process of zzso fusion with the target cell, the zzso zzso repeat zzso of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso repeat zzso to form zzso zzso bundle zzso zzso We previously identified a crucial zzso for zzso formation and virus zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso zzso It can form an important salt bridge with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we found another important zzso zzso for virus fusion and entry, zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso which forms a hydrogen bond with a polar zzso zzso zzso in zzso as a part of the zzso zzso zzso can also form a salt bridge with a zzso charged zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso Ala zzso or the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso resulted in disruption of the hydrogen bond network, breakage of the salt bridge and reduction of zzso stability, leading to impairment of viral fusion and decreased zzso of zzso an zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso with substitution of zzso for Ala zzso or zzso zzso also exhibited reduced zzso activity against zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the positively charged zzso zzso and its hydrogen bond network, together with the salt bridge between zzso and zzso are important for viral fusion and entry and may therefore serve as a target for designing novel zzso zzso zzso
