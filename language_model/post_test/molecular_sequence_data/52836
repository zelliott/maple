The zzso outer membrane proteins zzso of zzso zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine all the zzso gene sequences and their zzso zzso There were 21 members of the zzso zzso family located in a zzso DNA zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso genes each contained zzso zzso with zzso spaces of zzso zzso All the genes were complete and were predicted to have a signal zzso The molecular masses of the mature proteins were predicted to be zzso The zzso acid sequence identity of the zzso proteins was zzso Ten zzso genes were investigated for zzso activity by using zzso amplification of zzso Six of 10 tested zzso genes were actively transcribed in zzso grown zzso zzso zzso also indicated that each of the zzso genes was zzso These results suggest that the zzso genes are active genes and zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso The zzso were divergent among zzso of zzso zzso zzso The large repertoire of the zzso genes in a single zzso zzso and zzso diversity of the zzso among the zzso of zzso zzso suggest that zzso may be involved in immune zzso
