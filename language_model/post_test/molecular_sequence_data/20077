To understand key processes governing defense mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso upon infection with the rust fungus zzso zzso we used combined zzso and molecular techniques to describe the infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves by compatible and incompatible zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso infection were observed after zzso zzso zzso between compatible and incompatible zzso No zzso oxygen species production could be detected at infection sites, while a strong zzso of zzso occurred in the incompatible interaction after 48 zzso indicating a late plant response once the fungus already penetrated host cells to form zzso infection zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and sequencing of zzso were used to determine changes in gene expression in both interactions at 48 zzso zzso expression profiling of zzso transcripts was further compared by zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Among zzso significantly zzso expressed transcripts in the incompatible interaction, 150 showed an increase in concentration zzso or zzso whereas 62 were decreased by zzso or zzso zzso transcripts corresponded to known genes targeted by R genes in plant zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the transcript showing the highest zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein with no known zzso In contrast, only a few transcripts showed an altered expression in the compatible interaction, suggesting a delay in defense response between incompatible and compatible interactions in zzso This comprehensive analysis of early molecular responses of zzso to zzso zzso infection identified key genes that likely contain the fungus proliferation in zzso zzso from the zzso library described in this article can be retrieved in zzso under zzso numbers CT zzso to CT zzso and CT zzso
