zzso bean zzso contains a well known acid zzso activity that is associated with the oil body zzso In order to identify this zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso oil zzso A approximately zzso protein was identified zzso which shares zzso with a zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso contains features that are characteristic of an zzso such as a putative zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso in zzso coli and shown to zzso zzso at an acid pH zzso approximately zzso zzso can zzso a range of zzso but is not active on zzso The activity is sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso were used to show that the protein is restricted to the zzso where it is associated with the surface of oil zzso This is the first evidence for the molecular identity of an oil zzso zzso from zzso zzso comparisons reveal that families of zzso proteins are present in many species, and it is likely that they play an important role in regulating zzso
