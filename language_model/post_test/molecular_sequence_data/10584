We recently cloned a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which zzso and activates zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have identified its regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a series of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and bound zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind zzso and was largely zzso and zzso also did not bind zzso but activated a zzso zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso of triple negative charges zzso at positions zzso zzso or zzso blocked zzso binding and suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso exhibited partial zzso zzso These results identify overlapping AID and zzso between zzso 430 and 460 in zzso similar to other zzso zzso with this assignment, the synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso bound zzso in a zzso manner with a zzso in the low zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso by zzso of zzso at the zzso of the zzso in zzso which suppresses subsequent zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by prior binding of zzso to zzso
