zzso and zzso protein zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence similarities with zzso zzso and zzso B zzso allowed the construction of zzso models of zzso zzso as well as zzso In addition, the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso was solved by conventional two-dimensional zzso zzso The models indicate that the zzso domain of zzso possesses a number of positively charged zzso in its binding site that could interact with the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso The zzso domain of zzso seems zzso to bind the sequence zzso which forms a zzso alpha zzso this is analogous to zzso and zzso B, which also bind alpha zzso zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggest that binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso may be affected by fluctuations in the zzso calcium zzso
