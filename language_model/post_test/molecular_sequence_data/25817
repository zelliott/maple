Several zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso were zzso by the zzso method using the zzso zzso group for zzso zzso The compounds were tested in a zzso binding zzso using bovine adrenal zzso zzso cell zzso and in the rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso in position 116 of zzso and of the analog zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the biological activity profiles and, therefore, these two zzso in zzso form will be useful for zzso degradation and clearance zzso Replacement of zzso acid with zzso acid in zzso resulted in an analog with very low potency in both zzso systems, presumably as a consequence of the zzso bulk and/or local zzso restriction produced by the zzso group attached to the zzso in position zzso The analog zzso zzso zzso showed very low affinity in the zzso binding zzso but displayed considerable zzso zzso The obtained biological activity profiles suggest that in comparison with other zzso peptides the zzso zzso zzso may have a somewhat longer zzso in zzso or zzso may indicate a more complex situation of zzso zzso or binding site zzso
