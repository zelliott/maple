There is zzso evidence that bovine group C zzso exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their zzso zzso zzso samples from calves with zzso 81 samples from adult cows with zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C zzso by zzso gel zzso immune electron zzso and reverse zzso zzso Three samples from adult cow zzso cases were positive only by zzso and a group C zzso was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso the zzso strain was more closely related to the zzso zzso group C strain than to the zzso bovine zzso Because the original cow feces also contained a group A zzso zzso after passage in cell zzso we hypothesized that such zzso infections might play a role in the zzso and host adaptation of zzso Thus, we examined the zzso of zzso alone or combined with virulent zzso or attenuated zzso bovine group A zzso in zzso zzso zzso alone induced zzso without (or with zzso virus shedding in zzso calves zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all calves zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2) developed zzso and shed both zzso whereas calves zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3) developed zzso but did not shed either zzso zzso with zzso or zzso alone caused only mild zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso whereas dual infection with both viruses induced zzso throughout the small zzso Although zzso alone caused zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso occurred in calves zzso with zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso of calves with group A zzso enhanced zzso shedding of a bovine group C zzso and the extent of zzso zzso in the small zzso Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of zzso zzso to new host zzso
