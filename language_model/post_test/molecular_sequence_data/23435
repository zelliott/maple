The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 607 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso contains a typical zzso signal zzso of 29 zzso acid zzso followed by a zzso sequence that is zzso to the family zzso zzso 9 in family 4) zzso zzso zzso of this domain is a family 10 zzso domain of zzso zzso The C zzso separated from the zzso domain by a short zzso sequence contains a zzso domain responsible for zzso zzso The zzso sequence from mass zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analyses agreed with that deduced from the zzso zzso zzso was highly active toward zzso but not active toward zzso zzso The zzso was zzso active at 40 degrees C and pH zzso Northern zzso revealed that zzso is transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso ends by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso identified a single zzso start site of zzso located 47 zzso upstream from the first zzso of the translation initiation zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region provided evidence for highly zzso sequences that exhibited strong similarity to the zzso consensus promoter sequences of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased from early to middle exponential phase and decreased during the early stationary phase when the cells were grown on zzso No alternative promoter was observed by zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso analyses during zzso The analysis of the products from zzso zzso by zzso zzso indicated its zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is a consistent and major zzso zzso during growth on cellulose or zzso
