zzso is an essential zzso zzso factor that controls proliferation and differentiation of zzso during blood cell zzso Whereas zzso of the zzso regulatory domain zzso is known to have a major impact on the activity of zzso no role for zzso binding of small zzso modifier zzso to zzso has been zzso Based on the consensus zzso motif zzso we identified and examined putative zzso in human zzso zzso and reporter zzso showed that the SIM in the in the zzso domain of zzso zzso is zzso This motif is necessary for zzso to be able to interact zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso properties by zzso resulted in a large increase in the zzso potential of zzso zzso analysis and zzso of zzso zzso argued against zzso repression caused by zzso zzso and in favor of zzso repression in zzso Using both a zzso cell zzso zzso and a primary zzso cell zzso we addressed the transforming abilities of zzso binding and zzso zzso Interestingly, only loss of zzso zzso and not zzso zzso enhanced the zzso transformational potential of zzso zzso with the SIM zzso zzso a higher zzso ability than the zzso and caused an effective differentiation zzso This establishes zzso binding as a mechanism involved in modulating the zzso activity of zzso and responsible for keeping the transforming potential of the zzso in zzso
