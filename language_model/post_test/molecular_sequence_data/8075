We cloned and zzso the two zzso proteins zzso present in the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Atkinson, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1994, zzso Cell zzso zzso The sequence of zzso is more similar to other zzso than to zzso while the sequence of zzso is more similar to other zzso than to zzso zzso analysis of all known zzso demonstrates that most group into three major families, which are likely to be shared across all zzso zzso Together with conventional zzso the zzso form a larger family distinct from structurally related zzso such as zzso and sugar zzso Atomic models of the zzso based on their sequences and the structure of zzso provide some clues about zzso Both zzso have atoms appropriately placed to bind zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso has a zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso has the zzso required to zzso with zzso but an zzso zzso present in the zzso complex might serve as a pointed end nucleus for zzso zzso Both zzso zzso are soluble in cell zzso and both are concentrated in the zzso of zzso The cellular zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso but comparable to many zzso zzso
