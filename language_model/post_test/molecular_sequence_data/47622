Basic zzso are known to play a critical role in the attachment of protein zzso to membrane zzso Many of these zzso also contain zzso zzso that may alter the binding and the position of the domain on the zzso In the present study, the role of zzso in determining the membrane position, dynamics and free energy of a zzso derived from the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso in zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicates that this zzso zzso partially zzso the membrane interface when bound and alters the effective charge density on the membrane interface by approximately 2 charges per bound zzso However, a zzso of this zzso in which the five zzso are replaced by zzso zzso does not penetrate the interface when zzso This result was confirmed by depth zzso by electron zzso resonance zzso on several zzso derivatives of the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso on zzso zzso on the zzso lacking zzso do not reside within the zzso but are in the zzso phase when the zzso is bound to the zzso The zzso to Ala zzso shift the position of the labeled side chains by approximately zzso zzso The zzso dynamics of zzso are strongly influenced by membrane charge density and indicate that this zzso is drawn closer to the membrane interface at higher charge zzso As expected, zzso binds more zzso to zzso composed of zzso zzso than does the native zzso zzso however, each zzso contributes only zzso zzso to the binding energy difference, far less than the zzso zzso expected for the binding of zzso to the membrane zzso This energetic zzso and the differences in membrane position of these peptides can be accounted for by a zzso energy that is encountered as the zzso approaches the membrane zzso This energy likely includes a Born zzso acting between the charged zzso and the low zzso membrane zzso The interplay between the long-range attractive zzso force, the short-range repulsive force and the zzso effect controls the position and zzso of protein zzso on zzso membrane zzso
