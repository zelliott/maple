The zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence of a zzso beta chain was obtained from zzso clones isolated from a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The sequence of this beta chain gene was distinctive, differing from those of all other defined DR zzso The zzso beta chain gene was shown by zzso experiments to zzso a zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso that is also zzso by the zzso beta 2 chain zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of both genes revealed that their third D regions zzso acids 67 to zzso were zzso This suggested first that the zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso of this region, and second, that a putative gene conversion event transferred this sequence along with the information zzso the zzso zzso from a donor gene such as zzso beta zzso The sequence of the zzso beta chain gene was observed to be identical to that of clone zzso beta 4 derived from the zzso zzso in the zzso cell line, which was also demonstrated to express the zzso recognized by zzso zzso suggesting that the typing of this cell line is zzso No evidence was found for the existence of a DR beta 2 chain gene product zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was of particular interest because it was present along with a zzso zzso in the zzso who had zzso arthritis, and was shared by the zzso son of the zzso who also had zzso zzso This raised the possibility that the zzso zzso and most probably one or more specific zzso zzso by the DR beta chain, are involved in the definition of the disease zzso zzso
