The bacterial species in soil that can receive a zzso zzso by zzso from zzso zzso were zzso In order to have direct access to the potential zzso of zzso zzso amongst soil zzso the zzso system consisting of a multiply zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso containing a triple zzso cassette in zzso was used to transfer the zzso zzso in a complex soil zzso used as the zzso Numerous zzso were obtained by this method but none was identified as zzso This could be explained by the low density of zzso in the tested zzso As indicated by analysis of the zzso gene zzso zzso recovered directly from soil were found to be new bacterial species which appeared to be closely related to zzso zzso
