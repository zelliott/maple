We conducted a molecular zzso study on newly diagnosed human zzso virus type 1 zzso patients in Hong Kong to identify the zzso linkage of zzso infection in the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso was performed on newly diagnosed zzso zzso collected from January 2002 to December zzso zzso products zzso to the zzso zzso region and gag zzso junction of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso analyses performed on the acquired zzso sequences revealed that zzso and zzso B were the two dominant zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated the presence of three emerging zzso clusters among the zzso B sequences in Hong zzso Individual cluster possesses a unique zzso zzso acid signature for zzso Data show that one of the clusters zzso I) is rapidly zzso In addition to the unique zzso zzso acid signature, the majority of sequences in zzso I harbor a zzso acid zzso at the gag zzso junction in a region that is thought to be closely associated with zzso zzso
