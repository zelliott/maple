Two methods are currently available to solve high resolution protein zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Both methods usually produce highly similar structures, but small differences between both solutions are always zzso Here the raw zzso data as well as the solved zzso structure were compared to the multiple crystal structures solved for the zzso 60 zzso three zzso bundle zzso zzso zzso and single point zzso There was excellent agreement between zzso and crystal zzso zzso angles and a good agreement for the zzso zzso ( N ) H ( alpha zzso zzso for the multiple crystal zzso Around zzso of zzso were violated for any crystal structure, but no zzso was inconsistent with all of the crystal zzso zzso usually occurred for surface zzso or for zzso for which multiple discreet zzso were observed between the crystal zzso zzso of the disorder shown in the multiple crystal structures shows little correlation with dynamics under native conditions for this zzso
