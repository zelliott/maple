zzso zzso are zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso Nine distinct zzso have been described in zzso and two of them zzso 2 and 3) are regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and is therefore a zzso zzso In the present study, we report that zzso is also regulated by zzso We have identified the putative zzso zzso pocket by comparative zzso acid sequence alignment and zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso is capable of completely reversing this zzso In addition, zzso zzso is not restricted to zzso zzso but is also present in different adult and zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso outside the zzso These results reveal the zzso actions of zzso and zzso with respect to zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso are a complex family of zzso regulated by zzso with at least three of them, namely zzso zzso and zzso also being regulated by zzso and zzso
