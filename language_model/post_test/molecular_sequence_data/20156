zzso zzso zzso regulates sex zzso production in many female zzso zzso zzso with common zzso zzso are found in other insect groups where they have other zzso The ubiquity and zzso nature of the zzso family of peptides suggests that the zzso zzso proteins could also be present in a variety of insect zzso with alternative functions from that of sex zzso zzso Previously we showed the presence of the zzso in zzso zzso at the protein zzso In the present study we confirm the similarities between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso demonstrating the presence of the zzso protein in zzso cells, cloned to express the zzso zzso as compared with the zzso zzso zzso previously shown in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by identifying the zzso sequence of the zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso are zzso identical with most changes taking place in the zzso We demonstrate the spatial distribution of the zzso zzso protein in zzso of zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso zzso We also demonstrate the presence and differential expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and reverse zzso real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso in the neural zzso zzso zzso and zzso of adult zzso zzso female zzso as compared with its presence in zzso zzso Surprisingly, the gene for the zzso zzso is also detected in the male tissue zzso to the female zzso zzso the zzso although the protein is zzso and zzso does not induce zzso zzso zzso or cellular zzso zzso zzso responses in this zzso Our findings indicate that zzso or zzso receptors are present in the neural zzso and may represent a zzso function for zzso zzso In addition, the surprising discovery of the presence of the gene zzso the zzso zzso in the male zzso zzso but its absence at the protein level, zzso opportunities for studying molecular regulation pathways and the evolution of these G protein coupled receptors zzso
