We recently demonstrated that most band zzso zzso on DNA sequencing gels result from the presence of a single sequence zzso zzso where Y and R indicate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding raised the possibility that the use of zzso instead of zzso in chain termination sequencing reactions would resolve most of the band zzso Thus, we examined the effects of zzso on DNA sequencing using zzso DNA zzso The results indicate that the replacement of zzso with zzso in conventional cycle sequencing reactions can successfully eliminate most band zzso without sacrificing sequencing zzso
