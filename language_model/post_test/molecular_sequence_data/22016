A strictly zzso zzso bacterial strain zzso isolated from rice plant zzso in zzso zzso soil in Japan was characterized zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso short zzso The strain zzso various zzso and produced zzso and zzso as major zzso products with a small amount of zzso The optimum growth temperature was 30 degrees zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major respiratory zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence placed the strain in the zzso zzso The closest relative to strain zzso was an environmental clone from water contaminated with zzso zzso zzso similarity of zzso zzso and the strain formed a distinct cluster with other environmental clones mainly from freshwater zzso The closest recognized species were members of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso zzso was the next closest recognized species zzso of zzso % to the type zzso Given that the zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of strain zzso were different from those of any related species, a new zzso and species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
