Three short synthetic DNA zzso which are closely related to one another, zzso three distinct patterns of zzso expression on the heat shock zzso gene in transgenic zzso zzso zzso These results show that small variations or even single base pair changes in a repeated element of a regulatory sequence can create promoters that display new zzso of tissue and zzso zzso Interestingly, the three patterns of zzso expression zzso by the synthetic zzso resemble in part those of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso In each case, the defined regulatory region of the known zzso gene contains multiple sequences that are similar or identical to the synthetic sequence that zzso a similar pattern of zzso expression on the zzso zzso Thus, these results are zzso with the view that short sequence elements in multiple copies can zzso either simple or relatively complex patterns of zzso expression on a receptive promoter like that of zzso Furthermore, the fact that the three zzso tested produced three distinct patterns of expression in transgenic animals suggests that the number of different elements is zzso
