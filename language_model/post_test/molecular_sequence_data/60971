Here we investigate differences in the zzso and spatial zzso and zzso interactions of two of the major zzso channel zzso zzso in zzso brain, the type I and type II zzso zzso By using zzso zzso we find that both zzso are abundant in adult rat brain, where both interact with the zzso bound zzso auxiliary zzso zzso analysis reveals complementary levels of type I and type II in different brain regions, with the highest levels of type I in zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso where it is found predominantly on the zzso of zzso and the highest levels of type II in zzso zzso zzso and thalamus, where it is zzso localized to zzso zzso type I zzso channel zzso expression in brain increases dramatically during the third zzso week, zzso at the end of the first zzso month, and then decreases such that adult levels are approximately 50% of those at zzso Type II zzso channel zzso expression in brain also zzso large increases in the third zzso week, but levels continue to increase such that peak expression levels are maintained in adult zzso Type I zzso channels are found associated with the auxiliary zzso zzso at all ages, whereas free type II zzso channels exist during the first two zzso zzso Thus, although expression of these two zzso channel alpha zzso in zzso systems yields currents with very similar zzso and pharmacological properties, their distinct spatial and zzso zzso and association with auxiliary zzso in brain, suggest that they perform zzso zzso functions in zzso
