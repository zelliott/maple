We developed a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and determined its zzso zzso were selected from the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene of the Karp zzso The target sequence of zzso DNA was zzso as the band corresponding to 88 zzso in zzso zzso of the DNA extracted from zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso bands were observed not only for the zzso Karp strain, but also for four zzso zzso two other reference strains zzso and zzso and two zzso strains prevalent in zzso district zzso and zzso The minimum copy number zzso by this method was estimated to be five zzso All of nine peripheral blood zzso cell samples from patients with zzso disease who were seen zzso days after disease onset tested positive for zzso zzso The zzso zzso method presented here could be a specific diagnostic tool for zzso disease, especially in its early acute zzso
