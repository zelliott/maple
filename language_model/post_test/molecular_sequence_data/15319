The first complete zzso sequence for a zzso zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains has been zzso The unique sequence of this terminally zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso content of zzso and contains 117 putative zzso genes and 26 zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso in which a precisely zzso zzso zzso has been found dispersed throughout the zzso with 24 copies in zzso Also notable in the zzso zzso are the presence of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso the absence of a small packaging zzso zzso and the presence of zzso a principle component of the zzso salvage pathway, which has been found in only a few zzso zzso to zzso zzso is the first reported Felix zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso proteins share zzso with those of the zzso zzso Apart from this similarity to Felix zzso the zzso zzso appears to be substantially different, both globally and locally, from previously reported zzso A total of 43 of the 117 genes are unique to zzso and 32 of the Felix zzso genes do not appear in any zzso zzso sequences other than zzso and Felix zzso zzso sequencing and zzso laser zzso zzso of flight analysis resulted in the identification of five zzso genes coding for zzso structural zzso including the major zzso zzso
