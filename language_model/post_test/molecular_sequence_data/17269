The zzso zzso zzso is widely known for its production of the potent zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso by the zzso function of a large, modular zzso complex zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Also zzso within the zzso gene cluster is a putative zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso This study details the zzso and zzso analyses of zzso and offers functional predictions for the hypothetical zzso The zzso is zzso comprised of two zzso each with an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to cluster with members of the zzso zzso of ABC zzso suggesting an export function for the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were constructed by partial deletion of the zzso zzso zzso production was completely absent in these zzso While the zzso deletion had no apparent effect on the zzso of other zzso zzso the complete zzso zzso zzso complex could not be detected in zzso zzso zzso Finally, expression levels of zzso in the wild type and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated by using zzso with an zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to be reduced in zzso and zzso zzso and completely absent in the zzso zzso By virtue of its association with the zzso gene cluster and the zzso and experimental data presented in this study, we predict that zzso functions as a zzso exporter and is, in addition, intimately associated with the zzso zzso zzso
