zzso zzso are seeing increasing use in industry as an zzso and food zzso They are also a growing source of human food zzso which arise principally from the proteins zzso with the zzso fraction during zzso A previous study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, zzso zzso identified several zzso proteins in soybean zzso and a soybean zzso protein termed zzso was zzso However, very little was known about this protein except that it was coded by the soybean zzso This paper investigates key biological and zzso properties of this potential soybean zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso family in soybeans and in several other higher zzso The soybean zzso protein and its essentially indistinguishable zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso These proteins and their zzso belong to a family of zzso proteins of unknown zzso In zzso zzso is seed specific, and its transcript levels are highest in developing seeds and decline during seed zzso In contrast, zzso protein was zzso only in the fully mature, dry zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein was strongly associated with oil zzso however, zzso indicated zzso was distributed in the zzso of the protein storage zzso suggesting that association with oil bodies was an artifact arising from the extraction zzso By the use of zzso techniques it has also been documented that zzso zzso are present on several different portions of the zzso zzso
