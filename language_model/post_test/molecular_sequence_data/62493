zzso relationships and zzso of Northeast Asian zzso were zzso based on the DNA sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes and nuclear zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that two zzso exist in Korean zzso The southwestern population zzso from zzso was more closely related to the populations from Northeast China and eastern Russia than to all the other Korean zzso According to zzso estimated divergence times, the divergence event occurred between zzso in zzso Northeast China and eastern Russia and those in the remaining South Korea during the zzso zzso zzso and then the divergence event between zzso in zzso and those in Northeast China and eastern Russia occurred zzso zzso In the Korean Peninsula, zzso is located in the most southwestern region among the high mountains zzso The location is the farthest from Northeast China and eastern Russia among sampling localities in South zzso Thus, it was unexpected that the southwestern populations are more closely related to those from Northeast China and eastern Russia rather than to the other Korean zzso Based on Korean topography and estimated divergence times, possible scenarios are proposed for the current geographical distribution of Korean zzso
