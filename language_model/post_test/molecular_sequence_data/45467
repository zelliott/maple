zzso is a member of an emerging family of proteins sharing a set of protein motifs referred to as zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso regulate cell behavior during zzso in zzso and zzso and to ask whether zzso is also involved in controlling cell behavior, we isolated its zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a maternal transcript that is maintained at low levels until zzso stages when expression is elevated in the head and zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a zzso head and severe defects in axis zzso The anterior zzso is due in part to the zzso of zzso neural crest migration while the defects in zzso may be due to zzso of expression of zzso zzso and zzso and thereby to disruption of zzso zzso Finally, we note that simultaneous depletion of zzso and zzso zzso results in zzso defects that are more severe than those resulting from depletion of zzso alone, suggesting that the two proteins act together to control zzso zzso
