zzso zzso is zzso and replaced by the zzso counterpart during zzso metamorphosis in the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the zzso goes through significant changes at molecular zzso To zzso the intrinsic mechanism of zzso zzso the dynamics of zzso content in the zzso was examined in an important agricultural zzso the common zzso and the zzso was analyzed using zzso sequencing zzso Gene expression profiles during the metamorphosis were further studied by both the digital gene expression zzso system and real-time quantitative zzso The results showed that the zzso content decreased in zzso and then increased in zzso A total of 58 million sequencing reads were obtained and assembled into zzso zzso Over zzso zzso were identified to express zzso during the transformation zzso As compared with the 6th zzso feeding larvae, the most significant changes took place in the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and genes involved in sex zzso zzso changed their zzso levels zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed distinct zzso expression patterns, the former two zzso revealed the highest expression in zzso however the latter one showed its climax zzso level in zzso The gene expression patterns suggest that zzso and zzso may be responsible for the degradation of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso may help to degrade the zzso zzso Gene expression dynamics also implied that the zzso of zzso zzso might be formed by recycling of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso rather than through de zzso zzso The zzso nuclear receptors seem to be important factors regulating zzso zzso zzso during the zzso zzso Our data provide a comprehensive resource for exploring the molecular mechanism of zzso metamorphosis in zzso
