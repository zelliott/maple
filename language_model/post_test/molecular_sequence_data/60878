Progressive zzso zzso of the zzso type zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by seizures, zzso and progression to zzso zzso zzso arises due to zzso in the zzso B zzso gene which encodes a zzso zzso zzso Only a minority of zzso zzso carry point zzso while the majority contain large expansions of the zzso zzso repeat which is present at two to three copies in normal zzso The zzso repeat is located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso presumably in its zzso The pathological repeat expansion results in a reduction in zzso zzso which may be cell zzso To zzso the mechanism of this reduction of gene zzso we have studied the putative zzso promoter in zzso A zzso zzso fragment, containing the putative promoter with a 600 zzso repeat expansion, showed a zzso to zzso reduction in zzso activity compared with an identical zzso with a normal zzso this reduction was observed only in certain cell zzso Introduction of zzso DNA fragments of 730 and 1000 zzso into the normal promoter, instead of the repeat expansion, showed similarly reduced zzso Terminal deletions of the promoter zzso a putative zzso binding site, upstream of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso We propose that a novel mechanism of zzso the altering of the spacing of zzso factor binding sites from each other and/or the zzso initiation site due to repeat expansion, is among the causes of reduction in zzso expression and thus zzso
