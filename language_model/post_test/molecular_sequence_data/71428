The conventional concept is that the zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso are zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso that are capable of binding zzso growth factors zzso with high zzso This dogma was recently challenged by the discovery of a group of zzso proteins that share important structural similarities with the zzso but have demonstrably lower affinity for zzso It is therefore proposed that these zzso proteins zzso and the zzso constitute an zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso is derived from an ancestral zzso that was critically involved in the regulation of cell growth and was capable of binding zzso zzso Over the course of evolution, some members zzso evolved into zzso zzso zzso and others zzso into zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso on the zzso zzso the ability to influence cell growth by both zzso and zzso zzso
