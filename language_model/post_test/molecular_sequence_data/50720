Ten zzso zzso zzso acids possessing zzso (Al) or zzso zzso zzso groups have been characterized by zzso liquid zzso for use in zzso degradation sequence zzso zzso separation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids was achieved on a zzso zzso column with a zzso zzso spanning 32 zzso Five of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were completely stable to the conditions of zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially zzso during zzso zzso and one zzso was completely zzso during zzso zzso All zzso derivatives were well resolved from their zzso zzso Studies on the stability to zzso treatment showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and possibly zzso and zzso to be suitable for zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of Al and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso demonstrated the usefulness of these derivatives for zzso preview sequence zzso
