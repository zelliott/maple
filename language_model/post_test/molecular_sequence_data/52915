The zzso zzso mediates repression by zzso hormone zzso zzso as well as other nuclear hormone receptors and zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a novel zzso complex from zzso zzso This complex contains zzso zzso protein 1 zzso whose gene is zzso in human zzso zzso It also contains zzso a zzso zzso not previously thought to interact with zzso zzso displays structural and functional similarities to zzso and Groucho zzso sharing their ability to interact with zzso zzso In zzso zzso is bridged to zzso through zzso and can zzso repression by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause deafness in mice and zzso These results define a new zzso zzso complex with a physical link to zzso structure and a potential biological link to zzso
