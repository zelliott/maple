Certain maternal zzso lose their zzso tails during early development and zzso become zzso zzso In this report we analyze the mechanism of zzso removal during zzso zzso maturation by injecting short synthetic zzso We demonstrate that removal of zzso during zzso maturation is a default zzso In the absence of any specific sequence information, zzso is zzso However, zzso removal can be prevented by specific sequences in the zzso regions of certain maternal zzso These sequences are also required for zzso addition during zzso maturation and include zzso and a nearby zzso zzso zzso in either zzso or the zzso element cause loss of zzso and not merely a failure to extend the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso addition is required to escape zzso zzso The zzso that removes the zzso during zzso maturation appears to be a zzso zzso that prefers a zzso zzso zzso We discuss possible mechanisms by which zzso addition might circumvent default zzso removal and consider whether zzso removal is also a default reaction in zzso zzso Finally, we consider the possible implications of our results for the selectivity of zzso addition and zzso and for zzso regulation during early zzso
