We have expressed truncated forms of the insect control protein genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cotton plants at levels that provided effective control of zzso important zzso insect zzso Total protection from insect damage of leaf tissue from these plants was observed in laboratory zzso when tested with two zzso insects, an insect relatively sensitive to the zzso insect control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an insect that is 100 fold less sensitive, zzso zzso zzso zzso Whole plants, zzso under conditions of high insect pressure with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed effective square and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cotton plants indicated that the insect control protein represented zzso to zzso of the total soluble zzso We view these results as a major step towards the agricultural use of genetically modified plants with insect resistance in this valuable, high acreage zzso
