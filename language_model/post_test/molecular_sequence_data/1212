zzso interactions are required for most cellular functions, yet little is known about the relationship between zzso interaction affinity and biological zzso To investigate this issue, we engineered a series of zzso that zzso reduced the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso domain for its in zzso target, the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate a strong linear correlation between the binding energy of these zzso and quantitative in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso response zzso controlled by zzso In addition, we find that reduction in binding affinity for the correct target within this zzso causes a zzso increase in zzso of the related mating zzso response zzso and that strong binding affinity alone does not guarantee efficient biological zzso Our experiments also indicate that a second binding surface on the zzso zzso domain is required for its proper in zzso zzso
