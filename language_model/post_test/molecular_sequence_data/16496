The effect of two zzso peptides on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were investigated using transmission electron zzso and atomic force zzso Both techniques showed that zzso an zzso zzso induced cell zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso caused no zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with previous experimental work which indicated that zzso caused cell death and induced cell zzso whereas zzso acted by interacting with the inner cellular zzso
