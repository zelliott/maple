We report the synthesis of an zzso zzso base containing the two well zzso DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso The mode of interaction of the hybrid zzso was investigated by circular and linear zzso experiments and a zzso zzso using DNA zzso zzso The data are compatible with a model in which the zzso zzso zzso between DNA base pairs and the zzso ring occupies the DNA zzso zzso I zzso experiments were carried out to investigate the sequence preference of the hybrid zzso and a well resolved footprint was detected at a site encompassing two adjacent zzso zzso The sequence preference of the zzso zzso is compared to that of the zzso zzso
