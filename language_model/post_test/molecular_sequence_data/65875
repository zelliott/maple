zzso B viruses were zzso in Taiwan during the zzso epidemic and both Victoria and zzso lineage viruses zzso A zzso influenza B virus that contained a Victoria lineage zzso zzso gene and zzso lineage zzso zzso gene appeared first in 2002 and became zzso during the zzso zzso During the zzso epidemic, an influenza B outbreak occurred in Taiwan and only Victoria lineage viruses zzso We characterized the viruses isolated in the zzso epidemic and found that the zzso genes of influenza B viruses from that epidemic were highly similar to those from the zzso zzso We also analyzed the zzso genes of zzso from the zzso epidemic and found that they all belonged to the zzso lineage and formed a new genetic zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso revealed four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Although the zzso sequences from the zzso epidemic were similar to those from the zzso epidemic, the zzso sequences zzso suggesting distinct patterns of evolution of the zzso and zzso genes from zzso in zzso This study emphasizes that the evolution of the zzso genes may contribute to zzso of influenza B zzso
