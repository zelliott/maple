zzso a synthetic zzso zzso based on the zzso acid sequence corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso enhances gene expression from DNA zzso To investigate how this enhancement occurs, zzso was zzso labeled to study its zzso and zzso zzso When human zzso cells zzso were incubated with zzso labeled zzso for as little as 3 zzso zzso displayed nuclear and zzso zzso with enrichment of fluorescent signal in the nucleus and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed with the short sequence zzso but not with zzso and the zzso was readily taken up into cells but not into the zzso We found that the zzso zzso is routed to the zzso very rapidly in an zzso fashion, whereas membrane zzso and nuclear zzso are zzso When we tested the involvement of known zzso pathways in zzso and trafficking of this zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso and zzso pathway, although zzso zzso zzso may play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell entry with rapid nuclear zzso probably accounts for enhancement of gene expression from inclusion of zzso into DNA zzso
