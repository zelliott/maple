We have used reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso to amplify a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this clone established that both the zzso and the cardiac forms of zzso were derived from the same gene zzso A zzso product representing the zzso half of zzso zzso zzso and corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso of the cardiac zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso Further deletion zzso were constructed by removing either an additional 100 zzso acids from the zzso zzso or the zzso insert characteristic of the zzso family, from the zzso domain zzso In addition, zzso zzso was performed to explore the function of the zzso zzso All zzso were evaluated for their ability to zzso zzso and zzso their ability to be zzso by zzso and for the effects of zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than those for zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the ratio of zzso for zzso for zzso from zzso in intact zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and to zzso in zzso Thus deletion of the zzso enhanced zzso of zzso relative to zzso suggesting that zzso sequences may exert selective effects on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso insert generated a zzso with a zzso domain closely resembling those of other zzso gene families but despite a limited ability to be zzso by zzso no zzso zzso zzso activities of the zzso were zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso in putative zzso at the beginning and end of the zzso insert to zzso zzso markedly reduced the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso retained the ability to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso binding by the zzso deletion zzso and the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may interact exclusively with the zzso domain of the zzso
