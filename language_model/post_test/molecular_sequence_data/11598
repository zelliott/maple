A series of peptides derived from three zzso within the fusion protein of zzso virus was zzso and examined for their potential to inhibit the fusion of the virus with human red blood zzso These zzso include the zzso zzso and two zzso repeats, one adjacent to the fusion zzso zzso and the other to the zzso domain zzso Of all the peptides tested, only zzso was highly zzso Using zzso zzso the mechanism through which the zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the virus was zzso The results suggest that interactions of the active zzso with zzso elements and zzso zzso are zzso Since it has recently been found that synthetic peptides corresponding to putative zzso zzso of the human zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso protein zzso are potent zzso of zzso we discuss the general property of zzso zzso peptides as zzso of viral zzso
