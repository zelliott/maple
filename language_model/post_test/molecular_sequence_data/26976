Members of the zzso zzso zzso family are common models for zzso studies, and their evolution has been well characterized in zzso This family of zzso zzso is zzso with members in almost all organisms including plants, animals, zzso bacteria and even some zzso While several biological functions have been proposed for these zzso in plants, their role in animals is zzso Interestingly, in zzso most of the biological roles of plant zzso zzso proteins are carried out by members of a different family, zzso zzso Still, zzso zzso proteins are zzso in these animals 

As a first step to shed light on the role of animal zzso zzso zzso and to understand the evolution of these proteins while zzso with the zzso A family, we characterized zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two zzso zzso genes present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso These genes are expressed in most zzso zzso including high expression in all stages of embryonic development, and their expression zzso well with the presence of zzso zzso activities in every tissue zzso zzso expression seems to be a zzso characteristic of members of this family, as other plant and animal zzso zzso genes show similar high expression during zzso zzso While plant zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso A family show zzso of radiation and gene zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins form a zzso group, but there is also another zzso group defining a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on gene expression and zzso analyses we propose that zzso zzso zzso carry out a zzso zzso This zzso biological role probably kept zzso zzso zzso in animal zzso in spite of the presence of zzso zzso A hypothetical role during zzso development is also zzso
