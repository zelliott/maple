The expression of bone zzso zzso is normally restricted to zzso zzso zzso of bones and teeth where it has been associated with mineral crystal zzso However, recent studies have revealed zzso expression of zzso in various zzso including oral and zzso zzso in which it has been associated with the formation of zzso deposits and the zzso of cancer cells to zzso To develop a model to study the induction of zzso in zzso development, zzso expression in zzso zzso induced by chemical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was first isolated and zzso then used to prepare zzso for Northern and in zzso zzso The protein sequence of zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso acid identity with a consensus zzso zzso sequence and retained zzso zzso the zzso sequence and sites of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and protein was confirmed by in zzso zzso and zzso in developing zzso zzso zzso induced in the zzso zzso of 5-week-old male Syrian golden zzso treated with chemical zzso had zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, neither zzso zzso nor the protein could be detected in the zzso within which islands of the transformed tissue had zzso Thus, the zzso cheek zzso is a zzso model that can be used to study the induced expression of zzso in association with the development of zzso zzso
