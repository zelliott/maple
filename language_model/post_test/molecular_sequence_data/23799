zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso grown in the presence of zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso were examined by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cellular protein zzso were analyzed and zzso using immobilized pH zzso zzso zzso More than 1000 zzso proteins were detected using a zzso analysis program within the window of zzso point zzso zzso and a molecular mass range of zzso zzso We observed variations in the protein composition showing the zzso of multiple proteins for the five zzso treatments compared with the zzso control zzso By zzso sequencing or mass zzso we further analyzed the proteins separated by zzso Due to the lack of zzso sequence information for this species, protein identification provided an zzso zzso Several zzso proteins were identified including a zzso a putative zzso a zzso small zzso a small zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also identified proteins related to zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA translation zzso zzso factor zzso heat shock zzso and energy production zzso zzso Many proteins from zzso zzso zzso showed similarity with protein sequences from zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso Some proteins were detected uniquely upon exposure to a specific zzso whereas others were common to more than one zzso which indicates that induction triggers not only specific responses but a common response in this zzso
