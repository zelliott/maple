zzso cell zzso zzso features inflammatory zzso zzso by the presence of zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso et zzso recently reported the presence of a zzso zzso zzso in 57% of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Here we confirm their findings and report the identification of two novel zzso zzso detected in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso were observed in zzso samples from 11 out of 16 patients using zzso zzso zzso In 9 cases the zzso identified was zzso In 2 cases novel zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the structural and functional consequences of the zzso zzso It zzso the inactive zzso of the zzso zzso and resulted in increased zzso zzso in zzso T zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were found enriched in DNA and zzso from the zzso fraction of zzso They were absent from the blood and zzso of 58 zzso patients, with a lower threshold of sequencing sensitivity of zzso relative zzso zzso A novel germ line zzso zzso zzso was detected in one patient, at a relative zzso abundance close to 50% in the zzso zzso blood zzso and zzso However, zzso did not destabilize the inactive zzso of the zzso zzso and did not induce increased zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Our data confirmed presence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of some patients, and identify two novel zzso zzso They indicate that zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso enriched in zzso zzso cells and absent from the patient zzso Further studies are needed to assess the functional consequences of the zzso zzso zzso
