zzso of zzso to zzso cells or zzso zzso is likely to play a critical role in triggering zzso zzso in zzso sites of infection, chronic inflammatory disorders, tissue damage and zzso zzso We have constructed a zzso library from zzso zzso for 30 zzso on plastic and have screened it by differential zzso for zzso rapidly induced by zzso Two of the zzso isolated have been identified as zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso data from three other adherence specific clones demonstrates the presence of zzso zzso instability sequences in their 3' untranslated regions signifying zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences indicate the presence of open reading frames with sequence zzso to a family of host defense zzso one of them being identified as zzso Of the 14 clones initially identified, 4 have been analyzed for induction of zzso zzso Although 3 of the 4 clones were equally induced by zzso and zzso under zzso conditions, all 4 zzso showed distinct patterns of induction with adherence to zzso zzso components or zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso indicate that we have isolated zzso that code for three unique gene zzso These zzso belong to a gene family of early host defense zzso involved in inflammation and cell growth, but which are zzso regulated by adherence to different zzso
