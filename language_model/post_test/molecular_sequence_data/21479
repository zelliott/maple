zzso 2 zzso is zzso as a precursor protein zzso which by zzso is processed to generate the mature components of the zzso 2 family of proteins zzso zzso and zzso In zzso patients, abnormal processing of the zzso 2 precursors has been suggested by the detection of an increased presence of precursor zzso However, the presence of small zzso amounts of precursor proteins has been demonstrated also in normal zzso samples, although the variation of zzso in individual human zzso cells had not yet been zzso In the present manuscript we perform a zzso describing what is known about zzso 2 precursors and zzso zzso In addition, we by zzso demonstrate the existence of a marked variation in the presence and abundance of zzso in individual zzso zzso
