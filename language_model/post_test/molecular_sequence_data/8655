A zzso form of zzso zzso zzso acid binding protein I zzso has been zzso and zzso at pH zzso and the crystal structure has been refined to an zzso of zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso acid and some zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso were not available during the early stages of the study, and in spite of numerous zzso of known structure, zzso were not zzso through molecular zzso Instead, an zzso electron density map was obtained by multiple zzso replacement methods after improvement of the zzso parameters with density modified trial zzso Two molecules of zzso occupy the zzso zzso unit and are related by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences are apparent between the two zzso In all of the family members studied to date, there is a lack of hydrogen bonds between two of the component zzso resulting in a gap in the zzso hydrogen bonding zzso In the zzso zzso described here, a continuous zzso zzso is formed by using this gap zzso This is possible because of an 8 A outward maximum displacement of the tight turn between the third and fourth zzso on one of the zzso The result is a double zzso containing two zzso molecules with a more open, zzso binding zzso which has not been observed in other structures of a family of proteins that bind zzso zzso
