The zzso zzso growth factor zzso module of vitamin zzso zzso factors IX and X and protein C each has one calcium binding zzso This module zzso zzso from factor X has been isolated previously and found to bind calcium with a zzso of zzso zzso at zzso pH and zzso zzso We have now demonstrated that it binds calcium with a zzso of 120 zzso in a zzso that consists of the zzso module and the zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso module zzso zzso increases the calcium affinity of the site in the zzso module approximately zzso thus making it essentially saturated in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso has no significant effect on the calcium affinity of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of factor X zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso zzso folded to a native zzso were used to demonstrate that the contribution of the zzso module to the calcium affinity of the site in the zzso module is zzso by its 17 zzso zzso 12 of which form an zzso in the intact zzso zzso In the zzso structure of the zzso zzso module in factor X, five calcium zzso groups have been identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As calcium usually requires seven to eight oxygen zzso there is reason to believe that the zzso module contributes zzso or negative charge, to increase the calcium zzso Our findings suggest that the calcium affinity of zzso zzso in other proteins may also be influenced by neighboring zzso
