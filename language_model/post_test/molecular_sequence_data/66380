Seven strains of canine zzso zzso were isolated from affected dogs in Japan between 1999 and 2000, and their zzso genes were genetically zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso suggested that three field zzso corresponded to zzso type zzso while the other four to zzso type zzso The zzso tree constructed from the zzso genes showed that the newly isolated strains are classified into the cluster consisting of recent Japanese and Taiwanese field zzso which are distinct from Vietnamese zzso United States zzso or classical zzso type zzso These results suggest that the zzso transmission occurred between Japan and Taiwan in 1990s, and the offspring are still circulating in both zzso
