The general zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso is very active in cells grown on zzso as the sole nitrogen zzso Adding zzso to the medium triggers zzso and degradation of the zzso via a regulatory process involving zzso a zzso zzso In this study, we describe several zzso affecting the zzso region of zzso that render the zzso resistant to zzso zzso An in zzso isolated zzso zzso causes a single zzso substitution in an zzso acid context similar to the zzso sequence involved in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Another replacement, substitution of two zzso for a zzso zzso likewise protects the zzso zzso against zzso zzso In zzso cells, such a motif is involved in the zzso of several zzso zzso These data provide the first indication that a zzso motif influences the function of a plasma membrane protein in zzso zzso of a putative zzso site upstream from the zzso motif altered neither the activity nor the regulation of the zzso In contrast, deletion of the last zzso zzso acids of zzso a region zzso in other zzso acid zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso Although the zzso region of zzso plays an important role in nitrogen control of activity, it was not sufficient to zzso this regulation to two zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
