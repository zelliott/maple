zzso zzso zzso 17) is a specific marker of acute zzso leukemia zzso In this study, molecular cloning of the zzso 17) zzso was carried out in a Chinese zzso zzso It has been shown that the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso normally located on zzso 17, was fused with a new zzso unit zzso normally localized on zzso zzso We have subsequently cloned a portion of the zzso gene and generated a panel of zzso A zzso gene zzso was detected in 33 out of 36 zzso cases zzso 24 zzso were clustered in a zzso zzso region, designated here as zzso whereas 9 zzso were concentrated in a zzso zzso region, defining another zzso cluster region zzso These two types of zzso constitute the basis for the zzso of the zzso fusion gene and its possible biological significance remains to be zzso
