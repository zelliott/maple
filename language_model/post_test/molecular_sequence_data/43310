zzso derived from the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso have been studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso These include the inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso form of the latter zzso A zzso fold was found in the three peptides which consisted of an zzso segment in zzso zzso to zzso 13 and a zzso segment poorly defined zzso A parallel study was carried out by molecular dynamics zzso for the inhibitor zzso zzso The zzso zzso as observed in the crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex, was zzso in the MD simulations with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso turn was apparent in all MD structures, whereas the zzso region, zzso zzso was directed towards the zzso zzso in contrast to the extended zzso of this segment pointing away from the zzso zzso in the crystal zzso This is primarily due to zzso interaction between zzso and zzso Indeed, a detailed analysis of the zzso contacts by zzso at low temperature (2 degrees zzso shows the occurrence of zzso contacts with zzso We conclude that the binding of short zzso such as zzso to the zzso involves a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the product zzso give very similar structures with local zzso involving some of the side zzso
