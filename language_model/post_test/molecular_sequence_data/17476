We have previously described that zzso acts as a zzso zzso of rat zzso in guinea pig pancreatic zzso We therefore examined other zzso peptides of zzso for such zzso zzso zzso did act as a rat zzso zzso However, zzso zzso peptides of 4 to 8 zzso acid zzso did not antagonize the actions of rat zzso but zzso zzso zzso In pancreatic zzso a zzso effective concentration of rat zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso When the zzso peptides of zzso were tested in at 100 zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase, zzso a zzso increase, and zzso a zzso zzso Further studies with the most effective zzso zzso demonstrated that it did not cause release of zzso zzso and thus did not cause zzso release by cell zzso Unlike rat zzso zzso did not increase cellular zzso zzso but did stimulate zzso of zzso zzso zzso release was not inhibited by the substance P zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides of zzso inhibited binding of zzso with the relative zzso of the peptides being the same as their relative zzso for stimulating zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
