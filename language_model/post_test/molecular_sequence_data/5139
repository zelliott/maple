A new surface membrane zzso zzso surface zzso termed zzso was identified in zzso zzso using zzso surface, zzso of intact zzso This integral membrane zzso was zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso gel zzso The protein was expressed only in zzso forms of the zzso was heavily zzso and was present in different zzso zzso of the same zzso as well as in different zzso The gene for this protein was isolated by screening a zzso expression library with zzso against the zzso protein followed by screening of a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene zzso base zzso predicted a highly zzso zzso containing three distinct zzso a unique zzso domain of about 10 zzso containing three potential zzso sites, which was followed by a large internal domain consisting entirely of 72 consecutive copies of a zzso zzso acid motif zzso 113 zzso and terminated with an apparent zzso spanning region of about zzso zzso The internal repeat region of this gene zzso base zzso represents the largest zzso coding sequence to be fully characterized in any species of zzso There was no significant zzso with other known zzso and overall the predicted protein was extremely zzso Unlike the genes for other surface zzso the gene zzso zzso was present as a single zzso Although present in the zzso pocket, zzso was predominantly associated with components of the pathways for zzso such as zzso zzso located in the proximity of the pocket as well a large, zzso zzso zzso zzso
