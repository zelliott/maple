zzso zzso zzso which zzso only four major zzso proteins as revealed by zzso zzso gel zzso were isolated from crude cellular extracts of zzso zzso D by zzso in a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence determination identified two proteins of zzso zzso and zzso 40,000 as the zzso and zzso zzso products, respectively, of zzso zzso zzso In a previous study it was shown that both proteins are required for the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the third protein zzso zzso exhibited no zzso to other zzso zzso which was added during zzso of the zzso exhibited a strong affinity to zzso zzso and was identified as the fourth protein enriched with the zzso
