A rapid and efficient zzso method was developed using zzso zzso zzso zzso immobilized by their zzso terminal to the gel zzso zzso used for zzso liquid zzso The method allowed us to concentrate DNA fragments having a particular base sequence in an zzso tube with very high efficiency within 2 zzso For example, zzso DNA zzso the human zzso gene zzso was concentrated by this method and cloned into zzso zzso zzso zzso of the concentrated zzso DNA library for the zzso region of the human zzso gene showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tested were positive zzso Various factors affecting cloning efficiency were zzso
