The dense zzso network directly underneath the zzso bodies of zzso zzso might exert strong influences on the bacterial community of zzso Such zzso bodies might serve as hot spots for bacterial activity, for instance by providing nutrients and colonization sites in zzso Here, we assessed the putative selection of specific members of the zzso family at the bases of the zzso bodies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in comparison to the adjacent bulk zzso To do so, we used a previously designed zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso system and zzso this with analyses of sequences from a zzso clone zzso The analyses showed clear selective effects of the zzso bodies of both zzso on the zzso community zzso The effect was especially prevalent with zzso zzso zzso similar zzso sampled approximately 100 m apart showed similar zzso patterns, while corresponding bulk zzso patterns differed from each zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso still revealed divergent community structures, indicating that different zzso select for different members of the zzso zzso zzso of specific bands from the zzso patterns, as well as analyses of the clone libraries generated from both zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso It further showed that major groups from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not cluster with known bacteria from the database, indicating new groups within the family of zzso present in these zzso
