zzso zzso protein zzso is a host factor that specifically zzso the replication of certain zzso such as zzso by targeting viral zzso for zzso How zzso recognizes its target zzso has been zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso domain of rat zzso zzso the major functional zzso The overall structure of zzso resembles a zzso with four zzso motifs located at the zzso zzso and functional analyses identified multiple positively charged zzso and two putative zzso cavities forming a large putative zzso zzso zzso molecules interact to form a zzso that binds to a zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso These results provide insights into how zzso binds specifically to complex target zzso
