In virtually all of the 200 group I zzso zzso thus far, the specificity of zzso zzso zzso is determined by a zzso between a zzso base at the end of the zzso zzso and a zzso in an zzso guide sequence which pairs with the zzso zzso the zzso It has been reported that two zzso in the zzso zzso zzso I gene of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are exceptions to this rule and have a zzso zzso in this zzso We have confirmed the initial reports and shown for one of them that zzso editing does not convert the C to a zzso Both zzso zzso cleave the zzso zzso zzso of the C to U in one zzso reduces the requirement for zzso and leads to an increase in the rate of zzso As the C base encodes a highly zzso zzso acid, we propose that it is selected zzso at the level of protein function, despite its inferior zzso zzso
