Alternatives to X-ray zzso techniques are needed to probe the structure of the zzso lens protein zzso We zzso mass zzso for 3 zzso analysis zzso to study the zzso structural characteristics of this important lens protein and molecular zzso 

We have employed two types of chemical zzso to probe key zzso and zzso interactions of zzso using zzso Native zzso was exposed to zzso zzso zzso and the common zzso zzso The reaction products were zzso and enriched in zzso and modified species using size exclusion zzso zzso zzso of these zzso were zzso using reverse phase zzso and analyzed by both zzso and zzso assisted laser zzso mass zzso Comprehensive zzso for each zzso fraction were screened for zzso with mass unique to each chemical treatment and candidate sequences matching the experimental data were assigned using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by collision induced zzso 

zzso including zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were modified by zzso and partially zzso zzso zzso containing modified zzso 11, 78, and 99 of zzso were zzso and the modified zzso acids zzso In addition, zzso corresponding to zzso and/or zzso zzso were assigned a sequence based on two zzso First, the mass values observed were unique to a single zzso experiment and were not present in a control where no zzso was zzso Second, two unique zzso detected from different zzso experiments were correlated in that the structures assigned to the masses were equivalent apart from the structure of the zzso One such correlation was found involving zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso of zzso Another two independent correlations involving zzso of zzso were found that indicate zzso of two zzso of zzso through this same zzso 

zzso of peptides modified by partially zzso zzso and zzso provide experimental evidence for models of zzso zzso structure that suggest a similar zzso fold for both zzso and zzso zzso to multiple zzso along the zzso of zzso our data indicate that the same region of zzso up to and including zzso is also relatively accessible to modification despite its zzso Mass correlation between experiments using different zzso suggests that zzso occurred between zzso of adjacent zzso of zzso in the native complex in support of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, multiple zzso involving zzso of the so called zzso zzso region within the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that this region is a site of zzso contacts in the native zzso
