We have determined the DNA sequence of a zzso zzso region class I gene from the major zzso complex zzso that had been identified previously as zzso a zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence shows, however, that this zzso the zzso gene from the zzso zzso could not zzso a zzso zzso or any other functional class I zzso due to the presence of numerous stop zzso and zzso zzso in the coding zzso This result suggests that the earlier transformation data may have been incorrect or perhaps that the clone containing the zzso gene contains sequences that induced expression of a zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso of the recipient L zzso The zzso gene is structurally related to the previously zzso zzso gene that encodes a zzso defined zzso zzso The 3' half of the zzso gene including zzso 4, 5, 6, and the 3' untranslated region has about zzso zzso similarity (including zzso with the corresponding parts of the zzso zzso however, the zzso half of the zzso gene has little zzso with the zzso zzso There is a sharp line of zzso between the zzso and zzso regions, and this border occurs precisely at a B2 zzso repeat sequence present in the zzso zzso This suggests that a zzso event took place here and that an zzso repeat sequence that is known to have characteristics of zzso elements played some role in a zzso or gene conversion zzso
