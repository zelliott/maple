By screening zzso and zzso libraries, we have cloned zzso the fourth and last zzso gene of zzso zzso which encodes a typical zzso zzso and is expressed in all zzso zzso A4 is closely related to A3, another zzso zzso gene of the zzso in its zzso zzso zzso and the location as well as the sequence of a single zzso Both A3 and A4 have possibly arisen from the recent zzso of an zzso ancestral zzso The two genes display different organization of their zzso untranslated and zzso zzso In contrast to A3, which zzso a single promoter, A4 exhibits two leader zzso transcribed by the use of alternative zzso A3 and A4 zzso differ only by two zzso acids at positions known to vary among zzso zzso of other species, and are likely to be functionally zzso We speculate that zzso constraints are actually the target of a selective pressure that maintains two distinct zzso zzso genes in insects, as well as in other zzso
