The three-dimensional structure of the complex between zzso zzso and a zzso corresponding to the zzso portion of the zzso domain of the plasma membrane calcium zzso the zzso zzso has been solved by zzso three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The structure calculation is based on a total of 1808 zzso zzso and 49 zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and a zzso experiment, zzso Chemical shift differences between free zzso zzso and its complex with zzso as well as the structure calculation reveal that zzso binds solely to the zzso half of zzso In addition, comparison of the zzso zzso of the nine assigned zzso zzso of free zzso zzso with those of the zzso complex revealed a significant difference between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the complex were much more similar to those reported for free zzso in contrast to those in the zzso half which were significantly different not only from the zzso of free zzso but also from those reported for the zzso zzso As a consequence, the global structure of the zzso complex is unusual, zzso different from other zzso zzso complexes, since we find no indication for a collapsed zzso The fine zzso in the zzso protein interface shows a number of differences to the zzso complex studied by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) Science zzso zzso The unusual binding mode to only the zzso half of zzso is in agreement with the zzso observation that the calcium pump can be activated by the zzso half of zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
