The zzso end of the breast and zzso zzso gene zzso has previously been shown to lie within a duplicated region of zzso band zzso The duplicated region contains zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 and their surrounding zzso as a result, a zzso zzso zzso lies upstream of zzso However, the sequence of this segment remained essentially zzso We needed this information to investigate at the zzso level the zzso deletions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2, which we had previously identified in two families with breast and zzso zzso We have analyzed the recently deposited zzso sequence of the zzso region upstream of zzso We found that 14 blocks of zzso between the zzso repeated copies zzso length zzso zzso zzso show similarity of zzso zzso between blocks result from zzso or zzso usually of repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso In the two families with breast and zzso cancer mentioned above, distinct zzso zzso events occurred between zzso 2 of zzso and zzso 2 of zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso junctions were found to be located at close but distinct sites within segments that are zzso zzso The zzso zzso lack the zzso promoter and harbor a zzso gene consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2, which lacks the initiation zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso Thus, we report a new zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso The presence of a large region zzso to zzso on the same zzso appears to constitute a hot spot for zzso
