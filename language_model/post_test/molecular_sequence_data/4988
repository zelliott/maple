It is well established that zzso and zzso zzso zzso play key roles in cell migration, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso We describe a novel mechanism zzso the zzso alpha 6 beta 1, a zzso zzso can affect cell zzso and induce migration onto zzso zzso with which it is not zzso By using zzso gene transfer, we expressed the human zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso cells expressing alpha zzso zzso at the surface zzso with zzso beta 1, extended numerous zzso and zzso and were intensely migratory in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was responsible for these effects, because cells zzso with control zzso or alpha zzso a zzso domain alpha 6 zzso displayed compact zzso and no migration, like zzso zzso zzso The zzso migratory zzso persisted on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that alpha 6 beta 1 did not contribute zzso to zzso to these zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso 6 zzso completely blocked migration of zzso cells on zzso or zzso Control experiments with zzso and zzso zzso indicated that this zzso could not be explained by deposition of an alpha 6 beta 1 zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso with secondary zzso overcame the zzso effect of zzso 6 zzso restoring migration or zzso extension on zzso and zzso Thus, to induce migration in zzso cells, alpha zzso beta 1 did not have to engage with an zzso zzso but likely participated in molecular interactions sensitive to zzso 6 beta 1 zzso and zzso by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso inhibited alpha zzso beta zzso migration but had no effect on zzso cell zzso It is known that zzso is physically associated with alpha 6 beta 1, therefore our results suggest a mechanism by which interactions between alpha zzso beta 1 and zzso may zzso cell zzso affecting migration zzso by other zzso
