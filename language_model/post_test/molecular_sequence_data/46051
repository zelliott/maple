zzso expression is zzso upon zzso zzso but the mechanism is not well zzso In the current study, we found that zzso zzso zzso expression by suppressing its promoter zzso Although zzso binds to the zzso promoter, the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso promoter does not require the direct zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso does not inhibit zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso cells, and the zzso is restored when zzso is expressed zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso after DNA damage zzso We show that such stimulation zzso zzso to inhibit zzso promoter activity and promote zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso promotes zzso induced zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates the zzso zzso by zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso
