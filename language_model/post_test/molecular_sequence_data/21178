zzso zzso zzso B zzso is a zzso zzso by group A zzso and known to degrade a wide range of host and zzso proteins in zzso Although the role of zzso in zzso infection is zzso recent evidence has zzso demonstrated that zzso is critical for the zzso of severe invasive disease caused by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene results in significantly decreased zzso in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso of fully active zzso by zzso is extremely zzso Following zzso and translation the zzso protein is zzso as an inactive zzso which is zzso processed through a series of zzso to form an active zzso Each step from zzso to zzso zzso is tightly controlled and regulated by the bacterial cell reflecting the critical role played by this zzso factor in zzso zzso Here we review the molecular aspects of zzso production by zzso from zzso to zzso and the multiple layers of control zzso
