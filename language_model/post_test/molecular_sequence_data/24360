To investigate the zzso of the human zzso B2 zzso we have zzso individually or simultaneously into zzso two potential zzso sites zzso 324 and zzso located in the zzso zzso of the zzso and evaluated the effects of these zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the single zzso but not the double zzso incorporated zzso indicating that the zzso zzso tail can be zzso at both zzso The zzso did not differ from the zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso C and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso reduced capacity to zzso zzso This indicates that zzso does not influence the zzso activity of the zzso and its zzso zzso However, the zzso triggered zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso in response to B2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds that behaved as zzso on the zzso zzso became zzso on the zzso zzso and produced zzso C and zzso responses of zzso as compared to that of zzso These results suggest that zzso is required for the stabilization of the zzso complex in an zzso zzso
