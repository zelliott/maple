zzso of zzso shares its initial steps with that of zzso involving conversion of zzso acids to their corresponding zzso A zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this investigation, a zzso zzso was identified from zzso zzso tissue of zzso sanctum with high sequence similarity to an zzso zzso from zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso transcripts were highest in zzso sanctum zzso followed by zzso stem and zzso The zzso content in leaf essential oil was positively correlated with the expression of zzso in the leaf at different zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest activity with zzso acid, followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso suppression of zzso in zzso sanctum leaves caused a reduction in leaf zzso content and zzso transcript level, with a considerable increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A significant reduction in the expression levels was observed for zzso transcripts in suppressed zzso compared with transcripts similar to the other four zzso zzso 2, 3 and zzso zzso acid and zzso content were also unaffected in zzso suppressed leaf zzso zzso expression of zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein in zzso zzso was associated with the zzso These results indicate zzso channeling of zzso towards zzso by a specific zzso and is the first report demonstrating the involvement of zzso in creation of virtual compartments through zzso zzso and committing zzso for zzso zzso at an early stage of the zzso
