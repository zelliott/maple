Members of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes appear to control the development of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso To understand the evolution of this zzso in the flowering plants, we have identified 26 new zzso genes from 15 diverse zzso zzso zzso analyses of these genes within a large data set of zzso sequences show that ancient gene zzso were critical in shaping the evolution of the zzso Before the radiation of extant zzso one event produced the zzso D lineage and the zzso C zzso whose members typically promote zzso and zzso identity as well as floral zzso zzso zzso zzso in the C lineage resulted in independent instances of zzso zzso and maintained functional zzso Most notably, the functional zzso AG from zzso and zzso zzso from zzso are shown to be representatives of separate zzso lineages rather than simple genetic zzso The multiple zzso events that have occurred in this zzso highlight the potential for gene zzso to lead to zzso among genetic zzso thereby allowing an increase in zzso zzso
