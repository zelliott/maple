The zzso zzso engages two of its recognition sequences zzso simultaneously and is therefore a type zzso restriction zzso To identify the zzso acids of zzso that interact specifically with the recognition zzso we zzso zzso with zzso zzso that contained only one recognition sequence for zzso In this recognition zzso we zzso either zzso for each C or zzso for A, G, or zzso These zzso bases were excited using a zzso laser to result in zzso zzso zzso The yield of zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso strand of the recognition sequence was zzso However, we could not zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the contact of zzso to the bases of the recognition sequence appears to be zzso unlike that expected for most type II restriction zzso zzso zzso of free and of zzso zzso followed by high performance liquid zzso zzso separation of the individual peptides and zzso degradation, identified zzso acids zzso of zzso as the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso of this zzso indicates that zzso is the zzso acid involved in the zzso and that it therefore contributes to specific DNA recognition by zzso
