To evaluate those zzso in the 117 zzso acids of the zzso zzso domain required for zzso of T zzso zzso signals, a full-length human zzso zzso and a series of deletion and substitution zzso were inserted into the zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The resulting cells express surface zzso protein and unlike the parental zzso line, are zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso stimulation of cells expressing a full-length zzso zzso results in a characteristic rise in zzso calcium zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso that accompany zzso stimulation in human T zzso zzso expressing zzso delta zzso and zzso delta zzso partially deleted zzso molecules containing the entire zzso and zzso zzso segments but only 98 and 77 zzso acids of the zzso domain, respectively, are also activated by zzso zzso In contrast, clones expressing more severely truncated zzso structures, zzso delta zzso and zzso delta zzso are not zzso These data show that the zzso domain plays an essential role in zzso of zzso signals via zzso and that the segment between zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso is necessary for zzso This region contains two tandem repeats of the sequence zzso thought to form part of a putative zzso zzso zzso of the latter by zzso zzso does not affect zzso gene zzso suggesting that only one of the repeats is required for zzso this function of the zzso zzso
