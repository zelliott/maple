The type X collagen gene is the classical marker of zzso zzso zzso in the human collagen X gene cause zzso zzso type zzso zzso In order to gain insight into the evolution of collagen X zzso we identified a putative collagen X gene from the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated expression of the putative zzso collagen X gene by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso spanning zzso zzso The zzso collagen X gene shares a common gene structure and high zzso acid identity with zzso and chicken collagen X zzso Interestingly, we have found that most of the zzso zzso in human zzso are highly zzso in the zzso zzso The availability of the zzso collagen X gene sequence will be of value in the identification of functionally important zzso within the protein and for zzso regulatory elements that control collagen X gene expression in zzso
