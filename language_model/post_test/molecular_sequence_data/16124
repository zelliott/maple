We have determined the primary structure of a zzso zzso part of the zzso zzso locus mapping in a region containing genes of late zzso zzso This part of the locus was found to zzso a zzso related to one of the families of zzso genes zzso high zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibits an overall sequence identity of zzso to the consensus coding region of zzso zzso zzso A zzso identity was observed over a length of 190 zzso of its immediate zzso upstream sequences and the corresponding part of the consensus zzso sequences of zzso gene pairs, normally encompassing zzso zzso Thus, the zzso has retained part of the promoter region that includes sequence elements whose presence is thought to be necessary for zzso competence of zzso zzso The zzso is also characterized by the elimination of part of its first zzso containing most of the zzso untranslated region, the zzso translation initiation zzso and part of the signal zzso zzso Its zzso is longer than that of other zzso genes due to the zzso of a copy of a repetitive element that appears to be transcribed by zzso zzso zzso A previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso representing a rare zzso sequence of late zzso zzso was found to be identical to the zzso over its entirety spanning zzso of the zzso second zzso zzso of clones spanning a 260,000 zzso domain of the zzso locus of zzso zzso and of total zzso DNA to a zzso of the zzso clone containing relatively unique zzso coupled to primer extension experiments, have demonstrated that zzso zzso originated from the zzso and that the zzso transcripts are initiated at the zzso cap site consensus zzso We conclude that the zzso sequences retained by the zzso zzso elements necessary and adequate for correct zzso zzso but may not include those required for quantitative expression of the zzso zzso reasons for the observed lack of random drift in the zzso sequences of the zzso and the maintenance of a functional promoter in a zzso gene are discussed on the basis of the observation that elements resembling scaffold attachment sites are present in these zzso
