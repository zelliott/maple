We have recently demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso IV in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have identified and cloned a target zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso I zzso which has approximately zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso has 348 zzso acid zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 40 zzso which is activated by zzso through zzso of zzso in a zzso manner, resulting in a zzso decrease in the zzso of zzso for its zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso is mainly localized in the nucleus of zzso cells because the zzso six zzso zzso contain a functional nuclear zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso a signaling zzso that mediates zzso zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, consistent with nuclear zzso of zzso These results suggest that the zzso cascade is zzso in zzso zzso and is functionally operated both in zzso and in intact cells, and it may be involved in zzso nuclear events such as zzso zzso through zzso of zzso
