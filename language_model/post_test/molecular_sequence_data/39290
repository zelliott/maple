A novel purple sulfur zzso strain zzso was isolated from a microbial mat from an zzso of the White zzso Individual cells are zzso zzso zzso by zzso and do not contain gas zzso The mean cell diameter is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell suspensions exhibit a zzso zzso They contain zzso a and zzso of the zzso series as zzso zzso The novel zzso is an zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso sulfur as electron donors for photosynthesis and is capable of zzso several organic carbon sources in the presence of zzso and a reduced sulfur source zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso formed during zzso of zzso are stored zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso and pH for growth are at zzso % zzso and pH zzso The DNA base composition of strain zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolate belongs to the zzso zzso with zzso minor zzso as the nearest relative zzso similarity of zzso zzso Several distinct differences from described species zzso the description of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the proposed name, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
