A rapid procedure has been developed for the isolation and zzso of zzso clones isolated from a zzso library based on zzso zzso Using information of the partial zzso acid sequence of a zzso synthetic zzso zzso are first employed as a screening probe using the plaque zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the clones obtained are then directly amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso the cloning site of the zzso Besides being used for cloning into a zzso zzso the amplified zzso are also subjected to zzso sequence analysis using the same zzso zzso as sequencing zzso This approach allows sequencing through the region of the known zzso acid sequence for direct zzso of the authenticity of the clones zzso This procedure has successfully been used for cloning and partial characterization of the gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso
