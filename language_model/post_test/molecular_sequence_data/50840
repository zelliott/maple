We studied the binding of zzso zzso to both the normal human insulin zzso and an insulin zzso in which the sequence zzso of the zzso alpha zzso was zzso to provide an additional net positive zzso One zzso insulin zzso which has an additional negative charge, bound to both types of receptors with a higher affinity than native zzso Moreover, this zzso insulin was more effective in zzso the zzso zzso activity of both types of zzso This study suggests, therefore, that charge interactions between insulin and its zzso may play a role in insulin zzso binding and zzso
