Recently, a novel zzso putative tumor zzso zzso which has a growth zzso function in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, has been identified at zzso zzso To determine the relationship of the zzso with the development or progression of zzso we analyzed the genetic zzso and the expression pattern of the zzso gene in a series of 80 zzso six zzso zzso and eight large zzso zzso determining the zzso zzso We identified a total of seven zzso of which two were alternative, and three zzso zzso short zzso medium zzso and zzso zzso In the genetic zzso study of the zzso zzso no zzso was detected in the large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas ten zzso of 29 zzso cases at one or more zzso zzso sites showed loss of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was identified only in zzso samples with zzso B virus zzso infection and the frequency of zzso was not statistically related with zzso grade and clinical stage, suggesting that zzso loss of the zzso gene may occur as an early event in the development of zzso especially in the cases with zzso zzso
