Evidence is presented that the zzso domain of the type I zzso zzso zzso may be a zzso This domain zzso segments of zzso zzso acids that suggest a structural zzso to the zzso zzso protein and other members of the zzso zzso despite a lack of significant zzso sequence zzso When the zzso segments of the zzso were aligned with similar segments of the zzso it became apparent that the zzso possess a number of zzso zzso acids that represent plausible functional zzso for zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a segment of five zzso zzso were found that is identical between zzso and the zzso and which is positioned to form part of the zzso base binding zzso If this model is correct, then the zzso possess a highly zzso zzso protein binding region, but one that is entirely unrelated to the zzso regions of other zzso zzso zzso if the zzso is indeed a zzso then its zzso function may be directed to zzso zzso zzso target zzso as part of a unique cellular signal zzso zzso
