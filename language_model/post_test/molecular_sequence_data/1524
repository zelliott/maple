High mobility group box protein 1 zzso a DNA binding nuclear and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso released by zzso and zzso This study addressed the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso signal that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso We show that zzso via its B box domain, induced zzso maturation of zzso as evidenced by increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso class II expression and decreased zzso zzso The B box caused increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B box zzso zzso expression as well as zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso B zzso zzso acted as potent zzso of zzso T cells, and the magnitude of the response was equivalent to zzso activated by exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, B box induced zzso of zzso from zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso from zzso T cells, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso released by zzso cells may be a signal of tissue or cellular injury that, when sensed by zzso zzso and/or enhances an immune zzso
