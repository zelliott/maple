zzso acts as an zzso protein that mediates the zzso of zzso proteins to the zzso for zzso Although previous studies suggested a key role of zzso in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso a direct relationship between zzso and zzso bodies in zzso brains remains zzso 

By zzso we studied zzso and zzso expression in the frontal zzso and the zzso of six zzso and 13 control zzso 

Numerous zzso bodies, accumulated in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso expressed intense zzso for zzso They were much less frequently found in control zzso However, zzso bodies did not express a panel of markers for zzso zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paired zzso filament zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but some of them expressed zzso zzso deposits were classified into four distinct zzso such as zzso structures characteristic of zzso bodies, zzso zzso zzso senile zzso fragmented structures accumulated in the zzso affected with severe zzso loss, and zzso structures located mainly in the molecular layer of the zzso 

zzso zzso is concentrated on zzso bodies and zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression of zzso serves as one of pathological hallmarks of zzso
