We have initiated an investigation of the de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plant zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso coli zzso allowed the direct isolation of expressed zzso leaf zzso Using this approach we have successfully suppressed zzso in 4 of the 12 genes in this zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized in zzso Analysis of zzso DNA suggests that the zzso zzso contains a single zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence and zzso size suggests that this zzso activity is zzso by a zzso zzso similar to that of bacteria and unlike other zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains a basic zzso transit zzso consistent with transport into zzso zzso of both the predicted zzso acid and zzso sequence from zzso to those of eight other distant organisms suggests that the plant sequence is more similar to the bacterial sequences than to other zzso zzso This study provides the groundwork for future investigations into the regulation of de zzso zzso zzso in zzso Additionally, we have demonstrated that functional suppression of bacterial zzso may provide a useful method for cloning a variety of plant zzso
