We have isolated a zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso of rat skeletal zzso zzso zzso based on zzso acid sequence data for the zzso zzso were used as zzso to amplify fragments of the gene from rat skeletal muscle zzso by the zzso chain zzso The amplified zzso zzso was then applied as probe to screen a rat skeletal muscle zzso zzso The longest zzso clone thus isolated was incomplete at the zzso and therefore an amplified zzso from the zzso portion of the gene was further generated by zzso chain zzso These two zzso were used to construct a zzso zzso the entire sequence of rat zzso The composite sequence encodes an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids that include all zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequence is not largely similar to those of bacterial and zzso zzso it contains two zzso blocks, the zzso sequence of the zzso from these zzso When the zzso was inserted into an expression zzso followed by transformation in zzso coli, zzso activity appeared in the cell zzso The zzso could be completely zzso by zzso against the zzso zzso of rat skeletal zzso
