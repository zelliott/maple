In zzso two zzso zzso zzso complexes that differ by a single zzso zzso to different cellular compartments and have distinct functions in zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex promotes zzso zzso and zzso to processing bodies, whereas the zzso complex takes part in a variety of nuclear zzso processing zzso The structural features that determine their different functions and zzso are not zzso Here, we zzso a range of zzso and hybrid zzso and zzso zzso shedding light on the relative importance of their various zzso in determining their zzso and ability to support zzso Although no single domain is either essential or sufficient for cellular zzso the zzso zzso may act as part of a nuclear exclusion signal for zzso and the shorter zzso zzso contributes to nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso regions seem to play a secondary role in determining zzso with little or no contribution coming from the central zzso zzso The essential zzso protein is remarkably resistant to zzso in terms of supporting zzso whereas zzso appears more zzso These findings contribute to our understanding of how two very similar protein complexes can have different zzso
