zzso virus C zzso is an enveloped zzso zzso virus belonging to the zzso zzso Studies on the genetic zzso of the zzso reveals the existence of six zzso zzso 1 zzso in West Africa, zzso 2 in Europe and America, zzso 3 in Asia, zzso 4 in Southwest Asia, zzso 5 in South Africa and zzso 6 in zzso The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and zzso distribution of zzso in the Colombian zzso 

Two groups were zzso zzso zzso Colombian blood donors infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso 99 indigenous people with zzso infection from zzso zzso A zzso of 344 zzso from the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso was amplified by zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso by zzso analysis using reference sequences from each zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were conducted using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso approach to obtain the zzso tree using zzso zzso 

Among blood donors, from 158 zzso positive samples, eight zzso zzso zzso 8) were positive for zzso and from 250 zzso positive samples, zzso zzso 8) were positive for zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso 7) zzso positive samples were found among indigenous people from zzso A zzso analysis revealed the presence of the following zzso zzso among blood zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso All zzso 1 sequences were found in zzso with zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso were found in zzso with zzso All sequences from indigenous people from Leticia were classified as zzso zzso The presence of zzso infection was not correlated with the sex zzso zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso or origin zzso zzso zzso
