zzso and conventional zzso against the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso zzso were studied for zzso with native zzso zzso zzso zzso and its fragments of sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso reacted zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso but failed to react to zzso free acid and its zzso On the other hand zzso reacted zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso to zzso These results indicate that the zzso drastically inhibited zzso but that the zzso zzso preserved the zzso zzso responsible for the induction of an effective zzso zzso zzso
