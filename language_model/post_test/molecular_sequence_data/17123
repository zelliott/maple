Most zzso organisms, zzso as well as animals, plants, and algae have a zzso stage in their life zzso Here, we describe an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that reproduces by zzso zzso It is zzso in all the stages of its life cycle, and during most of the life cycle the cells organize into a hollow sphere formed by a functionally coordinated and polarized zzso layer that grows by increasing the cell zzso zzso all the cells divide zzso the zzso becomes zzso and separates into two equal spheres with a zzso movement in the equatorial zzso zzso bacteria similar to the cells that compose these organisms have not been zzso zzso biology analysis showed that all the organisms studied belong to a single genetic population zzso related to zzso zzso zzso in the delta zzso of the zzso This appears to be the first report of a zzso zzso zzso that zzso by dividing into two equal zzso organisms each similar to the parent zzso
