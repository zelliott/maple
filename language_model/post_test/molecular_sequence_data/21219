zzso of blood and meat inclusions is an internal egg quality zzso Mass zzso reveals most of the spots, but because brown eggshell zzso selection in brown chicken lines it has not been possible to eliminate the zzso by zzso zzso frequency of blood and meat inclusions in brown layers is about zzso whereas it is zzso in white egg zzso Several factors are known to increase the zzso of this zzso genetic background, low level of vitamin A and/or D, stress or infections, for zzso To study the genetic background of the zzso a mapping population of zzso zzso zzso from a cross of White Rock and Rhode Island Red lines was set zzso 

Our zzso analyses show that blood spots consist of mainly zzso and that meat spots are zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of 27 zzso with 162 zzso markers revealed one significant quantitative trait locus zzso affecting blood spot and meat spot zzso We zzso a zzso of a candidate gene within the region, zzso coding for a tight junction zzso Nine zzso were detected and two of them were included in zzso and association zzso zzso defined the zzso zzso To further verify the zzso association analyses were carried out in two independent commercial breeding lines with the marker zzso and surrounding zzso Association was found mainly in a zzso zzso zzso area on zzso 

There was good agreement between the location of the zzso region on zzso Z and the association results in the commercial breeds zzso Variations found in tight junction protein zzso and zzso zzso may zzso egg layers to blood and meat spot zzso This paper describes the first results of detailed zzso analyses of the blood and meat spots zzso in zzso
