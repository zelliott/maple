zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso via five hypothetical zzso zzso We zzso and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the conversion of zzso to zzso as an zzso responsible for the first step of this alternative zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso preferred zzso to zzso as a zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso had high zzso efficiency for both zzso and zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned using a partial zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and was zzso in zzso coli as a fully active zzso The zzso consists of 308 zzso acids and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had some similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso possesses unique zzso zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that this gene was induced by zzso but not by zzso Furthermore, a zzso of the zzso zzso gene did not grow on zzso but grew on zzso at the same growth rate as the zzso zzso There was a partial gene for zzso transport in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso is involved in the metabolism of zzso but not zzso This is the first identification of a gene involved in an alternative zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso
