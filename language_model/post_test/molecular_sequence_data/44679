The zzso method for genetic screening in zzso was used to search a zzso zzso zzso library for zzso proteins that interact with the zzso of the zzso repetitive zzso The zzso was formerly shown to contain two high zzso zzso binding sites for a nuclear protein factor of unknown function zzso The bait DNA sequence was bound in zzso by a zzso protein whose derived zzso acid sequence showed high zzso to zzso core zzso zzso but not to partially available zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single gene and shows significant sequence variation at the zzso zzso of the zzso including a zzso zzso not found in any other zzso zzso
