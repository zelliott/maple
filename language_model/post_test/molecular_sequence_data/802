zzso zzso zzso have recently received particular interest due to their significant zzso zzso This is mainly related to their high zzso content and specific zzso zzso We have now analyzed the zzso and the zzso linkage sites of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using different zzso We analyzed a number of zzso by zzso and identified the sugar chains and zzso sequences of 12 zzso Additionally, the potential zzso linkage sites of 2 functional units, zzso and zzso were determined by gene sequence zzso Only zzso shows a potential zzso zzso During this study, we discovered a highly zzso zzso separating the coding zzso of zzso and zzso Following reports on zzso properties from zzso zzso we conducted a preliminary study of the zzso activity of zzso and the functional units zzso and zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso has zzso properties against the respiratory zzso virus zzso whereas native zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have zzso This is the first report of the fact that also zzso zzso functional units possess zzso zzso
