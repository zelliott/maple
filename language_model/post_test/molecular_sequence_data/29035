Gene regulation can be tightly controlled by recognition of DNA zzso that are induced by stress generated during zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso a regulator of zzso zzso bind in zzso and in zzso to the zzso zzso element zzso 1,500 base pairs upstream from the zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso acts through zzso at the zzso Here we report the solution structure of a complex between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso DNA from zzso The zzso zzso recognize two sites, zzso bases in zzso separated by 5 zzso with zzso bound to the zzso site and zzso to the 3' zzso The central portion of each site comprises a zzso of sequence zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso show that the two zzso zzso bind as articulated zzso to zzso DNA, providing a flexible framework with which to recognize zzso moving zzso
