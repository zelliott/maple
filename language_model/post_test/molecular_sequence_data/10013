zzso zzso a small and highly zzso nuclear protein related to cell zzso is known to be zzso attached to a small unidentified zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso rat zzso a links zzso to an zzso when zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso species of this complex is represented by a wide range of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso zzso alpha appears to be linked to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso attachment site lies close to the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso alpha is also competent for zzso zzso The site of zzso attachment zzso with the nuclear zzso signal of zzso zzso and zzso binding might be expected to affect zzso zzso of this zzso
