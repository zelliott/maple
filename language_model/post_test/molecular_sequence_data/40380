A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a farm soil and was characterized to determine its zzso position by using a zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso belongs to the family zzso class zzso and is related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso and members of all other recognized species of the family zzso were below zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso The detection of a zzso system with zzso zzso as the major respiratory zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unknown zzso as major polar lipids and a fatty acid profile with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the major components supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited relatively low levels of zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (18 zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso and zzso properties together with its zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified in the zzso zzso as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
