zzso zzso 2 zzso is a zzso highly zzso zzso active, and zzso zzso protein zzso It is found in two different zzso the zzso zzso composed of two alpha zzso zzso and two beta regulatory zzso and the zzso zzso zzso consisting of the alpha zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated barley zzso clones of the zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso assignment, using a set of zzso zzso zzso addition lines, and zzso zzso using two doubled zzso zzso showed that zzso was duplicated on the short arm of zzso zzso and the long arm of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and a single copy of zzso was located on the long arm of zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso experiment demonstrated that the zzso sequence originated from the zzso zzso showing that at least zzso was zzso The present zzso sequences and zzso organization of the two zzso will facilitate further functional analysis of zzso in zzso
