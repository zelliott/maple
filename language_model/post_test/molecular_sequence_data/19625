Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso nascent zzso promoting their nuclear export, stability, and translation, while the related zzso zzso zzso activates translation of zzso zzso Here we characterize the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso implicated in cell cycle checkpoint zzso Surprisingly, zzso has robust zzso zzso activity in zzso especially when isolated in native zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that upon zzso arrest, the 3' ends of zzso zzso were zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso shows similar zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso forms the basis of an zzso zzso mechanism of gene zzso
