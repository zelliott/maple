zzso protein zzso is part of the 60 S zzso zzso and zzso in both the zzso and the nucleus of zzso cells, accumulating particularly in the zzso zzso is known to bind specifically to 5 S zzso and is involved in zzso transport of this zzso Here, we report a detailed analysis of the domain organization of the human zzso protein zzso We show that a signal that mediates nuclear import and zzso zzso maps to zzso acids zzso within the zzso acid zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso at positions zzso serve as an additional zzso targeting zzso zzso involved in 5 S zzso binding are located at both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies in zzso cells demonstrate that a nuclear export signal zzso that maps to zzso acids zzso resides in the central region of zzso This zzso is characterized by a pronounced zzso of critical zzso zzso which creates a zzso motif not previously observed in other zzso zzso Finally, we present a refined model of the zzso structure of human zzso protein zzso
