The zzso capsule is the main zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso essential for capsule formation have been previously identified, although their roles in the zzso zzso remain zzso A genetic and zzso approach allowed the identification of six zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This gene family is apparently specific in a zzso of the zzso zzso Single as well as double deletions of these genes in all possible combinations demonstrated that none of the zzso genes were essential for capsule formation, although the zzso strains displayed a zzso zzso The chemical structure of the zzso zzso produced by the zzso family zzso revealed that these genes determined the position and the linkage of the zzso and/or zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso these genes are all involved in assembly of the zzso structure in zzso zzso
