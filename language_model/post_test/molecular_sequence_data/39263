A zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a soil in Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C without zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso is most closely related to members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso properties indicative of members of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso type was based on zzso acid, zzso was the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso was the zzso fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso was zzso % similar to those of the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso % similar to those of the type strains of other zzso zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from the three zzso relatives, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and by differences in some zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and genetic data, the strain represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
