The zzso zzso zzso nervous system is composed of zzso zzso that fall into at least 118 diverse zzso Here we describe zzso a gene that contributes to the development of zzso zzso zzso promotes appropriate differentiation of the zzso sensory zzso and zzso zzso from expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is present in zzso and zzso zzso and can promote expression of zzso genes in both zzso and zzso but zzso zzso expression of these genes in the zzso zzso zzso also promotes appropriate differentiation and zzso zzso expression in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein containing an zzso rich interaction domain zzso zzso proteins regulate early patterning and muscle fate in zzso but they have not previously been implicated in the control of zzso zzso zzso
