zzso zzso is a genetically zzso form of retinal zzso that affects approximately 1 in zzso people zzso Recently we identified the gene responsible for the zzso form of zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso at zzso and found two different nonsense zzso in three families previously mapped to zzso The zzso gene is an unusually large zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso but is comprised of four zzso zzso To determine the frequency and range of zzso in zzso we screened zzso from 56 large zzso families for zzso in the entire zzso After preliminary results indicated that zzso seem to cluster in a zzso zzso segment of zzso 4, an additional zzso zzso with zzso and 409 zzso with other degenerative retinal diseases were tested for zzso in this region zzso We identified eight different zzso zzso in 17 of the 250 zzso zzso zzso All of these zzso are either nonsense or zzso zzso and lead to a severely truncated zzso Two of the eight different zzso zzso and a 5 zzso deletion of zzso zzso were reported zzso while the remaining six zzso are zzso We also identified two rare zzso changes in two other families, one new zzso zzso acid zzso one silent substitution and a rare zzso in the zzso region that is not associated with zzso Based on this study, zzso in zzso appear to cause at least zzso zzso of zzso The 5 zzso deletion of zzso zzso and the zzso nonsense zzso account for 59% zzso of these zzso Further studies will determine whether zzso changes in the zzso gene are associated with disease, whether zzso in other regions of zzso can cause forms of retinal disease other than zzso and whether the background variation in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the disease zzso
