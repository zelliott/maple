Contemporary distribution of North American species has been shaped by past zzso events during the zzso zzso However, their effects were not as severe in the southern Rocky Mountains and Northern Mexico as elsewhere in North zzso In this context, we test hypotheses about the historical demography of zzso zzso based on 136 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis yielded four zzso corresponding to northwestern United States and southwestern Canada zzso southwestern United States zzso zzso northwestern Mexico zzso Madre zzso zzso and northeastern Mexico zzso Madre zzso zzso zzso of demographic expansion were examined through neutrality tests against population growth and mismatch zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso zzso have experienced demographic expansion events, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso times between pairs of zzso were estimated from early to middle zzso The longer divergence time between zzso and all other zzso could be the result of zzso within the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains and long-term isolation from southernmost populations in zzso The results obtained in this study are in agreement with the evolutionary history of the host zzso as the warmer climates of zzso periods pushed zzso zzso of Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, whereas environmental changes reduced the population size of zzso and forced fragmentation of distribution range southward into northern zzso
