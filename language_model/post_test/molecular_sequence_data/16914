The control of zzso gene expression in the human pathogen zzso zzso is under the partial control of the zzso zzso system zzso by genes of the zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene has been shown by zzso acid sequence similarity to be the putative response zzso however, binding of zzso to promoters under its control has not yet been zzso In this study, we isolated and zzso soluble zzso by expression under zzso shock conditions and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso binding to the zzso zzso region by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was localized by zzso I protection zzso to a pair of direct repeats in the zzso and zzso promoter regions of the zzso zzso We found that this binding was enhanced by the addition of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in binding affinity between these two promoters was found to result from a zzso difference between the downstream direct repeats of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these base pairs in the zzso site to match those found in the zzso site increased the affinity of zzso for the zzso site relative to that for the zzso zzso These results are consistent with the function of zzso as a response regulator with recognition sites in the promoter regions of zzso and the zzso zzso
