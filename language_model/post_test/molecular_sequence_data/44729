The r locus of zzso regulates zzso synthesis in various zzso of zzso through the production of zzso DNA binding proteins capable of inducing expression of structural genes in the zzso zzso zzso The complex r zzso zzso standard zzso zzso frequent zzso through a variety of mechanisms including displaced zzso and crossing over, and zzso zzso Here we report a new mechanism for zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of a novel family of zzso zzso Because the elements were first identified in the zzso gene of the zzso complex, they have been named P instability Factor zzso Two different zzso elements were cloned and found to have identical sequences at their zzso but divergent internal zzso In addition, the zzso elements showed a marked specificity of zzso zzso Six out of seven zzso derivatives examined had an element inserted at an identical zzso Two different members of the zzso element family were identified at this zzso The seventh zzso zzso examined had the element inserted at a distinct position within zzso Even at this location, however, the element inserted into a zzso target zzso The timing of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso rates can range up to several percent of zzso Yet zzso sectors are rare, even in lines exhibiting high zzso zzso zzso
