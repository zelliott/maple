Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cases clinically resistant to zzso zzso were analyzed for the mechanism of zzso resistance in zzso The purpose of the study was to focus the attention of zzso on the frequency of occurrence of zzso resistance in zzso and to characterize such a zzso We employed zzso plaque reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso confirmation zzso analysis and sequencing to detect any zzso in zzso zzso gene in this zzso zzso Four of the seven zzso zzso proved zzso resistant by plaque reduction zzso and three of them showed reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility pattern indicative of zzso within 335 base pair zzso product zzso the suggested zzso zzso hotspot (7 zzso was detected in 2 of these 3 zzso DNA sequencing showed a deletion at zzso position 336 from the zzso gene zzso start in both the zzso This zzso has generated the first zzso stop zzso 27 zzso downstream in the zzso open reading zzso Our study also suggests the need of zzso surveillance of zzso resistance in zzso types in a given geographic location for better management of zzso zzso
