In human cervical zzso zzso DNA is frequently integrated in the cell zzso We have cloned the integration site of human zzso DNA in human zzso region zzso present in the zzso cervical zzso cell zzso zzso DNA is broken from zzso zzso to zzso in the E1 and zzso open reading zzso resulting in a deletion of zzso bases of viral zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged and zzso zzso shows that there is no zzso between the target cellular and viral DNA, suggesting it is a zzso zzso The target cellular region is called zzso associated locus 2 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso derived from the hybrid zzso clone detect completely different zzso restriction fragments in DNA from cells with normal zzso zzso There is no overlap between the restriction maps of the target zzso clones obtained with zzso and zzso zzso zzso from these zzso clones beyond the zzso position do not detect any DNA zzso in zzso cells zzso These data prove that there is a deletion of cellular DNA as consequence of the integration, with an estimated minimum size of 14 zzso Both cellular zzso zzso are outside the zzso of this zzso region identified in the zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso genes and where zzso zzso are located in zzso The integration at zzso might have been selected by its contribution to the tumor zzso
