In zzso the family of zzso zzso genes includes a number of genes zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which act as guides in the maturation or zzso modifications of target zzso zzso Since in zzso zzso zzso only few examples of zzso have been identified so far by zzso libraries zzso integration of the molecular data with in zzso identification of these types of genes could throw light on their organization in the zzso zzso 

We have performed a zzso screening of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso followed by experimental validation of the putative zzso Few of the 26 confirmed zzso had been recognized by zzso library zzso Organization of the zzso zzso was also found to be more variegated than previously suspected, with zzso genes zzso in both the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This finding suggests that the presence of additional mechanisms of zzso zzso based on the alternative production of overlapping zzso zzso
