zzso is the smallest member of the zzso family of snake zzso zzso containing four zzso in a zzso chain of 49 zzso zzso assignment of zzso has been made previously by zzso and chemical zzso A full assignment was made by a newly developed chemical approach, using partial reduction with zzso at acid zzso Reduction proceeded in a zzso manner at pH 3, and the zzso were isolated by high performance liquid zzso zzso of free zzso followed by zzso analysis, enabled all four bridges to be zzso zzso at 20 degrees C a single bridge linking zzso zzso 11 was broken, giving a relatively stable zzso zzso with further treatment at 41 degrees C the bridges zzso zzso 32 and zzso zzso 37 became accessible to the zzso and were reduced at zzso equal zzso zzso the two zzso peptides produced in this manner were less stable and could be reduced at 20 degrees C to a zzso that retains a single bridge linking zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso can be reduced to the linear zzso at 20 degrees zzso Some zzso exchange occurred during zzso of the zzso zzso but results zzso show the pattern to be zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison is made with zzso a longer zzso whose zzso structure has been proposed from zzso zzso
