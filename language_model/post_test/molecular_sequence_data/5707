zzso the function of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso is a promising way to prevent zzso from causing tissue damage during zzso zzso and zzso are humanized zzso which bind to human zzso and block its function as an zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of the action of zzso and zzso we determined their zzso on zzso at the zzso acid zzso The analysis of human zzso and zzso zzso proteins demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso is necessary for the binding of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso binding is sensitive to zzso acid changes at positions 11, 56, 87, 89, 105, 107 and 111 zzso from the zzso of mature zzso while zzso binding is sensitive to zzso acid changes at 45, 46 and zzso Both zzso are located close to the predicted zzso binding site, indicating that zzso and zzso block the function of zzso by directly zzso the binding to zzso zzso
