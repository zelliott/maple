The zzso zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar zzso integration and zzso reactions between specific DNA regions known as attachment zzso zzso However, the zzso proteins of zzso and zzso are unable to zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites of both zzso contain weak binding sites for zzso known as zzso zzso zzso acting zzso zzso associated with specific core sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the barrier to zzso zzso In this study, we used challenge zzso to demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso cannot bind to core sites containing zzso specificity zzso in zzso We isolated zzso of the zzso zzso which bind the zzso zzso core zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso have changed a zzso in the zzso zzso domain, which may be directly zzso the core site zzso We suggest that binding to the zzso zzso site was accomplished by removing the zzso charged zzso zzso which normally zzso in a conflicting interaction with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We showed that, although our zzso retain the ability to recombine their zzso zzso sites, they are unable to recombine zzso zzso zzso
