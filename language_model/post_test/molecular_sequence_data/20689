zzso receptors function to control many aspects of motor control and other forms of zzso in both zzso and zzso They can be divided into two main groups zzso and zzso based on sequence zzso zzso affinity and zzso zzso However, little is known about the pharmacology and functionality of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has recently been placed as the most zzso of all the zzso A zzso study shows that zzso has at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso was found to have high levels of sequence similarity to both zzso zzso receptors and to zzso zzso Here, we report on the cloning of zzso from an adult zzso zzso library, and its pharmacological characterization subsequent to its expression in both zzso cell lines and zzso zzso It was found that zzso has a similar pharmacology to zzso zzso zzso including responding to zzso zzso The pharmacology of the zzso exhibits zzso zzso depending upon the second zzso zzso to which it is zzso Moreover, no pharmacological characteristics were observed to suggest that zzso may be an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
