zzso protein A zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that is essential for general DNA zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso 33 and 14 zzso We have identified by zzso screening a novel zzso protein called zzso that interacts with the zzso domain of the largest zzso of zzso zzso zzso are found in human and in zzso but not in zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in zzso egg extracts together with another 90 zzso protein that was identified as zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso but not zzso zzso is required for nuclear import of zzso zzso of zzso from the egg extracts blocks nuclear import of zzso but not that of zzso a classical import zzso zzso import can be restored by addition of zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso alpha blocks import of zzso but not that of zzso zzso pull-down zzso shows that zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso beta as well as with zzso in zzso Finally, zzso import can be zzso from the zzso zzso We propose that zzso plays the role of zzso alpha in the zzso import zzso zzso serves as an zzso to link zzso to zzso zzso
