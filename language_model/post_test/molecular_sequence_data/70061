Studies were performed to identify a pair of zzso specific for the zzso encephalitis zzso virus complex of the zzso with which to develop a rapid and specific identification system based on reverse zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso The specificity of a putative primer pair was examined by zzso of representative viruses from other zzso complexes of the zzso and by computer sequence zzso zzso All viruses of the zzso complex tested, with a single exception, were identified by zzso using the identified primer zzso zzso data suggest that one of the putative zzso identified in these studies may have zzso group zzso The advantages of such a primer in the development of identification systems for all virus complexes of the zzso is zzso
