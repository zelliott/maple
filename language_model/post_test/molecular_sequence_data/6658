To extend our knowledge of genes expressed during early zzso the differential display technique was used to identify and isolate zzso sequences that accumulate zzso in young zzso zzso zzso One of these genes encodes a new member of the zzso domain family of regulatory zzso it has been designated zzso (for zzso zzso shows a novel pattern of expression that is distinct from those of previously characterized family zzso zzso gel zzso analyses and in zzso zzso techniques were used to demonstrate that zzso zzso accumulated primarily in the zzso and was present in all embryonic zzso beginning at least as early as late zzso stage in zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones corresponding to two zzso genes from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene from zzso which is located on zzso 5, were isolated and zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain were used to probe zzso and zzso proteins were found in zzso of a variety of zzso including plants as zzso related as zzso Based on these data, we suggest that zzso is likely to be an important component of the regulatory zzso directing zzso processes in the developing zzso
