Human zzso zzso and mouse or rat zzso are linked to zzso in the genes zzso zzso that zzso zzso or zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso To explore its possible zzso in zzso function, we used protein zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso and identified zzso zzso zzso as a novel partner of zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso which could serve as an important source of zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso complex in the brain, whereas binding studies showed that they interact with each other zzso zzso and in zzso zzso revealed high zzso expression in zzso and zzso broadly overlapping with the expression pattern previously reported for zzso zzso zzso expression was activated in zzso zzso of the embryonic zzso cell line zzso whereas its zzso in rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso from the zzso to zzso zzso It also reduced the zzso levels of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that through binding to zzso zzso could regulate zzso synthesis at zzso during zzso Thus, loss of zzso function could render zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso or other neurological zzso
