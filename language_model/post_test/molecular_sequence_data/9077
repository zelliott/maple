The rapid promotion of zzso is critical for tissue engineering and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso scaffolds has already been the major criterion for choosing and designing ideal biological zzso We here report systematic in zzso studies on the zzso activity of two zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the chicken zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the two functional motifs zzso and zzso improved the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically and provided ideal synthetic zzso for zzso cell migration and zzso structure zzso zzso A zzso zzso was carried out to assess the efficiency of various zzso scaffolds in inducing zzso invasion in zzso Among these three zzso zzso the zzso zzso scaffold zzso presented a significantly better zzso activity inducing zzso tissue invasion and new zzso vessel formation within the scaffolds in the absence of zzso With the addition of zzso more newly formed vessel zzso could be observed in all zzso zzso Our results suggested that the zzso zzso scaffolds had satisfactory zzso properties, and may also have wide potential applications in tissue zzso
