Three overlapping zzso artificial zzso zzso spanning a zzso zzso region of DNA around the zzso locus on zzso 11 have been isolated and zzso The individual cloned regions have been mapped by in zzso zzso to zzso band zzso and a restriction zzso map of this region has been zzso The positions of these clones in relation to a series of zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso It was concluded that, although two clones lay entirely zzso to the zzso zzso the third clone zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was observed in an acute zzso zzso in a patient previously treated for an unrelated zzso It would thus appear that the zzso at zzso band zzso occurring in zzso zzso are in the same region as those found in adult and childhood acute zzso and may result from a common underlying zzso
