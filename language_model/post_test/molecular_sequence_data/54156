zzso manipulation of cellular zzso is contingent upon the development of proteins and zzso with zzso DNA sequence zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso of the DNA sequence specificity of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and comparative sequence analyses were used to predict a network of zzso acid zzso that mediate zzso and zzso DNA sequence zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso rounds of positive zzso selection, we identified extensively redesigned and highly zzso zzso and zzso populations in the context of engineered zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequences zzso more effectively than their parental zzso zzso zzso revealed the molecular basis of zzso and zzso DNA sequence zzso When used as rationally designed zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso modified zzso and zzso DNA zzso Early studies on the directed evolution of zzso zzso DNA sequence specificity produced zzso with relaxed zzso specificity as a result of randomly incorporated zzso In the current study, we focused our zzso exclusively on DNA zzso leading to redesigned zzso that remained highly specific and directed zzso integration into the human zzso with zzso zzso These results demonstrate that unique zzso and zzso derivatives can be developed to zzso modify the human zzso in the context of zzso zzso fusion zzso
