zzso genes zzso surface proteins belonging to the zzso family have been identified by in zzso analysis of six zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven genes zzso previously described zzso while 10 have not yet been zzso Of these, eight contain the zzso sorting signal zzso responsible for zzso zzso proteins to the zzso zzso The remaining two, zzso and zzso zzso a single zzso variation in the fourth position of the zzso motif zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins demonstrated the release of zzso in the zzso zzso indicating that proteins carrying zzso are sorted zzso Analysis of primary sequences of the zzso zzso surface zzso proteins indicated that several share a similar structural organization and a common signal sequence with previously characterized zzso proteins of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso has 128 zzso B repeats that are almost identical at the DNA zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso with repeat length variations are present in the bacterial population whereas they are not zzso in the zzso region of zzso The zzso and zzso genes are significantly associated with invasive disease zzso compared to zzso carriage zzso Several zzso samples zzso from patients recovering from zzso zzso infections had higher zzso against zzso proteins than control zzso suggesting that expression occurred during infection in some zzso
