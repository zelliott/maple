Human zzso zzso represents one of the most medically important human viruses and causes a wide spectrum of human diseases, including birth defects and mental zzso in zzso common opportunistic infections in acquired zzso syndrome zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso and possibly cardiovascular diseases such as zzso This chapter describes the zzso of zzso P zzso zzso zzso as a zzso agent for blocking zzso gene expression and zzso The target for the zzso P zzso is the overlapping region of the zzso that code for zzso major zzso factors zzso and zzso which are essential for viral gene expression and zzso The methods described in this chapter focus primarily on zzso construction of the zzso zzso for expression of zzso zzso in cultured cells, zzso generation of stable cell lines expressing zzso zzso determination of the expression of zzso zzso in human cells, and zzso evaluation of the efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression and viral zzso Using these methods, we successfully constructed zzso zzso against the zzso zzso sequence and recently showed that a reduction of up to zzso to zzso in zzso growth is found in cells that express the zzso
