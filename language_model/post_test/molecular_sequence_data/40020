zzso acid zzso a chemical analogue of zzso acid zzso is widely used as a growth regulator and zzso source of zzso Because zzso evokes zzso and molecular responses similar to those evoked by zzso it is believed that they share a common response zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in a screen for resistance to the zzso zzso acid zzso is resistant to zzso yet nevertheless responds like the zzso to zzso and zzso acid in root zzso and lateral root induction zzso That the zzso zzso alters zzso responsiveness specifically was confirmed by analysis of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso backgrounds, as well as by real-time zzso zzso of zzso zzso The two characterized zzso zzso both harbor zzso zzso however, zzso responsiveness was restored by transformation with one of the genes missing in both zzso and the zzso zzso was reproduced by decreasing the expression of the same gene in the zzso using an zzso zzso The gene encodes a small, zzso protein zzso with unknown function and present in plants, animals and zzso but not in zzso or zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a regulatory component that mediates responses to zzso and that responses to zzso and zzso are partially zzso
