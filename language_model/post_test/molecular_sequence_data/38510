In contrast to the highly zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has low zzso potential and produces a broad range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Lawrence, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso To determine the origin of the zzso property of the zzso product, we used experimental zzso restraints and molecular dynamics to determine the solution structure of a zzso DNA zzso zzso This DNA zzso duplex zzso zzso contains a mismatched base pair between the 3' T zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and an opposed G zzso zzso The 3' T zzso of the zzso zzso formed stable hydrogen bonds with the opposing zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso and unwinding angles of the zzso duplex were much larger than those of a second duplex that contains the zzso zzso and opposing A15 and A16 zzso zzso zzso The zzso duplex showed poorer stacking interactions at the two bases of the zzso product and at the adjacent A7 small middle zzso base pair than did the zzso zzso These structural features imply that no zzso stability or zzso benefit is obtained by incorporating a G instead of an A opposite the 3' T of the zzso zzso These properties may thus facilitate the preferential incorporation of an A in accordance with the A rule during zzso replication and lead to the low frequency of 3' zzso zzso observed at this zzso
