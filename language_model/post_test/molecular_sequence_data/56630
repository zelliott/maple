zzso hormone zzso receptors zzso regulate zzso by binding to zzso response elements zzso located within promoter regions of zzso zzso In rat zzso zzso cells, expression of a reporter containing zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso gene sequences zzso linked to the zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso scanning zzso of the zzso promoter revealed that regions around zzso containing a zzso recognition sequence and around zzso are both required for regulation by zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells labeled with zzso bound only to zzso promoter DNA fragments containing the zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso contains zzso oriented as an zzso repeat separated by 6 zzso that are identical to and similar to an zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso alpha 1 forms apparent zzso and zzso complexes on the zzso zzso as found previously with an zzso repeat of the zzso zzso zzso with no zzso zzso zzso enhances the formation and alters the mobility of these complexes on both zzso When positioned zzso of a zzso zzso zzso reporter, the zzso zzso zzso regulation by zzso zzso in zzso cells and by zzso chicken zzso alpha 1 in zzso zzso The zzso does not bind and is not activated by zzso acid zzso zzso and nuclear proteins from zzso zzso and zzso cells form zzso on the zzso which differ in abundance and mobility from zzso formed on the zzso The identification of a zzso in the zzso promoter raises the possibility that zzso or related proteins may play important roles in regulating the life cycle of zzso zzso zzso
