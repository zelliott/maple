zzso acid zzso zzso zzso differentiation of a human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso but does not affect its zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso We found that zzso induced the zzso zzso of acid zzso zzso activity 24 h after treatment in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso did not affect neutral zzso activity in either zzso or zzso Upon treatment with zzso zzso the product of an zzso reaction, accumulated in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a marked zzso of the zzso zzso 8 h after zzso treatment, reaching a plateau at 24 zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was studied by a promoter analysis using zzso reporter zzso The zzso zzso region of human zzso gene zzso zzso with the zzso gene was introduced into zzso zzso zzso activity in transformed cells markedly increased in response to zzso stimulation when the wild type zzso or the zzso hybrid protein was zzso zzso experiments revealed that a short sequence at the zzso zzso was indispensable for the zzso zzso Within this short region, two zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso and one zzso motif zzso were zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that all three motifs are required for the full expression induced by zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with the nuclear extract of zzso zzso cells showed that proteins were bound specifically to the probe being zzso by all three motifs in the promoter zzso
