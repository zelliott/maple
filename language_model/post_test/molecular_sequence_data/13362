The capability of rat zzso cells to express receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was evaluated by binding studies and measurement of zzso zzso activity on whole zzso preparations and by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using specific zzso on preparations from isolated cell populations enriched in zzso and zzso zzso Data obtained on whole zzso preparations indicated that selective zzso receptors zzso Type I) zzso The zzso coding for zzso Type I and for the zzso zzso receptors Type II zzso (but not zzso were zzso The zzso coding for four different spliced zzso of the zzso Type I zzso were zzso In zzso producing cells, three zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso whereas in zzso cells the zzso coding for the zzso having a zzso acid insert zzso zzso in the third zzso loop was the only zzso
