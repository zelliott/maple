zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso is a zzso condition that in some cases displays zzso zzso zzso By systematically searching for linkage in multiplex affected families, we mapped a locus for zzso to zzso zzso As the previously cloned zzso hormone zzso zzso gene had been assigned to zzso we searched it for zzso A zzso transition in zzso 7 of zzso predicting an Ala to Val substitution at zzso 189 in the zzso zzso domain zzso perfectly with the disease zzso zzso of the gene in zzso cells demonstrated a dramatic reduction of binding capacity and signal zzso but apparently normal zzso affinity of the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso causes zzso in these zzso
