zzso resistance and resistance specificity frequently restrict the application of a disease resistance zzso gene in crop breeding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso type plasma membrane zzso mediate zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes bacterial zzso one of the most devastating rice zzso Plants carrying zzso and plants carrying zzso have different resistance zzso and the functions of the two R genes are regulated by zzso zzso Four zzso genes zzso proteins consisting of different parts of zzso and zzso were constructed by domain swapping and transformed into a susceptible rice zzso The resistance zzso and zzso resistance of the transgenic plants carrying zzso zzso or zzso gene to different zzso strains were analyzed in the same genetic zzso The results suggest that the gradually increased expression of zzso and zzso plays an important role in the progressively enhanced zzso resistance during rice zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are important zzso of zzso recognition during zzso interaction, but zzso regions of the two R proteins also appear to contribute to resistance zzso
