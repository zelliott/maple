A basic protein zzso zzso named basic protein II, was zzso to zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso after four zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this protein was determined by sequencing the zzso zzso and its peptides produced by chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein consisted of 122 zzso acid zzso and was found to be identical in sequence to basic protein I from the same source except that zzso of basic protein I is replaced by zzso Like basic protein I, the structural feature of basic protein II is that zzso and zzso common in zzso zzso from snake zzso and zzso zzso are replaced by zzso and zzso zzso Thus, basic protein II belongs to the category of zzso zzso The action of basic protein II on zzso released only zzso acid, indicating that it has zzso zzso zzso Its zzso activity toward zzso however, was only zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso zzso for zzso and zzso toward zzso zzso of basic protein II were 8 and zzso times, respectively, smaller than those of zzso zzso from the same source, zzso the low zzso zzso activity of basic protein zzso
