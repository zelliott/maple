A zzso clone for the human zzso gene was isolated and zzso An zzso was located within the coding region and began 211 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Except for this zzso the zzso sequence shares zzso identity to the published zzso zzso zzso A second zzso was located in the 3' zzso 6 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene was determined by primer extension and confirmed by zzso mapping zzso Analysis of the zzso region of the gene revealed that the promoter sequences zzso and zzso were 30 and 160 zzso upstream, respectively, from the zzso Other potential zzso factor binding sites included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso inserted into a reporter zzso for zzso zzso were zzso into zzso and zzso activity was zzso higher compared with controls lacking zzso zzso These data indicate that the promoter region of the isolated zzso gene is zzso
