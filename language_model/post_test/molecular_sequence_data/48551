zzso a zzso copper zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso zzso zzso The structure and functions of zzso have so far been studied zzso but the zzso maturation process from the zzso to the active form has been less zzso In this study, we provide the crystal structures of zzso zzso full-length zzso in the zzso and the zzso at zzso and zzso zzso resolution, respectively, revealing that zzso on the zzso domain is zzso in the zzso site as a zzso analog to protect the zzso active site from zzso access zzso zzso of the zzso domain or deformation of the zzso domain by acid treatment zzso the zzso to the active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso studies have shown that the copper incorporation into the active site is governed by three zzso as zzso zzso which is zzso bound to zzso via an unusual zzso linkage in the zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso motif located on the zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of the maturation processes of zzso zzso involving the accommodation of the zzso copper unit, the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, and the zzso zzso zzso to produce the active zzso have been discussed on the basis of the detailed structural zzso
