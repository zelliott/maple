Using 62 zzso zzso obtained with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we identify zzso start sites of zzso zzso 53 of which are transcribed from multiple start zzso zzso start sites are identified by analyzing probe signal zzso zzso created from probe pairs tiled every 5 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso from zzso binding the same message are zzso The contribution of each promoter for genes transcribed from multiple promoters is zzso Knowing the zzso start site enables targeted searching for zzso binding motifs in the promoter regions of genes with similar expression zzso We identified 27 zzso 17 of which share no similarity to the characterized motifs of other zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso we predict zzso zzso We verified novel promoter motifs that regulate zzso zzso including those responding to uranium challenge, a zzso zzso factor and a zzso zzso zzso
