We report here the characterization of the first zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and the zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso is a zzso of 180 zzso which shows a much higher similarity with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso Like human zzso zzso shows an absolute specificity for zzso and zzso zzso shares 50% identity with zzso from zzso zzso zzso The alignment of the protein sequences of zzso and zzso indicates that only four zzso changes are able to switch the specificity of zzso from a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso still maintaining the same overall active site zzso zzso is highly zzso with an optimum temperature of 120 degrees C and is characterized by extreme zzso stability zzso 110 degrees C that increases to 120 degrees C in the presence of 100 zzso zzso kinetic stability zzso residual activity after 4 h incubation at 100 degrees zzso and remarkable zzso Limited zzso indicated that the only zzso zzso site is localized in the zzso region and that the zzso zzso is not necessary for the integrity of the active zzso By zzso zzso zzso with mass zzso we assigned three pairs of zzso zzso bridges that play a role in the stability of the zzso against zzso zzso The characterization of the zzso properties of the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso motif in the zzso region may also account for the extreme zzso zzso
