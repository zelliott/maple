zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso molecules in signal zzso regulated by a plethora of molecules in either an zzso synergistic or zzso zzso Out of nine different zzso each zzso zzso uses an individual set of zzso In the present study, we have used zzso zzso point zzso and zzso competition studies with zzso to show a common mechanism of multiple contact sites for the regulatory molecules zzso and zzso Despite their chemical, structural and functional variety and different target motifs on zzso zzso and zzso share a zzso mechanism with zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to interact with both zzso zzso of zzso from inside the zzso zzso as well as at the zzso An individual interaction site located at zzso of the specifically regulated zzso zzso had been ascribed for both zzso and zzso In the present study we now show for these two regulators of zzso that a second zzso and zzso contact site in zzso is necessary to render zzso activity susceptible to zzso or zzso zzso In addition to the zzso motif in zzso of zzso zzso contacts the zzso loop in zzso whereas zzso requires not only the zzso zzso region in zzso but also a zzso domain in zzso of zzso containing the zzso loop to stimulate this zzso zzso
