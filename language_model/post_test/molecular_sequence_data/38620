Two zzso zzso enable the zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso to use molecular hydrogen as the sole energy zzso The complex synthesis of the zzso zzso has to be efficiently regulated in response to zzso which is available in low amounts in zzso zzso zzso sensing in zzso zzso is achieved by a zzso protein which controls the zzso gene expression in concert with a zzso regulatory zzso In this study we show that the zzso sensor of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Although capable of zzso zzso with zzso zzso as electron zzso the protein did not support zzso growth in the absence of the zzso zzso A specifically designed zzso system for zzso zzso provided the basis for identifying the zzso sensor as a zzso regulatory zzso The data support previous results which showed that the sensor has an active site similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated that in addition to the zzso activity the regulatory function of the zzso sensor is zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso sensing requires an active zzso zzso leaving the question open whether only zzso binding or subsequent zzso zzso and electron transfer processes are necessary for zzso The regulatory role of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which has also been investigated in other zzso bacteria, is intimately correlated with a set of typical structural zzso Thus, the family of zzso sensors represents a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso
