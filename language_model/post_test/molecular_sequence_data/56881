A simple, zzso zzso usable for the detection of zzso zzso activity and zzso has been zzso It uses a zzso zzso immobilized on zzso plates that is able to specifically recognize the Big zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso This zzso is zzso between zzso zzso by zzso with almost the same zzso rate as Big zzso and after zzso treatment it does not bind to the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso bound to the plate is detected by subsequent treatment with zzso zzso to zzso followed by a zzso zzso Model inhibitor profiles generated for zzso a zzso known to convert Big zzso in zzso demonstrated the utility of this zzso as a rapid zzso aid in the study of Big zzso zzso processing and possibly in the identification of putative zzso zzso
