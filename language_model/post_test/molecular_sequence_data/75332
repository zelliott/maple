The primary sequences of five zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind with various affinities zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso haloperidol, have been zzso zzso light and heavy chain zzso was isolated and gene sequence determined by primer extension in the presence of zzso The pattern of insertions and deletions found within the zzso regions produce zzso which differ in length from one zzso to another, and are directly responsible for establishing the gross architecture of the combining zzso Two of the zzso zzso have long zzso zzso which form a zzso combining zzso Three other zzso have deletions of 3 or 4 zzso acids in the third heavy chain zzso producing region which result in a zzso combining site as determined by computer based molecular zzso A discussion of the probable mechanism by which the given sequences were generated from various gene segments is also zzso
