zzso zzso and kidney necrosis virus zzso is the type species of zzso zzso A novel membrane protein corresponding to the first open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso has a high content of zzso sequences and contains zzso putative zzso zzso indicating it may be a membrane zzso The zzso zzso start site was extended 433 zzso upstream of the start zzso and the zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was first transcribed at 8 h zzso zzso zzso protein was detected on the plasma membrane of zzso infected cells by zzso In order to further investigate different zzso zzso influence on zzso zzso of zzso series of truncated or deleted zzso were constructed with zzso at the C zzso The zzso results indicated that the second putative zzso domain played a zzso role in zzso membrane zzso and the zzso of the first and third zzso zzso depended on their interactions with the second zzso zzso this novel zzso protein is considered to serve as a model for analyzing the zzso and roles of different zzso regions in zzso zzso
