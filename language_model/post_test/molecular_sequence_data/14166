zzso zzso zzso were developed for zzso zzso an endangered zzso tree endemic to China, to assess its genetic diversity and population structure as well as its evolutionary zzso 

Using the compound zzso marker technique, 10 pairs of zzso zzso zzso were isolated and characterized in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were tested across a total of 63 individuals from three natural zzso zzso numbers varied from 10 to 20 per zzso with an average of zzso zzso per zzso The observed zzso per locus ranged from zzso to zzso and the expected zzso ranged from zzso to zzso 

The highly zzso markers developed and characterized in this study will facilitate evolutionary and population genetic studies in zzso zzso
