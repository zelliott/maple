We show that the single zzso of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso contains a cryptic promoter for zzso of the second zzso This promoter is inactive in the normal zzso zzso but can be activated when the zzso gene promoter is zzso An identical zzso was induced by placing efficient zzso zzso at position 61 of the 309 zzso zzso In all cases transcripts with identical zzso ends close to the boundary of the zzso and the second zzso were zzso These results indicate that the cryptic promoter in the zzso zzso is zzso in the normal zzso gene by zzso interference with the zzso gene zzso zzso initiation near the zzso 2 boundary is enabled by protection from zzso zzso that initiated zzso at the upstream located zzso gene zzso A partial promoter protection using leaky zzso resulted in small amounts of transcripts initiated from the cryptic zzso Although we do not know any function of the cryptic promoter in zzso gene zzso it is tentative to speculate that the cryptic zzso promoter might be a zzso of a promoter that was functional earlier in zzso
