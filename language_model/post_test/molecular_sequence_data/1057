zzso motifs found in known bacterial zzso DNA zzso sequences were identified, and zzso zzso zzso were designed for zzso amplification of an internal portion of zzso genes from all bacterial zzso We describe here a method that has allowed the rapid identification and isolation of 13 zzso genes from a diverse selection of zzso bacteria and report on the zzso characteristics of nine of the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso showed significant zzso activity in the presence of zzso particularly the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
