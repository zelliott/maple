Based on sequence zzso several zzso zzso zzso proteins have been grouped in the zzso zzso family, which comprises at least 40 proteins involved mainly in zzso zzso zzso The core member of this family is zzso a moderately zzso protein with a double zzso barrel zzso zzso and the recently identified zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso interaction, and can be considered zzso zzso zzso zzso is more active in inducing defense when in an zzso zzso than in its native form, but little is known about other zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was used to characterize the protein zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is more active in inducing defense, and that the unfolding process can be induced by interaction with zzso inanimate surfaces such as zzso treated zzso and gold zzso In zzso we found that both zzso and zzso interact with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso we propose that the interaction of these proteins with host zzso waxes could induce unfolding and consequently trigger their zzso zzso
