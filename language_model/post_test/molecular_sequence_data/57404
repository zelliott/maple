zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso A was expressed in zzso coli in order to identify the zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Two zzso acid regions that are zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso A and B had characteristics consistent with two zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso and zzso to generate three zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins with regard to zzso activity revealed that zzso zzso exhibited zzso of control zzso activity, zzso zzso was totally inactive and zzso zzso was fully zzso The reduced levels of zzso activity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were correlated with an altered ability of the zzso zzso to bind zzso as determined by zzso affinity zzso Neither zzso binding nor zzso binding appeared to be zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the same characteristics as the zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly indicated zzso that zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso are necessary for zzso zzso activity and form part of the zzso domain, and zzso that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in either zzso binding or zzso stimulation by zzso
