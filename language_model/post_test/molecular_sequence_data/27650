zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is an alpha zzso domain zzso that causes zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is zzso by a reduction of zzso zzso zzso and by the development of a major zzso zzso at the expense of the alpha zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, following zzso transfer onto zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso results from a zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso probe and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites detected with this probe, we concluded that zzso zzso is associated with the + - + zzso (in the above zzso Twenty zzso zzso complementary to zzso segments from zzso 2 and 3, respectively, were zzso We then performed DNA amplification and zzso In the two investigated carriers of zzso zzso we found the zzso base substitution of the zzso corresponding to position 35 of the alpha zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso lies in the last part of an alpha zzso that extends from zzso 9 to 44 of partial repeat alpha zzso and is comparable with zzso 3 of full repeats 1 to zzso The modified zzso site, located 25 zzso acid zzso upstream, occurs at the beginning of the zzso
