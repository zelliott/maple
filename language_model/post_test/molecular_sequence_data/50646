The sequence of zzso zzso of the zzso region of an ordinary strain of potato virus S was determined from cloned zzso This portion of the viral zzso contains two major open reading frames zzso zzso the coat protein of zzso and a protein of zzso 3' to the coat zzso both of which showed high zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with the equivalent proteins of the Andean zzso A major block of zzso acids that differ between the ordinary and Andean strains was present in both the coat protein and the zzso These blocks may be responsible for the substantial differences between the ordinary and Andean strains at the symptom and zzso zzso zzso
