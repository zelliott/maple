The zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as a tightly bound zzso The exact function of this tightly bound zzso however, has not been zzso In order to probe the function of this unusually strong interaction between zzso and zzso a 30 zzso acid zzso derived from the putative zzso binding site of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso and zzso form a zzso complex as well as several higher molecular weight zzso When zzso in the presence of a zzso excess of zzso to zzso over zzso of the zzso activity was zzso This zzso could be prevented with the addition of zzso bovine zzso to the zzso mixture, in a zzso zzso Native PAGE and Western zzso analysis of zzso treated with zzso revealed the formation of a zzso complex with zzso derived from zzso Moreover, zzso (5 zzso caused a zzso zzso zzso of activity that was reversed by the addition of zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, suggesting a role for zzso in this zzso zzso also changed the native PAGE mobility of zzso and increased the intensity of a band which zzso with zzso These results demonstrate that the binding interaction between zzso and zzso is tight but zzso requires zzso and is zzso from other known zzso zzso
