zzso zzso zzso are important zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of six genes coding for zzso zzso zzso belonging to clan CA have been identified in zzso zzso At least 23 distinct spots with zzso activity have been detected by two-dimensional zzso zzso gel zzso from in zzso grown zzso however, only few of them have been zzso In this work, we detected six spots with zzso activity and molecular weights between 25 and 35 zzso The six zzso zzso to two distinct zzso families: the zzso family, represented by four spots with zzso between zzso and zzso and the zzso family represented by two spots with zzso zzso and zzso Next, we obtained two zzso zzso for zzso zzso from zzso zzso which were named zzso and zzso The size of these zzso clones were zzso and zzso zzso which zzso for 388 and 415 zzso zzso zzso Their putative translation products have molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to inactive zzso zzso zzso The two sequences share approximately zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso These protein products can be classified within a branch of the zzso family in clan CD zzso zzso due to their sensitivity to specific zzso zzso their DNA zzso and zzso zzso However, they do not zzso either to the typical zzso zzso or the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso are likely to be part of a new zzso within the zzso family of clan CD zzso zzso Furthermore, they could be one of the missing links between zzso and zzso zzso in clan CD zzso
