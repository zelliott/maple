zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso cells showed zzso selectivity for big zzso zzso when compared to big zzso big zzso big zzso and big zzso To investigate the big zzso structure important for specific conversion by the zzso zzso we zzso a series of truncated zzso of big zzso measured the zzso of their zzso bonds, and found that a zzso zzso big zzso is the minimal zzso zzso This suggests that an unusually long zzso sequence is required for big zzso zzso zzso substitution for individual zzso acids in the zzso region of big zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are more important than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso efficient zzso of the zzso bond, even though the former zzso are located at more distant positions from the zzso sites than are the zzso These results, together with the fact that big zzso and big zzso show zzso in the big zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that the zzso sequence in the zzso region of big zzso plays the most important role in selective conversion by zzso converting zzso
