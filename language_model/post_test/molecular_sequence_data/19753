zzso binding proteins zzso are found to participate in various processes of DNA metabolism in all known zzso We describe here a zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is the first noted attempt at characterizing a zzso protein from a zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds zzso to zzso with the same high affinity as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso protein derivatives suggest that zzso occurs via a putative zzso structure predicted by three-dimensional zzso The native zzso forms zzso as determined by gel zzso zzso These results allow distinguishing the first zzso zzso protein with zzso binding zzso which defines a novel cluster of zzso zzso zzso The possible role of zzso in zzso zzso cycle is also zzso
