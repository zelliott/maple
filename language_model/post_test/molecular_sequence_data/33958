zzso human zzso zzso are the recognized zzso agents of cervical zzso A number of zzso zzso and molecular data suggest that zzso of the same zzso type are distinct biologically and may zzso differential zzso zzso zzso investigation of zzso zzso of clinically important zzso types may be important for the identification of zzso important zzso In this study, the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and long control region zzso of zzso 31 and 58, identified in women with abnormal cervical zzso were zzso Several zzso were identified in the regions zzso Of the zzso found in the zzso region of zzso 31 and 58, the novel zzso described in this study fall within a protein region which may play a critical role in the binding of zzso zzso against different zzso zzso No significant association was found between the E6 and zzso zzso of both zzso types and the zzso zzso zzso Some zzso found in the zzso of zzso 31 and 58 zzso known zzso binding sites with possible consequences on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genetic characterization of zzso types may help to define the zzso risk of zzso zzso
