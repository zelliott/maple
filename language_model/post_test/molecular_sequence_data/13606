zzso sequence analysis of zzso chain zzso DNA fragments from the large zzso protein zzso gene of human zzso 6 zzso was performed with use of zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from four zzso zzso In two cases, zzso gene sequences were identical in paired zzso zzso thus suggesting that zzso transmission of zzso may have zzso The genetic stability of zzso strains was confirmed by the fact that there was no difference between amplified DNA fragments from sequential zzso samples from two of two infants zzso In contrast, a change in the amplified viral strain was detected in an infant who had zzso with zzso zzso B zzso Furthermore, zzso strains zzso amplified from saliva and zzso from an adult were found to be zzso The data suggest that zzso may be frequently transmitted from zzso and that zzso with zzso may zzso
