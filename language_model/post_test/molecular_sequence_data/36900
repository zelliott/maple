The effects of peripherally administered zzso hormone zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso on the relative zzso of nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso in the zzso and zzso of young adult zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso activity were measured since zzso and zzso have been shown to enhance the expression of this marker zzso of central zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso were increased significantly zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso following zzso zzso Despite enhanced abundance of zzso in the zzso zzso activity was zzso whereas zzso activity was modestly increased by zzso in the zzso without corresponding changes in zzso zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso administration is capable of inducing the zzso of zzso in addition to zzso but that the induction levels of zzso cannot be directly correlated with zzso of the zzso system as measured by zzso zzso
