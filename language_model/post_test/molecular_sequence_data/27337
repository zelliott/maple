In this work we have studied the properties of the novel mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and the structural and functional properties of these particles were studied by a combination of zzso approaches, atomic force zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso I and zzso radical zzso as well as zzso and zzso III zzso demonstrated an altered structure of the zzso zzso all over the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso accessibility experiments revealed that the interactions of the zzso zzso zzso with the ends of the zzso DNA are highly zzso zzso imaging showed that the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with only approximately 130 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a type of a zzso on a zzso structure, which was quite different from the zzso triangle zzso organization of conventional zzso zzso The presence of zzso affected both the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso These unusual properties of the zzso zzso suggest a specific role of zzso during mouse zzso
