The major zzso of zzso growth factor 3 zzso is initiated from a zzso zzso and the zzso product is distributed to the zzso and zzso zzso This dual zzso zzso is achieved in part by the competing effects of two classical zzso targeting signals located near the zzso zzso At the extreme zzso zzso is a short stretch of 29 zzso acids before a signal zzso necessary for zzso into the zzso zzso which is next to an adjacent zzso nuclear zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso is also implicated in zzso zzso We describe here the characterization of zzso signals by showing they are capable of directing a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso Furthermore, appending both the zzso and zzso zzso onto zzso reproduces the dual zzso zzso properties of zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso appears to be zzso since it binds to zzso zzso the nuclear zzso signal binding zzso of a zzso zzso of the nuclear import zzso The import of zzso into the nucleus is zzso and the zzso of this process has demonstrated the importance of the zzso retention signal in zzso and zzso zzso
