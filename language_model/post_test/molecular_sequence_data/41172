Two groups of zzso zzso bacterial strains previously isolated from experimental zzso were investigated to determine their zzso zzso Based on their zzso zzso gene zzso these zzso formed two distinct groups within the zzso zzso The gene sequence similarities of the new zzso to the type strains of zzso species were below zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso 11 as the zzso fatty acid and a polar zzso pattern with zzso zzso zzso and zzso was in accordance with the characteristics of this zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso tests and zzso properties allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of the strains from all recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso were assigned to two novel species of this zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
