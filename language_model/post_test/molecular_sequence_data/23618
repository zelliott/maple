Previous studies have suggested that differences in the ability of normal and zzso cells to process certain alternatively spliced zzso transcripts can be exploited as a potentially powerful means of targeting the expression of therapeutic genes to tumor cells in zzso and in zzso Specifically, it was shown that efficient processing of zzso zzso containing the alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso only occurs in tumor cells that express zzso zzso that incorporate these zzso zzso zzso In the present study, efforts were made to define the molecular mechanisms that zzso the apparent specificity of this zzso zzso analysis and DNA sequencing were used to characterize the various zzso events that occur between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso following zzso of zzso zzso containing these various zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The results obtained confirm that although the zzso zzso is efficiently removed in both zzso and zzso cells, the corresponding zzso zzso is accurately spliced and the zzso appropriately joined only in lines that express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell lines zzso zzso alternative zzso and 3' zzso sites located within the zzso zzso are zzso used, resulting in various portions of the zzso being retained within the final processed zzso zzso It is proposed that identification of these functionally important zzso sequence elements will facilitate the development of second generation zzso activated gene zzso zzso that may prove useful in various cancer gene therapy zzso
