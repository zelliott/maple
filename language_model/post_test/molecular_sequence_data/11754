This study demonstrates an apparent competition between newly zzso precursors of zzso and factor X for binding to and processing by the zzso in the zzso membrane of zzso The precursor of factor X appears to exhibit a strong affinity for the zzso than the zzso zzso This conclusion is supported by the findings that 1) in normal zzso the factor X precursor prevents increased zzso precursor binding to the zzso zzso 2) increased zzso binding to the zzso membrane was measured in zzso zzso zzso cells where factor X synthesis is zzso The variations in the zzso of the zzso and the factor X precursors that were as associated with the zzso membrane correlated with the available zzso and factor X zzso pools for the zzso
