zzso the zzso sheath around large diameter zzso is formed in the central nervous system zzso by zzso We isolated the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso factor, and describe the origin and development of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso transgenic animals demonstrate the highly dynamic nature of zzso membrane zzso providing a tool for studying in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and initiation of zzso expression are under the control of long-range zzso and notch signaling while maintenance of zzso expression only depends on zzso zzso of zzso did not affect zzso formation in the brain and combined zzso of zzso and zzso could not rescue loss of zzso zzso indicating that critical factors other than zzso and zzso are zzso Lastly, zzso of zzso in an zzso background did result in defects in zzso zzso indicating a functional overlap between zzso and zzso zzso
