Both the ability of zzso cells to form zzso zzso via zzso or zzso zzso and their zzso to the zzso are important if not critical during early stages of cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso have been implicated in tumor cell zzso and tissue zzso In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of T zzso in both zzso zzso of zzso human breast zzso cells and their zzso to the zzso The T zzso zzso zzso zzso selected from a zzso display library was able to inhibit spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso cells up to zzso in a zzso zzso Because T zzso has zzso as a terminal sugar, the expression profile of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso Our data indicated the abundant expression of zzso zzso and zzso in this cell line, which suggested possible interactions between zzso and T zzso As revealed by laser zzso zzso both zzso and zzso also participate in the zzso of the zzso cells to the zzso We observed the zzso of zzso on zzso cells at the sites of the contact with tumor cells, consistent with its possible interaction with T zzso on cancer cells The zzso zzso however, strongly accumulated at the sites of zzso contacts predominantly on tumor zzso The T zzso zzso significantly zzso inhibited this zzso which indicated that T zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso breast cancer cells to the zzso The ability of synthetic zzso to inhibit both the spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso cells and their zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests its potential functional significance for zzso therapy of cancer zzso
