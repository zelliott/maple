The orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of the zzso zzso and its expression has been shown to be regulated with a robust zzso rhythm in zzso and zzso In addition, in zzso its expression has been shown to be zzso zzso In order to analyze the mechanisms of the zzso gene regulation, we have isolated its zzso zzso We found that two promoters control the zzso zzso The first one zzso is characterized by a very high degree of sequence identity with the zzso zzso promoter and zzso as the zzso zzso a functional zzso site zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso using zzso zzso results in an increase of zzso gene expression suggesting that zzso is zzso its own zzso in zzso In addition, we show that zzso orphan receptors also regulate in zzso and in zzso zzso gene expression through the same zzso zzso In contrast, the second promoter zzso is zzso different from the zzso zzso its sequence is not zzso between zzso and zzso and is not regulated by the same zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso promoter, whereas zzso zzso has no zzso zzso and does not function like zzso to control zzso zzso
