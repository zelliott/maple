zzso zzso is a key zzso of T zzso with major regulatory functions in the immune zzso To determine and compare zzso interactions at the native zzso locus in T cells, we analyzed the human zzso promoter by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells and primary zzso and zzso zzso T cell zzso isolated from peripheral blood using zzso beads were cultured and analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso interactions of the zzso promoter in zzso were detected in all T cells zzso Interestingly, an zzso footprint between zzso and zzso was consistently observed in zzso T cells and zzso and zzso T helper zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso that was highly sensitive to treatment with zzso This novel target site, zzso the zzso was shown by several criteria, including cell distribution studies, stimulation experiments, zzso zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso to bind the zzso factor zzso zzso of the zzso that prevented zzso binding to this site was sufficient zzso to reduce zzso promoter activity in primary zzso T zzso In zzso the data demonstrate that zzso gene zzso in primary T cells is regulated in zzso at the level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose a model where zzso zzso is maintained by binding of various zzso factors to the zzso promoter, whereas zzso zzso zzso in zzso T cells is associated with binding of zzso to the zzso
