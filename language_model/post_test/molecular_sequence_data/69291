zzso zzso are zzso to elicit predictable zzso responses in the liver by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from mouse liver zzso rat liver zzso and zzso liver zzso zzso have been cloned zzso We now report the cloning of a new member from mouse liver which we designate zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein exhibiting zzso zzso acid similarity to zzso zzso while it showed only zzso identity with zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are best zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Like zzso zzso gamma is able to impart zzso zzso responsiveness to the promoter of zzso zzso zzso which encodes the second zzso of the zzso fatty acid zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed high expression of zzso gamma gene in mouse liver, zzso and heart and low expression in the zzso zzso brain, skeletal muscle, and zzso In mice treated with zzso a zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso gamma zzso was observed in the liver and zzso The presence of two zzso in the mouse liver suggests the possibility of multiple signaling pathways for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
