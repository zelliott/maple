The Indian delta zzso with elevated fetal gamma zzso gene zzso was previously found to have a large deletion beginning 1 zzso 3' of the zzso gamma zzso gene at zzso zzso coordinate zzso and extending into a new zzso zzso We have now determined the 3' zzso of this zzso and in doing so we have extended the known zzso gene cluster DNA sequence from its end at zzso to projected zzso coordinate zzso These data show that the deletion is zzso zzso long, terminating 11 zzso 3' of the zzso zzso This 3' zzso is at zzso within a zzso zzso partial zzso repeat at zzso the Black zzso gamma delta zzso also zzso in this zzso at zzso In addition, two zzso sequences were found, at zzso and zzso Among the zzso DNA sequence motifs 3' to the Indian delta zzso zzso at zzso there is a zzso pair that binds the zzso zzso and ubiquitous zzso binding zzso We zzso that elevated fetal zzso may be due to an zzso or enhancers 3' to the deletion zzso and may involve the zzso zzso
