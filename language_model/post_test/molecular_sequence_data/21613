zzso analyses were applied to study the structural diversity of the bacterial community which developed in groundwater zzso zzso actively zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that the community produced zzso as a zzso at slightly increasing rates over a period of zzso while no zzso zzso zzso profiles of partial zzso zzso genes generated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso technique by zzso from directly extracted total DNA revealed that, despite the long incubation period, six replicate zzso were characterized by almost the same microbial zzso Nine distinguishable contributors to the zzso were characterized by DNA sequencing, revealing the presence of different members from the zzso zzso zzso and from the candidate division zzso zzso isotope probing zzso was applied to distinguish the actual zzso zzso bacteria from the other community zzso This study reveals for the first time the structural diversity of an zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso However, it also demonstrates the limitations of zzso to detect bacteria slowly zzso carbon sources under zzso zzso
