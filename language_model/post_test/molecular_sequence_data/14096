zzso of the bean rust fungus zzso zzso detect penetration sites on the surface of the host leaf by zzso topographical zzso Within 2-4 zzso after the zzso of a zzso germ tube encounters the zzso lip of a zzso the zzso zzso polarized growth and begins to swell over the zzso The mechanism by which the cells detect topographical signals is not understood; however, previous experiments indicated that the initiation process does not involve de zzso gene zzso In order to detect zzso zzso the protein profiles of induced and zzso zzso were compared at the earliest stages of zzso formation, and a zzso differentiation protein was identified by a shift in zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence exhibited zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso of the respective sequence recognized zzso zzso of zzso in zzso of native zzso zzso of the active zzso bands and separation by zzso indicated that the zzso protein is a component of a zzso zzso zzso
