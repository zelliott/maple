To investigate the potential contribution of the zzso compartment in the processing of zzso precursor protein zzso to zzso zzso (A beta zzso we zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso B, L and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a human kidney zzso cell line zzso zzso to express high levels of beta zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso cells zzso zzso zzso B, L and D, but not zzso zzso A beta zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso and found to be increased approximately zzso following zzso S zzso but to be unchanged zzso B, zzso or decreased zzso zzso in the other double zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced A beta zzso by the zzso S zzso but had no effect on cells expressing the other zzso zzso of A beta zzso by zzso zzso cells revealed that a previously zzso zzso beginning at Met zzso zzso to the most common A beta zzso zzso zzso accounted for most of the increase in A beta zzso zzso of human brain sections revealed zzso S in cortical zzso and zzso in samples of brain from patients with Alzheimer's zzso These results provide evidence in living cells for a zzso in which zzso S generates A beta from zzso fragments of beta zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso appears to be zzso distinct from a zzso zzso used by zzso and other cells to generate A zzso and may be relevant to the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso
