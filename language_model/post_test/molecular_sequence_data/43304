Renal cell zzso zzso a human kidney cancer from the zzso zzso zzso accounts for about zzso of adult zzso zzso and zzso analysis have highlighted zzso zzso or loss of zzso in the zzso a putative zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Studies on zzso expression of human kidney tissue and on zzso modifications in zzso have not yet provided a marker for early zzso cell zzso zzso Current diagnostic methods do not help to detect the tumor before advanced zzso We therefore used two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso to study normal and tumor kidney zzso in ten patients suffering from zzso A human kidney protein map in the zzso database accessible through the zzso zzso zzso Biology zzso was zzso Of zzso separated zzso 43 were identified by gel comparison, zzso acid analysis, zzso sequencing, and/or zzso The comparison between normal and tumor kidney zzso showed four zzso to be absent in zzso One of them was identified as zzso zzso c zzso zzso whose locus has elsewhere been tentatively assigned to zzso zzso or zzso zzso A second zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso complex I whose locus is located on zzso zzso and zzso zzso These result suggest that the lack of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso complex I expression in zzso may be caused by unknown zzso or by changes in gene zzso or zzso It might indicate that zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso genesis or zzso
