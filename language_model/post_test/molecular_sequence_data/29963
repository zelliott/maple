zzso zzso gene zzso coding for an zzso zzso possesses one of the strongest translation initiation regions zzso in zzso zzso It was isolated on DNA fragments of differing length and cloned upstream of the mouse zzso zzso gene in an expression zzso to control the translation of this zzso zzso The zzso efficiency was highly dependent on zzso zzso to zzso downstream of the zzso zzso This sequence is complementary to zzso zzso of the zzso Similar sequences complementary to this zzso region are present in other efficient zzso of the zzso coli zzso and those of its zzso There seems to be a correlation between this sequence zzso and the efficiency of the initiation zzso We propose that this region specifies a zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso besides the zzso interaction during the translation initiation zzso
