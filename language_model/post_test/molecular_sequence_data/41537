Studies of population zzso increasingly use next-generation DNA sequencing to identify zzso zzso in zzso zzso There are, however, relatively few studies that validate the feasibility of transitioning from marker development to experimental application across populations and zzso North American zzso of the zzso zzso species complex occur in the United States and Mexico, and little is known about their population structure and zzso zzso This absence of information and population zzso markers is particularly concerning because they are highly zzso and have important implications on human zzso To alleviate this problem in zzso we investigated the feasibility of using zzso shotgun sequences for zzso marker zzso First, a zzso shotgun library from a single individual was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso We then zzso sampled 76 individuals from throughout the geographic distribution of the species complex and examined whether zzso were zzso and zzso zzso half of the zzso tested were readily zzso from all individuals, and zzso of the zzso tested for variation were variable and thus zzso as population genetic zzso To evaluate the repetitive landscape characteristics across multiple zzso we also compared zzso content between the zzso and two other previously sampled zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Burmese python zzso zzso
