zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the production of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso organisms, where its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso takes two electrons from two reduced zzso zzso molecules in two sequential steps, and transfers them to zzso in a single hydride transfer zzso zzso Despite the good knowledge of this zzso machinery, additional roles can still be zzso for already reported key zzso and new features are added to zzso not previously identified as having a particular role in the zzso Here, we zzso for the first time the role of zzso in zzso zzso a zzso suggested by recent theoretical simulations as zzso involved in competent binding of the zzso in the active site by cooperating with zzso We show that zzso indirectly zzso the geometry of the active site, the interaction with zzso and the electronic properties of the zzso ring, and in consequence the electron transfer zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, we revise the role of zzso and zzso previously investigated in zzso zzso from zzso Our results probe that the active site of zzso is tuned by a zzso network that involves the zzso of these zzso and that results to critical optimal zzso zzso exchange of electrons and, particularly, competent disposition of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso during the zzso zzso zzso
