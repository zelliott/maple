The segmented zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso was zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso The zzso clones that zzso to the smallest zzso segment zzso 10) were identified, and its zzso sequence was zzso Genome segment 10 of zzso was found to be zzso zzso in length with a single open reading frame in one strand capable of coding a predicted protein of 258 zzso (Mr of zzso consistent with an apparent Mr of zzso zzso determined by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the zzso gene of zzso with those of other zzso and with several nuclear zzso viruses revealed no particular zzso Analysis of the zzso profiles and predicted secondary structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated the presence of seven similar regions located at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the three zzso The expression of the cloned zzso zzso gene in zzso coli demonstrated that this zzso has the property of zzso since the production of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso lattice structure was zzso
