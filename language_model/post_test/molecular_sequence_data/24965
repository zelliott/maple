One of the main dilemma in T cell zzso zzso signal zzso is whether the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso signaling module serves for signal amplification or signal zzso To contribute to answer this question, we analyzed the effect of synthetic zzso representing the three zzso zzso zzso on the early signaling events in zzso leukemia T zzso Our main observations were as zzso zzso of the cells with the zzso membrane zzso and central zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a strong zzso of proteins with a similar zzso In contrast, the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso had a reduced ability to promote zzso zzso and failed to induce the zzso of a number of zzso zzso The zzso induced zzso zzso events were at least partially zzso by zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso as it was shown in zzso and zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso patterns of the association of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso proteins following cell stimulation with the zzso membrane zzso or the central zzso were similar, while the membrane zzso zzso was unable to induce any of these zzso Our data provide additional evidence that the three zzso differ in their capacity to induce zzso zzso of zzso proteins in zzso T cells, depending to their primary zzso The first and second zzso sequences of the zzso chain may have similar but not totally overlapping zzso This conclusion results from their similar but not identical abilities to induce zzso zzso and association of zzso with zzso zzso In contrast, the third zzso zzso may have distinct functions since this zzso fails to induce zzso zzso of a number of proteins compared to the other two zzso and it is unable to induce either new association or the increase in the amount of zzso associated zzso
