We have developed a functional zzso to verify the delivery into the zzso of a zzso acid zzso zzso modified by the incorporation of a zzso zzso into the zzso or zzso zzso This zzso is based on the use of a zzso sequence for the protein zzso C zzso zzso of alpha and beta for the zzso of zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso after zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This cellular zzso is simple, and it allows for a rapid and comparative study of several zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were able to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, with an zzso in the zzso zzso range, whereas the unmodified zzso was not zzso Two control zzso were also zzso demonstrating that the zzso group had no effect by zzso This study confirms that the modification of a relatively long zzso by the zzso of a zzso into the zzso or zzso end is sufficient to allow entry into intact zzso
