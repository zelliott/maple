The zzso sequence of a DNA zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso sequences has been zzso In addition, the origin of zzso has been identified and is located 120 base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso exhibits some degree of sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso coli and also to zzso the major structural component of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso by type 1 zzso is less susceptible to zzso by zzso than has been observed to be the case in other type 1 zzso zzso The zzso zzso this adherence specificity has been shown to be distinct from the zzso gene product and, therefore, is analogous to the zzso systems reported in other zzso
