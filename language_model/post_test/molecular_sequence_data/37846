The zzso of zzso zzso contains tandem zzso of alternating genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a surface zzso abundantly expressed on the zzso zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso We demonstrated previously that the zzso gene cluster is zzso transcribed to an equal extent in all zzso life cycle zzso The steady state level of zzso zzso however, is zzso more abundant in zzso than in zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso zzso is 7 times longer in zzso than in zzso zzso replacement experiments demonstrate that the middle one-third of the zzso zzso region zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso zzso This positive effect is dependent on the distance of the zzso segment from the stop zzso and the zzso site as well as on its zzso A protein or protein complex more abundant in zzso than in zzso binds to this minimally defined zzso segment and may be involved in its regulatory zzso
