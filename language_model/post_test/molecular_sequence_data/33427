The rice zzso gene zzso immunity to most strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of biologically active zzso from zzso zzso led to the identification of a zzso acid protein designated zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso acid synthetic zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso is sufficient for activity, whereas peptides lacking zzso zzso are biologically zzso Using zzso we found that zzso is required for zzso binding and zzso zzso is zzso zzso in all analyzed zzso species, confirming that zzso is a zzso molecular pattern and that zzso is a pattern recognition zzso
