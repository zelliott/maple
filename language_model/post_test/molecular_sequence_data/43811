A full-length zzso clone of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso gene was isolated from a zzso library from adult liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed a high degree of zzso between putative functional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes from other zzso zzso including rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso rat zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso green monkey zzso zzso and human zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso is expressed at a very low level in normal adult liver zzso This transcript is similar in size to transcripts of zzso genes from other zzso zzso screening of six zzso tumors in four adult zzso revealed no zzso within characteristic zzso hotspots encompassing zzso zzso IV and zzso
