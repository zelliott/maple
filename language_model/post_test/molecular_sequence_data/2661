zzso zzso with Ala in place of zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso into zzso The zzso zzso is completely unable to catalyze zzso zzso but zzso exchange and zzso at least as well as zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso downhill zzso influx without zzso zzso zzso and binds zzso zzso with a zzso only slightly higher than that of zzso zzso Studies with zzso membrane zzso demonstrate that replacement of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso results in behavior similar to that observed with Ala in place of zzso On the other hand, zzso with zzso in place of zzso zzso zzso zzso about zzso as well as zzso zzso The results indicate that an zzso zzso at position 325 is essential for zzso zzso and that hydrogen bonding at this position is zzso Taken together with previous results and those presented in the following paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso paper of three in this zzso the findings are consistent with the idea that zzso zzso and zzso may be components of a zzso relay system that plays an important role in the coupled zzso of zzso and zzso
