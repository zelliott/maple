A zzso zzso form of the rev zzso zzso zzso resistance to infection by the human zzso virus zzso in zzso and is currently under investigation as a potential intervention in acquired zzso syndrome zzso In this report, we examine three issues relevant to the safety of zzso transfer of human T cells genetically modified with Rev zzso First, the potential for zzso transformation was assessed in zzso using zzso zzso dependence and zzso transformation zzso and zzso was evaluated in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso toxicity was evaluated by zzso analysis following adoptive transfer of genetically modified human T cells into zzso zzso Second, methods were developed that permit T cell zzso required for gene transfer but do not allow replication of zzso zzso Third, T cell function was evaluated in peripheral blood zzso zzso of zzso donors zzso with Rev zzso and compared to a negative control zzso delta Rev zzso By all criteria, no zzso or toxicity was zzso Human T cells zzso with these zzso did not grow in the absence of zzso in zzso and no tumors were observed following transplantation of genetically modified human cells into recipient zzso zzso zzso analysis of heart, zzso liver, zzso and kidney of animals zzso weeks following adoptive transfer of zzso human T cells revealed no significant zzso Additionally, no differences were observed in the pattern of zzso zzso in enriched human zzso expressing Rev zzso compared to delta Rev zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
