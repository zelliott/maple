zzso is an zzso protein with distinct zzso and zzso roles that are affected by zzso zzso The zzso nuclear export is sensitive to zzso B, consistent with a zzso region maintenance protein zzso zzso We determined that the zzso region of zzso was involved in its nuclear export by demonstrating that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exports at a reduced rate, compared with the zzso 139 zzso acid zzso We searched for potential nuclear export sequences within the zzso region, which is zzso zzso Comparisons with established nuclear export sequences identified a putative consensus signal at zzso zzso zzso of this region resulted in nuclear export characteristics that closely matched those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed that zzso nuclear levels of the truncated and deletion zzso were significantly greater than levels of zzso zzso and were unaffected by zzso B, unlike the zzso zzso In addition, both zzso demonstrated greatly reduced nuclear export with zzso using nuclear preparations and intact zzso Based on these results, we conclude that the zzso zzso acid sequence closely zzso the structure of a zzso region maintenance protein zzso zzso nuclear export signal and is critical for nuclear export of zzso
