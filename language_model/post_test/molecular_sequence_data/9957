In this study, we examined a large number of patients to clarify the distribution and frequency of a recently described zzso tandem zzso among zzso zzso including 112 acute zzso leukemia zzso 55 acute zzso leukemia zzso 37 zzso syndrome zzso 20 chronic zzso leukemia zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso 14 adult T cell zzso 15 chronic zzso leukemia zzso and 38 multiple myeloma zzso We also evaluated 71 cell lines derived from 11 zzso 31 zzso two zzso cell zzso three acute zzso zzso 10 zzso 12 NHL including six zzso lymphoma, and two zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso 11 coding for the zzso zzso domain and first zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso domain, this length zzso was found only in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso they were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso anemia with excess of blast in zzso In the various cell lines zzso this zzso was determined in only one derived from zzso and never found in other zzso zzso The sequence analysis of the abnormal zzso products revealed that 23 of 24 showed internal tandem zzso with or without zzso of zzso In one zzso zzso and deletion without zzso was zzso All 24 zzso sequences were zzso zzso takes place in the sequence coding for the zzso domain and leaves the zzso domain zzso In conclusion, we emphasize that the length zzso of zzso at zzso zzso were restricted to zzso and zzso Since all these zzso resulted in zzso this zzso might function for the proliferation of zzso zzso
