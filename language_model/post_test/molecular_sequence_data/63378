The zzso gene encodes an integral membrane protein of unknown zzso zzso in zzso can cause juvenile zzso zzso zzso or zzso disease, an inherited neurodegenerative zzso storage disease affecting zzso Here, we report a zzso study of the zzso protein using zzso approaches constrained by experimental zzso Our results suggest that zzso has a six zzso zzso zzso with zzso N and zzso three large zzso zzso one of which may contain an zzso zzso and one large zzso zzso Surprisingly, varied zzso predictions were made using different zzso of zzso zzso highlighting the challenges still remaining for zzso
