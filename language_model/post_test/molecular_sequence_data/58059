The alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso the alpha zzso is most abundant in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso where it is important in enhancing zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso studies suggest that the alpha zzso zzso primarily on the zzso surface of these zzso zzso cells in zzso To investigate the mechanisms underlying alpha zzso polarization in zzso cells, we permanently expressed zzso and an zzso version of the alpha zzso in zzso canine kidney zzso zzso Using a zzso surface zzso zzso we observe that zzso of the alpha zzso in zzso cell clones is located on the zzso membrane zzso zzso studies confirm the zzso results and demonstrate that the alpha zzso is actually confined primarily to the lateral domain of the zzso zzso zzso labeling experiments suggest that zzso polarization of the alpha zzso is achieved by direct targeting of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the alpha zzso to the zzso surface is not zzso by zzso zzso of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso of the alpha zzso to zzso proteins is not important for zzso zzso
