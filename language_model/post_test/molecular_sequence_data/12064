Two zzso zzso proteins of 21 and 27 zzso zzso with a novel zzso of zzso DNA binding activity zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 (1992) zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso protein zzso have been shown to affect the zzso and extent of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso to human zzso recently identified as the beta zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso involved in ensuring zzso protein sorting and zzso zzso et zzso Nature 370 zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized zzso zzso the zzso protein and found that zzso is zzso similar to the alpha zzso of human zzso zzso therefore, contains a complex composed of zzso and zzso very similar to the zzso complex described in human zzso zzso of zzso alone or in combination with an zzso zzso causes no obvious zzso The lack of zzso the high levels of zzso and zzso zzso and the identification of multiple human genes zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso genes may be members of zzso families with redundant zzso
