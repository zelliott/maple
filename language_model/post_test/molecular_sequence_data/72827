In order provide data for a basic understanding of the mechanisms of zzso specificity and for the design of zzso with desired properties, we have zzso three high affinity zzso zzso zzso All three zzso zzso to zzso had been raised by zzso of the zzso zzso to protein zzso The genes zzso heavy zzso and light zzso chains of these three zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso zzso chains were found to be from zzso to zzso sequence identical to a zzso zzso zzso binding a related zzso zzso The zzso and L chains were paired with all possible zzso combinations and the corresponding proteins were expressed in zzso coli and characterized for their binding zzso to zzso Under the zzso promoter and using the zzso signal sequences the production levels of the soluble zzso heavy and light chain zzso zzso combinations in zzso and in zzso varied from 115 to zzso zzso while the zzso percentages zzso varied from zzso 1 to zzso The production levels and zzso were dependent on the first constant domain zzso of the heavy chain as well as the zzso chain combination zzso
