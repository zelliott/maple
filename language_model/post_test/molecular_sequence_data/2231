zzso of zzso zzso is regulated by a variety of hormonal and other stimuli in rat cells and zzso To study this phenomenon at the molecular level, we isolated and zzso a zzso rat zzso zzso and deduced its zzso acid zzso The zzso clone was used to isolate a clone from a rat zzso library which contained the sequence of the entire rat zzso zzso zzso The gene comprised 12 zzso and 11 zzso and spanned zzso zzso Two zzso signals zzso were located 310 and zzso base pairs 3' to the zzso termination zzso and were responsible for the occurrence of two zzso zzso species in Northern blots of rat cells and zzso zzso zzso mapping suggested that there were multiple zzso start zzso the major one appeared to be located zzso base pairs of zzso sequence zzso to the zzso zzso initiation site, representing zzso bases of zzso Several potential regulatory elements were identified in the zzso regions or in the first zzso a zzso box, zzso boxes, zzso and zzso binding sites, a zzso element, a zzso regulatory element, and zzso zzso III promoter zzso The zzso region of the zzso was extremely rich in G + zzso secondary structure predictions suggested that almost this entire region could form stable secondary structures, with an overall free energy of formation zzso zzso of zzso zzso The potential regulatory elements identified in both the promoter region of the gene and the zzso region of the zzso may be involved in the complex regulation of rat zzso zzso zzso
