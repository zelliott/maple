The genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso the predicted zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso it was concluded that the structural genes are tightly linked and presumably organized as an zzso zzso zzso Two pairs of zzso and zzso consensus sequences resembling zzso promoters lie upstream of zzso the first of the four zzso zzso extension experiments indicate that the second promoter is responsible for zzso zzso zzso and zzso code for the zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso of zzso which exhibits zzso zzso A putative zzso region is zzso The zzso zzso gamma zzso contains two zzso clusters which may participate in the coordination of two zzso The genes zzso and zzso code for the small zzso delta zzso and the zzso zzso beta zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso of zzso The latter zzso exhibits several zzso regions found in all zzso zzso The roles of these regions in zzso iron and zzso are zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequences of the delta and beta zzso share some zzso regions with the corresponding zzso of other zzso zzso the overall zzso acid zzso is zzso Nevertheless, significant sequence zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso of the soluble zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Unlike the small zzso of the zzso and soluble zzso zzso the zzso protein does not appear to be zzso with an zzso leader zzso
