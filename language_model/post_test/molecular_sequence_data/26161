Three methods to detect single base zzso in zzso 61 of the human zzso gene from human melanoma DNA are described and zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct manual and automated sequence zzso Point zzso are detected by zzso zzso and direct manual and direct automated sequence analysis of in zzso amplified zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is reliably detected by zzso zzso and by direct manual, but not by direct zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso DNA via zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and utilizing alpha zzso as zzso for manual sequencing and zzso labeled zzso for automated sequencing zzso zzso zzso we can obtain sequence information from either zzso The use of several of these zzso to detect single base changes in the human zzso gene is zzso In addition, the use of these and other related techniques to define the involvement of zzso zzso in human zzso more precisely is zzso
