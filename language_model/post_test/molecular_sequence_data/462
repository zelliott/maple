The three zzso hormones, zzso zzso zzso growth hormone zzso and zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a gene family of hormones with similar gene structure and zzso protein zzso These hormones are believed to have evolved from a common ancestral gene through several rounds of gene zzso and subsequent zzso 

In this study, we have identified a new zzso gene in zzso zzso through zzso and molecular cloning zzso zzso analyses showed that this novel protein is zzso to the previously identified zzso A zzso zzso zzso further showed that this novel protein could bind to zzso zzso to trigger the downstream zzso event, indicating that it is biologically zzso In view of its close zzso relationship with zzso and also its ability to activate zzso zzso we name it as zzso and the previously identified zzso as zzso All the newly discovered zzso sequences possess three zzso zzso linkages with the exception of the shark zzso which has only zzso In sharp contrast to the classical zzso which is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso was found to be mainly expressed in the eye and brain of the zzso but not in the zzso A largely reduced inner nuclear layer of the zzso was observed after zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicating its role on zzso development in zzso 

The discovery of this novel zzso has revitalized our understanding on the evolution of the zzso gene zzso Its unique expression and functions in the zzso eye also provide a new avenue of research on the neuroendocrine control of zzso development in zzso
