zzso is a natural compound that has been intensely studied due to its role in cancer prevention and potential as an zzso zzso Its effects include induction of zzso and zzso growth zzso Here, we report that two cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso differ significantly in their molecular responses to zzso Specifically, in zzso zzso cells, the zzso of the zzso zzso is attenuated when compared to the zzso in zzso zzso This zzso is accompanied by a point zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene and zzso of the zzso zzso which is a negative regulator of zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in slightly increased zzso of the zzso pathway, most clearly visible as stronger zzso of zzso zzso When treated with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells both responded with substantial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso improved the zzso survival of both cell lines treated with zzso This improvement was associated with lower zzso of zzso signaling zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and higher zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso by zzso helps to preserve the zzso potential of cells exposed to zzso
