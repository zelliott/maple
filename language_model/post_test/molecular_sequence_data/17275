Agricultural activities have produced well-documented changes in the Florida zzso including establishment of a zzso in zzso zzso in Water Conservation Area 2A zzso of the northern zzso An effect of increased zzso zzso is increased zzso in the zzso regions compared to the zzso regions of zzso The goal of this study was to identify relationships between zzso and composition and activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of two genes associated with zzso were characterized in zzso taken from zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso M zzso zzso The richness of zzso zzso was greater in zzso than in zzso sites, and sequences related to previously cultivated and zzso zzso were zzso A preferential selection for the order zzso was observed in zzso clone libraries, suggesting primer bias for this zzso A greater diversity within the zzso was observed in zzso clone libraries than in zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed a dominance of clones related to zzso zzso an zzso zzso dominant in environments with low zzso zzso A significant number of clones were related to zzso an order characterized by species utilizing hydrogen and zzso as zzso zzso No representatives of the orders zzso and zzso were found in any zzso zzso clone library, although some zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso are the dominant zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso that zzso in low zzso zzso zzso those that typically dominate in higher zzso zzso
