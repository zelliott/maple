zzso zzso zzso from four closely related zzso members of the zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were characterized for their resistance to zzso zzso Despite possessing between 68 and zzso sequence identity, the zzso zzso significantly differed in their stability against zzso zzso with melting points ranging from 69 to 103 degrees zzso The high sequence identity between these organisms allowed regions of the zzso and zzso zzso to be exchanged, producing zzso zzso with significantly altered zzso zzso Up to a 20 degrees C increase or decrease in stability was achieved for zzso zzso whereas zzso of the original protein sequence was zzso Based on our previous structural modeling studies, we conclude that cooperative interactions within the zzso protein core play an integral role in determining the differences in structural stability observed between the zzso zzso From comparisons of the effects of temperature on protein unfolding and optimal zzso activity, we also conclude that zzso and zzso temperature zzso are influenced differently by molecular modifications and thus that the protein flexibility required for activity and stability, respectively, is not unconditionally linked within the zzso zzso
