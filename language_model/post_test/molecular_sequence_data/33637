High zzso zzso and low toxicity is associated with zzso transplantation of zzso zzso in zzso human zzso We hypothesized that zzso viruses zzso of zzso origin could be highly compatible to human zzso and thus of good efficiency and low toxicity for in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso were screened by zzso for the presence of zzso using zzso designed to bind zzso regions and amplify variable regions of an alignment of several zzso sequences available on zzso We isolated new zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso and successfully generated a zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso generated against all other commonly used zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8) indicating a distinct zzso zzso zzso immunity to zzso could not be detected in the human zzso zzso In mice, zzso particles expressing zzso or green fluorescent protein demonstrated high zzso efficiency in muscle fibers and the zzso after intramuscular or zzso zzso zzso experiments following systemic administration showed efficient gene transfer exclusively in muscle zzso Novel zzso derived from zzso zzso may contribute to the generation of new preventive or zzso clinical zzso acceptable for human zzso
