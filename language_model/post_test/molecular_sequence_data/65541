The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso the transformation of zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso bacteria zzso it has been suggested to operate in the reverse zzso Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso has been determined in different zzso relevant states providing insights into its reaction zzso 

zzso zzso sequences from 20 zzso distinct zzso and zzso species were used for zzso zzso In general, the average accuracy of the calculated models was sufficiently good to allow a structural and functional comparison between the zzso and zzso structures zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso main chain zzso respectively, had root mean square zzso below 1 A with respect to the template zzso Besides their overall zzso the zzso and zzso models revealed the existence of individual adaptations at the zzso zzso protein surface presumably resulting from zzso to different electron zzso zzso These structural zzso correlated with the protein zzso (three major zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso lineage II, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of the distinct zzso lineage I) and the presence of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso The almost identical protein zzso surrounding both zzso zzso the zzso zzso the active site channel and center within the zzso models of zzso and zzso point to a highly similar zzso process of zzso zzso zzso independent of the metabolism type the zzso zzso is involved in and the species it has been originated zzso 

Based on the comparative models, there are no significant structural differences between zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso this might be indicative for a similar zzso process of zzso zzso zzso
