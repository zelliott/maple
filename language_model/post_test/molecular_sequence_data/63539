Over 40 different human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso are produced by alternative zzso of the primary zzso zzso zzso In addition, approximately half of the viral zzso remains zzso and is used as zzso zzso and as zzso for the zzso and Pol gene zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso 3' zzso sites zzso requires zzso zzso zzso and positive or negative regulation occurs through the binding of cellular factors to zzso zzso regulatory zzso We have previously shown that zzso at zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso zzso and promotes the inclusion of zzso zzso 2 into both completely and incompletely spliced viral zzso is increased by zzso the zzso zzso site zzso downstream of zzso 2 zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso within zzso zzso that are predicted to lower or increase the affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso result in reduced or increased zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso was not necessary for the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso In addition, we have found that zzso of the zzso motif zzso to the zzso zzso increase zzso 2 inclusion and zzso zzso Finally, we report the presence of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso element within the zzso region of zzso 2 that zzso both zzso inclusion and zzso zzso This zzso binds specifically to the cellular zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso act competitively to determine the level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that these positive and negative zzso elements act together to allow the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compatible with optimal virus zzso
