The gene coding for the mouse zzso zzso has been isolated by using a zzso specific zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the gene reveals eight zzso separated by seven zzso zzso important DNA sequences zzso and zzso zzso the first zzso zzso with other zzso genes shows extensive zzso in zzso as well as in zzso Two zzso clones zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and provide evidence for at least two expressed zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence to three other zzso zzso indicates that gene conversion zzso act on zzso zzso zzso of zzso donor and zzso sites of different zzso genes and zzso show that alternative zzso sites are used by different zzso
