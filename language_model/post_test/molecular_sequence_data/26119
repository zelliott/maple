The expression of an zzso zzso zzso gene isolated from the zzso plant zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso Using an expression zzso containing the highly active zzso zzso promoter, several plant ALS zzso were made containing successive zzso zzso from the zzso end of the coding zzso zzso zzso by these plant ALS zzso of a zzso zzso zzso devoid of ALS zzso activity was zzso on minimal zzso zzso which eliminated a large portion of the transit zzso coding sequence proved to act as efficient ALS genes in the bacterial zzso zzso close to the putative processing site of the plant protein were inactive in the zzso zzso A full length copy of the zzso including the entire transit zzso coding region, was also zzso The efficiency of the zzso estimated by comparison to the growth rate of zzso zzso zzso was found to correlate with levels of ALS activity in the transformed zzso zzso zzso known to produce zzso resistance in plants, were introduced into the truncated ALS coding sequence by zzso zzso When expressed in bacteria these zzso zzso a zzso resistance zzso on the zzso The potential of this system for zzso and zzso studies of plant proteins is zzso
