zzso zzso is thought to be a key event in the zzso of zzso Although different zzso zzso and modifications have been proposed to be responsible for early zzso steps, the mechanisms underlying these events remain zzso zzso is a small protein localized to synaptic terminals and its intrinsic structure has been claimed to be an important factor for zzso and zzso zzso expression studies in cell cultures have demonstrated that zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are primarily involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, in the last few years accumulating evidence has pointed to alternative zzso as a crucial mechanism in the development of neurodegenerative zzso At least three different zzso zzso have been described as products of alternative zzso Two of these zzso zzso 112 and zzso zzso are shorter proteins with probably altered functions and zzso zzso The present review attempts to zzso the data so far available on zzso structure, zzso zzso and alternative zzso as possible enhancers of zzso
