zzso is a fundamental degradation process for zzso and zzso of vital importance for cell and tissue zzso zzso research has gained a strong momentum in recent years because of its relevance to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, muscular dystrophy, zzso storage disorders, development, zzso and innate zzso zzso has traditionally been thought of as a bulk degradation process that is mobilized upon nutritional zzso to replenish the cell with building blocks and keep up with the energy zzso This view has recently changed dramatically following an array of papers describing various forms of selective zzso A main driving force has been the discovery of specific zzso receptors that zzso cargo into forming zzso zzso At the heart of this selectivity lies the zzso region zzso zzso which ensures the targeting of zzso receptors to zzso (or other zzso family zzso anchored in the zzso zzso zzso proteins include cargo zzso members of the zzso zzso apparatus, proteins associated with zzso and of their zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and specific signaling proteins that are zzso by selective zzso Here, we comment on these new insights and focus on the interactions of zzso proteins with members of the zzso protein zzso
