A zzso library from zzso zzso zzso was constructed in zzso coli by partial zzso zzso of the zzso DNA, with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This library was screened for clones able to grow as green stained colonies on selective medium developed for detecting zzso zzso Three zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso carried zzso plasmids harboring DNA zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso experiments demonstrated the presence of overlapping DNA fragments in the three clones and that these three clones were all derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis, together with zzso gels of proteins zzso by zzso coli containing zzso suggested that the isolated zzso zzso DNA zzso encodes the functional portion of a zzso transport zzso
