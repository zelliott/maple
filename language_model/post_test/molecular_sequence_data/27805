We have isolated a zzso pair zzso zzso clone for rat zzso zzso from a rat kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of rat kidney zzso The zzso region (including a zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso A single zzso of about 8 zzso pairs was detected in rat liver, zzso brain, heart, zzso zzso zzso stomach, zzso and muscle with varying zzso which is consistent with and further confirms the presence of zzso in zzso zzso as demonstrated previously by zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that there is a single gene for zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence contains sequence from the zzso zzso internal repeat 12 to the C zzso of rat kidney zzso zzso comparison with human and chicken zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso is well zzso during zzso The rat kidney zzso zzso when compared to rat brain zzso contains an extra zzso sequence at the C zzso zzso comparison of all the internal repeats available revealed that the internal repeat 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 has highest sequence similarity with internal repeat 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, zzso zzso internal repeats zzso and zzso are most likely derived from an ancestral gene through gene duplication, suggesting that the zzso gene is derived from a zzso gene by gene zzso and divergence during zzso
