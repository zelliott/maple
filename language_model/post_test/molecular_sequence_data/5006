zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso in zzso zzso It zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso Human zzso zzso clones are similar to the two zzso genes for synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are believed to zzso two zzso of zzso zzso zzso Pinto, zzso zzso Lester, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wells, zzso zzso Lester, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 91, zzso We have cloned and characterized two complete human and zzso zzso sequences named zzso & zzso and zzso & zzso respectively, similar to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Human embryonic kidney cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso independently and in zzso showed an zzso of the transcripts on the zzso and protein zzso The zzso activity of cells expressing zzso alone or zzso with zzso was three times higher than the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was not required for the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two proteins do not contain a signal zzso nor are they zzso The zzso and zzso zzso activity were both sensitive to common zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso acid indicated that cell lines zzso with zzso zzso use the excess zzso bases for zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide conclusive genetic and zzso evidence that the human and zzso zzso genes described here zzso zzso zzso Further studies will be required to unravel the function of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
