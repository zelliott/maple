A wide diversity of biological functions have been attributed to the highly zzso and ubiquitous zzso protein zzso Yet how much of this diversity is inherent in the basic structure of zzso and how much is due to zzso specific functions is not yet fully zzso Here, two zzso zzso zzso zzso whose protein sequences are zzso similar were found to differ significantly in both their zzso structure and expression zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ in both the position and sequence of their zzso Since the various zzso boundaries respect neither functional nor structural protein zzso the zzso appear to be relatively recent evolutionary zzso zzso encodes three zzso enhanced zzso two of which are related through the differential use of alternative zzso addition zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies reveal high levels of zzso throughout the zzso with particularly high levels in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso encodes a single transcript which is expressed zzso In zzso high levels of zzso transcripts appear to be zzso zzso whereas zzso is expressed as an early zzso transcript whose expression pattern later zzso to the zzso region of zzso zzso These expression pattern differences between zzso and zzso suggest that these two zzso zzso perform distinct biological roles within the zzso
