In zzso cells two zzso zzso receptors zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso To understand the precise function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso of the corresponding gene has been disrupted in mouse embryonic stem cells and zzso mice lacking this zzso have been zzso The zzso mice appear normal, suggesting that other targeting mechanisms can partially compensate for the loss of the zzso in zzso However, zzso zzso cells and animals clearly exhibit defects in targeting of multiple zzso zzso when compared with zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso zzso were present in body zzso of zzso zzso In zzso from zzso mice or in primary cultures of zzso from zzso zzso there is a marked increase in the amount of zzso zzso zzso that are zzso into the zzso zzso The cultured zzso have decreased zzso levels of multiple zzso zzso and accumulate zzso within their zzso zzso Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the zzso is required for efficient zzso targeting of multiple zzso zzso
