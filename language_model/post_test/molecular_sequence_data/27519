The zzso type I fatty acid zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso complex, catalyzing all necessary steps for the synthesis of long zzso zzso To be zzso competent, the zzso must be activated by a zzso modification of the central zzso carrier domain zzso by an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso However, recent X-ray structures of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso architecture, with zzso located at the outside of the barrel wall, zzso separated from the zzso zzso in the inner zzso This separation indicated that the zzso has to proceed before the assembly to the mature complex, in a zzso where the zzso and zzso zzso can zzso To gain insight into the zzso reaction and also into the zzso zzso assembly pathway, we structurally and functionally characterized the zzso zzso zzso type I zzso as part of the zzso protein and as an isolated zzso
