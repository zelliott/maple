zzso called zzso protect cereal crops from zzso zzso zzso methods zzso PAGE and zzso were zzso to identify zzso and/or zzso proteins in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso to better understand a zzso mechanism of zzso Growth experiments showed that the zzso zzso protected zzso from injury by the zzso zzso In total, 29 zzso and 10 zzso proteins were identified by zzso These proteins were classified into two major categories based on their expression patterns, and were further classified into several functional zzso Surprisingly, mutually exclusive sets of proteins were identified following zzso or zzso treatment, suggesting that different signaling pathways may be zzso zzso zzso mostly involved in zzso detoxification, also included several new proteins that had not been previously identified as zzso whereas zzso proteins belonged to several classes involved in general stress zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso protein zzso transcripts were highly induced by zzso and two zzso genes were zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso protect zzso zzso zzso from zzso toxicity by zzso inducing proteins involved in an entire zzso zzso zzso mainly in the zzso and zzso thereby protecting new leaves from zzso zzso
