Some zzso zzso are associated with higher risk of zzso cancer development and are suggested to explain part of the genetic contribution to Lynch zzso 

To evaluate the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso in 124 unrelated South American individuals suspected of having Lynch syndrome, based on frequency, association with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and clinical zzso 

DNA was obtained from peripheral blood and zzso chain reaction zzso was performed, followed by direct zzso 

The Val zzso of the zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso of the individuals, with an zzso frequency of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was frequent in the studied population; however, it does not appear to exert any modifier effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the development of zzso zzso
