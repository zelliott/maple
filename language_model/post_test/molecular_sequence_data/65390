zzso and the zzso growth factors zzso bind with high affinity to their zzso zzso and with lower affinity to the zzso zzso The major structural difference between insulin and the zzso is that the zzso are single chain zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the insulin zzso contains separate A- and zzso The zzso of zzso is critical for high affinity binding to the zzso growth factor I zzso and lack of a zzso largely explains the low affinity of insulin for the zzso growth factor I zzso It is less clear why the zzso have lower affinity for the insulin zzso In this study, 24 insulin zzso and four zzso zzso were expressed and analyzed to explore the role of zzso acid differences in the A- and zzso between insulin and the zzso in binding affinity for the insulin zzso Using the information obtained from single zzso zzso four multiple zzso zzso were zzso A zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso showed affinity as zzso for the insulin zzso and a zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an affinity close to that of zzso for the insulin zzso whereas a zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed affinities similar to that of insulin for the insulin zzso The zzso potency of these zzso correlated well with the binding zzso Thus, a small number of A- and zzso zzso that map to the zzso surface equivalent to the classical binding surface of insulin weaken two hotspots that bind to the insulin zzso site zzso
