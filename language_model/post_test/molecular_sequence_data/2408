Three of zzso clones isolated from a zzso expression library of zzso zzso DNA using chronically infected human zzso also react with chronically infected mouse zzso zzso of these three clones showed that they contain different members of the same gene zzso One clone contains two members of the gene family approximately 2 zzso apart and in opposite orientation to each zzso DNA sequence zzso between pairs of genes range from zzso to zzso Southern zzso results indicate there are approximately 40 copies of these genes per zzso zzso zzso from mice zzso with zzso fusion protein detected zzso products in the central zzso and zzso zzso cells of zzso
