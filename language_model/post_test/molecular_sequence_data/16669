We compared quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to qualitative zzso in determining response to therapy and predicting clinical outcome in 18 zzso selected patients with ALL positive for the zzso fusion and with frozen zzso samples collected at diagnosis and during follow-up zzso samples zzso The zzso junction was detected by qualitative zzso in 18 patients and by zzso in 17 patients (one patient zzso the rare zzso zzso zzso which falls outside of the primer and probe location designed for the zzso In three of the 12 patients negative to qualitative zzso after induction therapy, a small number of zzso copies was detected by zzso Thus nine patients were negative and eight zzso Seven of the eight positive patients suffered a zzso including two of the three patients positive to zzso yet negative to qualitative zzso Moreover, we found two zzso zzso results among the 39 follow-up tests of the nine patients who converted to a negative zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that qualitative zzso is more appropriate for the routine diagnosis of this genetic zzso However, zzso is more accurate in assessing the molecular response after induction treatment and could be more useful in clinical decision-making in zzso ALL zzso
