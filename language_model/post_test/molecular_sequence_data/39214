The zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso family of zzso zzso are critical regulators of cholesterol and fatty acid zzso We previously demonstrated that human zzso bind the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso domain and recruit zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes through unknown zzso Here we show that zzso use the zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso to activate target zzso zzso analysis of the zzso domain in zzso by zzso revealed a zzso bundle with marked similarity to the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso do not bind the zzso zzso domain, although they interact with the zzso zzso domain, revealing a surprising specificity among structurally related zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes fatty acid zzso by regulating the expression of zzso zzso We found that, like zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for fatty acid zzso and show that both zzso and zzso control zzso of genes governing zzso of zzso acid to zzso zzso zzso dietary addition of zzso acid significantly rescued various defects of zzso targeted with zzso interference against zzso and zzso including impaired zzso fat storage, infertility, decreased size and slow zzso suggesting that regulation of zzso acid levels represents a zzso critical function of zzso and zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso is a key zzso of zzso gene regulation and control of zzso zzso in zzso
