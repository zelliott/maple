Human sexual determination is initiated by a cascade of genes that lead to the development of the fetal zzso Whereas development of the female external zzso does not require fetal zzso hormones, male zzso development requires the action of zzso testosterone and its more potent zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from cholesterol to testosterone in the zzso and the subsequent conversion of testosterone to zzso in zzso skin is well zzso Recently, an alternative zzso leading to zzso has been described in zzso but its potential importance to human development is zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso in the alternative but not the classic zzso Using a candidate gene approach, we identified zzso zzso with zzso zzso inheritance in four zzso individuals with zzso sexual development zzso Analysis of the inheritance of zzso markers excluded other candidate zzso zzso individuals had moderate to severe zzso at zzso when recreated by zzso zzso and expressed in bacteria, the zzso zzso had diminished but not absent zzso zzso The zzso zzso individuals also carry a zzso causing zzso zzso in zzso which encodes an zzso with similar zzso This suggests a mode of inheritance where the severity of the zzso zzso depends on the number of zzso in the two zzso An unrelated zzso zzso patient carried zzso zzso on both zzso confirming the essential role of zzso and corroborating the hypothesis that both the classic and alternative pathways of zzso zzso zzso are needed for normal human male sexual zzso
