zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso occurs by localized DNA zzso breaks zzso at several locations in the zzso corresponding to hot spots for zzso gene conversion and crossing zzso The zzso zzso occur in regions of zzso that are hypersensitive to zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the formation of these zzso we have determined their positions at the zzso level at the zzso hot spot of gene conversion on zzso zzso We found four major new features of these zzso zzso sites of zzso are multiple with varying zzso and spacing within the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso no consensus sequence can be found at these sites, indicating that the activity involved in zzso formation has little or no sequence zzso zzso the breaks are generated by blunt zzso and zzso the zzso ends are modified in zzso zzso zzso where the processing of these ends is known to be zzso We present a model for the initiation of zzso zzso taking into account the implications of these zzso
