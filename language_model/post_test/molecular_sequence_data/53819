The zzso gene of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso codes for a response regulator which, together with the sensor zzso zzso zzso is required for the production of zzso and secondary zzso involved in zzso including hydrogen cyanide zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of strain zzso and identified as the zzso zzso which encodes the translation initiation factor zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso The efficiency of suppression was about zzso as determined by the use of a zzso reporter zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso for a global zzso zzso reversed the zzso effect of the amplified zzso zzso This finding suggests that some zzso of the zzso zzso can compete with zzso at the level of translation in zzso zzso zzso and that important zzso traits can be regulated at this zzso
