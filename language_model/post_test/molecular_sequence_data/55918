We have characterized the zzso region of the zzso gene of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso with rat liver nuclear extracts identified 7 major zzso zzso termed zzso through zzso in a zzso base pair DNA zzso zzso pairs zzso to zzso zzso through zzso are clustered in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso contain several known consensus sequences such as a zzso box, zzso box, zzso and zzso which all have previously been implicated in the zzso zzso of several zzso zzso competition studies indicate that zzso specific for zzso and zzso displaced the nuclear proteins bound to the zzso box zzso zzso and an zzso site zzso zzso zzso Several other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to bind to the zzso zzso Other elements located upstream of the zzso region, which includes zzso protection zzso zzso are required for enhanced promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was measured by transient expression of a zzso zzso gene zzso to deletion fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for promoter activity and complex zzso protein interactions were confined within a region spanning zzso This region also retained more than zzso of the promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, this promoter region shows characteristics of both zzso and zzso gene zzso suggesting complex zzso zzso
