We report the crystal structure of the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA, showing the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso flipped out of the DNA zzso and occupying virtually the same position in the active site as the natural target zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex faithfully reports this state: base flipping is accompanied by the loss of the very short ( approximately 50 zzso lifetime component associated with fully zzso zzso in DNA, and zzso is subject to considerable zzso by zzso interactions with zzso in the zzso motif IV zzso This proves zzso to be an excellent probe for studying base flipping by zzso and suggests similar zzso in the active sites of DNA and zzso zzso as well as DNA zzso zzso sharing the zzso motif zzso In solution, the same distinctive zzso response confirms complete zzso from DNA and is also observed when the proposed key zzso for base flipping by zzso the target base partner zzso is zzso by an zzso site zzso The corresponding zzso structure shows zzso in the active site of zzso demonstrating that the partner zzso is not essential for base zzso However, in this structure, a shift of the 3' neighbor of the target base into the vacancy left after base flipping is observed, apparently replicating a stabilizing role of the missing partner zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes in solution provide evidence for an alternative binding site for the zzso target base within zzso and suggest that the partner zzso assists in delivering the target base into the active zzso
