zzso of core zzso can alter zzso structure, zzso the zzso and repression of zzso A key example is the zzso of zzso zzso of the core zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso T cells, and shown to be zzso identical to the zzso global gene regulator zzso zzso et zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of zzso a zzso expressed putative deposition zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from diverse zzso shows high levels of identity within a putative zzso core zzso Further alignment with other types of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from mycoplasma and zzso and a protein of unknown function from an zzso reveals an apparently zzso core, and suggests that zzso zzso belong to an ancient family of zzso with related zzso
