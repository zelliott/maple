zzso is the zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain consists of a zinc zzso cluster different from the other members of the zzso family by several zzso In particular, it is able to bind to zzso and zzso sites with the same zzso with both sites being functional in zzso zzso Here, we show that unlike the other proteins of the zzso zzso cluster family, zzso binds most probably as a zzso to its zzso zzso Two molecules of the zzso protein can simultaneously bind in a zzso manner to zzso zzso The consensus core has been determined precisely zzso and the zzso site in the zzso promoter has been zzso The sequence downstream of the zinc cluster is necessary for high affinity zzso Furthermore, our data show that the use of the carrier protein zzso zzso in zzso binding experiments introduces an important bias in the recognition of DNA sites due to its zzso zzso zzso
