In order to define the zzso zzso I zzso apparatus and how it might interact with regulatory signals, the DNA sequences necessary for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso A systematic set of zzso substitution and zzso zzso were zzso in a zzso in zzso zzso The sequences required for zzso of the gene consist of two large zzso (I and zzso from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Complete deletion of either domain abolished zzso zzso sequences zzso a small stimulation of zzso zzso II includes a zzso sequence at -5 which is sensitive to a small (2 zzso substitution and which is zzso among the large zzso genes of many zzso zzso I includes a zzso termed the zzso zzso which is also required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and which occurs in the zzso region of a zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso and zzso zzso boxes are shown to be functionally zzso
