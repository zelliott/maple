zzso toxins acting on sodium channels differ in their zzso zzso peptides specific towards zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso have been zzso Because of the similar three-dimensional fold of these zzso the molecular base of their specificity is thought to reside in certain differences at the level of zzso acid zzso especially within or near the binding site of the toxin to the particular zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence and biological activity of an zzso zzso zzso from the scorpion zzso zzso Hoffmann is zzso The zzso potential surface around a three-dimensional model of zzso was zzso It revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso situated at the side of the toxin proposed in the literature to bind to the sodium channel, constitute a positive surface zzso zzso they may form the site that binds to the zzso zzso was included in a comparative analysis of two groups of natural zzso highly similar peptides of the zzso zzso with zzso towards zzso or zzso A number of zzso zzso consistently different between the two groups and situated near the putative binding site, may be of importance for the specificity of the analyzed zzso
