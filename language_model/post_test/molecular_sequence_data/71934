A zzso portion of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was amplified from whole zzso DNA extract and zzso The sequence was found to code for the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso II, a zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, and a zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso The zzso cluster distinctly within the zzso radiation, as a sister group to the zzso Also, the zzso genetic code of this sponge is likely identical to that found in the zzso Both the full zzso DNA and protein sequences and a portion of the zzso zzso gene were found to possess a striking similarity to published zzso zzso zzso allying the zzso more closely to the zzso than to any other zzso zzso The gene arrangement, zzso is observed in many zzso zzso and is apparently ancestral in the zzso
