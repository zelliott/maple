Due to the poor zzso of the plasma zzso several strategies are designed to enhance the transfer of zzso into zzso Over the last 20 years, small peptides called zzso zzso zzso have been widely developed to improve the cellular delivery of zzso These small peptides derive from protein zzso zzso zzso zzso or model zzso Several zzso are primary or secondary zzso zzso depending on whether the distribution of their zzso and zzso zzso occurs from their zzso sequence or through zzso zzso Most of the zzso are able to deliver different zzso such as zzso acids or proteins in zzso and in zzso Although their mechanisms of zzso are varied and controversial, the understanding of the intrinsic features of zzso is essential for future zzso This chapter describes several protocols for the investigation of zzso properties of zzso zzso Surface physics approaches are specifically applied to characterize the interactions of zzso peptides with model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso allow the identification of their structural zzso These methods are exemplified by the analyses of the main zzso features of the zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso
