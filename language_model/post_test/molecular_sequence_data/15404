The general zzso factor zzso is a zzso complex with different zzso activities such as zzso protein zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) is one of the zzso zzso that has zzso activity and it is the third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The main objective of this work was to characterize zzso a zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso Northern blots and in zzso zzso results showed that zzso was expressed in zzso mature zzso leaf roll and zzso and it was not zzso expressed in any of the other zzso analyzed such us bud and zzso In addition, zzso was not zzso expressed during different stress conditions and treatment with zzso In zzso zzso analyses also showed that zzso was expressed in different cell types during leaf zzso In order to identify proteins that interact with zzso a zzso two hybrid zzso with zzso as bait was used to screen a zzso leaf zzso zzso The screening of zzso two hybrids yielded 14 positive zzso One of them is a zzso zzso family protein involved in zzso degradation of toxic zzso Other clones isolated are also related to plant responses to zzso To determine the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso fusion was zzso in onion zzso cell and the zzso was localized to the nucleus, in agreement with the putative role of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso
