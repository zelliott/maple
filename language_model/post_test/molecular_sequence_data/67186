A zzso zzso zzso has been isolated by differential screening of a zzso library from rice zzso zzso is a unique gene in the rice zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso indicates that this gene is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso during zzso and disappears before zzso zzso has no zzso and encodes a putative zzso of 94 zzso acids with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of the gene do not show significant zzso to any known zzso However, a sequence in the promoter region, zzso differs only by one or two zzso from one of the zzso motifs in the promoter region of two zzso genes of zzso Several other sequence motifs found in other zzso promoters were also identified in the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso approaches revealed that zzso gene is required for male fertility in zzso The promoter region of zzso when fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of the zzso zzso is able to drive zzso expression of both genes in rice, creeping zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso male zzso to the transgenic zzso Light and zzso zzso zzso of zzso through developing flowers of zzso zzso shows that zzso expression of zzso or the zzso zzso genes interrupts zzso development, resulting in zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate a critical role of the zzso gene in zzso development in rice and the versatile application of the zzso gene promoter in directing zzso gene expression in both zzso and zzso plants, pointing to a potential for exploiting this gene and its promoter for engineering male zzso for hybrid production of various plant zzso
