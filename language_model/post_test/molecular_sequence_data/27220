zzso of zzso zzso concentration zzso plays a fundamental role in cell volume regulation and zzso response to zzso zzso exit via zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso however, mechanisms governing zzso activities are poorly zzso We identified two sites in zzso that are rapidly zzso in zzso conditions in cultured cells and human red blood cells in parallel with increased transport zzso zzso zzso at these sites result in zzso active zzso These sites are highly zzso in plasma membrane zzso in zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso increases zzso intrinsic transport zzso Reduction of zzso expression via zzso interference reduces zzso at these zzso zzso sites are zzso in all human zzso zzso is partially zzso in zzso mouse brain and zzso in parallel with zzso zzso These findings provide insight into regulation of zzso and have implications for control of cell volume and zzso zzso
