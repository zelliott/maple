Although four members zzso B, C, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family have been cloned by different groups, no study comparing the characteristics of zzso human zzso zzso has been zzso In this study, we have expressed human zzso A, B, C, and D in insect zzso cells by using the zzso expression system, zzso the expressed zzso and compared their zzso The zzso zzso zzso all showed zzso activity for zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso values differed significantly among these zzso with the following order: C zzso B zzso A zzso zzso zzso A, B, C, and D showed a very similar zzso dependence zzso zzso B and C showed similar pH profiles with the optimal pH being zzso The pH profiles of zzso A and D were very different from each other and from those of B and C, with the optimal pH being zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, although zzso A, B, C, and D were all inhibited by the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso potency zzso Thus, by several criteria including zzso pH dependency, and inhibitor sensitivity, various zzso zzso differ significantly from one zzso
