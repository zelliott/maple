zzso zzso proteins are a class of zzso proteins that play an essential role in zzso packaging and viral zzso They contain two zzso zinc binding motifs connected by a basic zzso of variable zzso The zzso structure of a zzso zzso corresponding to sequence zzso from zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso simulated zzso and molecular zzso The solution structure consists of two zinc binding zzso held together by a zzso basic zzso zzso that allows for spatial proximity between the two finger zzso zzso zzso folding is stabilized by H bonded secondary structure zzso resulting in an zzso central region, zzso centered on the zzso The zzso differences and similarities with other NC zinc binding zzso have been systematically zzso The two zzso zzso both characterized by a peculiar zzso sequence preceding the His zzso although preserving zzso geometry and zzso of other known NC zzso exhibit local fold differences both between each other and in comparison with other previously characterized zzso zzso zzso
