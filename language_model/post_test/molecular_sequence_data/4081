Plant zzso proteins comprise a family of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso contain four loop zzso in one zzso with a proposed distant zzso to zzso channel selectivity zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso revealed that wheat zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso only zzso in zzso expression zzso To understand the molecular basis of this difference we constructed a series of zzso zzso and introduced point zzso to zzso and wheat zzso at positions predicted to be critical for zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to zzso was sufficient to restore zzso zzso to zzso The reverse zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso in zzso A of zzso and zzso can be modeled as the first zzso of the zzso channel selectivity filter zzso zzso The importance of such filter zzso for zzso selectivity was confirmed by zzso of zzso and zzso in the rice zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, all zzso zzso known from zzso have a zzso at the filter position in zzso A, suggesting that these proteins function mainly as zzso zzso in plants and that zzso zzso in zzso proteins is associated with a zzso in the filter zzso These data provide experimental evidence that the zzso zzso in selectivity filters of zzso proteins are structurally related to those of zzso zzso
