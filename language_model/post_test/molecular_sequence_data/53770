The zzso zzso group A zzso protein zzso and zzso replication protein A zzso are among the major zzso proteins involved in the early stage of zzso zzso repair zzso zzso and zzso are able to bind damaged DNA zzso although zzso interaction stimulates zzso binding to damaged DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso Peterson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used surface zzso resonance zzso analysis to investigate the interaction of zzso and zzso with two major types of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso zzso duplex DNA over zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso was weak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso showed a very stable interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 02 zzso zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were incubated together, the stability of the zzso DNA interaction was significantly enhanced by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso defective in its interaction with zzso failed to stabilize zzso DNA zzso Taken together, our results suggest that a role for zzso in zzso recognition is to stabilize zzso DNA complex through zzso zzso
