zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of zzso death in the United States, with a zzso survival rate of less than zzso zzso early detection and screening are currently not available, and tumors are typically diagnosed at a late stage, frequently after zzso zzso clinical markers of pancreatic cancer lack zzso as they are also found in inflammatory diseases of the zzso and zzso zzso In the work described here, naturally occurring zzso were enriched by using zzso affinity zzso and then further resolved by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were then printed and zzso with a variety of zzso to screen zzso patterns in zzso from normal, chronic zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso Ten normal, 8 chronic zzso and 6 pancreatic cancer zzso were zzso Data from the zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso approaches including principal component analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both normal and chronic zzso zzso were found to cluster close together, although in two distinct groups, whereas pancreatic cancer zzso were significantly different from the other two zzso Both zzso and zzso increased as a function of cancer on several proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas decreased zzso was detected on plasma zzso C1 zzso Target zzso on zzso were verified by zzso zzso experiments and zzso mapping experiments using zzso These altered zzso structures may have utility for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic zzso and identify critical differences between biological samples from patients with different clinical zzso
