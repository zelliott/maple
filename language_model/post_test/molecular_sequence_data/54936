The zzso channel zzso by the zzso Gene zzso is expressed in different zzso of different animal zzso There are at least three zzso of this channel, being the zzso 1 zzso crucial in the zzso phase of the cardiac action zzso zzso in this gene can affect the properties of the channel producing the type II long zzso syndrome zzso and many drugs are also known to affect this channel with a similar side zzso Various zzso zzso and sea zzso toxins affect the zzso currents by blocking the zzso pore from the external side or by modulating channel gating through binding to the zzso zzso By doing so, these toxins become very useful tools for better understanding the structural and functional characteristics of these zzso zzso This review discusses the interaction between the zzso channels and the peptides isolated from zzso of these zzso Special emphasis is placed on scorpion zzso although the effects of several zzso zzso toxins and zzso toxins will be also zzso
