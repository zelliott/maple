The transfer of newly zzso membrane proteins moving from the rough zzso zzso zzso to the zzso complex has been studied by electron zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso for zzso zzso These proteins consist of a reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso anchored to the zzso zzso of two integral membrane zzso the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are distributed throughout the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso clusters zzso and a network of zzso in the zzso zzso At 20 degrees C zzso containing zzso connect the zzso to the zzso and to the zzso zzso On transfer to 37 degrees C in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso are seen to move from the zzso and through the zzso zzso With this temperature shift the direct connections with the zzso are lost and free zzso zzso some of these zzso contain zzso reaction product which is much more concentrated than in the adjacent zzso while others lack reaction product zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso reaction product remains distributed throughout the zzso the zzso and the zzso network for prolonged periods in the presence of zzso and almost all of the zzso which form at 37 degrees C are zzso Together these observations demonstrate that all three zzso are transported from the zzso to the zzso in free, zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso They also suggest that the retrograde traffic which carries zzso back to the zzso is probably zzso by zzso with a similar zzso but which, in cells expressing zzso zzso lack zzso reaction zzso
