Gap zzso electrical zzso contributes to zzso zzso activities of zzso and considerable progress has been made in defining the molecular composition of gap junction zzso In particular, cloning and functional expression of gap junction proteins zzso zzso from zzso zzso have shown that this part of the brain possesses a high degree of zzso diversity that may account for differential functional properties of electrical zzso Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a new zzso designated zzso zzso zzso This zzso shows little similarity to known zzso from fish and higher zzso By combining in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found that this novel fish zzso is expressed in horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer of the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso led to functional gap zzso channels and, in single zzso induced large zzso membrane currents indicative of the formation of zzso which were inhibited in zzso fashion by raising zzso zzso zzso
