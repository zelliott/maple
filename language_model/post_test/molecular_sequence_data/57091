Gas zzso synthesis in zzso zzso involves several gene products zzso by a zzso pair DNA region zzso zzso that contains 13 genes in addition to zzso zzso the major structural gas zzso zzso The expression of part of this region, encompassing the genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso These genes are transcribed from a common promoter located upstream of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso were observed, with the zzso transcript being the zzso zzso zzso The majority of the zzso formed zzso 64 base pairs downstream of zzso at the zzso of the sequence zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of the zzso and zzso proteins was investigated by Western zzso An zzso raised against isolated gas zzso of zzso zzso zzso in addition to gas zzso fragments, the zzso protein of the zzso of approximately 8,000 in zzso derived from different zzso or from zzso coli expressing zzso In samples containing isolated gas zzso mainly partially zzso gas zzso fragments zzso but a minor amount of zzso zzso is also zzso For the detection of the zzso zzso two versions of the zzso gene (full length and zzso delta C lacking the 3' part zzso the zzso C zzso were expressed in zzso coli, and the resulting proteins were zzso The two zzso raised against these zzso versions indicate the expression of zzso in different zzso By Western analysis, zzso is also zzso in samples containing isolated gas zzso demonstrating that zzso is a second, but minor, gas zzso structural zzso
