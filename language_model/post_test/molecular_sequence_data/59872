The human zzso zzso II and III zzso promoters share a common zzso element, the zzso sequence element zzso which is recognized by a complex we refer to as the zzso protein complex zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso is composed of at least four zzso of 43, 45, 50 and 190 zzso as well as variable amounts of the zzso box binding zzso zzso zzso zzso the 43 and 45 zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated, but there is no evidence that either of these zzso contacts zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso zzso the 50 zzso zzso of zzso zzso The open reading frame predicts a 411 zzso acid zzso which contains two potential zinc finger zzso zzso with zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso II and III zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso interacts with zzso in zzso experiments, but not with zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso contacts DNA in the zzso zzso These results are consistent with the same core zzso complex recognizing the zzso of zzso zzso II and III zzso zzso and provide an initial view of the architecture of the zzso zzso
