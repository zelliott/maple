During development, excess zzso are eliminated by programmed cell zzso Similarly, zzso immortalized zzso rat zzso and zzso cells undergo cell death following differentiation with several factors such as zzso growth factor, zzso activated zzso or zzso zzso The mechanism by which cell death occurs has not been zzso Using zzso differential display, we have identified and characterized a novel immediate early gene zzso zzso for zzso and zzso induced during differentiation of both rat zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso rich in zzso zzso and zzso repeats, is zzso to a zzso protein zzso required for zzso zzso in T zzso To determine whether zzso acts as a zzso of zzso in zzso cells, the zzso zzso cells were zzso with either a zzso expressing zzso zzso or an zzso against zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso against zzso increased the number of surviving cells by zzso zzso expression of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells decreased the number of surviving cells by zzso this reduction was reversed by zzso of zzso zzso Finally, levels of zzso transcripts are not increased in the zzso cells, indicating that the mechanism of action differs from that in T zzso These results demonstrate that zzso can be induced by growth factors and zzso agents and can itself induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, these data suggest that zzso can function more generally as a zzso of zzso and provide a possible mechanism for induction of programmed cell death during zzso zzso
