The left-handed zzso zzso is an intriguing, rare structural pattern in zzso that has been implicated in the formation of zzso zzso We used accurate zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations to study the relative stability of diverse sequences in the zzso zzso zzso coordinates from zzso served as a scoring criterion to identify sequences and zzso zzso suited to the zzso as in a fold recognition zzso We examined the zzso of our zzso simulations, finding that single simulations can be reliable to a quantifiable zzso We find expected behavior for the positive and negative control cases of a native zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a designed zzso repeat show remarkable affinity for the zzso zzso A structural model for zzso zzso prion protein was also considered, and showed intermediate stability under the given zzso Our technique is found to be an effective probe of zzso stability, and promises to be zzso to broader studies of this and potentially other novel or rare zzso The zzso character of the designed zzso repeat suggests theoretical and experimental zzso
