In addition to the zzso and zzso zzso H domain, zzso zzso zzso possess either one or two copies of a small zzso zzso The solution structure of one of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso determined using zzso zzso is zzso The 46 zzso motif comprises a zzso zzso zzso and two short zzso which pack onto opposite faces of the zzso zzso zzso involved in packing the zzso onto the zzso form the zzso core of the zzso Three highly zzso and zzso exposed zzso are implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of the domain differs from the structures of known zzso binding zzso such as the zzso zzso binding domain zzso the zzso K zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso However, structural similarities exist between this domain and the zzso domain of zzso protein zzso which binds to 23 S zzso zzso
