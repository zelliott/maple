We have refined the crystal structure of zzso S zzso zzso at zzso A resolution to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso to those originally grown by zzso and zzso A zzso feature of this crystal form is a double strand of zzso zzso that has been shown by a variety of techniques to be the fundamental building block of the zzso zzso cell zzso The double strand is stabilized by lateral contacts involving the zzso zzso interacting with a pocket between the E and F zzso on another zzso The new structure reveals some marked differences from the previously refined zzso A resolution structure, including several zzso in the lateral contact which have shifted by as much as zzso zzso The lateral contact includes, in addition to the zzso interactions involving the zzso zzso zzso interactions and bridging water molecules at the periphery of the zzso This structure provides further insights into zzso zzso and may be useful for the zzso design of therapeutic agents to treat zzso cell zzso
