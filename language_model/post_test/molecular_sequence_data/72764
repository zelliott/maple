zzso rabbit zzso raised against a zzso protein zzso zzso from the toxic fraction of the crude zzso of zzso zzso can neutralize the effects of the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were compared by an indirect zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso fraction of zzso that represents most of the toxicity of the crude zzso and crude zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to coat zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a comparable high zzso with the toxic fraction and crude zzso of zzso zzso moderate binding capacity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were unable to recognize the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso equivalent to 20 zzso were effectively neutralized by 1 zzso of the zzso zzso This result shows that this protein may be of interest in the production of zzso for clinical zzso
