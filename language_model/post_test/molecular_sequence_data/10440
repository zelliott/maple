We report the construction and analysis of a zzso zzso zzso disruption zzso and an investigation of whether zzso is required for zzso and integration of zzso mobile DNA zzso The zzso zzso was deficient in zzso zzso and was more sensitive than the zzso strain to zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also more sensitive to oxygen than the wild type, indicating that repair of DNA contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso Many zzso clinical zzso carry zzso zzso elements known as zzso zzso These zzso zzso can also zzso and mobilize in trans a family of zzso integrated elements called zzso zzso units zzso The results of a previous study had raised the possibility that zzso plays a role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso but this hypothesis could not be tested in zzso zzso because no zzso zzso strain was zzso We report here that the zzso and integration of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso were unaffected by the absence of zzso zzso
