zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso To study the function of zzso during zzso development, the zzso expression levels were measured using zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso showed a relatively high level of expression at 5 days zzso zzso and the expression was specific to the zzso zzso The zzso expression was evident at zzso zzso zzso and remained high up to 8 zzso corresponding to embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso were designed to both genes to prevent zzso zzso and block zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso cell zzso zzso decreased gene expression by zzso and induced a zzso zzso zzso and curled tail associated with death at around 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso with full-length mouse zzso zzso together with the zzso completely rescued this zzso No zzso changes were observed when the zzso gene zzso was injected into zzso with zzso efficiency of zzso These results suggest that zzso is an essential gene for normal zzso development and provide insight into the function of zzso the gene zzso in zzso
