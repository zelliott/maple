zzso surface proteins of zzso zzso play a critical role in the invasion of human zzso by the malaria zzso Here we describe the identification of a novel protein with a molecular mass of 40 zzso that is found on the zzso surface of zzso zzso We call this protein zzso surface protein 4 zzso Evidence for the surface location of zzso includes zzso a zzso pattern that is consistent with zzso surface location in indirect zzso studies of cultured zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso phase in zzso zzso zzso studies, and zzso zzso sequencing studies which predict the presence of an zzso signal sequence and a zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid indicated that zzso is anchored on the zzso surface by a zzso zzso Of considerable interest is the presence of a single zzso growth zzso domain at the C zzso of the zzso zzso making it the second protein with such a structure to be found on the zzso zzso
