The zzso structures of the zzso and zzso proteins from zzso zzso in solution at zzso were determined following a new protocol which uses the software package zzso for extensive zzso The results obtained with this novel procedure were evaluated by comparison with the crystal structures solved by the zzso at zzso to zzso and zzso resolution, zzso In addition, the zzso solution structure was compared with an zzso structure solved by the zzso using a conventional largely interactive zzso For both zzso the newly determined zzso structure could be superimposed with the crystal structure with zzso values of zzso for the backbone heavy zzso which provided a starting platform to investigate local structure variations, which may arise from either the methods used or from the different chemical environments in solution and in the zzso zzso these comparative studies were further explored with the use of reference zzso and crystal structures, which were zzso using the zzso software with input of zzso distance constraints derived from the molecular models that represent the results of structure determination by zzso and by X-ray zzso zzso The results thus obtained show that zzso structure calculations with the new automated zzso software used by the zzso compare favorably with those from a more zzso and zzso interactive zzso An intriguing observation is that the zzso of two zzso or three zzso molecules in the zzso unit of the crystal structures mimic the behavior of the zzso of 20 zzso used to represent the zzso solution structures when comparing global zzso values calculated either for the zzso zzso the core zzso with zzso accessibility below zzso or all heavy zzso
