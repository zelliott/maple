zzso is a zzso expressed in a wide variety of cell zzso Recently expression of some zzso zzso of zzso transcripts zzso has been suggested to play a potential role in tumor zzso and the detection of zzso containing zzso 6 to 11 may be helpful for the diagnosis of zzso Expressions of zzso containing zzso 6 to 11 were investigated in 20 human zzso cancer samples, peripheral blood zzso isolated from zzso cancer patients, and 4 zzso cancer cell lines using reverse zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso zzso The standard form of zzso transcripts was expressed in all samples zzso zzso containing zzso 6 to 11 was expressed in 18 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 out of 4 cell lines, and one normal tissue zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso containing zzso 6 to 11 can be regarded as tumor specific and that this marker may be helpful for the early diagnosis of colon zzso if specimens from the early stage are zzso
