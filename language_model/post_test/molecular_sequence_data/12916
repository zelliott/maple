The present work was designed to study the pharmacological control of the zzso zzso of human zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid inhibited in a zzso manner the zzso response and zzso influx in zzso activated either by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was used to activate zzso zzso acid (30 zzso reduced zzso influx by 50% and zzso by zzso zzso zzso influx and zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso respectively, by 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid did not inhibit the release of zzso from zzso stores induced either by zzso or zzso To confirm the zzso of zzso zzso influx by zzso acid, the zzso induced zzso influx was studied in zzso free zzso zzso acid zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso influx in zzso in a zzso zzso The simultaneous zzso release from zzso stores was not zzso zzso zzso C activity in zzso human zzso and the zzso zzso from rat brain were inhibited by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso Both failed to inhibit zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso acid zzso zzso increased the cellular zzso levels up to zzso in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso No effects on cellular zzso levels were zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
