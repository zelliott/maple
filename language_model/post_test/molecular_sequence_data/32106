The molecular recognition of a novel kind of hybrid zzso composed of artificial zzso zzso zzso with an zzso natural zzso (the zzso zzso by four different zzso specific zzso was investigated using surface zzso zzso zzso The influence of the zzso and the zzso zzso on the recognition was studied using two zzso zzso a zzso zzso two zzso acid containing zzso and zzso zzso Although all four zzso displayed a decreased affinity for the zzso zzso when attached to a zzso as compared to the zzso zzso the zzso part was found to have distinct effects on the binding zzso that varying degrees of zzso interactions occurred in the recognition zzso Likewise, the zzso did not discriminate between zzso and the zzso but the zzso of the zzso had a zzso effect for at least two of the zzso
