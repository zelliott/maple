The zzso A gene zzso of zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso upon exposure to inducing carbon sources, such as starch and zzso In order to identify nuclear zzso possibly involved in the induction of the zzso zzso gel mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso analyses were carried out, and revealed a novel nuclear factor in zzso zzso zzso which specifically bound to two sites in the zzso promoter region, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso which share the common sequence zzso The nuclear factor was detected in zzso from both induced and zzso zzso zzso analysis within and around the binding sequences demonstrated that only the upstream binding zzso designated zzso zzso responsive zzso was required for the zzso expression of the zzso zzso and thus we designated the nuclear factor zzso zzso binding zzso The downstream binding site contained an zzso zzso zzso and played no role in the induction of zzso zzso zzso was shown by gel zzso zzso to have higher affinity for zzso than for zzso
