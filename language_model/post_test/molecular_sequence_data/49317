zzso protein zzso zzso zzso control gene expression patterns in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activate zzso by zzso zzso activated zzso in turn, zzso target zzso factors, and are zzso by zzso One mechanism for maintaining signal specificity and efficiency is the interaction of zzso with their zzso and regulators through zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that peptides corresponding to the zzso sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Each zzso inhibited multiple zzso for example, the zzso zzso inhibited not only zzso but also zzso and zzso In addition, these zzso peptides inhibited zzso zzso The zzso site of zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso of a target site on the same zzso Control peptides with zzso of zzso basic and zzso zzso of the zzso site consensus lacked biological zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor compete for binding to the same region of zzso via zzso interactions that are crucial for zzso zzso
