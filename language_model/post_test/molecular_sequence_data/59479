zzso has previously been shown to have a slight zzso or no effect on blood pressure in zzso zzso but causes potent increases in blood pressure in several other zzso zzso In this paper, the part of the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso activity was investigated in the zzso road, zzso zzso by administration of fragments of zzso into zzso toads and isolated zzso segments in an organ zzso In zzso zzso the order of efficacy was human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso zzso In isolated vessels, the first three peptides were equally zzso When four fragments of human zzso were tested in zzso zzso the order of efficacy was human zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso Gal zzso The substitution of zzso for zzso at position 2 or for zzso at position 9 abolished the zzso response to the human zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that vascular activity in the zzso is retained within the zzso and that positions 2 zzso and 9 zzso are key zzso acids in retention of the vascular activity of zzso
