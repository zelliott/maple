Small zzso peptides called zzso produced by the predatory marine snail zzso zzso present an interesting case for zzso zzso They have a high degree of zzso acid zzso among them yet they possess highly zzso structural elements that are defined by zzso zzso forming zzso bridges along the length of the mature zzso It has been observed that zzso specifying these zzso are also highly zzso It is unknown how such zzso conservation is maintained within the mature zzso gene since this entire region zzso an accelerated rate of zzso There is evidence suggesting that zzso acids wield some influence in mechanisms that dictate the region and frequency where zzso occur in zzso zzso acids exert this effect primarily through secondary structures that bring about local zzso and zzso in the energy relief of these transient zzso Secondary structure predictions of several zzso genes were analyzed to see if there was any correspondence between the highly variable regions of the zzso zzso of the DNA encompassing the zzso zzso zzso (and several other zzso zzso acid zzso have been found to zzso to predicted secondary structures of higher zzso In stark contrast the regions of the zzso that have a higher degree of variation correlate to regions of lower zzso This striking zzso allows for a simple model of zzso of a zzso to these highly zzso regions of the zzso gene allowing them a relative degree of resistance towards zzso
