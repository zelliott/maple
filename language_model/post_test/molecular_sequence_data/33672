The zzso restriction system of zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by carrying out transformations with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to strongly restrict DNA zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso modification systems of zzso zzso zzso DNA was restricted as strongly as zzso DNA, even though there are significantly fewer sites on the zzso zzso zzso was restricted more strongly then either zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA modified in zzso by different zzso also showed a greater dependence on the zzso sequence than on the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed that lacked genes identified as the likely candidates for zzso zzso restriction zzso (the products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso that are located in the zzso acquired zzso islands of the zzso zzso zzso these zzso showed partial zzso of zzso DNA zzso Cloning of these genes in the close relative zzso zzso increased the restriction of zzso DNA by this species, confirming their role as part of the zzso restriction system of zzso zzso
