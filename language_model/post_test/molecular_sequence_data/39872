zzso zzso containing premature termination zzso zzso have the potential to be translated into truncated zzso which could act to the detriment of the zzso by interfering with normal cellular zzso zzso have mechanisms of zzso quality control that identify zzso transcripts and target them for destruction, a process known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences have been reported in the mechanisms of zzso between different zzso zzso and zzso are structurally unrelated zzso which function in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso in plants requires zzso as zzso containing zzso become stabilized in zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso in zzso zzso zzso is capable of targeting both spliced and zzso zzso zzso An zzso series of zzso zzso exhibits a range of unexpected zzso and floral zzso including jagged leaves, late zzso fused flowers and zzso zzso We also show that zzso in zzso share these zzso As both zzso and zzso are required for zzso the similar zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso regulates a common set of genes required for plant development and zzso Finally, gene zzso by an zzso repeat zzso is impaired in zzso zzso indicating a connection between zzso and zzso interference in zzso
