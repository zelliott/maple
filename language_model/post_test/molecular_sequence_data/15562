zzso and zzso zzso content of the zzso first internal transcribed zzso zzso were compared across a wide variety of marine animal species, and its zzso utility was zzso From a total of zzso individuals representing zzso species, we only failed to amplify the zzso sequence from 87 individuals by zzso chain reaction with universal zzso zzso No species was found to have an zzso region shorter than 100 zzso In general, the zzso sequences of zzso were longer zzso to zzso zzso and richer in zzso content zzso to zzso than those of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Specifically, zzso animals zzso and zzso were observed to have short zzso sequences zzso to 422 zzso with lower zzso content zzso to zzso than the other animal zzso zzso and zzso were diverse groups with respect to zzso zzso ranging from 108 to zzso and 182 to zzso zzso zzso No universal relationship between length and zzso content was zzso Our data indicated that zzso has a limited utility for zzso analysis as obtaining confident sequence alignment was often impossible between different zzso of the same family and even between zzso zzso
