zzso labeling along with mass zzso is a method that is increasingly used to study protein zzso Recently, it has been shown that zzso zzso is a powerful labeling zzso because it can modify up to zzso of the zzso in the average zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We recently discovered, however, that zzso zzso that form zzso bonds appear to be modified by zzso as zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso linked zzso zzso are not actually zzso with zzso but, instead, once reduced, free zzso zzso can capture a zzso group from other modified zzso acids via a zzso reaction that can occur during the protein zzso zzso This zzso of zzso groups decreases the amount of modification observed at other zzso and can potentially provide incorrect protein structural zzso Fortunately, label scrambling can be completely avoided by zzso the free zzso after zzso zzso
