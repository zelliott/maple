zzso diversity and structural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The analyses revealed a mosaic structure consisting of highly zzso regions shared among some of the zzso from geographically different areas and zzso sequence runs shared among zzso from one zzso The specific pattern of diversity in which large insertions and deletions were observed, giving a mosaic structure to the zzso zzso is quite exceptional for zzso zzso The zzso middle region of the gene was zzso by large deletions or insertions in many zzso There was no correlation between the copy number of the zzso repeats in this region and the total length of the zzso The gene was highly zzso when compared with sequences from other known zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings support the concept that as yet unidentified mechanisms are generating extensive diversity and shaping the zzso zzso The relevance of this finding for diagnosis and the relationship between these mechanisms and the possible role of this protein in host immune responses is zzso
