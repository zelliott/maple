zzso cell lines producing human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso M zzso which bound to the outer core region of zzso zzso zzso zzso were established by cell fusion of human peripheral zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Both binding specificity experiments with a series of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rowe and zzso zzso Meadow, zzso zzso zzso 1983) and competitive zzso zzso experiments with zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso in the outer core of zzso might be in part an zzso The zzso specifically bound to clinical zzso belonging to zzso zzso A, zzso G, and K at a frequency of 70 to zzso and to zzso H and M zzso at about zzso They did not bind to any zzso of zzso B, zzso and I zzso This evidence indicates that zzso and probably its neighboring zzso in the other core of zzso zzso are zzso in some association with the O zzso
