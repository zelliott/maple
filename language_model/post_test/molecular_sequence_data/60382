Plasma from 126 patients with various zzso diseases and 118 healthy subjects were examined to determine the presence of zzso to zzso one of zzso The frequency of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso detected by zzso was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy subjects zzso The specificity of the zzso was demonstrated by zzso of the plasma samples with zzso and other zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with two bands of 12 and 24 zzso the latter representing the zzso zzso zzso in some patients reacted more strongly with the zzso than the zzso suggesting that zzso may also exist as the zzso in zzso The majority of zzso zzso bound to two synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso approximate to zzso and zzso approximate to zzso These zzso are zzso well zzso and responsible for the binding to zzso and zzso The zzso inhibited zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso These data define the frequent occurrence of a novel set of zzso to a zzso protein involved in the regulation of the immune zzso
