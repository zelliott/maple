zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso muscle using zzso zzso and zzso 200 zzso column zzso The molecular weights of the zzso zzso were calculated to be zzso according to zzso mass zzso and to be approximately zzso and zzso on zzso 200 zzso column zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and were calculated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso to be 24,000 and 25,000 in the absence and 25,000 in the presence of zzso These findings suggested that the native zzso is composed of four identical zzso Other properties of zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso including pH stability and heat stability, were also zzso We determined the partial zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso using zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and also determined the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso obtained using both methods showed zzso to those of zzso such as human, zzso chicken, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also predicted the zzso structure of zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso using molecular operating environment and compared its structure with those of other zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso was very similar to those of other species, including human and zzso
