The generation of a diverse population of viral zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso In order to address what role this diversity plays in disease zzso accurate sampling of the viral population is zzso However, traditional zzso methods often rely on amplification of multiple zzso in one reaction, leading to zzso of viral zzso and potential errors in the zzso of viral diversity, especially when sequences from only one or a small number of zzso are examined and/or viral copy number is zzso Here we describe a method to amplify one viral envelope gene per zzso thereby avoiding zzso For this purpose we developed a highly accurate real-time zzso method to zzso zzso copy number, then used a single zzso template in a sensitive, zzso full-length envelope zzso Using this method, we have estimated the zzso viral diversity for a cohort of five zzso zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso which displayed a broad range of viral loads at zzso
