Twelve percent of zzso California ground squirrels zzso zzso from six different geographic locations in Kern County, zzso were found to be shedding on average zzso zzso g of zzso The mean annual environmental loading rate of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with seasonal patterns of zzso shedding ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso in fall, winter, and spring to levels of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were about twice as likely as adult squirrels to be infected and shed higher zzso of zzso than adults did, with particularly high levels of infection and shedding being found among juvenile male zzso Based on DNA sequencing of a portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso there existed three zzso of zzso species in these populations of squirrels zzso zzso and zzso zzso numbers zzso to zzso zzso These unique DNA sequences were most closely related zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with up to 10,000 zzso or zzso fresh zzso from different infected hosts did not produce zzso levels of infection, suggesting that this common zzso shed by California ground squirrels is not infectious for mice and may constitute a new species of zzso
