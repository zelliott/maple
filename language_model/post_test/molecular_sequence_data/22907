Since zzso factor family especially zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and liver X zzso alpha zzso have been recognized to play crucial role in both zzso metabolism and zzso the present study was addressed to explore the zzso between blood cellular zzso expression profile, serum zzso levels and severity of coronary heart disease zzso in human zzso Based upon the demographic and laboratory data, the human subjects were divided into 4 zzso zzso expression profile in the subjects belonging to these groups was determined by measuring the zzso expression of genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low density zzso zzso zzso in their blood zzso zzso This zzso expression profile was correlated with serum zzso profile as well as with the severity of zzso zzso by coronary zzso coupled with modified zzso zzso using standard statistical zzso zzso Further in zzso and in zzso effect of statins on such zzso profile was also zzso Although genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed correlation with the severity of coronary zzso , blood cellular zzso zzso profile showed conspicuous negative correlation with the severity of coronary zzso in subjects with or without zzso This view was further confirmed in experiments directed to understand the effect of statins on the cellular zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on these reported findings, we propose that blood cellular zzso zzso profile has a protective effect against the development of zzso and hence may be of importance in devising synthetic therapeutic drugs for zzso in zzso
