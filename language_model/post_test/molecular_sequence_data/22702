The zzso zzso plays a major role in the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso in vascular zzso One of the key zzso in this zzso is zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of the zzso zzso To zzso the evolution and functional role of zzso we identified and zzso zzso from the moss zzso zzso zzso sequence tag zzso databases containing approximately zzso zzso from zzso were searched and three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In vascular plants zzso is found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, all three zzso resembled the zzso zzso from vascular plants lacking the zzso or zzso extension found in zzso targeted zzso The number and position of zzso was also zzso between zzso and zzso zzso from vascular zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso are zzso in origin and the ancestral gene evolved before the divergence of zzso more than 400 million years zzso zzso analyses showed that expression of zzso and zzso was increased up to zzso under salt stress, zzso stress or upon exposure to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels were unchanged upon chilling, zzso exposure or zzso zzso The conservation of zzso zzso in the zzso lineage and the zzso zzso under water zzso suggest that the evolution of zzso zzso played an essential role in stress protection for land plants when they inhabited the dry zzso zzso
