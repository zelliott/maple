zzso zzso zzso 4 is mainly found on cells of the zzso zzso It recognizes zzso zzso and mediates cellular zzso and production of zzso zzso Less is known about the distribution and role of zzso in zzso cells that are continuously exposed to microbes and microbial zzso Here we show that the zzso small zzso zzso cell line zzso is highly responsive to zzso and expresses both zzso and zzso zzso and surface membrane zzso for zzso were zzso upon zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso revealed a strictly zzso zzso zzso This zzso compartment could be identified as the zzso zzso zzso added to the zzso was zzso by zzso cells and zzso with zzso Continuous exposure to zzso led to a tolerant zzso but did not alter zzso expression nor cellular zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells might be able to provide the initial zzso signal to attract professional immune cells to the side of zzso The zzso location of zzso which is identical to the final location of zzso zzso further indicates an important role of cellular zzso and zzso traffic in the process of innate immune zzso
