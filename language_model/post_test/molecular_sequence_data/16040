We have zzso conditions for zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA with both unique and zzso zzso zzso Using the human Factor IX zzso optimal probe zzso and zzso times were determined, and washing conditions with sodium zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso With zzso the washing temperature was independent of zzso zzso With these conditions, the Factor IX gene was detected in zzso DNA using a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso This permits the detection of a gene prior to cloning and the reduction of probe zzso and zzso the isolation of that zzso We apply this method of probe zzso reduction using zzso for the human Factor VIII zzso
