Heat shock protein zzso preparations derived from cancer cells and zzso cells have been shown previously to elicit zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso preparations has been attributed to peptides associated with the zzso The studies reported here demonstrate that zzso zzso complexes can also be zzso in zzso The studies show that zzso complexes of zzso or zzso zzso molecules with a variety of synthetic peptides can be generated in zzso zzso the binding of zzso with peptides is specific in that a number of other proteins tested do not bind synthetic peptides under the conditions in which zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso in zzso are zzso active, as tested by their ability to elicit zzso immunity and specific zzso zzso T zzso zzso and zzso synthetic peptides zzso in zzso with zzso are capable of being taken up and zzso by zzso in the same manner as zzso peptides complexes generated in zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso are zzso T cell zzso zzso
