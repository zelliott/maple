zzso zzso and zzso species produce zzso that generate zzso acids from zzso zzso The zzso acid products are detected by the formation of colored iron complexes, raising the possibility that the zzso functions to secure iron for these species, which do not produce traditional zzso A gene zzso an zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified by screening a zzso library hosted in zzso coli zzso alpha for zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso localized on a zzso clone by zzso and zzso zzso was subjected to zzso zzso A single open reading frame, designated zzso zzso acid zzso which appears to be both necessary and sufficient for zzso activity, predicts a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within an area mapped by zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso did not share significant zzso acid sequence similarity with any other zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso acid zzso activity in both zzso zzso and zzso coli transformed with zzso plasmids was not affected by medium iron concentration or expression of genes in zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso coli zzso zzso expression was zzso affected by growth with zzso or zzso as the sole carbon source but was not consistent with zzso zzso
