The zzso native zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso sequence of 68 zzso acids predicted to be zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein has now been expressed zzso The protein was named zzso by zzso with zzso the first soluble domain of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been characterized using a set of zzso zzso The binding of mercury was followed using circular zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso The two zzso zzso contained in the consensus sequence zzso zzso are involved in the binding of one mercury zzso with an apparent affinity comparable to that of zzso for the same zzso The zzso site is confirmed by zzso chemical shift changes observed between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso shift and zzso data also indicate that only minor structural changes occur upon metal zzso Further zzso investigation of the fold of zzso using long-range zzso zzso and backbone residual zzso zzso data confirm the expected close structural zzso with zzso zzso relaxation data show that zzso is a globally rigid zzso An increased backbone mobility was observed for the loop region connecting the first zzso and the first zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Although significantly reduced, this loop region keeps some zzso flexibility upon metal zzso Altogether, our data suggest a role of zzso in mercury zzso
