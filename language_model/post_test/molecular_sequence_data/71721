Because of a sequence similarity between the zzso envelope zzso zzso and the variable region of human zzso we have suggested that the use of this protein as a vaccine component could strongly influence the host immune system, making it more vulnerable to zzso and in the long term, accelerate disease progression in zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso primer consisting of the zzso sequence derived from the zzso zzso gene coding for the second zzso region of zzso and the highly zzso sequence derived from the human zzso gene coding for the zzso domain, we have identified in zzso of AIDS patients zzso field zzso carrying the complete and active Chi zzso hot spot zzso We have also demonstrated in zzso zzso between the zzso gene coding for the central portion of the zzso involving the zzso loop and the bacterial gene coding for the zzso zzso These results strongly support and reinforce the previous contention and the serious concern that AIDS vaccine candidates carrying the zzso zzso gene on viral and bacterial zzso could result in the generation of new pathogens with unpredictable effects on the immune zzso
