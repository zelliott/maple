A zzso carrier protein zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso condensing zzso has been partly zzso from pea zzso The zzso which had zzso zzso zzso activity, was resolved from a second, specific, zzso zzso The zzso III zzso had a derived molecular mass of 42 zzso (from its zzso zzso and operated as a zzso Its zzso characteristics were similar to those of two other plant zzso III zzso except for its zzso by zzso A zzso of zzso containing a longer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a more effective inhibitor of pea zzso III and showed competitive zzso towards zzso whereas zzso showed uncompetitive characteristics at high zzso This difference may be due to the better fit of compound 332 into a zzso pocket at the active zzso A full-length zzso for the pea zzso III was zzso This was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso zzso in order to facilitate subsequent zzso zzso activity in preparations from zzso coli confirmed that the zzso zzso a zzso III zzso Furthermore, the expressed zzso III had zzso activity, showing that the latter was zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the pea zzso showed zzso similarity to that for other plant zzso zzso zzso somewhat less for zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and various bacteria zzso The pea zzso III exhibited four areas of zzso three of which were around the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, a stretch of 23 zzso acids zzso zzso in the pea zzso zzso was almost completely zzso in the plant zzso zzso zzso this stretch showed they belonged to a zzso zzso that fitted over the active site and contained segments suggested to be involved in zzso binding and in zzso changes during zzso as well as an zzso suggested to participate in the zzso zzso zzso
