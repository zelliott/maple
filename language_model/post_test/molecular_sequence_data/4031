Three zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared and evaluated as zzso zzso The most effective inhibitor was the zzso zzso zzso which exhibited a zzso of 360 zzso A comparison of zzso peptides 7 zzso zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso zzso with their zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is not as effective a zzso zzso as zzso by zzso to zzso Although zzso is not as effective as zzso a comparison of zzso 7 with zzso peptides bearing other zzso zzso zzso recently reported in the literature indicates that zzso is about zzso more effective than any other zzso zzso zzso zzso reported to zzso To further assess the zzso acid zzso group as a zzso zzso zzso a series of 24 zzso zzso compounds bearing the zzso group were prepared using zzso zzso and screened for zzso zzso Several of these compounds were selected for further study and their zzso compared to their zzso zzso zzso The differences in zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso compounds was not as great as with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso reasons for this and its implication to the design of small zzso zzso zzso is zzso
