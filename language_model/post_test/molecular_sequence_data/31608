Members of the zzso family of proteins are accessory factors implicated in the assembly and repair of the zzso II zzso We present here the crystal structure of the zzso protein zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso is similar to the solution structures of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained previously by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso One new aspect is that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to form zzso in solution and packs as a zzso of zzso in the zzso Analysis of wild type and zzso strains of zzso zzso by blue zzso gel zzso suggests that zzso the closest zzso to zzso zzso zzso in this zzso also exists as an zzso in zzso most likely a zzso In line with the prediction based on the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso the addition of a zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso interferes with the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, the more zzso related zzso protein found in zzso zzso lacks the zzso that stabilize zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso crystal and is detected as a zzso in zzso zzso our data suggest that the zzso interface in the zzso crystal might be zzso zzso
