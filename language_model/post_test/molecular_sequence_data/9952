zzso F is a zzso surface protein of zzso zzso zzso A zzso that mediates adherence to host zzso A gene product zzso by zzso activates zzso of the gene that encodes protein F zzso and was identified in a strain of zzso zzso that expressed high levels of protein F under all conditions zzso zzso zzso of zzso in this strain results in a zzso similar to that of other strains where high-level zzso of zzso occurs only in response to increased oxygen zzso In this study, we have compared the regulation of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso strains in order to gain further insight into the function of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts by zzso zzso and primer extension zzso indicated that the same promoters for each transcript are used in both zzso and zzso zzso However, analyses of zzso reporter zzso revealed that a key difference between strains involves regulation of zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression of zzso was elevated following culture under conditions of reduced zzso zzso However, a much more robust zzso of zzso expression was observed when zzso strains were grown under similar zzso Exchange of reporter and zzso zzso between strains demonstrated that host genetic background, and not the sequence of the respective zzso zzso or regulatory region, dictates the expression zzso zzso of zzso required zzso and zzso was shown to bind specifically to DNA containing the promoters for zzso and zzso Finally, zzso of either zzso of zzso caused zzso expression of zzso regardless of host zzso These data suggest a model where zzso expression of zzso in zzso hosts is controlled at the level of zzso of zzso and zzso additional factors in this regulatory zzso
