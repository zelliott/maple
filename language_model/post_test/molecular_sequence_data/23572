The zzso early zzso is a 200 zzso region that controls the early phase of zzso expression during mouse embryonic zzso This zzso defines the domain of zzso expression in the neural tube and zzso of the zzso regions of the developing zzso Five distinct zzso zzso zzso were previously shown to govern early phase zzso zzso zzso divergence between zzso and fish zzso early zzso sequences and activities suggested additional zzso zzso Here we describe four additional zzso elements zzso within the 200 zzso zzso early zzso region identified by comparative regulatory analysis and zzso zzso These elements affect zzso neural tube and zzso expression of the reporter zzso either zzso or in zzso Surprisingly, these new elements are missing from the zzso and zzso zzso early zzso zzso Considering that fish enhancers direct robust reporter expression in transgenic mouse zzso it is tempting to zzso that fish and zzso zzso early enhancers zzso different sets of elements to direct zzso early zzso These observations reveal a remarkable plasticity in the zzso early zzso suggesting different modes of initiation and establishment of zzso expression in different zzso We zzso that extensive restructuring and zzso of zzso zzso regions occurring in different zzso lead to relatively different zzso expression patterns, which in turn may act as a driving force in generating diverse zzso zzso
