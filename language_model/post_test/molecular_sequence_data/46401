Two new lycopene zzso zzso were cloned and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso During fruit zzso zzso expression did not show significant differences between zzso (red zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was much lower than zzso and nearly zzso however, zzso expression dramatically changed in a similar tendency in the pulp of both zzso zzso but the relative abundance of zzso in zzso was significantly lower than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was a zzso member and zzso a zzso member, the two zzso of all the zzso zzso An zzso was found in the zzso region of zzso and in two other zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso resulting in an extra 20 zzso zzso compared with all the other zzso It suggested that a different zzso event, in addition to gene duplication, has contributed to the evolution of these zzso zzso and likewise, the change of their zzso
