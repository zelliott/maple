The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a class II G zzso zzso that contributes to many different cellular functions including zzso zzso survival, and synaptic zzso The solution structure of the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso The zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso when bound to zzso with a bend at zzso zzso and makes extensive zzso and zzso interactions along the exposed zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data on both the zzso and the zzso delineate the critical interactions between the C zzso of the zzso and the C zzso of the zzso domain that define the high affinity and specificity of hormone binding to zzso These results present a structural basis for zzso selectivity for zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso and also differentiate zzso zzso involved in binding to the zzso zzso domain versus other parts of the full-length zzso zzso The zzso zzso and binding data are consistent with a model for zzso binding in which the C zzso of the zzso hormone interacts almost exclusively with the zzso zzso domain, whereas the central region makes contacts to both the zzso and other zzso parts of the zzso ultimately positioning the N zzso of the zzso to contact the zzso region and result in zzso zzso
