Three zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso were predicted to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso II zzso of the zzso zzso system, and were cloned from zzso zzso the primary zzso agent of human dental zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso BC and domain A of zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso Northern zzso and slot zzso analysis showed that expression of zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso while zzso were expressed zzso and at much lower zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso alone, or of both zzso and zzso had no major impact on growth on zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso However, when the strains were grown with zzso zzso as the sole zzso source, a significant decrease in the growth rate was seen with the zzso double zzso zzso of zzso activity showed that the zzso double zzso had roughly zzso of the capacity of the zzso strain to transport zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso toxicity zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso was responsible for zzso zzso
