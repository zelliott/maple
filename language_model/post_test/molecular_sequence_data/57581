Early zzso factor zzso was identified previously as a zzso and differentiation zzso zzso protein that zzso in the regulation of the zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences obtained from zzso zzso were used to isolate zzso zzso which by multiple criteria zzso zzso The zzso zzso formed zzso complexes with the zzso site in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso to multiple transcripts in zzso and zzso lines, but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells strongly activated zzso from reporter plasmids containing functional zzso zzso Analysis of DNA binding by deletion zzso of zzso identified an zzso zzso zzso domain lacking obvious sequence similarity to known zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and truncated forms of zzso indicated that the protein interacts with its site as a zzso zzso delineated a zzso zzso region containing two repeats of 15 zzso acids that show similarity with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso represents a novel regulator of B zzso gene zzso
