Data from zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analyses of an isolate obtained from the zzso of a kidney transplant patient identified the isolate as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data, as well as zzso zzso indicated that the isolate represents a new species of the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso the type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso data, as well as the results of zzso tests, indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a single species designated zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are genetically different and therefore propose that zzso zzso zzso zzso be elevated to species status as zzso zzso zzso zzso whose type strain is strain zzso zzso
