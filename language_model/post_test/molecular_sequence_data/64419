zzso of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is associated with fusion of zzso into a zzso zzso Here, we studied regulation of the zzso gene in zzso undergoing in zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporters harboring different lengths of the zzso upstream sequence revealed that the zzso promoter region zzso to zzso is sufficient to govern zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested that two selective promoter factor zzso and three zzso protein 2 zzso recognition sequences are necessary for full activity of the zzso During zzso these elements zzso with increasing amounts of the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso but only zzso binding rose upon zzso of zzso levels with zzso zzso expression of different zzso of zzso and zzso could also be detected by Western zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso zzso both in differentiated cultures and in term zzso zzso suggesting assembly of functional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factors with zzso on term zzso sections revealed that 47 and zzso of zzso zzso were negative for zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of early tissue demonstrated expression of zzso in the majority of zzso and zzso whereas zzso was absent from the zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso promoter zzso upon zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that the zzso elements function as zzso zzso The data suggest that increasing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso enhance zzso of zzso in zzso term zzso whereas a different combination of factors may control expression in early zzso
