zzso zzso is a major pathogen of wheat and barley causing head blight and crown rot in cooler temperate climates of Australia, Europe, West Asia and North zzso To better understand its evolutionary history we partially zzso single copy nuclear genes zzso translation zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso zzso zzso with 11 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequence zzso data using zzso zzso and maximum zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso from wheat is a single zzso species with no significant linkage zzso and little or no lineage development along geographic zzso Both zzso and zzso and RED gene sequence analysis separated the four zzso species used and delineated three to four groups within the zzso zzso zzso But the zzso gene could not completely resolve zzso into their respective zzso zzso index and gene flow suggest significant genetic exchange between the zzso from distant geographic zzso A lack of strong lineage structure despite the geographic separation of the three collections indicates a frequently zzso species and/or widespread distribution of zzso due to international trade, tourism and long-range zzso of zzso Moreover, the two mating type genes were present in equal proportion among the zzso zzso collection used in this study, leaving open the possibility of sexual zzso
