A zzso protein zzso consisting of the zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso fused via a zzso zzso sequence to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by expression of the corresponding zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso was confirmed by complete zzso of the zzso activity of zzso at zzso zzso excess of the zzso and by the resistance of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso prolonged the zzso time of normal human plasma in a zzso way zzso of the apparent zzso concentration to 50% with 95 zzso zzso protein as compared to zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of the apparent zzso concentration to 50% with 40 zzso zzso zzso The zzso had a specific activity on zzso films of 57,000 zzso as compared to zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein was only 220 zzso but increased to zzso zzso after treatment with zzso which resulted in quantitative conversion to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso efficiencies for zzso conversion to zzso molecules were comparable for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso potential of the zzso zzso was comparable to that of zzso the zzso efficiencies for zzso zzso by their zzso counterparts were also similar zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 2 zzso 50% zzso of zzso clots prepared from zzso human plasma and immersed in normal plasma was obtained with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso with corresponding residual zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso 50% zzso in 2 h in normal human plasma required zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso has maintained the specific zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso as well as its zzso potency in zzso whereas it displayed a similar or somewhat better zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
