In this paper, we report the identification of genes from pine zzso zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso a novel class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso is unrelated to other zzso zzso from plants and animals but similar to bacterial zzso zzso analysis indicates that this zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso suggesting it might have an zzso zzso Interestingly, most of the essential zzso involved in the interaction with the zzso and the attachment of zzso zzso zzso in the active site of the zzso were zzso in the deduced zzso The zzso is processed in zzso to a mature zzso of 45 zzso that is zzso distinct from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso previously characterized in zzso zzso expression of zzso sequences in zzso coli showed that the processed precursor is assembled into a zzso active zzso zzso that is strictly specific for zzso These zzso genes are predominantly expressed in green zzso of zzso zzso and rice, suggesting a key role of this zzso in nitrogen metabolism associated with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analyses revealed that the plant zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso This implies that two zzso zzso co-exist in zzso a zzso type previously characterized and the zzso type described zzso The respective roles of these two zzso in plant zzso acid metabolism are zzso
