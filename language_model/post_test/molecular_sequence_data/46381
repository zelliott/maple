zzso remains a leading cause of death worldwide among children because it suppresses immune zzso The zzso virus zzso P gene encodes three proteins zzso zzso and zzso that interfere with innate zzso controlling zzso zzso zzso and perhaps other key regulators of immune zzso We identified here three zzso in the shared domain of the P and V zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function to retain zzso in the zzso and inhibit zzso zzso This information was used to generate a zzso zzso virus unable to antagonize zzso function zzso zzso differing only in these three zzso from a zzso strain of zzso zzso This virus was used to assess the relevance of P and V interactions with zzso for zzso in zzso When a group of six zzso monkeys zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was short-lived, and the skin rash and other clinical signs observed with zzso zzso were zzso The zzso virus less efficiently controlled the inflammatory response, as measured by enhanced zzso of zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood zzso cells from infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses were equivalent in hosts infected with either zzso These findings indicate that efficient zzso interactions with zzso are required to sustain zzso in a natural host by controlling the inflammatory response against the zzso They also suggest that selectively zzso zzso may have utility as zzso for targeted zzso and zzso
