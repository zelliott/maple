We present here the analysis of the zzso organization of the zzso gene coding for zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it with the zzso human and zzso zzso Only two of the six zzso zzso gene zzso do not contain the zzso sequence and are in fact shorter than 100 zzso as most zzso zzso The other four zzso are somewhat longer and contain sequences zzso to zzso zzso two of these represent functional copies, as shown by zzso of zzso transcripts into zzso zzso whereas the other two appear to be zzso zzso Thus zzso turns out to be ideal for the study of zzso zzso zzso partly because of the reduced cloning and sequencing zzso and partly because the zzso length per zzso can be an indication of the presence of a zzso coding zzso
