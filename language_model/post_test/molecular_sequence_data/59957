We generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognizes an zzso shared by 50% of examined zzso zzso cell zzso lines and is susceptible to zzso by a zzso zzso clone derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso It did not stain normal kidney lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso lines but it did stain 2 of 4 tested breast cancer zzso Through screening of a zzso zzso zzso library using zzso we isolated a zzso clone which, upon sequencing, was found to be zzso b with 2 point zzso
