Recent progress in the field of zzso zzso has shown that a large array of closely related proteins is involved in each step of the signal zzso zzso Nine families of zzso zzso catalyze the synthesis of the second zzso zzso and protein zzso A, the zzso zzso of zzso are composed of four regulatory and three zzso zzso A comparable zzso has been discovered for the zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso 19 different genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso This is only an initial level of complexity, because each zzso gene contains several distinct zzso units that give rise to proteins with subtle structural differences, bringing the number of the zzso proteins close to zzso The molecular biology of zzso in zzso and zzso has shed some light on the role of zzso diversity in signaling and zzso However, much needs to be done to understand the exact function of these zzso particularly during zzso development and cell zzso With the identification and mapping of regulatory and targeting zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso structure is becoming an established zzso in the zzso zzso The use of different zzso units and zzso zzso of a single zzso gene generates proteins with different regulatory zzso joined to a common zzso domain, therefore expanding the array of zzso with subtle differences in properties and sensitivities to different zzso The zzso context in which these different zzso function is still largely unknown and undoubtedly will be a major area of expansion in the years to zzso
