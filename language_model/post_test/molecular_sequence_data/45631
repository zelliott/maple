The impaired zzso function hypothesis in schizophrenia is based on evidence of altered brain zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso zzso have their own zzso which is needed to zzso some of the zzso of the respiratory chain zzso zzso DNA zzso is zzso inherited and we observed an excess of maternal transmission of schizophrenia in a set of zzso affected zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso in the zzso may contribute to the complex genetic basis of zzso The entire zzso of six schizophrenic patients with an apparent maternal transmission of the disease was zzso and compared to the reference zzso We have identified 50 zzso and among these six have not been previously zzso Three of them were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These were zzso inherited because they were also present in the zzso of their respective schizophrenic mothers and none of them were found in 95 control zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso present in five of the six zzso patient pairs that triggers a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso of complex zzso zzso alignment of 110 zzso peptides from all zzso zzso shows that only zzso zzso acids are found in this zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso or zzso by an zzso in all zzso zzso This indicates that the presence of zzso could affect complex I activity in patients with zzso
