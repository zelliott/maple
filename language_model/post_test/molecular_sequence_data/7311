We report here the zzso zzso of transcripts corresponding to the zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso This is the first description of this process with zzso zzso although it has been reported to occur with human zzso delta virus zzso zzso occurs when the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are juxtaposed by the zzso zzso structure, and a zzso bond is formed between the two following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transcripts undergo zzso zzso and their subsequent zzso produces circular zzso The zzso observed in zzso may contribute to zzso zzso during rolling circle zzso however, this does not exclude the possibility that a host zzso zzso zzso the zzso steps in zzso Like zzso zzso is probably an ancestral reaction, and the zzso zzso most likely evolved from this primitive zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso transcripts derived from zzso is demonstrated, suggesting a possible mechanism for sequence zzso in zzso
