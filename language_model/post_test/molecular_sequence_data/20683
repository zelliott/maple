zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expression zzso also used as backbone for DNA vaccine zzso We have recently shown that zzso spontaneously zzso due to the presence of two zzso direct zzso The persistence of zzso zzso led us to evaluate the impact of environmental stresses typically found during zzso production on zzso copy number and zzso zzso We observed an increase in zzso amplification zzso in zzso coli cultures grown at 42 degrees C and also in minimal medium (at both 37 degrees C and 42 degrees zzso These conditions fit to the smallest ratio between zzso molecules and total zzso zzso increasing the dissolved oxygen tension from zzso to zzso in rich media did not have a significant impact on both zzso copy number and zzso frequency, independently of the temperature zzso We have also shown recently that the zzso resistance zzso gene of zzso becomes actively transcribed as a result of zzso between the zzso This prompted us to gain some insight into zzso adaptation and competition by evaluating the impact of distinct zzso of zzso on the differential selection of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso We found the zzso form to be predominantly recovered at lower zzso of zzso whilst higher zzso led to an increase in the percentage of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso form was invariably found at low zzso independently of the concentration zzso
