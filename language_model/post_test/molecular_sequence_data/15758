During zzso virus zzso assembly a major zzso zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso designated zzso is expressed as an early function and becomes an integral component of the zzso envelope surrounding the mature zzso In a previous study evaluating zzso immunity to zzso a prominent response against zzso was invariably detected in zzso zzso In the context of our continuing investigations of the structure and function of the zzso zzso with a view to zzso in zzso of this agent when used as a vaccine zzso for foreign zzso we carried out detailed mapping of the zzso zzso as well as determination of the zzso zzso Use of zzso translation, coupled with zzso located this gene within a zzso zzso zzso of the larger zzso zzso H zzso By means of zzso zzso resistance analysis a viral transcript was identified at the site of the zzso zzso where the occurrence of an open reading frame zzso corresponding to the transcript, was deduced from DNA sequence zzso However, the zzso encodes a zzso of only zzso Da predicted zzso which is much lower than the apparent zzso estimated from zzso gel zzso The size zzso is not due to zzso or zzso of zzso but may result from a zzso sequence which occurs in this zzso To confirm that the zzso recognized in this study does, indeed, zzso zzso the gene was expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso coli transformed with the relevant clones expressed a zzso of the appropriate molecular weight and zzso when tested by Western zzso Regarding secondary structure and zzso it can be predicted from the DNA sequence that zzso is highly zzso but contains a zzso region at the zzso zzso perhaps providing the stretch involved in membrane zzso Computer search of a bank of protein sequences revealed an unusually strong similarity of zzso between the zzso at zzso acid positions zzso and the G zzso of respiratory zzso virus at positions zzso
