The zzso protein zzso zzso controls the repair of zzso DNA breaks in zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso is targeted to DNA breaks by association with the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso association site is present at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso near the protein zzso zzso zzso the nuclear zzso zzso zzso that associates with zzso also binds to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain binds to zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso particularly zzso acids zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso provide opposing functions with regard to zzso zzso
