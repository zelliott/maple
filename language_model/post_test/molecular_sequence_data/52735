zzso was previously identified as one of the zzso zzso via a zzso zzso screening zzso In the present study, we cloned a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that human zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso Human zzso exhibited an zzso zzso acid sequence identity to rat zzso indicating the zzso zzso structure and function of zzso A database search for zzso zzso identified mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and each zzso protein contain a zzso domain in their zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso in adult human zzso with relatively higher levels in zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso a position overlapping the candidate tumor zzso locus for zzso zzso
