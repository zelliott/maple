To define the position of a zzso zzso from a patient with zzso a series of zzso cell hybrids carrying human zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso part of zzso 13 has been zzso zzso sites zzso have been generated from a series of zzso zzso previously shown to be in the zzso zzso Together with an zzso for the zzso zzso these have been used to define the relative positions of the zzso zzso in the zzso In this way, four markers have been ordered in three zzso of zzso and reference zzso zzso The refined physical map of zzso provides a series of reference markers with known locations and will be invaluable in the further characterization of zzso in this zzso
