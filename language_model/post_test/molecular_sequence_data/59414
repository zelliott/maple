zzso tumor cell lines have been shown to both produce zzso zzso and express the zzso zzso suggesting a potential zzso growth regulatory role for zzso We explored the role of zzso in the proliferation of the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso using zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted against zzso zzso sequences were prepared, and in zzso analyses were used to demonstrate that these molecules zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To test in zzso activity, these zzso were zzso into zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cultured cells with zzso zzso complexes resulted in a reduction of zzso protein levels in the zzso and reduced numbers of zzso cells 48 h after zzso However, similar results were also seen following treatment with control zzso zzso This reduction in zzso levels and cell numbers was a function of the zzso complexes and was not seen with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso the reductions in zzso levels and cell numbers observed were not due to zzso zzso of zzso zzso but rather reflected a zzso zzso toxic effect of the treatment with zzso zzso This effect can resemble functional zzso activity, complicating analysis of the activity of synthetic zzso after zzso into cultured zzso
