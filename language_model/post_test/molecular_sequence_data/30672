Three randomly derived sequences that can substitute for the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso were tested for the efficiency with which they can zzso zzso or zzso into the zzso zzso The rate of zzso as measured by zzso was estimated in zzso experiments to be less than 6 zzso When fused to zzso these zzso like the normal zzso signal zzso direct the hybrid protein to a zzso region, consistent with zzso to the zzso zzso The diversity of function of random peptides was studied further by zzso zzso of proteins fused to 28 random zzso 4 directed the hybrid to the zzso zzso 3 directed it to the zzso and 1 directed it to the zzso
