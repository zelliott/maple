The zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso has affinity for zzso charged zzso Isolation of cellular binding proteins will be a step to zzso its zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso was employed as affinity zzso for zzso zzso of extract from human zzso zzso with zzso M zzso or with zzso M zzso acid and 1 M zzso resulted primarily in zzso of a protein of molecular mass of about 12 zzso according to gel zzso analysis under zzso conditions in the presence or absence of reductive agent and zzso Da by laser zzso mass zzso The native molecular mass, assessed by gel zzso is approximately 28 zzso No evidence for zzso zzso modification by zzso was provided by treatment with zzso F or zzso and subsequent zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the major zzso protein is identical to that deduced from the zzso sequence of a human zzso migration zzso factor zzso starting from its third zzso acid, over the determined stretch of 22 zzso zzso zzso of the calculated molecular mass of zzso of this factor to the zzso determined value of zzso excludes any extensive modification of the zzso The zzso protein reduces zzso migration at a concentration of 100 zzso in zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor and zzso zzso protein reacted equally well with zzso zzso in zzso analysis and in zzso to block binding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso too, is nearly identical for the two protein zzso It is optimal in the range pH 7-9 and is markedly impaired by increasing zzso zzso Chemical modification with zzso zzso revealed that the integrity of zzso groups of the zzso protein and of zzso groups of zzso are primarily important to maintain binding zzso In addition to contribute to the understanding of the functional significance of zzso this result provides a convenient procedure to purify a zzso
