This study describes the identification and the structural and zzso analysis of a zzso protein zzso zzso implicated in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso resolution crystal structure of zzso is presented in the zzso state and reveals that the protein is composed of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain, with the zzso coordinated in the zzso zzso similar to other zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso confirms zzso binding and reveals the presence of a zzso zzso indicating binding of oxygen to the fully oxidized zzso These data provide the first structural insights into the zzso reactions that occur during zzso by zzso zzso
