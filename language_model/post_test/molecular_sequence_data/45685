zzso proteins regulate multiple zzso pathways by altering gene expression temporally and in a zzso zzso The zzso Rich zzso protein zzso is a zzso factor and an essential regulator of embryonic development and zzso Recent discoveries have implicated zzso as an important feature of zzso factor zzso Here, we show using a variety of techniques including zzso zzso zzso electron zzso and in zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso is zzso and we use in zzso zzso to confirm that this protein exists as zzso in zzso This is the first demonstration that a zzso protein can zzso in zzso zzso with these findings we show that a fraction of zzso and zzso zzso appears as discrete zzso within the nucleus and at the nuclear zzso The zzso domain of zzso is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and zzso repression and can make multiple zzso zzso We show that this region of zzso contains a novel zzso zzso domain that mediates zzso We propose a model that explains how zzso forms zzso and we discuss how these zzso might control zzso
