zzso factors such as zzso zzso control the zzso progression of malaria zzso during the complex life cycle in the human zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a potential target class for the development of novel zzso We zzso a compound library based upon a known specific inhibitor zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso Two compounds, zzso and its zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso in culture with zzso values of zzso zzso values at least zzso more potent than their apparent zzso toward two human cell lines and one mouse cell zzso These compounds zzso arrested zzso growth at all stages of the zzso life zzso zzso in zzso viability zzso was seen after a zzso incubation with 1 zzso zzso and resulted in complete zzso killing after a zzso zzso Additionally, mice with patent zzso zzso zzso strain infection treated with a single dose (40 zzso of zzso had zzso reduced zzso the following zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso in culture with zzso or zzso resulted in significant reductions in zzso zzso levels in a zzso and exposure zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso inhibit malaria zzso zzso zzso resulting in rapid and irreversible zzso zzso Our data position zzso zzso zzso as a previously zzso target class, and zzso as a promising lead compound, in a presently zzso avenue for zzso drug discovery targeting multiple zzso zzso
