zzso zzso may lead to the zzso of genes and zzso across species barriers and contribute to a zzso evolutionary pattern and thus zzso zzso Since several previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso has occurred among some species within zzso therefore it is possible that zzso zzso events also occur among Chinese zzso species and contribute to the current zzso zzso 

Data from four zzso zzso from 116 individuals, and one nuclear zzso from 119 individuals, provides the first evidence of frequent zzso events via historical and recent zzso zzso among six Chinese zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was completely replaced by zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the nuclear DNA sequence revealed a high proportion of zzso zzso containing zzso from two divergent zzso and that several zzso were shared among species, suggesting repeated and recent zzso Furthermore, results from the present analyses suggest that Chinese zzso belong to eight zzso 

This study provides a framework for understanding the patterns of zzso and the zzso of this zzso The existence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso resulting from frequent zzso events likely contribute to the current zzso confusion of Chinese zzso The present study also demonstrated that nuclear gene sequence could offer a powerful complementary data set with zzso in tracing a complete evolutionary history of recently zzso zzso
