By zzso human adult zzso zzso zzso with human adult and zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel human zzso gene zzso was zzso zzso expression was zzso higher in adult zzso than in fetal zzso zzso contains zzso base pairs zzso and a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein with zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was localized to human zzso zzso The deduced structure of the zzso protein contains one zzso domain, which was confirmed by zzso fusion protein expression in the zzso of the zzso human zzso zzso cells, suggesting that it is a zzso zzso Multiple tissue distribution indicated that zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso and zzso with little or no expression zzso Further analysis of abnormal expression in zzso male patients revealed complete absence of zzso in the zzso of patients with zzso syndrome and variable expression in patients with zzso zzso zzso gene expression in mouse zzso was confirmed in zzso cells by in zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction in mouse zzso of different stages indicated that zzso expression is zzso zzso These results suggest that the putative zzso protein may play an important role in zzso zzso and may be an important factor in male zzso
