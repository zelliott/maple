Eight zzso based upon regions of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were zzso against a background of their position within the zzso and their two-dimensional structure to zzso their use in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The 41 clinical zzso from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to confirm their zzso zzso of zzso zzso designated I zzso to I zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso with the zzso zzso suggested that these zzso lacked specificity or were constructed from zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso reliably detected both zzso Because of the high degree of zzso between the zzso zzso of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of zzso conditions for detection of both zzso Thus probe I zzso zzso zzso zzso while I zzso detected both zzso zzso and zzso zzso at low zzso However, under conditions of high stringency only zzso zzso was zzso by probe zzso These zzso were highly specific and did not zzso with DNA from the closely related zzso zzso nor other zzso pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several pigmented species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
