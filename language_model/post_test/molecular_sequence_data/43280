A gene zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been identified and termed zzso The gene has been zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso and zzso identify with a putative zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso coli cells expressing the zzso gene in two different zzso One was the direct measurement of zzso zzso activity in cell extracts and the other was the yellow color production of cells when the zzso gene was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes derived from zzso zzso
