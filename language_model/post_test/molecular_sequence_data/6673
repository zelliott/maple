Recent structural studies of the minimal core zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso to a single consensus zzso sequence and of the isolated zzso zzso domain have provided valuable insights into their functions, but many questions about their interacting roles and zzso remain zzso To better understand these zzso we have examined the binding of the zzso to two biologically important zzso elements (the zzso and zzso gene cluster zzso by using DNA zzso and zzso zzso We show that the zzso binds DNA strongly and zzso with zzso to DNA binding zzso of zzso For the zzso element, the mean apparent zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, and no intermediate species of lower zzso can be zzso We show further that complex formation zzso an zzso bend of at least 60 degrees in both response zzso These results, taken zzso demonstrate that zzso possesses the ability to direct the formation of a tight zzso complex having the same zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso which is accompanied by a substantial zzso change in the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso may play a role in the zzso function of zzso A possible role in this regard is zzso
