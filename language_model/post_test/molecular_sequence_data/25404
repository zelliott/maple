The expression of zzso zzso was investigated along the zzso axis of rat small zzso using zzso isolated cells and in zzso zzso A partial rat zzso zzso was cloned which coded for a protein that was predicted to be zzso zzso to those zzso by the rabbit and human zzso Southern zzso analysis of rat zzso DNA indicated that the zzso zzso to a single zzso Northern blots of zzso extracted from zzso of zzso zzso cells that were isolated from zzso and zzso compartments showed that this zzso zzso to a zzso zzso band predominantly in zzso zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso grains were detected over zzso cells located on zzso with the greatest number of grains located at the zzso junction and in the lower to zzso zzso from zzso to the zzso tip there was a decline in zzso zzso We conclude that expression of zzso as zzso emerge from zzso zzso is regulated primarily at the level of zzso zzso which, most zzso is a result of zzso of zzso gene zzso
