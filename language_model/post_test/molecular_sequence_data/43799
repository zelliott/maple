The structural organization of the zzso zzso gene zzso a folate zzso has been zzso The entire zzso sequence of the zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso and zzso regions and the coding sequence were found to be distributed in eight zzso including six primary zzso and zzso to zzso 1 and zzso 5, spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in an zzso cell zzso zzso The most common incorporates zzso 1 through 6, zzso a zzso zzso The two least common incorporate zzso 1 and 2, a truncated version of zzso 3 and zzso 4 through 6; or zzso 1 through 4, an alternate to zzso 5, and zzso 6, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso reported earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso by others incorporates what we have found to be an alternate of zzso 1 and zzso 2 through zzso A relatively zzso region of the zzso just zzso of zzso 1 as well as zzso zzso appears to be distinctly zzso and encodes a number of putative zzso zzso The findings pertaining to zzso of zzso 1 suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso results from two different zzso
