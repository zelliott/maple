To investigate zzso cell zzso we established a panel of zzso zzso that recognize zzso cell nuclear zzso One of these zzso zzso was used to purify a specific protein complex zzso from a human zzso This PC, which is present at high levels in peripheral blood zzso and zzso contains a protein that is the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso PC was shown to inhibit the activity of zzso zzso I and II but not zzso protein zzso protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso or insulin zzso zzso zzso The observed Ki values for zzso zzso I and II zzso from several sources were 1 zzso or zzso Furthermore, the addition of the zzso PC to a nuclear extract from human cells was able to prevent protein zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso The unique zzso character of the PC and its elevated levels in zzso and zzso and of the zzso zzso in zzso patients implies that this complex may be associated with zzso cell functions and perhaps with the cause or consequence of the clinical manifestations of zzso
