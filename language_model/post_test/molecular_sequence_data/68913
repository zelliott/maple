zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso results in varying degrees of zzso including zzso onset severe combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso later onset zzso We have determined the molecular basis of disease in a child from a zzso mating with zzso zzso of clinically and zzso reduced severity, diagnosed at 15 months of age and characterized by retention of more zzso function than is typical of the zzso zzso onset zzso The course was notable for an early predominance of bacterial infections and zzso In contrast to its absence in most zzso zzso residual zzso activity zzso of zzso could be detected in zzso B zzso zzso with the increased residual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the toxic zzso zzso were less than seen in zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a zzso zzso predicting a substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso zzso zzso The parents were zzso and the child was zzso for the zzso as shown by sequence analysis of amplified zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells revealed an zzso zzso more zzso charged zzso with zzso of normal zzso These observations are consistent with replacement of positively charged zzso by zzso the lower zzso of toxic zzso and the milder zzso By contrast, transient expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso onset zzso did not reveal zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which retain residual activity of zzso zzso should be dominant for zzso the zzso in patients carrying two different zzso zzso Identification of additional similar zzso may be significant in evaluating the goals for and efficacy of current trials of gene and gene product zzso
