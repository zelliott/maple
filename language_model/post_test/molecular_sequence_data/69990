Treatment of zzso and zzso primary human zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by two-dimensional gel analysis revealed three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso to zzso factor and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recorded in the zzso protein database zzso et zzso 1991, 1992) that are highly and specifically zzso by zzso among several agents tested including 14 other zzso second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compounds known to affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso calf zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for further studies as its level is affected by zzso transformation and because zzso sequences were available in the zzso zzso The zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso library using zzso zzso and expressed in zzso cells using the zzso virus expression zzso Database searches indicated that the predicted zzso which migrated with the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is novel although it exhibits weak similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso sequence found in many zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family and it is found at least partially in the culture zzso Considering the presence of zzso in zzso plaques as well as its putative involvement in the zzso of the disease it was of interest to determine whether the set of proteins was zzso in these zzso zzso gel analysis of the protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to reveal zzso of any of the three zzso proteins suggesting that the effect of zzso in zzso may be modulated by the activity of other zzso or growth zzso zzso zzso were equally sensitive to zzso as their normal zzso
