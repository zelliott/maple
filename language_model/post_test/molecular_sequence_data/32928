zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is resistant to zzso zzso while the zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso We have explored the zzso basis of this surprising zzso The sequences of these zzso are zzso identical and zzso zzso zzso of the crystal structure for the zzso coli protein and comparison to the previously solved zzso structure reveals that the two proteins have extremely similar zzso structures, and their global zzso determined by equilibrium zzso are also very zzso The zzso unfolding rate of zzso coli zzso is, however, zzso slower than that of the zzso zzso This surprisingly large difference in unfolding rates appears to arise from a divergence in the extent of zzso between the two structural zzso (the N and zzso that make up these zzso This is supported zzso zzso the zzso of zzso coli zzso cannot be expressed or fold independently of the zzso while both zzso of the zzso protein fold in isolation into stable structures and zzso the zzso and zzso of the zzso sensitive state of zzso coli zzso match those for global zzso This suggests that zzso occurs from the globally unfolded state of zzso coli zzso while the characteristics defining the zzso zzso suggest that zzso occurs upon unfolding of only the zzso with the zzso remaining folded and consequently resistant to zzso
