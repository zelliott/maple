Analysis of the activity and structure of lower zzso alcohol zzso reveals that relationships between the classical liver and zzso zzso need not be zzso Both the ethanol activity of class zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso activity of the class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in liver down to at least the stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol activity, zzso zzso of protein in one zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso in the major form of another zzso zzso analysis of the latter protein reveals it to be a typical class III zzso with limited variation from the zzso form and therefore with stable activity and structure throughout much of the zzso zzso In contrast, the classical alcohol zzso (the class I zzso appears to be the emerging form, first in activity and later also in zzso The class I activity is present already in the zzso line, whereas the overall zzso zzso is not observed until zzso and still more recent zzso zzso the class zzso zzso origin appears to have arisen from a functional class III form, not a class I zzso zzso ethanol zzso from organisms existing before this zzso have origins separate from those leading to the zzso liver alcohol zzso The latter now often occur in zzso forms from further gene zzso and have a high rate of evolutionary zzso The pattern is, however, not simple and we presently find in cod the first evidence for zzso also within a class III alcohol zzso Overall, the results indicate that both of these classes of zzso alcohol zzso are important and suggest a protective zzso function for the whole zzso zzso
