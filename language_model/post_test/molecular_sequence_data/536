The zzso zzso contains some important grain crops and economically important forage grasses as well as agricultural zzso The goals of this study were to zzso the zzso relationships between zzso species and ascertain the zzso status of the zzso weeds which provide bases for effective zzso of its germ resources on molecular breeding and improvement of crop qualities and thus provide important guidance for port zzso In the present study, total DNA from the seeds of 8 zzso species (four zzso zzso two zzso zzso one zzso silk and one zzso zzso zzso and the partial zzso gene of about 2,000 zzso in length were amplified by zzso using specific zzso designed from zzso regions of zzso gene reported in the zzso zzso and zzso Based on these sequences and other 24 zzso sequences registered in the zzso the zzso trees constructed by multiple methods zzso zzso and zzso with the corresponding zzso sequence of zzso zzso as the zzso shared almost the same zzso The results showed that: zzso there were obviously three lineages for the zzso zzso One included two zzso zzso and zzso and another included zzso zzso both of which consisted of zzso and zzso species with small zzso Still another lineage contained the two zzso zzso and zzso with zzso species and their zzso relatives with relatively large zzso zzso geographical divergence clearly existed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso clustered together, but zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the same zzso clustered with the species of zzso zzso showing closer relationship with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more closely related to zzso zzso than the other species of the zzso zzso
