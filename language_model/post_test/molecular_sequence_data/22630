In previous studies examining the structural zzso of zzso and zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso in zzso segment 1 zzso of human zzso as a major zzso of binding for several antagonists, including zzso zzso zzso Here we described a separate site in zzso zzso zzso that impacts zzso recognition when switched to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displays a marked loss of inhibitor potency for multiple zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso cocaine, zzso zzso and zzso whereas recognition of zzso including zzso and zzso is zzso zzso for zzso interactions is evident with this substitution because the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso cocaine analog recognition was verified in zzso labeling studies using zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso other zzso at this position significantly affected zzso recognition and/or transport zzso Additionally, the mouse zzso zzso zzso exhibits similar selective changes in inhibitor zzso Unlike zzso or zzso analogous zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso or human zzso zzso zzso result in zzso that bind zzso but are deficient in the subsequent zzso of the zzso A double zzso zzso zzso had a synergistic impact on zzso recognition ( approximately zzso decrease in zzso zzso in the context of normal zzso zzso The less active zzso zzso responded to the zzso substitution like zzso but was relatively insensitive to the zzso substitution and did not display a synergistic loss at zzso An zzso zzso with single zzso zzso in zzso and zzso resulted in formation of a high affinity cadmium metal coordination site, suggesting proximity of these zzso in the zzso structure of zzso These studies provided evidence for distinct binding sites zzso zzso zzso and revealed a close interaction between zzso and zzso zzso targeted by zzso of zzso
