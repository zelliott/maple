zzso efforts to decipher the origin of disease at the molecular level stimulate the emergence of more efficient zzso zzso To complement this, attempts are being made to identify new zzso zzso for building more reliable zzso zzso As zzso research gathers pace an immediate interest becomes focused on platforms, which although based on mainstream approaches, are more amenable to specialist zzso Particularly relevant this is for zzso zzso which are present at very low zzso in zzso biological zzso and require depletion protocols enabling their separation from zzso zzso In this report, we describe a new strategy allowing the rapid detection of target protein zzso by zzso mass zzso The approach relies on selective zzso of target proteins from complex media by engineered zzso which select proteins by their size zzso zzso and zzso points zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are subjected to direct zzso analysis without the need for preceding protein zzso zzso by a natural zzso zzso zzso the monitoring of zzso zzso zzso systems by the approach is also zzso The described strategy offers a general rationale for versatile platforms for high zzso zzso and holds promise for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
