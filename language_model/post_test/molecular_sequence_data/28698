A minor class of zzso zzso whose zzso requires a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been identified in plants, insects, and zzso We have characterized single zzso that specify the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso P zzso disruptions of the zzso and zzso genes cause zzso during the third zzso zzso and embryonic zzso respectively, and are rescued by zzso and zzso zzso The P element disruption of zzso results in zzso defects of zzso zzso from several transcripts including an alternative zzso spliced zzso of zzso a zzso protein required for zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate the requirement for the zzso zzso in the development of a zzso zzso
