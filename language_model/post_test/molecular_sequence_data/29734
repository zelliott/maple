zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso attachment of zzso is zzso represented in living zzso Indeed, the zzso is a zzso modification that allows the transformation of inactive zzso zzso which are committed in fundamental zzso such as fatty acid zzso into their active zzso zzso Among other living organisms, plants present a zzso complex zzso In zzso zzso activity has been detected in three zzso compartments and the systematic sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed the occurrence of two zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso gene product had been previously characterized at molecular and zzso zzso Here, by zzso amplification, we cloned an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed the occurrence of multiple zzso forms which resulted from the alternative zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, we evidenced a zzso zzso at the zzso gene within the zzso zzso which affected zzso of zzso zzso This contrasted sharply with the situation at zzso zzso However, this zzso had no apparent effect on total zzso activity in zzso Finally, zzso zzso were found zzso less abundant than zzso zzso and the most abundant zzso zzso spliced zzso should code for a truncated zzso We discuss the possible role of such a zzso of putative zzso proteins in plants and discuss the involvement of each of zzso genes in the correct realization of zzso
