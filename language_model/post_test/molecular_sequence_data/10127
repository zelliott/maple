The zzso of T and B cell zzso on a well characterized zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso from a total of 52 zzso patients with the generalized form of zzso A proportion of the zzso samples proliferated in response to zzso zzso fusion protein and to fusion free zzso zzso responses of patient zzso to seven truncated zzso zzso and to three synthetic peptides revealed at least one major and two minor T cell zzso in the zzso The dominant T cell stimulating domain was localized between zzso acids 113 and zzso zzso studies with the zzso fusion protein revealed that patient zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso response with 10 truncated zzso zzso identified four B cell stimulating zzso in the zzso central, and zzso region of the zzso The B cell domain recognized by the majority of zzso was localized between zzso acids 113 and zzso The data indicate that this region of the protein is the major T and B cell stimulating domain of zzso and might be relevant for vaccine development and for improved zzso of zzso
