zzso regions required for zzso and zzso zzso synthesis have been mapped for several zzso zzso zzso In general, the two types of promoters do not share structural features even though they are recognized by the same viral zzso The zzso promoter of zzso mosaic virus zzso a plant virus of the family zzso consists of a zzso hairpin zzso which is attached to a 3' zzso structure zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso promoter consists of a single zzso hairpin that bears no sequence zzso with zzso Here we show that zzso when detached from its zzso can function as a zzso promoter in zzso and can replace the authentic zzso promoter in the live zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and zzso promoters are basically the same, but the zzso promoter is linked to a 3' zzso to force the zzso to initiate at the very zzso
