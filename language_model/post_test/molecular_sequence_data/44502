A zzso DNA containing a zzso zzso zzso gene with zzso promoter and zzso elements was used as a model system to study the events triggered by a single zzso DNA zzso in adult zzso zzso A single zzso zzso was followed in a week by zzso of zzso zzso and production of zzso M zzso zzso Their zzso of serum appearance were almost zzso While zzso zzso remained zzso for over 6 months, zzso zzso disappeared after zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was detected in the zzso for 4 zzso A multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso analysis on zzso zzso DNA 17 days after zzso demonstrated that the zzso was integrated in the host zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the rearranged zzso region from zzso zzso DNA was identical to that of the parental zzso DNA, hence ruling out that zzso had zzso A booster injection of zzso zzso by the zzso on day 200 zzso a typical secondary immune response with zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that a single zzso of an zzso zzso DNA targeted to zzso zzso leads to spontaneous integration of the zzso into the host DNA, and that this is sufficient to initiate immunity and establish zzso zzso Our data also show that minute amounts zzso zzso of an zzso produced protein zzso in the zzso of a zzso tissue generate immunity and establish zzso memory rather than zzso
