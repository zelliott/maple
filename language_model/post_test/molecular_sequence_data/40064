The distributed zzso hypothesis zzso states that each strain within a bacterial species receives a unique distribution of genes from a zzso zzso that is many times larger than the zzso of any given zzso The observations that natural infecting populations are often zzso and that most chronic bacterial pathogens have highly developed mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer suggested the zzso and provided the means and the mechanisms to explain how chronic infections persist in the face of a zzso zzso zzso defense zzso Having previously established the zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso we wished to evaluate its zzso to an opportunistic bacterial zzso This was accomplished by construction and analysis of a highly redundant pooled zzso library containing approximately zzso functional clones that was constructed from 12 zzso clinical zzso of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso and 6 from other body zzso zzso analysis of zzso randomly picked clones zzso insert size, approximately zzso zzso from this library demonstrated that 348 zzso of the clones were unique with respect to all zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso translations of the open reading frames within these unique sequences demonstrated protein zzso to a number of bacterial zzso factors and other proteins not previously identified in zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso were performed to analyze the distribution and expression patterns of a zzso reading frame subset of these sequences among 11 of the clinical zzso These sequences were zzso distributed among the clinical zzso with nearly half zzso of the novel sequences being present in only one or two of the individual zzso zzso profiling revealed that a vast majority of these sequences are zzso strongly suggesting they zzso functional zzso
