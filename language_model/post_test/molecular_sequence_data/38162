zzso and zzso are zzso zzso hormones that play an integral role in the zzso regulation of zzso The domestic zzso with its zzso zzso zzso provides a unique model in which to study the role of these hormones in zzso zzso In the present study, the complete coding sequence and deduced zzso acid sequence for the chicken zzso zzso zzso has been determined from zzso clones isolated from a chicken zzso zzso cell zzso This zzso zzso predicts a precursor protein of zzso zzso acids containing the mature zzso 115 zzso acid zzso zzso When compared to the zzso zzso isolated from a variety of species, the chicken zzso clone showed high zzso identity in the full-length coding region zzso and in the mature coding region zzso In addition, the deduced zzso acid sequence of chicken zzso zzso showed greater than zzso identity compared to other species in the mature zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction in both zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis detected expression in the zzso zzso only, specifically in the zzso tissue from the zzso zzso small yellow zzso zzso large white zzso and immature and mature zzso zzso A major transcript of approximately zzso zzso zzso and three minor transcripts of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso To examine the expression pattern of the zzso zzso around the stage of zzso selection, the zzso zzso was subdivided into two groups: zzso zzso and 9-12 zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso 3) showed that expression of the zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso B, as well as other zzso signals, may regulate early zzso selection and/or development in the zzso
