By using differential zzso display to monitor the molecular zzso associated with adaptation of zzso eels to different zzso we identified a zzso zzso strongly induced in seawater zzso zzso Cloning of a full-length zzso and its expression in zzso cells indicated that the clone codes for an inward zzso zzso channel zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso which has two zzso segments and a typical zzso region zzso Only low sequence similarities are present, except the zzso region, compared with other members of the inward zzso zzso channel family zzso zzso with this divergence in the zzso acid zzso a zzso analysis indicated early divergence and independent evolution of zzso from other members; it is only zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protection analysis showed that zzso is highly expressed in the seawater zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but very zzso in freshwater zzso zzso of zzso sections revealed dense zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is mainly present in the zzso system in the zzso zzso This location and its zzso nature suggest that the zzso channel cloned here is a novel member of the zzso zzso of the zzso family and is implicated in zzso
