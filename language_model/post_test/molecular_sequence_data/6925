We have already shown that in species with highly zzso major zzso complex zzso class I molecules zzso zzso no functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso machinery of the class I zzso zzso Syrian zzso using mouse zzso class I expression via zzso zzso viruses zzso we found that six zzso cell lines fall into two zzso zzso four cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso in expressing four different zzso class I molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and the appropriate zzso zzso recognized by mouse zzso zzso T zzso cells on the cell zzso Two cell lines zzso and zzso expressed zzso and zzso in association with zzso peptides as recognized by zzso zzso zzso cells but not zzso and zzso However, zzso was expressed on the cell surface, as shown by zzso cell zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso is only zzso in these two cell lines when zzso with two zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso rendered both cell lines, after infection with either zzso and zzso susceptible to zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus Syrian zzso cell lines express functionally zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene from zzso cells was cloned and zzso comparison with human, zzso and rat zzso sequences show zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
