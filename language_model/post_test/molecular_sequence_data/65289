zzso of the zzso zzso form part of the resident oral zzso in children and zzso They are recognized as opportunistic pathogens of various zzso zzso The significance of individual species in zzso and zzso diseases is zzso due to the inability of conventional zzso tests to identify clinical zzso to species zzso zzso at a clear distinction between species, we undertook a zzso study of a collection of 102 zzso strains including 62 oral zzso from children and 40 reference strains from oral and zzso infections representing the five known, human, oral zzso zzso The zzso was estimated on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso and by partial zzso zzso gene sequencing, and was compared to zzso zzso The zzso profiles in the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and allowed identification of zzso to species level, based on zzso with reference zzso The study confirmed zzso zzso and zzso zzso as separate species, and zzso the problems of distinguishing between them by conventional zzso zzso The presence of two distinct clusters of oral zzso from children indicated the existence of novel species, supported by analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences and by zzso zzso zzso One cluster of zzso zzso zzso without the ability to zzso zzso is proposed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso Another cluster not zzso distinguishable from zzso zzso and zzso zzso is designated zzso zzso zzso zzso by strain zzso zzso zzso
