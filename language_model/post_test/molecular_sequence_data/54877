The zzso zzso to zzso zzso protein of zzso coli is a folding zzso with a zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain of the zzso binding protein zzso Here we investigated how the two zzso and their interplay are zzso for function in protein zzso zzso protein molecules initially form a highly dynamic complex with the zzso domain of zzso and they are then transferred to the zzso zzso zzso The turnover number of the zzso zzso site is very high and guarantees that, after transfer, zzso zzso bonds in zzso proteins are zzso very zzso The zzso constant of zzso folding reflects the zzso affinity of the zzso domain, and the turnover number is presumably determined by the rate of productive zzso transfer from the zzso to the zzso zzso site and by the intrinsic propensity of the zzso protein chain to leave the active site with the native zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso transfer is high because zzso from the zzso site is very fast and because the two sites are close to each zzso zzso molecules that left the zzso zzso site with an incorrect zzso zzso can rapidly be zzso by the zzso domain because the association rate is very high as zzso
