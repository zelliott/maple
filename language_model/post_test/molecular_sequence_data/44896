The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined in zzso solution by two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic zzso In addition to the zzso distance constraints from nuclear zzso effect zzso we added zzso distance constraints derived from the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso to the 19 zzso close to the zzso zzso center, where zzso disappeared due to zzso zzso The atomic zzso difference of the ten zzso structures from the mean structure was zzso A for backbone atoms zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure was almost the same as the crystal structures of other zzso zzso but comparison of the zzso structures revealed an extension of the zzso core, a unique zzso patch on the surface of the large zzso and two unique charge networks in this zzso zzso structure, some of which might contribute to zzso
