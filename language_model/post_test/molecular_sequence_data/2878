The putative zzso domain of human zzso type 2 zzso was revealed to contain a bent DNA structure in the upstream zzso By using zzso zzso this unusual structure was identified zzso to span from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso numbers from the left terminal zzso of the viral zzso This region has almost the same zzso sequence as the upstream half of the zzso and packaging region of zzso and, therefore, is thought to contain multiple zzso elements for zzso and the elements required for packaging of zzso zzso The bent DNA structure of this region was further characterized by analyzing zzso changes in zzso mobility of the DNA fragments used for zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a good system to investigate the relationship between higher order structure of DNA and zzso zzso
