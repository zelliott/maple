We analyzed mouse zzso cells using differential display to discover new genes that respond to the environmental contaminant zzso zzso We identified a class I major zzso complex zzso zzso which we designated as zzso zzso whose expression decreases in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso requires both the aromatic hydrocarbon zzso and the aromatic hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso factors that zzso other genes in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso appears to involve both zzso and zzso regulatory zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is probably a secondary response to zzso Our findings reveal new zzso aspects of gene regulation by zzso In addition, our observations suggest a mechanism that might account for some of zzso zzso zzso
