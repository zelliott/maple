Opiates zzso many zzso zzso zzso the resident zzso of the brain, migrate to sites of inflammation within the zzso Using primer sets designed to span the entire open reading frame of the human brain zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso cells zzso expressed zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso open reading frame in zzso were identical to those of human brain zzso Using enriched human fetal zzso cell cultures, we found that zzso zzso inhibited the directed migration zzso of zzso cells toward zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso value of 1 fM zzso We also found that zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso with an zzso value of 1 zzso which was significantly attenuated by 10 zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and support the notion of an zzso role of zzso within the zzso
