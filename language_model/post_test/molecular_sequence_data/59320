zzso species, representing widespread zzso insect zzso are resistant to zzso zzso zzso used thus far as zzso in transgenic zzso Here we describe the chemical synthesis of a zzso gene by a novel template directed zzso zzso This simple and economical method to construct large synthetic genes can be used when routine zzso of genes is zzso zzso zzso adjacent zzso of the gene to be zzso are assembled and zzso on a zzso partially zzso template derived from a zzso gene zzso in our zzso by a zzso zzso DNA zzso using repeated cycles of melting, zzso and zzso The resulting synthetic DNA strands are selectively amplified by zzso with short specific zzso zzso that are complementary only to the new synthetic zzso zzso expression of the synthetic zzso gene in alfalfa and tobacco results in the production of zzso of total soluble proteins as zzso toxin and provides protection against the Egyptian cotton zzso zzso zzso and the beet zzso zzso zzso To facilitate selection and breeding of zzso plants, the zzso gene was linked to a pat zzso zzso resistance to the zzso zzso
