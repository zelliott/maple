A zzso expression system was developed to zzso sequence zzso involved in zzso of proteins in zzso By expressing zzso sequences corresponding to known zzso sites within a zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso modified zzso zzso were found to have an important influence on zzso The expression system was used to screen zzso sequences selected using a neural network zzso trained on zzso zzso Evidence of zzso was obtained for eight of 11 proteins zzso The results suggest that sites involved in zzso of zzso and zzso proteins share similar structural zzso
