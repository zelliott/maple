DNA zzso cloning zzso method was invented by Kevin zzso zzso and colleagues to create DNA zzso at the ends of zzso chain reaction zzso zzso To increase the zzso products of zzso and make it possible to join the zzso products together to yield a larger DNA zzso without amplification by using the secondary zzso we modified the original method by lengthening zzso hybrids to 8 zzso using zzso H to digest zzso zzso and so zzso We found that the zzso of zzso fragments with DNA zzso could be improved significantly by using the modified zzso The zzso products of the modified zzso were rich enough to be separated by using zzso gel and joined together to yield a larger DNA zzso without amplification by using the secondary zzso The modified zzso is simpler and much more effective than the original zzso The creation of DNA zzso by using complementary DNA zzso T4 zzso and zzso H is simpler and cheaper than that by using reverse zzso and zzso zzso
