Members of the zzso family of proteins are key regulators of programmed cell death, acting either as zzso zzso or zzso Here we describe the solution structure of zzso presenting the structure of a zzso zzso family zzso An analysis of zzso of zzso family members allows us to define a structural zzso which has implications for general mechanisms for regulating zzso zzso It appears two criteria must be met for zzso function within the zzso family: targeting of molecules to zzso zzso and exposure of the zzso death zzso zzso activity is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso event, exposing the zzso domain and significantly changing the surface charge and zzso resulting in a change of cellular zzso
