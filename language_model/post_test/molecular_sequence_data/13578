Following DNA damage or a block to DNA zzso checkpoint pathways act to arrest zzso and prevent the attempted segregation of damaged or zzso zzso The zzso locus of zzso zzso is one of seven known zzso zzso zzso which are absolutely required to prevent zzso following DNA damage in zzso zzso Six of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also required for the checkpoint which prevents zzso from occurring before DNA replication is zzso We report here that the predicted zzso gene product is a basic zzso protein of 606 zzso acids which contains five zzso with sequence zzso to replication factor C zzso 1 zzso Western analysis and fusion with Green Fluorescent zzso indicate that the abundance and zzso mobility of zzso is not significantly modified following a block to DNA synthesis or following DNA damage, and that zzso is localized in the zzso zzso function is not essential for growth, but is required for the function of the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to demonstrate the biological significance of the zzso zzso zzso These studies have also defined an element of the radiation sensitivity caused by loss of zzso function which is not associated with the zzso zzso arrest zzso seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
