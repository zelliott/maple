zzso zzso of the zzso family (also known as zzso are zzso zzso involved in important zzso processes in zzso We report the characterization of the zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes the first essential zzso zzso identified in this zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso zzso abnormal zzso and embryonic zzso indicating that zzso is required for formation of the zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in the zzso cells, which are responsible for zzso zzso We have investigated the zzso function through zzso zzso While complete zzso can be obtained only by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso lethal zzso also can be caused by dominant zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso carry zzso in the uniquely essential collagen gene zzso which we show is the same gene as zzso Most zzso exhibit the unusual property of exclusively dominant suppression and all affect the sequence of the zzso collagen C zzso This suggests that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso processing of collagen zzso and is therefore a structural and functional zzso of zzso zzso The results also demonstrate the critical importance of the collagen zzso zzso which is highly zzso among all 49 members of the zzso zzso
