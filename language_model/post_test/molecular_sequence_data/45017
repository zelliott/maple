The zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso translation initiation factors were expressed and zzso in order to investigate their binding properties and zzso zzso zzso on zzso showed that bound zzso zzso zzso was zzso with crude zzso zzso Further column studies with zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso bound zzso zzso data zzso zzso and zzso in zzso in cap zzso When zzso or zzso were changed to zzso zzso lost the ability to form a complex with both zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso site is located in or near the zzso pocket on zzso zzso zzso for the interactions with zzso of zzso and capped zzso zzso were determined using surface zzso resonance zzso The zzso values showed that the binging affinity of zzso for zzso is stronger than that of capped zzso This suggests that viral zzso can interfere with formation of a zzso initiation complex on host plant cellular zzso by zzso zzso Further experiments with affinity zzso showed that zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso and zzso Thus, zzso may participate in viral zzso initiation by functioning as an alternative zzso zzso
