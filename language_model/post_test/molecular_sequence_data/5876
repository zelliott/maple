zzso zzso of cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso snail cell line resulted in increased or new expression of metabolically labeled zzso of approximately zzso 41, 70, and 74 zzso molecular zzso zzso of this response appeared to be at the zzso level since a similar protein zzso pattern was seen upon zzso analysis of zzso produced by in zzso translation of total zzso from cells subjected to heat zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso probe to screen a zzso library from heat-treated zzso cells, we isolated a full-length zzso clone zzso a putative zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso in length and contained an open reading frame of 1908 zzso zzso a zzso zzso with calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso region of 209 zzso acid zzso revealed zzso zzso identity between the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso the human blood fluke zzso zzso (for which zzso zzso serves as intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso and the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the extensive sharing of sequence zzso the identification of several zzso zzso signature sequences and an zzso zzso site characteristic of zzso zzso strongly support the identity of the zzso zzso as zzso an authentic zzso zzso of a Northern zzso analysis, using zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that gene expression was heat zzso and not zzso zzso This is the first reported sequence of an zzso zzso from cells originating from a freshwater zzso and provides a first step in the development of a genetic transformation system for zzso of medical zzso
