The zzso zzso zzso protein is a zzso protein zzso that controls the commitment of this zzso to zzso in response to zzso deprivation and several other zzso Prior studies indicated that the zzso zzso domain zzso plays a critical role in the zzso activity of this zzso as demonstrated by the significant decrease of the zzso rate of a zzso protein lacking this zzso On the basis of the environmental sensing role played by zzso zzso in a wide range of zzso including other bacterial sensor zzso it has been suggested that the zzso domain plays an important regulatory role in zzso zzso We have investigated this potential by using a combination of zzso and zzso methods to examine zzso structure and function, both in isolation and within the intact zzso Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain, showing that it zzso as a zzso using zzso packing interactions as observed for several other zzso domain zzso zzso we observed two zzso with zzso and zzso structure differences in the zzso zzso indicating significant structural flexibility in these zzso To confirm that zzso zzso also forms zzso in solution, we used a combination of zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso the results of which are all consistent with the zzso zzso We zzso tested the importance of several zzso at the zzso interface using zzso zzso finding changes in the zzso domain that significantly alter zzso zzso activity in zzso and in zzso These results support the importance of zzso zzso within zzso and other zzso zzso and suggest possible routes for natural or artificial regulation of zzso zzso
