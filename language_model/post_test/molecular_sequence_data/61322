zzso zzso FISH is a new zzso in zzso zzso zzso method using zzso zzso acid zzso zzso for differentiation between species of the zzso tuberculosis complex zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cultures is zzso The test is based on zzso zzso zzso that target the zzso of zzso or zzso species applied to zzso of zzso cultures for microscopic zzso Parallel testing with the two zzso serves as an internal control for each sample such that a valid test result is based on one positive and one negative zzso zzso zzso FISH was evaluated with 30 zzso cultures from Denmark and 42 zzso cultures from zzso The zzso zzso probe showed diagnostic sensitivities of 84 and zzso respectively, and a diagnostic specificity of zzso in both studies, whereas the zzso zzso probe showed diagnostic sensitivities of 91 and zzso respectively, and a diagnostic specificity of zzso in both zzso The low sensitivity of the zzso zzso probe in the Thai study was due to a relatively high prevalence of zzso zzso which is not identified by the zzso In total, 63 zzso of the cultures were correctly identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 17), whereas the remaining 9 were negative with both zzso and thus the results were zzso None of the samples were incorrectly identified as zzso or zzso thus, the zzso value of a valid test result obtained with zzso zzso FISH was zzso
