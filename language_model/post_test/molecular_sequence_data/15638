zzso is a well-known regulator of zzso and zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso regulated zzso in zzso zzso However, the mechanisms of its action are not fully zzso In the course of our study of zzso knockout mice, we identified a novel zzso zzso of zzso which we designate zzso while zzso the previously identified zzso zzso zzso which lacks the first zzso domain A in the zzso but has the second zzso domain B of zzso possesses zzso activity towards zzso as was found for zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso introduced zzso into zzso zzso cells was localized near the plasma zzso while zzso was found primarily in the zzso Interestingly, zzso domain A alone introduced into zzso cells was also localized near the plasma zzso In zzso cells, zzso was involved in triggering hormone zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso plus 1 zzso zzso but zzso was zzso The addition of a zzso signal to the zzso of zzso was able to mimic the effect of zzso on hormone zzso Thus, the present study indicates that the zzso zzso domain A of zzso plays a critical role in determining its zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
