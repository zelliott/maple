Four rat zzso cell lines were found to express only the rat insulin I zzso although an apparently normal insulin II gene was present in each cell zzso This finding was reflected by the absence of insulin II and the presence of insulin I gene transcripts in the products of zzso zzso zzso the absence of insulin II and the presence of insulin I zzso zzso zzso and the absence of mature insulin II and the presence of insulin I zzso Analysis of insulin II genes in cell lines by gene amplification indicated that the lack of insulin II gene zzso is not explained by the absence of or gross zzso in the insulin II genes per zzso These studies indicate that the two zzso insulin genes do not function zzso in zzso zzso
