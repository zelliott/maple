The zzso gene coding for an zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli has been cloned by the zzso chain zzso This gene is located at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso The complete open reading frame contains zzso zzso coding for the processed protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso Construction and expression of the zzso zzso which contained the zzso gene under the control of the zzso promoter, resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso activity above the level detected in zzso coli cells containing the control zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso zzso were determined to be 50 zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and 16 zzso for the zzso zzso Analysis of the kinetic data revealed that the reaction zzso by this zzso proceeds via a zzso zzso The observed zzso between the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso sequences suggests that they have evolved from distinct ancestral zzso zzso analysis also suggests that the zzso part of the zzso coli zzso contains the zzso domain whereas the zzso domain is located in the zzso region of the zzso
