A new zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso which was isolated from zzso Basin, zzso The full-length gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes 465 zzso acids including 38 zzso of a putative signal zzso The overall zzso acid sequence shares the highest identity zzso with a putative zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family zzso The gene zzso zzso the mature zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso and subsequently zzso The optimal pH and temperature for the zzso zzso were zzso and 60 degrees C, zzso The zzso showed broad temperature zzso retaining more than zzso of the maximum activity when zzso at zzso degrees zzso The zzso also had good zzso and pH zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso products of zzso were mainly zzso and zzso These favorable properties should make zzso a good candidate in various industrial zzso
