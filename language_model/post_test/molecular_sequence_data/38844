We sought to determine if zzso expression is regulated at the zzso level in cultured lung zzso zzso We also sought to determine if differences in zzso expression by cultured human lung zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso were attributable to zzso regulatory zzso zzso was expressed by zzso diverse lung zzso cell lines as well as zzso small airway zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Using gel mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso protein that selectively bound to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is found in the zzso but not nuclear extracts of zzso lung zzso zzso zzso it is found in the nuclear but not zzso extracts of selected zzso zzso cells that express relatively large amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso protein binding sequence zzso otherwise stable zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso gene expression in lung zzso and lung zzso cells is regulated at the zzso zzso The mechanism involves an interaction between a zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso region with a newly recognized zzso zzso protein to regulate zzso zzso zzso
