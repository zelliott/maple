zzso is regulated through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by large protein zzso zzso and zzso interaction has been shown to be zzso by specific zzso zzso called zzso and zzso Here we provide evidence for a similar function of two additional zzso within the zzso zzso complex, containing the zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed deletion and substitution zzso within zzso and zzso an interacting protein within zzso and have identified zzso recognition functions within the zzso domain of zzso and regions of the zzso zzso domain of zzso that are distinct from zzso function zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso recognition by zzso involves multiple zzso zzso and zzso beyond those that have been previously zzso
