The zzso basin was the cradle of some of the major complex societies of pre-Columbian South America and is today home to three surviving native zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study seeks to contribute to reconstructing the population zzso of the region, by providing a first genetic profile of its zzso set also into the wider context of South American genetic zzso 

We report the first zzso DNA first zzso segment sequences of native populations of the environs of Lake zzso speakers of zzso and zzso and the zzso of the Lake's floating zzso We sampled zzso speakers from a locality where the zzso language was formerly zzso to check for possible language shift zzso These data are compared with those for other zzso zzso collated from already published zzso 

Our results uncover the genetic distinctiveness of our formerly zzso but now zzso sample, in contrast with a relative zzso for all the other Central Andean zzso 

The genetic affinities that characterize Central Andean populations are highly consistent with the succession of expansive zzso in the region, culminating with the zzso In the environs of Lake zzso however, one subset of the present day zzso population exhibits a peculiar zzso perhaps a genetic correlate to their original zzso linguistic lineage (now extinct in the zzso tallying with zzso claims for the distinctiveness of the zzso zzso Our results emphasize the need for genetic descriptions to consider the widespread phenomenon of language zzso
