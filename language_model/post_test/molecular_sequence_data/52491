zzso and zzso zzso were prepared from the corresponding zzso zzso using zzso at the zzso zzso followed by zzso and mild zzso The blocking reaction was performed using a zzso zzso system at alkaline zzso in which the zzso occurred predominantly at the zzso zzso Through the zzso zzso and zzso were obtained with higher yields from the corresponding zzso zzso than through the previous method using zzso zzso as a blocking group or of direct zzso of it on zzso containing starting zzso and other zzso Chemical structures of the zzso and the synthetic zzso were confirmed by the zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and negative fast atom zzso zzso
