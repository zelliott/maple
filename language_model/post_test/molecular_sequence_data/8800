The zzso zzso box sequence of zzso class II promoters is zzso to zzso zzso and is required for B cell expression and zzso induction of zzso class II zzso The zzso binding protein zzso was initially identified as a zzso activity that specifically interacts with the zzso zzso box sequence in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To begin to demonstrate that zzso is the zzso box factor responsible for class II expression in B cells, we have zzso zzso to zzso from B cell nuclear extracts using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso is most likely composed of two zzso of 120 zzso and 46 zzso The zzso protein was specifically zzso to an zzso probe by exposure to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso in Western analysis and zzso zzso indicating that it may be a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso a factor that binds to the adjacent zzso box and is absent in some cell lines that are zzso for zzso class II zzso This interaction increases the zzso zzso of zzso from 5 to at least 60 zzso suggesting that zzso functions in class II zzso gene expression by forming a stable complex with zzso
