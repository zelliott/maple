zzso zzso that restored activity to severe zzso zzso zzso were zzso This was accomplished by using a zzso zzso zzso containing a fusion of the zzso zzso coli zzso promoters with the structural gene for zzso zzso zzso so that a system was provided for selecting zzso zzso (or zzso that zzso resistance of zzso cells to zzso Among the zzso changes that relieved defects in zzso zzso zzso the only one that restored zzso activity was a zzso substitution at position zzso a zzso zzso site in zzso coli zzso Three other sequence changes, zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso activated nascent promoters in the zzso regulatory zzso The nascent promoters zzso to the consensus rule, that activity is gained by sequence changes toward zzso with consensus sequences at the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso However, the relative activities of some promoters cannot be explained solely by consideration of their zzso sequence zzso
