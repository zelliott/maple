The zzso that cause zzso zzso fever and zzso disease are closely related human zzso yet they differ significantly in their ecology and zzso Genome sequencing of two species of zzso fever zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified a zzso open reading frame, designated zzso not present in the zzso disease zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which are involved with stress responses and zzso in other zzso zzso zzso produced an active zzso zzso that was recognized by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed in zzso at all growth temperatures and zzso levels were slightly elevated at higher zzso These results correlated with the synthesis of zzso during zzso zzso infection in zzso With the exception of zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein and zzso activity were found in all zzso fever zzso but not in zzso disease or related zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso increased the zzso resistance to both zzso stress and killing by human zzso zzso we propose that zzso encodes a unique and functional zzso zzso in zzso fever zzso This zzso zzso may prevent the zzso of proteins damaged by the innate immune response and contribute to the ability of the zzso fever zzso to achieve high cell zzso in zzso
