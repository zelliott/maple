zzso are zzso structures that assemble on zzso DNA and attach zzso to zzso zzso Because of their zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are particularly amenable to molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso contain three sequence elements of which zzso DNA sequence element III zzso appears to be particularly zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in genes zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso prevent correct zzso zzso Using zzso zzso in zzso zzso we show a strong correlation between zzso activity measured in zzso and zzso activity in zzso We extend previous findings by zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso to argue that zzso zzso may be involved in the operation of a zzso checkpoint but that functional zzso is not required for the assembly of a bipolar zzso
