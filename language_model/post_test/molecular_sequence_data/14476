Two zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso and were studied in detail in order to assess their zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis allocated both zzso clearly to the zzso zzso Both strains showed the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The fatty acid profiles contained major amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso feature zzso which supported the grouping of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso characterization and zzso zzso with the type strains of the most closely related species allowed a clear zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso For this reason, we propose for strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel species with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an additional strain of zzso zzso
