zzso responses are important for controlling chronic viral infections, yet zzso responses specific to human zzso virus type 1 zzso particularly to envelope zzso are lacking in the vast majority of zzso zzso It was previously shown that the presence of zzso to the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso 120 zzso prevents zzso responses to zzso but their zzso mechanisms were undefined zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso when zzso to zzso zzso becomes more resistant to zzso by zzso zzso from zzso cells such that zzso zzso are not released and presented efficiently by major zzso complex class II molecules to zzso zzso T zzso zzso to other zzso regions do not zzso this zzso Thus, zzso may evade zzso zzso responses by inducing and exploiting zzso that conceal the virus envelope zzso from T zzso
