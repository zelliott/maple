zzso C virus zzso core zzso protein is thought to bind to viral zzso before it zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso Details of these events are so far zzso The zzso C protein coding sequence that includes an zzso zzso tract is a part of an internal zzso entry site zzso This zzso sequence but not the corresponding protein sequence is needed for proper initiation of translation of viral zzso by an zzso zzso In this study, we examined the importance of this sequence for the ability of the C protein to bind to viral zzso zzso truncated C proteins with deletions from 10 up to 45 zzso zzso acids were expressed in zzso coli, zzso and tested for binding to viral zzso by a gel shift zzso The results showed that zzso of the C protein from its zzso by more than 10 zzso acids abolished almost completely its expression in zzso zzso The latter could be restored by adding a tag to the zzso of the zzso The zzso proteins truncated by 15 or more zzso acids showed an anomalous migration in zzso zzso by more than 20 zzso acids resulted in a complete loss of ability of zzso C protein to bind to viral zzso These results provide clues to the early events in the C protein - zzso interactions leading to C protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
