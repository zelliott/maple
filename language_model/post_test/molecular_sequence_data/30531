A zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA was cloned by zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The sequence showed no apparent similarity with that of the zzso coli zzso gene with the exception of a completely matched sequence of 21 zzso but it contained a zzso zzso open reading frame coding for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso of the predicted sequence was zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso of the signal recognition particle zzso zzso zzso including consensus sequence elements for a zzso binding site, whereas the zzso portion of zzso zzso had an unusual zzso domain containing several repetitive zzso An zzso of zzso zzso was detected on Northern zzso zzso The predicted sequence was zzso identical with the reported sequences of the zzso zzso of the zzso signal recognition particle zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso Bernstein, zzso et zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso We designated this gene as zzso zzso zzso Gene disruption experiments showed that the zzso gene product is essential for cell zzso
