In the present study, samples representing zzso zzso from zzso zzso and cashmere goat in zzso District, zzso Province, China, were characterized and grouped genetically by sequences of zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 gene zzso zzso zzso were extracted from zzso isolated from individual host by sodium zzso zzso K zzso The zzso and zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction and then zzso and compared with that of other members of the zzso available in zzso and zzso relationships between them were zzso using the zzso zzso The results showed that the lengths of zzso and zzso sequences were 1,125 and 518 zzso respectively, for all zzso zzso samples zzso The identities of zzso sequences of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and cashmere goat in zzso China with that of zzso zzso from sheep in Iran were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The identities of zzso sequences of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and cashmere goat in zzso China with that of zzso zzso from cashmere goat at zzso zzso Province, China were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso and zzso sequences revealed that zzso zzso is placed within the African zzso and zzso zzso should be considered the sister species of zzso zzso
