zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso having wide zzso zzso for zzso zzso These zzso are implicated in the development of diabetic complications by catalyzing the reduction of zzso to zzso zzso zzso as a direct zzso approach to the prevention of diabetic complications resulting from the zzso of diabetes has not been effective because of zzso of the zzso and some appreciable side zzso To understand the structural and evolutionary relationship of these zzso we cloned and zzso zzso coding for zzso and zzso zzso from human liver and zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso reading frame of zzso zzso zzso has a zzso identity zzso plus conservative zzso to human liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso reading frame of 325 zzso zzso The two sequences have significant identity to zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso and bovine lung zzso F zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA indicates a zzso system for zzso zzso suggesting the existence of additional zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso of proteins may have a more significant and zzso not fully appreciated role in general cellular zzso
