We investigated the target sites of three zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso and zzso are directed to overlapping but distinct zzso in the peripheral site, at the entrance of the zzso zzso whereas zzso binds to a different zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we identified surface zzso that differed between sensitive and insensitive zzso the replacement of a single zzso zzso by its rat zzso was able to abolish binding and zzso for each zzso zzso binding and zzso by zzso and by zzso could be zzso to rat zzso by the reverse zzso zzso appears to bind to one side of the active zzso whereas zzso covers its zzso explaining why the zzso complex zzso faster than the zzso or zzso complexes with two active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds to the region of the putative zzso zzso distant from the peripheral site, and does not interfere with the access of zzso to the active zzso The binding of an zzso to this novel regulatory site may inhibit the zzso by blocking the back door or by inducing a zzso distortion within the active zzso
