Random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis, a variation of the zzso chain reaction zzso in which a single primer is used, was evaluated for use as a simple and reliable method with which to type zzso zzso Representatives of six species of zzso were zzso Five zzso of zzso zzso and four zzso of zzso zzso were all distinguishable from one another, but the four zzso of zzso zzso tested, although distinguishable from other zzso zzso were not zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso at least six, three and six zzso patterns were observed, zzso Fourteen zzso zzso sets of zzso zzso zzso shown to be indistinguishable by zzso and zzso zzso were examined with three different zzso With one zzso three of the sets were shown to consist of closely zzso but zzso zzso In the other 11 cases, each set of strains was indistinguishable with all three zzso These preliminary data indicate that zzso analysis has promise as a method for typing zzso zzso
