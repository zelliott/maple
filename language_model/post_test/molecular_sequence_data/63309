In this study we examined the evolution of the genes for three zzso small heat shock proteins in zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that the zzso protein and one of the zzso zzso zzso are evolving under zzso selection to maintain zzso In contrast, the gene for zzso the other zzso zzso is highly variable within zzso zzso and in some zzso or zzso this gene may be a zzso zzso and zzso are related via a zzso zzso event, and the presence of zzso of each gene in other species within the zzso indicates that the zzso generating zzso and zzso may have occurred as much as 20 million years zzso This is considerably longer than the 4 million year zzso of gene zzso zzso genes as well as zzso reported by some zzso Our results are consistent with the prediction that after gene zzso one gene duplicate can be maintained for some time under relaxed selection while it accumulates random zzso By capturing a zzso in the making our study provides important information on how zzso are zzso
