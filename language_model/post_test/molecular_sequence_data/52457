In B cell precursors developing in fetal zzso zzso the selection of zzso zzso and zzso gene segments for initial H chain gene assembly is zzso The present study was designed to determine whether these biases persist in fully developed human fetal B cells and to examine zzso zzso by the favored zzso B cells were prepared from two sites representing different stages of development, zzso fetal liver as a source of cells newly generated in that zzso environment and fetal zzso as a source of more mature cells, potentially subject to selective environmental zzso The expressed zzso were sampled by two zzso zzso transformation so binding and structure could be examined simultaneously and generation of zzso from individual, zzso zzso B zzso We found that mature B cells in liver and secondary zzso tissue exhibit the same degree of bias in zzso use we previously reported in zzso tissue of the same zzso zzso However, the pattern of zzso and zzso use more nearly resembled that of the adult, suggesting that some constraints imposed by the zzso process are zzso zzso zzso recovered from zzso clones were not distinguishable from transcripts recovered from single cells by direct zzso Among zzso expressed by the zzso zzso binding to zzso was common, binding profiles zzso and, in contrast to mice, there was little relationship between specificity and zzso zzso Interestingly, the two individuals studied differed in the zzso element most commonly zzso One resembled previously studied fetal zzso in that zzso zzso about zzso of expressed zzso whereas the other did not express zzso and used zzso in zzso of expressed zzso This was found to reflect a lack of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that genetic variation at the zzso locus may significantly influence the emerging human zzso zzso
