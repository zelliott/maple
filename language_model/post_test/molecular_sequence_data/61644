In the current work, we have cloned and zzso the full zzso for a zzso protein in the zzso sea zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of 1857 zzso that codes for a protein of zzso zzso Within the coding zzso characteristic features of zzso proteins were found, such as a zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso and zzso the signature of the zzso family, zzso and a sequence that codes for a zzso zzso at the zzso region of the zzso An zzso was zzso to estimate the level of expression of zzso protein in sea zzso Through this method we determined that zzso is zzso expressed in head zzso liver, zzso heart, zzso muscle and brain of healthy sea zzso zzso challenge of sea zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in liver, head zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was also found in isolated head kidney zzso and blood zzso This expression was significantly zzso by addition of Poly zzso zzso was not zzso expressed in the sea zzso established cell line, zzso but Poly zzso and zzso were also capable of inducing zzso expression in this cell zzso
