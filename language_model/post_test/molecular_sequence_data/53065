The zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is involved in the process of zzso of zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso zzso have been found to play important roles in tissue development and organization during early embryonic zzso We have cloned the gene for mouse zzso zzso The gene spans approximately 20 zzso and is composed of seven zzso and six zzso A single zzso initiation site, 371 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso was zzso The promoter region was found to lack a zzso zzso However, several potential zzso factor binding motifs such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the promoter zzso
