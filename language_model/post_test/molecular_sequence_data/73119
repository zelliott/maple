Hughes zzso J zzso zzso zzso proposed that the box A region of zzso zzso interacts by complementary base pairing with small zzso zzso zzso sequences within precursor zzso zzso and through zzso and displacement mediates the formation of the universally zzso zzso end zzso We wondered how this zzso zzso might be formed in the zzso zzso of zzso and bacterial organisms that lack a zzso zzso In examining the zzso external transcribed zzso zzso zzso region in zzso transcripts from some of these organisms, we noted the presence of zzso box zzso zzso By zzso with the zzso zzso zzso interaction, we suggest that the box zzso zzso zzso sequence interacts through zzso complementary base pairing with the zzso end zzso sequences within zzso zzso of this structure mediates the formation of the zzso zzso end zzso If correct, this means that some of the zzso zzso functions provided in trans by zzso in zzso organisms may be provided in zzso by the zzso sequences in zzso transcripts in some bacterial or zzso organisms lacking zzso
