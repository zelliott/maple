A highly stable and potent zzso inhibitor was zzso to zzso from the seeds of zzso zzso belonging to zzso family by acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis, under reducing condition, showed that protein consists of a single zzso chain with molecular mass of approximately 34 zzso The zzso inhibitor inhibited bovine zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the protein is a competitive inhibitor with an equilibrium zzso constant of zzso zzso The inhibitor retained the zzso activity over a broad range of pH zzso zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso and in zzso (up zzso zzso The complete loss of zzso activity was observed above 90 degrees zzso CD studies, at increasing temperatures, demonstrated the structural stability of inhibitor at high zzso The zzso backbone folding was retained up to 80 degrees zzso The CD zzso of inhibitor at room temperature exhibited an zzso beta zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of 10 zzso did not show any similarities to known zzso zzso zzso however, two peptides obtained by internal partial sequencing showed significant resemblance to zzso zzso
