Here we describe the isolation and partial characterization of a new zzso protein zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was isolated in a zzso screening of a rat zzso heart library using zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions as zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein of 38 zzso with a stretch of zzso zzso acid zzso at the extreme zzso zzso In addition, putative binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso are present in the zzso half of the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso gene maps at zzso in man and in the zzso region X band D in zzso zzso is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles but not in smooth muscles or other zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is present in a zzso pattern consisting of two rows zzso zzso at Z zzso Its expression is zzso during in zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso cell line, and it is regulated during in zzso skeletal muscle zzso A zzso corresponding to the tail region of zzso zzso strongly and specifically with zzso zzso zzso domain in a zzso test, but the full-length protein did zzso Because the tail region of zzso contains an zzso zzso acid stretch resembling high capacity and low affinity calcium binding zzso we tested the possibility that zzso regulates zzso zzso In zzso binding experiments demonstrated that interaction of full-length zzso with zzso zzso zzso occurred only in absence of zzso suggesting that it can be regulated by zzso signals affecting zzso zzso
