The zzso zzso gene product, zzso and the zzso resistance zzso zzso by the zzso zzso are structurally related proteins and both are associated with zzso zzso channel zzso We have compared their zzso expression in the rat by in zzso zzso In all zzso examined the two genes were found to have complementary patterns of zzso demonstrating exquisite regulation in both zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, a switch in expression from one gene to the other was observed in certain zzso For example, expression in the zzso switches from zzso to zzso as the cells migrate across the zzso zzso A switch from zzso to zzso expression was also observed in the zzso zzso upon zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso serve analogous roles in zzso cells and provide additional evidence that zzso has a zzso role in regulating zzso cell zzso The patterns of expression suggest that the regulation of these two genes is zzso zzso
