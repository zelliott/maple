Factor IX zzso and zzso Madrid were zzso from patients with zzso B and zzso zzso zzso Each protein displays defects in zzso zzso secondary to the failure to cleave one of the zzso bonds whose zzso is necessary for full zzso zzso These proteins were isolated by zzso zzso using zzso zzso directed at either factor IX or zzso Factor IX zzso is zzso zzso by factor zzso yielding a pattern consistent with the failure to cleave the zzso bond between zzso 145 and Ala zzso zzso Madrid is zzso zzso by factor zzso yielding a pattern consistent with the failure to cleave the zzso bond between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping was performed on reduced and zzso factor IX, factor IX zzso zzso and zzso Madrid, and the zzso were separated by zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso in factor IX zzso was identified by automated zzso degradation as zzso 143 through 188 of factor IX, and had a zzso zzso for zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso identified in zzso Madrid zzso to zzso 267 through 285 of zzso and has the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso zzso These zzso each occurring at zzso are identical to those in factor IX Chapel Hill and zzso zzso These results suggest that a limited repertoire of point zzso many affecting zzso zzso may be responsible for zzso defects of the vitamin zzso proteins in patients with normal zzso zzso
