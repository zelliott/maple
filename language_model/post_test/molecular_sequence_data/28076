The respiratory zzso complex transfers the electrons from zzso to zzso c zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso are center o zzso preventing electron transfer at the zzso zzso site zzso which is located closer to the outer side of the inner zzso zzso The zzso b gene is carried by the zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso and zzso have been previously isolated and mapped to specific zzso of the zzso b zzso In the present work, zzso zzso were isolated and genetically zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso from seven zzso four zzso and six zzso zzso have been identified by sequencing the relevant segments of the resistant zzso b zzso A third zzso locus and the first zzso locus were zzso The zzso zzso were found to be clustered in two regions of the zzso b protein which appeared to be responsible for the resistance to zzso site zzso The first region is within the end of the first, the second, and the beginning of the third zzso whereas the second region is within zzso five and the beginning of the sixth zzso
