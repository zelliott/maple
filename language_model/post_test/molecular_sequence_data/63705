The distribution of zzso from the temperate regions changed considerably during the zzso fluctuations of the zzso This is especially true for many bat species that depend on warm zzso to install their nursery zzso zzso of genetic variation among European bats have shown that the southern zzso zzso and the zzso zzso endemic diversity, but to date, no such surveys have been conducted in the third potential glacial refuge area, the zzso zzso We report here the zzso analysis of 115 greater zzso bats zzso zzso sampled throughout Italy, and show that 15 of the 18 different zzso found in the zzso control region of these bats were unique to the zzso zzso zzso within this region also showed substantial genetic structure at both zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and nuclear markers zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Based on a comprehensive survey of zzso bats from Europe, these genetic markers further indicate that central Italian populations of zzso zzso are more closely related to Greek samples from across the zzso Sea, than to other Italian zzso zzso bat populations from the zzso peninsula thus represent a complex mixture of several endemic zzso which evolved in zzso with others that zzso this region more recently along an zzso zzso Our broad survey also confirms that the zzso represent a relatively zzso barrier to gene flow for zzso zzso even for zzso animals such as zzso These results underline the conservation value of bats from this region and the need to include the zzso peninsula in zzso surveys in order to provide a more accurate view of the evolution of bats in zzso
