zzso zzso assignments have been made for over zzso of the zzso acid side chains of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with folate by using a variety of two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso were assigned by using a combination of zzso zzso and a knowledge of the X-ray crystal zzso zzso sets of zzso zzso present in zzso pockets were matched with the X-ray structure and used to assign many of the zzso Other zzso particularly those near or in the active site, were assigned by zzso zzso The ability to assign zzso the zzso zzso of these zzso important zzso allowed for extensive networks of zzso zzso to follow from these zzso As a consequence of these assignments, the orientation of the zzso ring of folate could be determined, and its zzso is similar to that of the productive zzso zzso Under these experimental conditions, only one bound form of the zzso ring could be zzso
