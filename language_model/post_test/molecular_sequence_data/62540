The three South African zzso zzso types of zzso disease virus zzso display great genetic and zzso diversity, resulting from the independent evolution of these viruses in different geographical zzso For effective control of the disease in such areas, the use of custom-made vaccines is zzso To circumvent the tedious process of vaccine strain selection, an alternative in the control process is being zzso Specifically, it is proposed to replace the zzso zzso of an infectious zzso zzso copy of a good SAT vaccine strain with those of appropriate field zzso producing custom-made zzso zzso for use in vaccine zzso Here the construction of an infectious zzso zzso copy of the zzso vaccine strain, zzso is zzso created utilizing an zzso strategy with an existing zzso zzso zzso zzso The virus derived from this zzso zzso zzso displayed excellent growth properties in cell culture, indicating its potential usefulness in the production of custom-made vaccine zzso zzso of the growth of various zzso zzso created during the derivation of zzso infectious zzso suggested zzso between the zzso proteins of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso
