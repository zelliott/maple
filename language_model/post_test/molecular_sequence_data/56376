The sequence of the zzso gene of the zzso virus, the more divergent element of the zzso zzso has been determined and the predicted protein structure compared to its counterpart in rabies vaccine zzso A global similarity of zzso was zzso The divergence affects particularly the rabies zzso sites involved in the zzso zzso This provides a molecular basis for the absence of zzso between zzso and rabies viruses and argues for the necessity of a specific zzso zzso Toward this goal, a zzso copy of the zzso gene was cloned into the zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso A zzso protein was produced in substantial amounts at the surface of the insect zzso Although less strongly zzso than the native viral zzso produced in zzso cells, the zzso protein is zzso and zzso similar, it is recognized by specific zzso zzso and protects mice against an zzso challenge with zzso zzso It therefore constitutes the first experimental genetically engineered vaccine against a zzso virus, and fulfills the international standard for zzso
