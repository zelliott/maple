zzso coli expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso colonies due to the presence of zzso This host was used as a visible marker for evaluating regulatory systems operating in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhancing zzso levels were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and the green zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that they coded for proteins similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity confirmed the identity of the gene products as zzso zzso The corresponding gene was isolated from the zzso library of zzso zzso based on its zzso zzso and was confirmed to have the same effect as the above two zzso zzso genes when introduced into the zzso coli zzso accumulating zzso In the three zzso coli strains carrying the individual zzso zzso zzso zzso the increases in zzso levels are comparable to the increases in zzso zzso zzso activity with reference to control strains possessing the zzso gene zzso These results imply that zzso zzso forms an influential step in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coli, with potential for the efficient production of industrially useful zzso by zzso zzso
