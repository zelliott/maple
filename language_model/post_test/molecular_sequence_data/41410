zzso zzso is a zzso hormone belonging to the growth zzso family of zzso zzso In zzso fish, zzso is zzso by one or two zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso Our previous studies have revealed that zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso release from cultured goldfish zzso cells, whereas zzso hormone suppresses this zzso As in other fish, the goldfish possesses zzso and zzso So far, however, no useful means of detecting the respective zzso zzso in this species has been zzso In order to achieve this aim, we raised rabbit zzso against synthetic zzso fragments deduced from the goldfish zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso we observed zzso cells showing zzso and zzso zzso in the goldfish zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso Several cells in the zzso showed the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Then, using zzso zzso chain reaction with laser zzso we examined zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso cells showing zzso or zzso zzso Among cultured zzso cells, we observed three types of zzso those that possess transcripts of zzso zzso or zzso These results suggest a zzso of zzso cells in the goldfish zzso
