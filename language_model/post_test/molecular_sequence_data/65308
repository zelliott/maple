A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from soil from zzso Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and 25 degrees C in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso forming a coherent cluster with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values below zzso % with respect to the type strains of the other zzso zzso The zzso properties of strain zzso were consistent with those of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso type was based on zzso acid, the zzso zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso levels of 19 and 22 % with respect to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and could be differentiated from these species with reference to a number of zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
