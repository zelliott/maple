The third zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned in zzso zzso and was located within a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso by this zzso had an Mr of about 100,000 and showed optimum activity around pH zzso These properties were different from those of the zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso genes of the same zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence was found to be highly zzso to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 132 zzso zzso An evolutionary relationship observed among the four zzso of zzso zzso strains and that of zzso zzso zzso suggested that ancestral genes for alkaline and neutral zzso zzso early in the evolution of these zzso
