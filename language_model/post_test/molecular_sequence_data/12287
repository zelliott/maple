In zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso occurs at a frequency of about zzso and is the fifth zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso Since there is a correlation between the frequency of zzso usage and the level of its zzso zzso zzso problems might be expected when the zzso contains high levels of zzso zzso When a zzso from the influenza virus, a zzso protein with 12 zzso zzso zzso and 1 tandem zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with 33 zzso zzso zzso and 2 tandem zzso were expressed in zzso coli, product zzso was highly variable and dependent to some degree on the growth zzso In rich zzso the flu zzso represented about zzso of total cell zzso whereas in minimal zzso it was only 2 to zzso of total cell zzso In the presence of the cloned zzso which encodes the zzso zzso for zzso however, the zzso was 25 to zzso of total cell protein in cells grown in minimal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not accumulate to zzso levels in cells grown in zzso broth unless the zzso zzso was zzso when it accounted for 7 to zzso of total cell zzso These results indicate that the rare zzso zzso zzso like the rare zzso zzso zzso and zzso can interfere with the efficient expression of cloned zzso
