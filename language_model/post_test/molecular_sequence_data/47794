zzso lupus zzso zzso is a zzso disease associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and immune complex zzso zzso In both human and zzso zzso one zzso zzso has been mapped to the zzso linked to the zzso zzso zzso II zzso gene on zzso zzso In spontaneous zzso models of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, expression of zzso which acts as a negative regulator for B cells, was zzso zzso in zzso zzso center B cells from aged mice, compared to findings in zzso zzso while levels in zzso center B cells were practically zzso Such strain differences were also evident in young mice upon in zzso stimulation with foreign zzso In the zzso promoter region, the zzso zzso has two deletion sites, including zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed that this zzso zzso was significantly linked to zzso irrespective of the zzso zzso while high levels of zzso zzso specific for DNA were regulated by a zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter zzso may possibly zzso to zzso through zzso center B cells zzso zzso zzso expression upon zzso zzso and thus escaping negative signals for zzso zzso
