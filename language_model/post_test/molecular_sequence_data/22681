zzso plays a pivotal role in cell zzso and migration by providing the link between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We used a combination of electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso to provide an atomic model of how the zzso tail binds zzso zzso The zzso tail zzso binding site comprises two distinct zzso One of these regions is exposed in the full-length zzso zzso of zzso whereas the second site is zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The partial accessibility of the zzso binding site in the zzso full-length zzso structure suggests that zzso can act as part of a zzso input framework with other binding partners such as zzso or zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso thus promoting zzso zzso Furthermore, binding to zzso zzso a local zzso in the zzso tail that in turn promotes zzso zzso and, zzso formation of zzso zzso
