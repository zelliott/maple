The distribution of microbial species, including zzso has long been considered zzso Recently, this perception has been challenged by molecular studies in historical zzso zzso and population zzso Here we explore this issue using the zzso zzso species zzso zzso one of the most common species of zzso in the family zzso encountered in almost all geographic regions and considered as a cosmopolitan zzso In order to determine if zzso zzso is a single cosmopolitan species or an zzso of sibling species, we conducted various zzso zzso including standard gene zzso zzso zzso methods, and zzso species tree reconstruction on zzso collected from a wide geographic zzso zzso show that diversity among zzso referred as zzso zzso is greatly underestimated and that it represents a species zzso Within this complex, zzso distinct highly supported lineages were recovered, each of which has a restricted geographic distribution and zzso The zzso status of zzso regarded as zzso zzso is zzso and the assumed cosmopolitan distribution of this species is zzso We discuss how assumptions about geographically widespread species have implications regarding their zzso true diversity, biological diversity zzso and ecological zzso
