zzso are zzso plant zzso bacteria that alter host zzso zzso a small zzso of 38 zzso is a zzso factor zzso by zzso that zzso zzso and zzso broom in the host zzso In this study, we demonstrate that plants process zzso in order to generate small functional zzso First, virus zzso transient expression demonstrated that the zzso 11 zzso acids of zzso are capable of causing symptom development in zzso zzso zzso The deletion of the 11th zzso significantly diminished the zzso activity of zzso suggesting that these 11 zzso acids constitute a functional zzso Second, we found that zzso zzso zzso processing in zzso generating peptides of 19 and 21 zzso including the functional zzso Third, we observed similar processing of zzso in zzso and an zzso substitution zzso of zzso for which processing was compromised, showed reduced symptom induction zzso All zzso zzso from several zzso strains possessed similar symptom induction activity and went through processing, which suggests that the processing of zzso might be related to its zzso
