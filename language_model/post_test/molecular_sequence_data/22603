The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso begins with zzso to the zzso zzso In almost zzso of zzso clinical zzso the zzso proteins are the major zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified in zzso strain 12, exhibit different binding zzso The two binding zzso have been localized in regions of zzso sequence zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso Two areas within these binding zzso have been found essential for full level adhesive activity zzso the zzso zzso To investigate the conservation and diversity of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso and DNA sequencing were zzso First, we separately amplified the zzso and zzso structural genes in nine invasive zzso zzso discovering two new zzso zzso whose sequences are zzso zzso Then, the zzso and zzso zzso products were used as the template in zzso zzso to produce zzso encompassing the zzso sequences of the two zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis was then performed among sequences of each group, with the support of specific computer zzso Overall, extensive sequence diversity among zzso was zzso However, similarity plots showed patterns consisting of zzso of relatively high similarity alternating with strongly divergent zzso The zzso tree clearly indicated the zzso and zzso zzso domain sequences as two zzso zzso sets of zzso zzso acid motifs were identified within each group of sequences using the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso could represent candidates for future vaccines, identification of specific patterns of zzso motifs in otherwise highly variable regions is of great zzso
