The zzso zzso comprises a zzso group of organisms for which the zzso and evolutionary relationships are poorly zzso The zzso of these evolutionary relationships zzso the use of experimental methods that can distinguish zzso lineages that are time and cost effective, and can be accurately and zzso employed in different zzso zzso sequence typing zzso has been successfully used as a zzso and discriminating system in the study of zzso and zzso evolutionary biology, and for strain typing of various zzso In this study, zzso was applied to evaluate the evolutionary lineages in the zzso A group of zzso zzso zzso zzso type A has recently been shown to produce multiple zzso suggesting that it is not zzso as previously reported, but comprises distinct zzso For zzso analysis, we initially evaluated 14 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for amplification and sequence zzso In the first phase of the analysis, 30 zzso zzso type A strains producing zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of this pilot study suggested that seven of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be used for zzso of evolutionary lineages and strain zzso These seven zzso genes were successfully applied for the zzso of lineages for 73 zzso zzso type A zzso which resulted in 24 distinct sequence zzso This strategy should be zzso to zzso studies and typing of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
