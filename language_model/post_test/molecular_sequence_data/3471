The zzso gene zzso is highly zzso during zzso These genes act as zzso factors during several important zzso processes through their 60 zzso acid zzso that recognize and bind to the regulatory region of their target zzso We isolated a novel zzso gene designated zzso from a mouse zzso zzso library by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Three extra zzso acid zzso zzso are inserted between the first and second zzso of the zzso which makes zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed specifically in the zzso as seen by both Northern zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is initiated at around day 20 of zzso Furthermore, the results of in zzso zzso analysis reveal that the expression of zzso in zzso is restricted in the germ cells at zzso zzso Based on these data, it is suggested that zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso may play a crucial role during zzso
