Previously, we have shown that highly specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso can be produced by targeting a zzso acid sequence at the zzso Although rat zzso and zzso share zzso zzso acid sequence zzso they differ by 3 out of 5 of their zzso zzso In an effort to produce zzso specific to each form, rabbits were zzso with the peptides zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso bound strongly to zzso zzso fraction from rats treated with zzso 16 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was strongly inhibited by incubation with zzso but zzso was 60 times less zzso zzso binding of the zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso 100 times more effectively than zzso Similar zzso of zzso binding was also found using zzso zzso using the zzso zzso yielded a single protein from zzso zzso zzso fraction from zzso rats, which was zzso only by the zzso zzso Both zzso bound to single proteins in the liver which were increased following treatment with zzso but only the zzso zzso zzso protein in the zzso small zzso and kidney of zzso and zzso zzso Also, the binding of the two zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and induced rats showed differences in the expression of proteins zzso by the two zzso providing further evidence of zzso zzso Thus, the binding of zzso and zzso zzso is mutually exclusive and consistent with specific binding to their target zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the distribution of zzso and zzso In the liver of zzso animals, both zzso and zzso were found to be expressed in the zzso zzso However, some zzso zzso was also detected in many, but not all, zzso throughout the zzso However, following treatment of rats with zzso both zzso and zzso were found to be strongly expressed in zzso throughout the zzso although zzso showed greater expression in the zzso zzso zzso treatment was also found to result in induction of zzso in specific regions of the small zzso zzso and zzso
