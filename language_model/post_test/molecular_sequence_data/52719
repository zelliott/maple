For zzso understanding zzso interactions involved in local versus global unfolding has become increasingly important for understanding the nature of the native state ensemble, the mechanisms of zzso and the stability of both the native and intermediate states in zzso In this work we have addressed related questions with respect to zzso structure by combining chemical zzso and zzso radical zzso zzso We have determined unfolding zzso for each of 26 discrete sites of protection located throughout the zzso zzso group I zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and the free energy, zzso degrees zzso associated with formation of each zzso contact was determined by analysis of the zzso The zzso degrees zzso values measured in this study vary from zzso zzso zzso to zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the stability of these discrete zzso contacts vary by almost zzso In addition, an zzso contact and three zzso contacts show high zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that these contacts exhibit global zzso in their folding zzso This new approach to examining zzso stability provides an exciting comparison to our understanding of protein structure and folding zzso
