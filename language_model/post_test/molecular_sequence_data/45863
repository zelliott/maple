The zzso zzso basin in the zzso desert is a system of springs, streams, and zzso These zzso support zzso endemic species and abundant living zzso and other microbial communities, representing a desert oasis of high zzso Here, we combine data from molecular zzso and geology to document the microbial zzso of this unique zzso Ten water samples from locations within the zzso zzso basin and two neighboring valleys as well as three samples of wet sediments were zzso The zzso of zzso populations in the samples was determined by characterizing cultured organisms and by zzso amplification and sequencing of zzso zzso genes from total community zzso The composition of microbial communities was also assessed by determining profiles of terminal restriction site zzso of zzso zzso genes in total community zzso There were 250 different zzso among the 350 cultivated zzso zzso partial zzso zzso gene sequences were obtained and zzso The clones represented 38 unique zzso from ten major lineages of zzso and one of zzso zzso 50% of the zzso were most closely related to marine zzso even though these environments have not been in contact with the ocean for tens of millions of zzso Furthermore, terminal restriction site zzso profiles and geological data suggest that the aquatic zzso of zzso zzso are zzso interconnected with adjacent valleys recently targeted for agricultural zzso The findings underscore the conservation value of desert aquatic zzso and the urgent need for study and preservation of freshwater microbial zzso
