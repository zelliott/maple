The zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso factor involved in zzso initiation in zzso and zzso Using a zzso probe, a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso It contained the zzso gene and the zzso of two additional open reading zzso but surprisingly, zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso was devoid of coding capacity or similarity to database zzso The deduced zzso zzso exhibits sequence similarities to other zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis showed that the zzso and zzso zzso form two related zzso protein families, and the zzso zzso possess features which separate them from zzso zzso Compared with the other zzso the zzso zzso is unique in having a high excess of zzso charged zzso A zzso version of the zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli in a zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso zzso CD zzso was used to monitor zzso secondary structure and the conditions necessary for folding it into a native zzso In the absence of zzso agents, the folded as well as the unfolded state were found to be stable over a wide range of salt zzso zzso folded zzso was shown to bind to a zzso zzso DNA fragment, indicating that the fusion protein can be used to characterize DNA recognition by the zzso zzso
