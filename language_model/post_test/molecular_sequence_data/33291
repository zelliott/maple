The human zzso contains more than half a million human zzso zzso zzso long terminal repeats zzso that can be regarded as mobile regulatory zzso Many of these zzso zzso have been recruited during evolution as zzso control elements for cellular gene zzso We have cloned zzso sequences from two zzso families, zzso and zzso differing widely in their activity and tissue specificity into a zzso leukemia virus zzso promoter conversion zzso zzso Various human cell lines were infected with the zzso hybrid zzso and cell zzso expression of the reporter gene was compared with the promoter specificity of the corresponding zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso start site analysis of zzso hybrid zzso revealed preferential use of the zzso promoter initiation zzso Our data show that zzso zzso function in the context of zzso zzso in certain cell types and have the potential to be useful as cell zzso promoters in zzso zzso
