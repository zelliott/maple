The map positions of the zzso ends of eight late zzso from the zzso virus zzso D zzso were determined by a combination of zzso zzso studies and by primer extension zzso For genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso a single set of zzso ends can be observed by zzso zzso analysis which maps just upstream from the translation start site for each zzso For genes zzso zzso and zzso the situation is more zzso In addition to the zzso zzso family of protected DNA fragments, multiple larger protected DNA fragments map to sites up to several hundred base pairs upstream from the coding zzso When primer extension mapping is carried out, large extended products are observed in all cases but that of gene zzso For genes zzso zzso and zzso these large DNA products are zzso in length and much longer than the zzso zzso DNA zzso This has been observed previously for the late zzso from the zzso gene by zzso et zzso zzso Cell 50, zzso In the case of zzso from genes D3 and zzso however, the lengths of the extended DNA zzso agree with the lengths of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso for genes D3 and zzso the zzso regions of the zzso must be derived from zzso of the DNA sequences upstream from the coding region of each zzso Since the structures at the zzso ends of the late zzso assume more than one form, there may be multiple pathways for generating late zzso
