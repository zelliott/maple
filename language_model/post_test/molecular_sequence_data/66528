The zzso and evolutionary mechanisms behind the emergence of zzso brain features remain largely zzso However, the recent ability to compare our zzso to that of our closest relative, the zzso provides new avenues to link genetic and zzso changes in the evolution of the human zzso We devised a ranking of regions in the human zzso that show significant evolutionary zzso Here we report that the most dramatic of these zzso accelerated zzso zzso is part of a novel zzso gene zzso that is expressed specifically in zzso zzso in the developing human zzso from 7 to 19 zzso weeks, a crucial period for cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso with zzso a product of zzso zzso that is of fundamental importance in specifying the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso and the other human accelerated regions provide new candidates in the search for uniquely human zzso
