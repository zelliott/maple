We previously identified a 66 zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here we found that zzso shows sequence similarity to the zzso zzso of the zzso outer arm zzso zzso Analysis of secondary structure of zzso suggested that the zzso two-thirds of the zzso is rich in coiled zzso structure, as in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that it is located in the vicinity of outer arm zzso zzso was partly extracted from the zzso by a high salt solution and zzso with outer arm zzso This zzso was not affected by the absence of zzso in isolation zzso indicating that zzso is associated with outer arm zzso These results suggest that zzso is a component of the outer arm zzso zzso complex in the zzso of zzso zzso
