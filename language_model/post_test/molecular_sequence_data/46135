The protein zzso zzso is designed as a formal and zzso open biomedical zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The components of PRO extend from the zzso of zzso on the basis of evolutionary relationships at the full-length level, to the representation of the multiple protein forms of a zzso such as those resulting from alternative zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and protein zzso As an zzso PRO differs from a database in that it provides description about the protein types and their zzso In addition, the representation of specific protein types, such as a zzso protein form, allows precise definition of objects in zzso complexes, or in disease zzso This is useful for zzso studies where zzso and modified forms must be zzso and for biological zzso representation where the cascade of events often depends on a specific protein zzso PRO is manually curated starting with content derived from scientific zzso Only zzso with experimental evidence is included, and is in the form of relationship to other zzso In this zzso you will learn how to use the PRO resources to gain information about proteins of interest, such as finding zzso zzso zzso and different modified forms and their zzso In addition, it will provide some details on how you can contribute to the zzso via the rapid zzso interface zzso
