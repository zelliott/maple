Recent advances in the evolutionary zzso of sex determination indicate that zzso may be a zzso equivalent of the zzso zzso master sex regulator zzso zzso The role of zzso seems to be confined to some aspects of male sex zzso whereas in zzso zzso has wider zzso effects in both zzso This suggests other zzso of zzso may exist in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso functions not displayed by zzso We identified and characterized five novel human zzso zzso distinct from previously described family zzso Human zzso genes map to three zzso regions of zzso 1, 9, and 19 (one gene on zzso 19 having an additional zzso on zzso zzso We collated data indicating these zzso regions harbor multiple zzso genes sharing highly specific zzso relations, suggesting that they arose early during zzso zzso The zzso bands represent the ancestral copy and harbor closely linked zzso genes that may reflect the overall diversity of the fruit fly zzso gene zzso The human zzso contains a small number of potential zzso zzso that may be involved in human sexual zzso zzso highly zzso zzso regions, such as zzso zzso is an important tool to trace complex ancient evolutionary processes zzso by other zzso
