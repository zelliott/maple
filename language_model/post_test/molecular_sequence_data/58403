Within the zzso zzso zzso sequencing project, the region between zzso and zzso was assigned to our zzso In this report we present the sequence of the last 36 zzso of this region, between the zzso zzso and the attachment site of the SP beta zzso A zzso strategy was used for the zzso In the first step, total zzso DNA was cloned in zzso zzso zzso and the clones carrying zzso from the target region were identified by zzso with a zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso from our zzso zzso of the clones allowed us to establish a number of zzso In the second step the zzso were mapped by Long zzso zzso zzso and the remaining gaps closed by sequencing of the zzso zzso The level of sequence inaccuracy due to LA zzso errors appeared to be about 1 in zzso which does not affect significantly the final sequence zzso This zzso strategy is efficient and we suggest that it can be applied to sequencing of longer zzso zzso The 36 zzso sequence contains 38 coding sequences zzso 19 of which zzso unknown zzso Seven genetic zzso already mapped in this region, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Eleven zzso were found to display significant similarities to known proteins from the data banks, suggesting possible functions for some of the novel zzso zzso may zzso a cold shock zzso zzso the first bacterial zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso to 3' zzso similar to that of DNA zzso I of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso has zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The arrangement of the genes relative to possible promoters and zzso suggests 19 potential zzso zzso
