Signal transmission by many cell surface receptors results in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso the 3' position of zzso From a screen for mouse proteins that bind zzso the protein zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso domain and displays a region of high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of the closely related protein zzso which, through its zzso zzso domain, regulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exchange of the small zzso zzso protein zzso was also found to specifically bind zzso zzso and zzso appear to connect zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways with proteins that mediate biological responses such as cell zzso and membrane zzso
