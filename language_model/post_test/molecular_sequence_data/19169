zzso genes zzso are recently discovered genes that are involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and zzso in animal zzso In this study, two zzso genes zzso and zzso were isolated and characterized in 11 zzso The full-length coding sequence zzso of the buffalo zzso consists of zzso which encodes a 276 zzso acid protein with molecular mass zzso And the zzso zzso is zzso in length which encodes a 225 zzso acid protein with molecular mass zzso No zzso were found in the zzso of the buffalo zzso but seven and two zzso differences were found in the zzso between buffalo and other bovine zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso acid sequences showed that buffalo was grouped with other members in the zzso zzso Four types of putative modification sites were detected in buffalo zzso zzso And two predicted zzso target sites were found respectively in the zzso of buffalo zzso and zzso The tissue expression analyses by quantitative zzso zzso revealed that the buffalo zzso was expressed in ten zzso zzso Among these zzso the liver and zzso zzso showed high expression zzso And the zzso was only expressed in the brain, zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, and zzso Among these zzso the zzso zzso brain, and zzso demonstrated a high expression zzso These data provide the primary foundation for further insights into the buffalo zzso zzso
