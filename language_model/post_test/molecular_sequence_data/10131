An zzso zzso zzso capable of interacting with zzso proteins in cellular zzso would be a valuable tool for identifying proteins in signal zzso pathways involving zzso A bacterial zzso zzso for zzso zzso has been constructed by inserting the coding sequence for a nine zzso acid portion of the influenza virus zzso zzso protein into the initiation site of an zzso zzso for chicken zzso The zzso fusion produced in bacteria was compared to native zzso for its ability to activate smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso one of the best understood zzso zzso zzso activity was tested in both a zzso system and a zzso zzso zzso preparation maintaining many of the regulatory properties of the intact smooth zzso zzso behaves zzso to unmodified zzso in both systems, indicating that the zzso zzso does not adversely affect zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used to sensitively detect zzso interactions with smooth muscle proteins in a modified gel overlay zzso using a zzso zzso against the zzso zzso as the secondary zzso zzso active complexes of zzso and zzso could be zzso from zzso preparations using the same zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso
