zzso viruses have high levels of zzso zzso which can lead to difficulty in zzso characterization of new viruses using traditional zzso amplification and sequencing zzso In this study, random reverse transcription, anchored random zzso amplification, and zzso zzso were used to identify zzso sequences from total zzso extracted from viral cultures of acute zzso illness zzso zzso zzso sequence for the zzso L segment was assembled and zzso extended using de zzso assembly zzso from zzso reads and zzso sequences in zzso as zzso zzso and continuous coverage were achieved by mapping all reads to the L segment draft zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing were used to complete the zzso zzso The complete L segment was found to be zzso bases in zzso zzso a zzso putative zzso zzso The identified L segment was distinct from previously published South American zzso sharing zzso and zzso identity at the zzso and zzso acid level, respectively, with the complete zzso virus L segment and zzso and zzso identity at the zzso and zzso acid level, respectively, with a partial zzso virus L zzso The result demonstrated the effectiveness of a zzso amplification and next-generation sequencing approach for obtaining complete viral zzso from total zzso acid extracts and its use in pathogen zzso
