Although protein zzso with new zzso activities can arise from existing zzso less is known about the origin of zzso with new zzso Furthermore, mechanisms by which new zzso folds arise are not well characterized for either protein or zzso Here we investigate how readily zzso with new zzso activities and folds can arise from an existing zzso zzso Using in zzso selection, we isolated 23 distinct zzso zzso from a pool of sequence zzso of an zzso parent zzso Analysis of these new zzso showed that zzso with new folds and zzso activities can be found within a short zzso distance of a given zzso However, the probability of finding such zzso increases considerably as the zzso distance from the parental zzso increases, indicating a need to escape the fold of the zzso
