The zzso zzso is a key component of zzso By using chemical zzso and zzso we performed the first extensive experimental analysis of the structure and accessibility of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso These were zzso from zzso cell nuclear extract and zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso accessibility was also zzso For both species, data demonstrate the formation of the zzso zzso zzso In the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso forms the long range interaction, that was previously proposed to be responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In both zzso and human zzso zzso is more protected than zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso protein complex and other components of the zzso wrapped the zzso zzso of zzso zzso I of zzso is partially accessible, and chemical modifications of loop I were identical in zzso and human zzso This reflects a strong conservation of the interactions of proteins with the functional loop zzso Only some parts of the zzso zzso motif (the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Due to difference of protein composition of zzso and human zzso the zzso segment linking the zzso zzso to the zzso structure and the zzso central zzso segment are more accessible in the zzso than in the human zzso especially, the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso Data are discussed taking into account knowledge on zzso and protein components of zzso and human zzso and their involvement in zzso zzso
