We have zzso the genes for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors for genetic zzso in a large African-American and zzso population zzso We have identified eight novel zzso in these genes including four that are predicted to cause zzso acid zzso These zzso are additional candidates for association studies of behavioral disorders such as depression and schizophrenia as well as quantitative personality zzso We have also detected some, but not all, previously identified zzso in these genes suggesting that many previously identified zzso are unique to specific zzso The results of this study, and previous screens of zzso zzso demonstrate that the genes for zzso receptors display marked population and molecular genetic zzso These levels of complexity may have a substantial effect on genetic association studies of human behavioral zzso related to these zzso We discuss the implications of these findings and propose methods to address complexity in genetic association zzso
