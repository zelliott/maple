The use of zzso interaction analysis mass zzso to selectively zzso zzso and characterize zzso peptides present in total cell zzso is zzso zzso zzso peptides were captured via affinity interactions with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and detected using surface zzso resonance zzso interaction analysis zzso After zzso the zzso peptides were either zzso from the zzso chips for mass zzso analysis or analyzed directly from the zzso chip using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso database searches were performed using the masses of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in identification of the protein into which the zzso tag was zzso zzso limits for both zzso and zzso were at the zzso to zzso zzso The approach represents a zzso zzso zzso technique capable of identifying zzso proteins as they are present in complex zzso
