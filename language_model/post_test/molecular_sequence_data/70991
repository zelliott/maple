zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso capable of zzso native zzso forms of several collagen zzso as well as a number of zzso zzso The role of zzso in various diseases affecting the zzso tissue is well zzso zzso is zzso as both zzso and zzso species, and the two forms have been shown to be identical with respect to zzso zzso specific activity and zzso zzso No function for the zzso zzso of the zzso has been ascribed to zzso In the present study, we report on the detailed characterization of zzso zzso Using strategies based on sequential zzso zzso combined with zzso laser zzso zzso of flight zzso and zzso tandem zzso we have characterized the zzso structures of zzso derived from human zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso derived from zzso was found to carry mainly alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells produce zzso that has a zzso zzso pattern, zzso zzso zzso carrying Lewis X, zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso analogue of Lewis zzso as terminal zzso We also show that, of the two potential zzso sites in the zzso zzso only zzso is zzso
