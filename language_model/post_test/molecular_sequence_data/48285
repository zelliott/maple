The earliest known zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is still the only alternative to zzso zzso in biological electron transport zzso Cloning of several higher plant zzso zzso genes has led to the recognition that the corresponding proteins form a family of extremely similar zzso zzso The bacterial zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso are zzso with this family, as deduced from their cloned zzso The zzso and zzso zzso differ more than the zzso from higher plants, zzso recognition of functionally significant zzso zzso structures of zzso are reviewed and compared with zzso and soluble zzso
