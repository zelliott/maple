zzso in zzso associate with zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso While zzso shows zzso zzso zzso can present with either zzso zzso or dominant segregation pattern zzso the latter being zzso by milder zzso and later zzso The majority of the zzso zzso are associated with zzso and zzso with only four zzso zzso identified in zzso 

We screened zzso gene in a series of 43 index patients, 39 with zzso and 4 with intermediate zzso with sporadic and familial occurrence of the zzso 

Three novel zzso were identified in three families with dominant segregation of the disease: two zzso changes, zzso and zzso affecting the zzso domain of the zzso protein and a novel deletion zzso leading to early zzso of the protein upstream the zzso zzso Wide zzso in clinical presentation is shared by all three families mostly in terms of age at onset and disease zzso A rare zzso zzso located within the zzso domain, apparently acts as zzso zzso in the family carrying the zzso 

The results obtained reveal a zzso zzso frequency of zzso in the dominant families zzso a figure still zzso for this zzso thus suggesting that zzso involvement in dominant zzso might be higher than zzso
