Two classes of zzso cholesterol and zzso block export of zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso by preventing the binding of zzso proteins to a zzso sorting signal zzso in zzso the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso blocks zzso binding in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso blocks zzso movement in zzso zzso and zzso block zzso binding to zzso by binding to different zzso zzso cholesterol to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso labeling shows that both binding events produce a zzso change near the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding but not zzso zzso zzso experiments raise the possibility that the distance of zzso from the zzso membrane is crucial for zzso zzso and we speculate that zzso and zzso block zzso transport by altering the location of zzso with respect to the zzso rendering it zzso to zzso zzso
