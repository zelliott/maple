To identify negative regulatory genes for cellular differentiation in zzso zzso DNA fragments zzso the normal zzso processes were cloned on a zzso zzso One of these DNA fragments markedly zzso aerial zzso and spore formation on solid media containing zzso or zzso but not on media containing zzso or zzso The zzso contained three complete zzso precise zzso revealed that a zzso zzso zzso located in the promoter region between zzso and zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso of the promoter activities by using a zzso zzso zzso gene as a reporter showed that the promoter for zzso zzso maintained high activity in zzso grown in the presence of zzso but lost activity rapidly in zzso zzso zzso activity increased markedly when the promoter sequence was introduced on a zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso may initiate differentiation in zzso zzso
