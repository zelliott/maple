During cardiac zzso the chief zzso energy source switches from fatty acid zzso zzso to zzso zzso to fetal zzso The expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso was delineated in a zzso zzso pressure overload preparation to characterize the molecular regulatory events involved in the zzso of energy zzso zzso during cardiac zzso zzso of genes involved in the zzso zzso import, and zzso of fatty acids was zzso zzso after 7 days of right zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso of RV pressure overload studies in mice transgenic for the promoter region of the gene zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso step in the zzso zzso fused to a zzso zzso reporter confirmed that repression of zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso occurred at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso promoter fragments and nuclear protein extracts prepared from zzso and control RV identified pressure zzso zzso interactions at a regulatory unit shown previously to zzso control of zzso gene zzso during cardiac zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that members of the zzso zzso zzso and nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso upstream promoter zzso factor zzso protein zzso families interact with the pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The DNA binding activities and nuclear expression of zzso and zzso in normal fetal mouse heart were similar to those in the zzso adult zzso These results identify a zzso regulatory mechanism involved in the zzso of a fetal zzso program during pressure zzso cardiac zzso
