zzso coli zzso zzso zzso only during zzso growth in media supplemented with nitrate and zzso The reduction of nitrate to ammonium in the zzso of zzso coli involves two separate zzso zzso nitrate zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso involved, zzso contains zzso C and is zzso zzso with a zzso zzso C, zzso during growth in the presence of zzso or in limiting nitrate zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso are required for the zzso zzso reduction pathway, which involves at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso are involved in the maturation of a special zzso zzso zzso C zzso to zzso C zzso by transferring a zzso to the unusual zzso binding motif of the zzso sequence in zzso zzso Thus, in order to further investigate the roles of zzso in the formation of zzso zzso complex zzso and in the interaction between zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso zzso we determined the crystal structure of zzso at zzso zzso The structure of zzso showed that the contact between zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso is accomplished via a zzso domain in zzso which serves as a binding site for the zzso motif of zzso The portion of zzso that binds to zzso domain of zzso has a unique secondary zzso a zzso followed by about a zzso zzso loop (the so called zzso zzso This study allows us to better understand the mechanism of special zzso zzso assembly during the maturation of zzso zzso zzso and also adds a new zzso binding zzso to the list of zzso zzso zzso
