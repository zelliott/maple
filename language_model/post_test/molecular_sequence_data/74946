A zzso zzso clone for human zzso zzso E1 was isolated from a zzso zzso expression library by screening with zzso zzso to the E1 alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, a zzso zzso against bovine zzso zzso complex and a synthetic zzso based on the known zzso acid sequence of the zzso of the bovine zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso revealed a zzso sequence of 72 zzso a translated sequence of zzso zzso and a zzso sequence of 223 zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso structure predicts a leader sequence of 29 zzso acids and a mature protein of 362 zzso acids zzso an zzso zzso identical to that of the bovine E1 alpha zzso and three zzso zzso sites whose sequence was also identical to those in the bovine E1 alpha zzso The translated sequence for the mature protein differs substantially from that described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Hunt, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Brown, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by virtue of a zzso between bases 390 and zzso This amended sequence is confirmed by the presence of additional restriction sites for the zzso zzso and zzso at the beginning and end, respectively, of this zzso The leader sequence is typical for zzso zzso being composed of a combination of neutral and basic zzso The zzso acid composition is zzso similar to that of the bovine zzso This zzso clone zzso with a zzso zzso on a Northern zzso analysis of human zzso and a second minor band of zzso zzso is also zzso
