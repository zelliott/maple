Our ability to routinely engineer genetic networks for applications is limited by the zzso of highly specific and zzso zzso gene regulators with predictable zzso Though zzso zzso are attractive contenders for this purpose, quantitative understanding of their specificity and zzso relationship sufficient for their design has been zzso Here, we use rationally designed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso translation system from the zzso sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso interactions in zzso coli and integrate the data set with zzso modeling to identify the zzso stability of the duplex and the seed region as the key zzso of zzso zzso this model, we predict the performance of an additional zzso zzso pairs, forecast the possibility of large families of zzso zzso and forward engineer and zzso validate two zzso pairs zzso to an existing group of five from the training data zzso We discuss the potential use of these regulators in next-generation synthetic biology zzso
