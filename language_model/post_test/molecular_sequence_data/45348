zzso studies were performed on ten zzso zzso zzso bacteria that were isolated from volcanic zzso deposits derived from the zzso of zzso zzso in the Philippines in zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that these zzso belonged to the zzso zzso of the zzso sequence similarity values with their nearest zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso In addition to zzso analysis, results of zzso protein profiles and zzso tests revealed that these strains were members of two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein profiles enabled these zzso to be differentiated from related zzso species with zzso published zzso The zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso contents ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and their major zzso zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of these results, two novel species are proposed, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be included in the species zzso zzso
