zzso zzso infections cause significant global problems in veterinary and human medicine, including causing huge losses in cattle and sheep zzso zzso zzso host infection is a zzso process and zzso express zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which play pivotal roles in zzso through host entry, tissue migration and immune zzso zzso of these zzso is zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso of zzso larvae is dependent on zzso zzso and together zzso and zzso account for over zzso of total zzso activity zzso in newly zzso juvenile zzso zzso This paper focuses on members of the zzso L gene family, specifically those belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso of two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso transcript expression levels for these zzso were significantly different at various time points in life development stages obtained in zzso from dormant zzso to zzso zzso after zzso zzso expression levels were observed in zzso immediately after zzso In all stages examined by Real Time zzso zzso was expressed at a higher level compared to zzso which was expressed only at very low zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis also indicated higher expression of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso The ability of zzso responses from rats and sheep challenged with zzso zzso to recognize zzso zzso and zzso was shown to zzso zzso were also confirmed through the use of zzso and zzso zzso in Western zzso analysis of juvenile zzso zzso material separated by zzso zzso These results indicate analysis of relative expression of zzso zzso factors from different populations is required, as this will likely impact the effectiveness of vaccines based on these zzso
