The ability of zzso to invade tissue culture cells is correlated with zzso zzso the tissue culture invasion model has been used extensively to study this process and to identify the bacterial genes involved and their zzso Described here is the further characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso originally identified as a zzso for tissue culture zzso A zzso DNA zzso zzso this zzso was cloned and zzso The derived protein sequence is zzso identical to zzso from zzso coli, an outer membrane protein required for the signal zzso transport of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was renamed zzso and is referred to in this text as zzso to distinguish it from zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are functionally similar since zzso can complement the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso is required for export of zzso by zzso The zzso zzso is zzso for mice when administered by the oral route, suggesting that the gene is important for zzso Further characterization of the zzso zzso indicated that like zzso zzso it is more sensitive than the zzso strain to various detergents, antibiotics and zzso This zzso is more sensitive to zzso zzso only when associated with the zzso and the zzso zzso appears to be artifact of this zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is more sensitive to the zzso activity of human zzso zzso the zzso zzso could be the result of an inability to zzso a necessary zzso factor, or an increased sensitivity to complement and zzso as a result of a subtle zzso in the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso
