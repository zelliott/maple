A novel bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a field cultivated with zzso in zzso Republic of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and strictly zzso They were zzso by gliding and produced zzso zzso Growth occurred zzso at zzso zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that strain zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso The only zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the major polar lipids were zzso one unidentified zzso and one unidentified zzso The major cellular fatty acids zzso were zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data supported affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso Several zzso and zzso tests differentiated strain zzso from the species of the zzso zzso with zzso published zzso On the basis of data from a zzso study, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
