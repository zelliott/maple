The koala, zzso zzso is a geographically widespread species endemic to Australia, with three currently recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso variation in the zzso DNA zzso control region was examined in over 200 animals from 16 representative populations throughout the zzso zzso zzso different zzso were defined in the approximately 860 zzso zzso control region, as determined by zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso Any single population typically possessed only one or two zzso yielding an average zzso zzso diversity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso diversity of zzso Overall, zzso control region sequence diversity between populations averaged zzso and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso divergence between populations averaged zzso and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso methods revealed limited zzso distinction between geographically distant populations of zzso and tentative support for a single zzso significant unit zzso This is consistent with previous suggestions that the zzso differences zzso by zzso zzso may be interpreted as zzso zzso zzso differentiation in zzso zzso between localities suggested that little gene flow currently exists among zzso When combined with zzso analysis, which has revealed substantial differentiation among zzso zzso we conclude that the appropriate short-term management unit zzso for zzso is the local zzso
