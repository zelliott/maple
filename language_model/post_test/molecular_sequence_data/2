The complete zzso sequence and zzso structure of the rat embryonic skeletal muscle zzso heavy chain zzso gene has been zzso This gene comprises 24 X zzso bases of DNA and is split into 41 zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso long zzso consisting of 90 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein coding and 125 zzso of 3' untranslated zzso The rat embryonic zzso zzso is zzso by zzso 3 to 41 and contains 1939 zzso acid zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso Its zzso acid sequence displays the structural features typical for all zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso head region and a zzso zzso rod portion that shows the characteristics of a coiled zzso with a superimposed zzso repeat pattern interrupted at only four positions by zzso zzso The complex structure of the rat embryonic zzso gene and the conservation of zzso locations in this and other zzso genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the zzso zzso of the head, but not at the zzso junction or between the zzso repeats present within the zzso zzso there is little evidence for zzso zzso and zzso evolution by gene zzso as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso into a previously zzso ancestral zzso rod gene consisting of multiple zzso arranged zzso repeats, or zzso evolution of an originally zzso ancestral zzso rod gene must account for the observed structure of the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso
