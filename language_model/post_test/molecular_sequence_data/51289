The gene zzso an alkaline zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 221 was cloned in zzso coli and expressed in zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso identified as the zzso gene was preceded by a putative zzso sequence zzso with a spacing of 7 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had a zzso of 111 zzso followed by the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso The alkaline zzso from zzso zzso zzso 221 had higher zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso than to those from zzso zzso zzso Also zzso zzso 221 zzso and other zzso from zzso zzso shared common zzso acid changes and 4 zzso acid deletions that seemed to be related to characteristics of the zzso of zzso zzso when compared to the zzso from zzso zzso
