The full-length pigeon zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned and zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso of zzso zzso A zzso acid protein was predicted for the obtained zzso which had zzso identity with the chicken zzso Similar to chicken zzso the pigeon zzso gene is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that pigeon zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso and trace amounts were detected in other zzso During the zzso cycle, pigeon zzso zzso zzso expression reached its peak during the zzso stage, decreased with brooding, and then increased again during the zzso zzso Moreover, the relative zzso expression level in pigeon zzso zzso cells could be zzso by a constant concentration of steroid zzso
