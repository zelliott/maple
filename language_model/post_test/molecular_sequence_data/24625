A novel tandem zzso mass zzso is described that enables gaseous zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The instrument consists of a commercially available triple zzso mass zzso connected to an SID region and an zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The performance of the instrument was evaluated using zzso allowing a comparison between zzso and zzso and with previous reports of other SID zzso The zzso of SID data was assessed by replicate zzso of the collision energy required for 50% zzso of zzso excellent precision was observed zzso zzso of zzso zzso though, unexpectedly, the zzso of the equivalent figure for zzso was zzso Several peptides were zzso using SID in conjunction with liquid zzso mass zzso or zzso a comparison of the fragmentation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the further zzso of zzso fragments was consistent with the zzso of the latter fragments to zzso zzso Few product zzso attributable to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso were zzso The SID properties were investigated of a series of peptides differing only in the zzso of a zzso zzso similar decomposition efficiencies were observed for all except the zzso acid zzso which demonstrated significantly more facile zzso
