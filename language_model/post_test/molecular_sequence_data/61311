Plant zzso develop mostly zzso from persistent or newly formed zzso After cell division arrest, differentiation frequently involves zzso and cell zzso zzso controlling transition from zzso cycles to differentiation zzso have not been identified yet in zzso Here we describe zzso a plant zzso of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso clones were isolated from zzso zzso root zzso which exhibit the highest degree of zzso in this zzso zzso represents a small zzso family and appears to be zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso triggered zzso zzso degradation, cell division arrest, zzso and cell zzso In zzso enhanced expression of zzso was found in zzso cells undergoing zzso In transgenic zzso plants, zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso orientation resulted in partial suppression of zzso expression and decreased the number of zzso and the volume of the largest zzso Thus, the zzso product may switch zzso cells to differentiation zzso which, in the case of zzso result in cell size zzso
