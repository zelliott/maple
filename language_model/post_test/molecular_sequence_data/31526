Despite substantial efforts to control and contain H5N1 influenza zzso bird flu viruses continue to spread and zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso on the viral zzso zzso could zzso immunity to the diverse H5N1 virus strains and provide information for effective vaccine zzso Here, we report the characterization of a broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to most H5N1 zzso and zzso that was zzso by zzso with viral zzso of zzso zzso the immediate precursor of the current dominant strains of H5N1 zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso of zzso in complexes with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reveal a zzso zzso in the zzso vestigial zzso zzso that is some distance from the zzso binding site and partially zzso zzso site C of zzso zzso Further zzso characterization by selection of escape zzso and zzso mapping by flow zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso cell surface display identified four zzso that are critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all zzso in H5N1 zzso and are not in zzso zzso identified by other mouse or human zzso zzso zzso is effective in protection of H5N1 virus both zzso and zzso and appears to neutralize by blocking both virus zzso binding and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso identified here should provide valuable insights into H5N1 vaccine design and improvement, as well as zzso therapies for treatment of H5N1 zzso
