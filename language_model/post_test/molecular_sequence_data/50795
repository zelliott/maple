The zzso zzso zzso are associated with human zzso membrane proteins of zzso 30 zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins of 50 and 45 zzso (the zzso zzso are zzso with the zzso zzso on zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones representing a member of the zzso zzso family (the zzso zzso We used zzso with zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso and human zzso DNA as a template and cloned and zzso three types of zzso product of the expected zzso Two of these products, zzso and zzso gave the same translated zzso acid sequence which corresponded to the expected zzso zzso sequence but had only zzso DNA sequence zzso The third product zzso contained a single base zzso and the translated zzso acid sequence contained an zzso stop zzso We have isolated zzso clones containing the full coding sequence of the zzso zzso This sequence predicts that it is a zzso acid zzso membrane protein with up to 12 zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows clear similarity to the zzso protein in both zzso acid sequence and predicted zzso Our results are consistent with the zzso and zzso groups of proteins being different zzso of an zzso complex which is likely to have a transport or channel function in the zzso zzso We mapped the zzso gene to human zzso zzso showing that genetic differences in the zzso rather than the zzso genes specify the major zzso forms of the zzso zzso
