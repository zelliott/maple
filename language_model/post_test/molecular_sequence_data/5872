In zzso analyses using an autonomously replicating zzso zzso have enabled identification of zzso zzso elements critical for zzso and 3' zzso site selection in zzso plant zzso and development of a model for zzso zzso recognition in plant zzso To determine the minimal zzso spacing and zzso compositions constraining recognition of the 3' boundary of an zzso two or four zzso zzso have been introduced into the two zzso elements located between 50 and 66 zzso upstream from the 3' zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso In each case tested, zzso in the zzso left element zzso to zzso zzso the downstream 3' zzso site at zzso more effectively than zzso in the zzso right element zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso in either element reduce recognition of the zzso site zzso zzso zzso have a less severe zzso zzso in both of these zzso elements zzso block recognition of the downstream 3' zzso zzso The strong additive effect of these zzso supports a model in which short sets of zzso islands bind interactive factors and zzso zzso usage of the downstream zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso requirements documented for the 3' zzso of plant zzso zzso are partially interchangeable with zzso within this internal region of the zzso
