The zzso long zzso element zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso contains two open reading zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a protein containing a zzso motif and an zzso domain, whereas zzso encodes a protein containing an zzso and a reverse zzso zzso To zzso the functional significance of zzso in zzso we constructed many zzso of zzso and examined their zzso zzso We zzso 1) the zzso protein is not essential for zzso zzso in cultured zzso 2) the translation of zzso is required for the translation of zzso and 3) zzso translation probably occurs via suppression of the zzso stop zzso the efficiency of which is influenced by the context of the sequence juxtaposed to the 3' side of the stop zzso These results offer a new perspective on the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso
