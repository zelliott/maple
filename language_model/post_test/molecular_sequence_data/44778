A gene zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified downstream of the zzso gene and designated zzso This gene has two tandem Shine zzso sequences and two initiation zzso We have established zzso systems with the function of zzso zzso zzso pigmentation as a reporter for zzso gene expression in zzso zzso in order to identify the promoter and zzso zzso Using this system, the zzso gene was suggested to be transcribed zzso
