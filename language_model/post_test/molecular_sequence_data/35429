Trees are capable of tremendous architectural zzso allowing them to maximize their light exposure under highly competitive zzso One key component of tree architecture is the branch angle, yet little is known about the molecular basis for the spatial patterning of branches in zzso Here, we report the identification of a candidate gene for the br zzso in zzso zzso zzso associated with vertically oriented growth of zzso referred to as zzso or zzso zzso zzso as hypothetical protein in the zzso zzso zzso was identified as a candidate gene for br using a next generation zzso mapping zzso zzso similarity searches identified rice zzso zzso angle control 1) as a putative zzso and we thus named it zzso In zzso zzso is known to lead to less compact growth by increasing the zzso zzso In zzso an zzso zzso showed more vertical branch growth angles, suggesting that the gene functions universally to promote the horizontal growth of zzso zzso genes belong to a gene family (here named zzso for a shared zzso zzso found in all plant zzso consisting of two zzso one containing zzso zzso the other containing zzso which contains an zzso zzso and promotes vertical shoot growth in zzso zzso zzso and zzso through influencing polar zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso genes are zzso and play zzso roles in determining shoot growth angles in zzso zzso how zzso genes zzso branch angles will provide insights into how different architectural growth habits evolved in zzso zzso
