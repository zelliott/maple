We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso protein of human fetal liver zzso cells 29), from human fetal liver zzso zzso Two types of mature zzso were identified and designated zzso and zzso In human zzso the zzso gene is on zzso zzso and the two forms are zzso zzso There is a unique zzso start site, which predicts major zzso composed of zzso bases for zzso and 1801 bases for zzso The anticipated zzso were demonstrated in zzso cells, but not in any adult human zzso examined by Northern zzso In the zzso reverse zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is present in adult bone zzso and zzso at a higher level than in any other zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso proteins are expressed in zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso chains of zzso and zzso are composed of zzso and 350 zzso acids zzso A unique zzso motif composed of two zzso zzso fingers is common to both forms of zzso They are nuclear proteins and zzso but not zzso is an zzso of zzso gene zzso
