Complete zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were determined for 8 zzso species of chickens and for zzso zzso of zzso zzso were aligned with each other and with sequences from 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso sequences were analyzed by maximum zzso to zzso evolutionary relationships among the avian zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the sister zzso to the 8 zzso species infecting zzso Within the avian zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were sister zzso this zzso attached zzso to the other chicken zzso The remaining zzso zzso formed 3 zzso that correlated with similarities based on zzso size and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso near zzso zzso formed the next most zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oval zzso which was the sister group to zzso zzso zzso oval zzso The 4 zzso of avian zzso species were strongly supported in a zzso zzso zzso rooting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the remaining zzso species and the apparent absence of zzso that zzso the zzso of jungle zzso all suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso may have arisen from a host switch, perhaps from the North American zzso zzso zzso
