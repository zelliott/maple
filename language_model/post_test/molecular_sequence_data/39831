How insulin binds to the insulin zzso has long been a subject of zzso Although the structure of the free hormone has been extensively zzso a variety of evidence suggests that a zzso change occurs upon zzso zzso Here, we employ zzso zzso comparison of corresponding d and zzso zzso acid zzso to investigate a possible switch in the zzso To investigate the zzso of structure, function, and stability, zzso zzso have been zzso in which an zzso zzso in a zzso zzso is replaced by zzso or zzso The d substitution enhances stability zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso binding by zzso by contrast, the zzso substitution markedly zzso stability zzso zzso zzso with only zzso reduction in zzso zzso Although the zzso structures each retain a zzso overall fold, the zzso analog exhibits fewer zzso and long range nuclear zzso effects than does the zzso analog or native zzso Evidence for enhanced zzso fluctuations in the unstable analog is provided by its attenuated CD zzso The inverse relationship between zzso stabilization and zzso binding strongly suggests that the zzso zzso changes zzso on zzso zzso
