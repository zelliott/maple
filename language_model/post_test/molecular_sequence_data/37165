Members of the zzso zzso of the zzso family of viruses have the unusual requirement that the zzso length of the viral zzso must be an even multiple of six in order for efficient zzso zzso and hence virus zzso to zzso Human zzso virus type 2 zzso is the only member of the zzso that has been reported to have a zzso length that is not an even multiple of six, and it has also been recovered from a full-length zzso zzso that did not conform to the zzso of zzso To zzso the issue of zzso length in natural zzso of zzso a complete consensus zzso sequence was determined for three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of these strains was found to have a zzso length of zzso zzso zzso thus zzso in each case to the rule of zzso To directly examine the requirement that the zzso length of zzso be an even multiple of six, we constructed six full-length zzso zzso zzso that deviated from a zzso length by 0 to 5 zzso zzso zzso were readily recovered from all of the zzso including those that did not conform to the rule of zzso One zzso zzso isolate was completely zzso for each of the zzso zzso zzso These were found to contain small zzso insertions or deletions that zzso zzso length to the recovered zzso Interestingly, almost all of the length corrections occurred within the zzso and large zzso genes or the intervening zzso region and thus were zzso to the insert that caused the zzso from the rule of zzso These results zzso in the context of complete infectious virus, that zzso has a strong and seemingly absolute requirement for a zzso zzso
