A zzso zzso zzso library was constructed using zzso isolated from zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso of random clones of this library resulted in the identification of a zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso The zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a 3' untranslated region of 275 zzso with a zzso signal 16 bases upstream from the zzso zzso zzso The protein predicted by the zzso sequence contains zzso zzso acids and the level of zzso acid zzso with the corresponding part of human precursor zzso is 79 zzso No information is available about the tissue distribution of zzso in zzso therefore we investigated the expression of zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso To investigate the potential of zzso as an zzso zzso we also zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso clones derived from zzso zzso zzso
