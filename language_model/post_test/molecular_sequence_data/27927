Some peculiarities of zzso zzso by rat zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso It was demonstrated that at pH zzso the initial steps of zzso zzso are under control of zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the deep degradation of the peptides zzso The molecular mass of rat zzso zzso zzso D as determined by zzso on zzso zzso is about 45 zzso Using affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso D was zzso zzso The zzso zzso rapidly zzso low zzso of zzso down to peptides with Mr less than 1 zzso At zzso concentration ratios above zzso the limited zzso of zzso zzso At early steps of zzso zzso the formation of two peptides (Mr approximately 10 zzso takes zzso zzso degradation of sheep zzso led to the formation of four peptides with molecular masses of zzso zzso 1880 and zzso Da zzso from zzso zzso An analysis of structural peculiarities of zzso from different animal species revealed that this hormone is protected from the damaging effect of zzso
