A segment of DNA from the zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso strain zzso possesses promoter activity when tested in zzso zzso from, and transgenic plants of, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA segment, designated the zzso promoter, is derived from a position on the zzso zzso comparable to the position on the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso promoters show approximately zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso but in sequences further upstream the zzso drops below zzso zzso activities were estimated using zzso and zzso zzso II reporter gene zzso The activity of the zzso promoter segment zzso that of the zzso promoter in both zzso transient expression zzso and in zzso transformed tobacco zzso zzso of zzso sequences from the zzso promoter indicates that promoter strength depends upon DNA sequences located several hundred zzso upstream from the zzso zzso In leaf tissue the zzso promoter is zzso more active than the zzso zzso zzso promoter from zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter lacks the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso promoter, showing relatively uniform zzso zzso zzso and floral zzso
