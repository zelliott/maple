zzso is an zzso zzso hormone that plays a central role in the metabolism of iron and its expression in the liver can be induced through two major zzso the inflammatory pathway, mainly via zzso and the zzso pathway, zzso by zzso zzso are group of evolutionary zzso zzso regulators that bind to the consensus zzso the promoter zzso In zzso cells, zzso 4 and 6 in conjunction with the zzso friend of zzso zzso were shown to zzso the zzso of zzso However, it is unclear as to which of the zzso drive the expression of zzso in zzso In this study, using in zzso and in zzso approaches, we investigated the relevance of zzso and zzso proteins in the expression of zzso following treatment with zzso and zzso We found that treatment of zzso cells with either zzso or zzso increased the zzso promoter zzso The zzso promoter activity following treatment with zzso or zzso was further increased by zzso of the promoter with zzso proteins 4 and zzso However, zzso of the zzso promoter with zzso proteins 1 or 2 zzso the promoter response to treatments with either zzso or zzso The effects of both zzso and zzso proteins on the promoter activity in response to zzso or zzso treatment were zzso by zzso of the zzso response zzso the zzso promoter region zzso In zzso treatment of mice with zzso led to a transient increase of zzso expression in the liver that was positively correlated with the expression of zzso Our results indicate that during inflammation zzso is zzso in concert with zzso while zzso and zzso (1 and 2) are zzso
