The human gene zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was isolated, and its zzso organization was zzso zzso searches revealed the highest degree of zzso to several zzso zzso zzso and a weak zzso to zzso zzso zzso The 12 zzso gene was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso a locus neither related to that of the human zzso zzso nor to that of zzso B zzso The zzso is zzso in ten zzso with zzso ranging from 83 zzso to 4 zzso In addition, the gene contained one zzso in the zzso but none in the zzso Five of the 10 zzso sites of the zzso gene were fully zzso when compared to a related gene of zzso zzso whereas only one zzso site was identical to those found in zzso B zzso Furthermore, human zzso zzso with the zzso was expressed in zzso cells, and was found to be localized in zzso compartments as well as zzso into the medium suggesting the involvement of the zzso trafficking zzso Based on the high degree of zzso of the zzso acid sequences and zzso organization between zzso and zzso we suggest that both molecules may form a distinct group or family of zzso zzso
