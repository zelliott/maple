In higher plants, zzso starch zzso zzso zzso the zzso linkages of zzso and zzso We cloned an zzso starch zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso designated as zzso from common wheat zzso zzso using the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The open reading frame of zzso was found to have zzso zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence was found to share high similarity with those of other zzso plant zzso zzso It contains a putative transit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain (173 zzso zzso We extracted the expressed zzso protein from zzso coli zzso and measured starch zzso zzso During the wheat zzso period, transcripts of the zzso gene reached a maximum level at the early zzso stage, then declined, and increased again near the final maturation stage of the zzso We confirm that the zzso gene is present in common zzso it appears to play a role in starch synthesis during early and late stages of the zzso zzso
