The gene zzso zzso zzso Norway zzso zzso (Mr zzso a zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and successfully expressed in another zzso reducing bacteria, zzso zzso zzso The zzso named zzso is zzso and encodes a zzso precursor of 135 zzso acids with an extension at the zzso zzso of 24 zzso zzso This extension acts as a signal sequence which allows export across the zzso membrane into the zzso zzso zzso 73, which is in a close contact with the zzso sixth zzso zzso to the zzso 4 iron zzso has been replaced by a zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso is correctly folded and zzso A global increase of the zzso zzso of about 50 zzso is measured for the zzso zzso The zzso also has a strong influence on the interaction of the zzso with its zzso partner, the zzso This suggests, like the zzso zzso zzso (Mr 13, zzso zzso 4 is the interactive zzso in the zzso complex and that zzso of the zzso 4 environment can greatly affect the electron transfer reaction with its zzso zzso
