There are great demands on the stability, expression yield and resistance to zzso of zzso zzso To zzso intrinsic domain effects from domain zzso we present first a systematic evaluation of the isolated human zzso variable heavy zzso and light zzso zzso family consensus zzso and then a systematic series of zzso combinations in the zzso zzso The zzso were evaluated in terms of their expression behavior, zzso state in solution and zzso unfolding zzso under zzso zzso The seven zzso and seven zzso zzso represent the consensus sequences of the major human zzso zzso derived from the Human zzso zzso Library zzso The isolated zzso and zzso zzso with the highest zzso stability and yield of soluble protein were zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso on all domain combinations in zzso fragments allowed the zzso fragments to be classified according to zzso stability and in zzso folding zzso The zzso fragments containing the variable domain combinations zzso zzso zzso and zzso show superior properties concerning yield and zzso zzso interactions diminish the intrinsic differences of the zzso zzso fragments containing zzso zzso show high levels of stability, even though zzso zzso are surprisingly unstable by zzso This is due to a strong interaction with the zzso domain and depends on the zzso acid sequence of the zzso On the basis of these analyses and model structures, we suggest possibilities for further improvement of the zzso properties of individual zzso and give recommendations for library zzso
