zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a flagellate zzso was demonstrated to be zzso and zzso zzso protein from this strain was zzso to zzso and the zzso sequence zzso Using the zzso gene of zzso zzso as a probe, the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was identified and cloned into zzso zzso zzso of this zzso gene revealed that it encodes a protein of 272 zzso acids zzso zzso The predicted N terminal sequence of this protein was identical to that determined by zzso sequencing of the zzso protein from strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares zzso with other known zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso The middle portion, however, shows considerable differences, even from that of zzso from the related species, zzso zzso
