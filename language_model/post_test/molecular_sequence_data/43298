Recently the determination of the zzso sequences of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the first zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Between zzso of the genes were found to code for proteins to which no function could be zzso We describe an approach which combines zzso analysis zzso of expressed proteins isolated by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso to the zzso with genetic zzso to study the complex pattern of protein regulation occurring in zzso coli in response to zzso zzso We have previously described the zzso of eight spots on two-dimensional zzso gels in response to zzso zzso and the assignment of six of these to entries in the zzso coli zzso sequence zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1996, zzso zzso Here we describe the identification of the remaining two proteins which are zzso in a zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso coli zzso zzso protein spots were cut from multiple zzso gels collected and run on a modified funnel gel to concentrate the proteins and remove the sodium zzso zzso before zzso The zzso masses obtained from the zzso were used to search the zzso database or a zzso translation of the zzso DNA database using a zzso mass zzso zzso A digest can be zzso after zzso exchange to obtain a second, zzso data set to increase the confidence level of protein zzso The zzso of the remaining unidentified proteins were used for zzso zzso generation using either zzso zzso in a zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso or zzso zzso zzso coupled mass zzso zzso with triple stage zzso or zzso trap mass zzso The zzso were used as zzso zzso fingerprints to search the zzso and zzso zzso
