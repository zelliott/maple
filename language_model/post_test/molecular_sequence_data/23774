In recent clinical trials in patients with zzso melanoma, adoptive transfer of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso tumor zzso To better understand the role of individual T cell clones in zzso tumor regression, a zzso zzso technique was used to determine the distribution of zzso zzso V region sequences expressed in the transferred cells as well as in tumor samples and circulating zzso from melanoma patients following adoptive cell zzso We found that dominant T cell clones were present in the in zzso and transferred zzso zzso samples and certain T cell clones including the dominant T cell clones persisted at relatively high levels in the peripheral blood of the patients that demonstrated clinical responses to adoptive zzso However, these dominant clones were either zzso or present at a very low level in the zzso tumor samples used for zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrated that there was selective growth and survival, both in zzso and in zzso of individual T cell clones from a relatively small number of T cells in the original tumor zzso These results suggest that the persistent T cell clones played an active role in zzso tumor zzso and that zzso zzso analysis may provide an important tool for the analysis of the role of individual T cell clones in zzso tumor zzso A similar analysis may also be useful for monitoring zzso zzso
