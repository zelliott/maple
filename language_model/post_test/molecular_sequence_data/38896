zzso severe combined zzso zzso is a rare and potentially fatal disease caused by zzso of zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso gamma chain, a component of multiple zzso receptors that are essential for zzso development and zzso To date, over 100 different zzso of zzso resulting in zzso have been zzso Using zzso direct DNA sequencing of a single zzso zzso containing the whole zzso zzso we found zzso zzso in 78 previously unpublished unrelated cases of zzso We report 37 newly identified zzso of zzso including 23 point zzso 10 small zzso 3 instances of the same single zzso zzso 1 large zzso and 2 complex zzso More than half of the zzso zzso of zzso were predicted to result in unstable zzso zzso The remaining 14 zzso disrupted zzso functional motifs common to all zzso zzso family members; changed protein zzso charge, or zzso or altered the zzso portion of the zzso which is critical for proper interaction with zzso molecules including zzso family zzso zzso zzso
