Many zzso and zzso proteins have a zzso loop zzso the primary structure of which typically consists of a zzso sequence followed by a zzso zzso and a zzso or zzso The three-dimensional structures of several zzso and zzso proteins containing zzso have now been zzso In this review current knowledge of zzso is discussed with the additional aim of illustrating the fascinating relationship between protein zzso structure and zzso
