A common feature of all zzso cells is the presence of zzso proteins that assemble into an intermediate filament zzso zzso Whereas other cell types often use a specific master zzso factor to coordinate cell zzso transcription, analysis of zzso regulation of zzso genes suggests that specific groupings of widely expressed zzso factors, acting on clusters of recognition elements in the promoter regions, zzso zzso zzso We define such a cluster of three sites that binds five zzso factors in the human zzso zzso zzso Within this zzso an unusual zzso site binds the zzso zzso factor and two additional zzso zzso the zzso site are an zzso site and another zzso Site zzso each binds a zzso zzso Similar clusters of recognition sites for the same five zzso factors have been also identified in other zzso zzso Such clusters may play a role in zzso expression of zzso
