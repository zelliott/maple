In zzso protein function can be modulated by zzso to zzso or to zzso proteins zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is only zzso identical to zzso but is zzso identical to the zzso protein zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso to cellular zzso and protein zzso to zzso is involved in many zzso zzso It remained unknown, however, whether zzso of zzso from proteins is also zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso proteins from zzso and zzso but not from zzso zzso is unrelated to any known zzso zzso but shows distant similarity to certain viral zzso indicating the existence of a widely zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso are present in many organisms, including several human zzso The pattern of zzso proteins in zzso changes markedly throughout the cell cycle, and specific zzso accumulate in zzso zzso zzso has several functions, including an essential role in the zzso phase of the cell zzso
