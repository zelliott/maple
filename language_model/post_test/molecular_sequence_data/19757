An zzso zzso zzso genetic element, zzso as zzso has been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso strain and was zzso This genetic element is a zzso DNA of zzso zzso in size and contains eight open reading frames zzso It resembles members of the zzso zzso family in zzso organization but shows only weak similarity to the latter in zzso zzso zzso has a zzso gene similar to that of a zzso zzso encodes a large replication protein which, unlike a typical zzso zzso contains no zzso domain, and lacks the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso encodes an zzso zzso which probably zzso the integration of its zzso into a specific site (a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso can be packaged into a zzso viral particle and spread with the help of zzso or zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso appeared to replicate more efficiently in the presence of zzso Given the versatile genetic abilities, zzso appears to be well suited for a role in horizontal gene zzso
