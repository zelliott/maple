zzso A is an integral component of the zzso zzso that forms the selective and protective outer zzso of zzso bacteria, and is essential for bacterial growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso by catalyzing the transfer of zzso acid from zzso carrier protein to the zzso group of zzso The zzso is a zzso and previous studies suggested that the active site lies within a positively charged zzso formed at the zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso coli zzso in complex with zzso reveals details of the zzso site, with prominent zzso interactions between highly zzso clusters of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso These interactions serve to bind and orient the zzso for zzso The zzso model supports previous results, which suggest that zzso occurs via zzso attack of zzso zzso on the zzso donor in a general zzso mechanism involving a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the general base, interacts with the zzso group of zzso to generate the zzso The zzso zzso accepts a hydrogen bond from zzso and helps orient the general base to participate in zzso Comparisons with an zzso inhibitor complex indicate that the zzso competes with both zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso
