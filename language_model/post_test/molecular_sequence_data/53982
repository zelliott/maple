zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso that was first isolated from zzso zzso extracts on the basis of its ability to stimulate zzso formation in anterior zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone releasing zzso zzso The sequence of zzso has been remarkably well zzso during the evolution from zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the regulation of important biological zzso zzso is widely distributed in the brain and peripheral zzso notably in the zzso zzso zzso and respiratory and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor has revealed the existence of a zzso zzso whose activity remains zzso Two types of zzso binding sites have been zzso Type I binding sites exhibit a high affinity for zzso and a much lower affinity for zzso whereas type II binding sites have similar affinity for zzso and zzso zzso cloning of zzso receptors has shown the existence of three distinct zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso which is coupled to several zzso systems, and the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are primarily coupled to zzso zzso zzso receptors are particularly abundant in the brain and zzso and adrenal zzso whereas zzso receptors are expressed mainly in the zzso liver, and zzso The wide distribution of zzso and zzso receptors has led to an explosion of studies aimed at determining the pharmacological effects and biological functions of the zzso This report reviews the current knowledge concerning the multiple actions of zzso in the central nervous system and in various peripheral zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso and the cardiovascular and immune systems, as well as the different effects of zzso on a number of tumor cell zzso
