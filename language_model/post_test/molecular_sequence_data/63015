zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in both classical and alternate zzso Lower organisms zzso and zzso have multiple zzso whereas higher organisms have a single zzso zzso In zzso a closely related protein zzso zzso factor zzso is expressed in their zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso To understand the origin of these proteins and their similarity to zzso zzso we examined zzso proteins in the zzso Here we describe the complete zzso sequences of two zzso zzso and zzso of complement zzso found in zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of molecular zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso These zzso display the overall domain structure of complement zzso zzso zzso quantitative analysis shows that there is a zzso difference in their zzso expression zzso We also demonstrate by Southern zzso experiments that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the liver zzso zzso and zzso are the products of four individual zzso The putative promoter regions of these four genes are highly similar ( approximately zzso zzso to each zzso These genes represent a unique case where despite being identical at the zzso level, exhibit tissue specificity and differential gene zzso These genes offer a system to identify the zzso regulatory proteins that are responsible for the zzso expression of complement zzso in liver and zzso expression of zzso genes in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
