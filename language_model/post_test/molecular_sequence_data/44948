The human zzso virus type 1 zzso protein enhances virus particle release from infected cells, decreases the tendency of zzso formation and zzso degradation of human zzso zzso It is known that the zzso part of zzso is responsible for direct interaction to and degradation of zzso The zzso fold of the zzso zzso domain in zzso solution was determined employing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found a very well defined zzso zzso in the membrane zzso part zzso a less well defined zzso zzso and a short zzso at the zzso zzso We further determined the overall zzso structure based on long-range nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso of results from zzso experiments of zzso and the structure data is zzso
