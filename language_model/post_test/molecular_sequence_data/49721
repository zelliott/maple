The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso play a pivotal role in many aspects of cellular functions, and are zzso zzso from zzso to zzso In zzso there are four zzso members in the zzso Each zzso has its own zzso zzso and zzso In order to achieve normal cellular functions, the zzso zzso should zzso signals with high efficiency and zzso However, the molecular basis for the mechanism underlying the specific reactions in the zzso zzso has not been fully zzso The zzso form a zzso structure without a distinct domain specific for zzso zzso Recent studies revealed two mechanisms regulating the zzso the zzso interaction and the zzso The zzso interaction is achieved through the common zzso domain (the CD zzso on zzso and is different from a transient zzso interaction through the active zzso of the zzso Almost all the zzso molecules have a zzso motif interacting with the CD zzso The scaffolding usually zzso a third zzso to zzso several components of the zzso zzso Both of them are thought to regulate the zzso specificity and zzso
