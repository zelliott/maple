A putative zzso sequence zzso has been cloned and zzso The zzso element was found between the zzso and the zzso genes in the upstream region of the nicotine zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso It is flanked by an imperfect repeat of 33 zzso and carries two overlapping open reading frames which, by programmed zzso zzso zzso may produce a zzso of zzso Da with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein is similar to the zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso zzso all members of the zzso zzso The putative zzso element was found as a single copy in the zzso zzso and absent on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Similar sequences were detected by zzso on total DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
