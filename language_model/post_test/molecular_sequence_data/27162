zzso zzso fatty acids zzso are essential for zzso zzso growth and zzso To identify factors acting downstream of zzso for their function in growth regulation, we conducted a genetic screen for zzso of the zzso arrest that occurs in animals depleted of the zzso zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso defined an unexpected player, the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso family of proteins that are implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso but not other zzso zzso has a specific role in zzso the regulatory activity of zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso in zzso also suppress the zzso caused by zzso of the first step in zzso zzso We further showed that the fatty acid zzso of zzso contain zzso zzso and that this fraction is greatly diminished in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest a model in which a zzso zzso may mediate the regulatory functions of zzso and is zzso regulated by zzso in zzso zzso This work indicates a novel connection between a zzso zzso and the critical regulatory function of a specific fatty zzso
