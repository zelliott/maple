Five new genes were identified in the growth and reproduction complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The class zzso zzso and zzso genes have five distinct zzso zzso 4, 5, 6, 7) similar to other class I major zzso complex genes but the conventional zzso 2 and 3 are zzso The genes are zzso similar, have zzso and zzso boxes much upstream of the conventional position, obey the zzso rule in their zzso zzso and are transcribed at a low level in zzso and zzso but not in the liver and zzso The region between zzso 1 and zzso 4 was analyzed by obtaining transcripts by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification which revealed the presence of four alternatively spliced zzso transcripts of zzso 1) zzso zzso 14 and zzso has no zzso between zzso 1 and 4; 2) zzso zzso 7 and 8) has an zzso of 45 zzso that can translate into 15 zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso 5) has an zzso of 42 zzso with a stop zzso and 4) zzso zzso 10) has two zzso of 42 and 38 zzso respectively, with stop zzso Only one zzso zzso transcript was zzso and it has an zzso of 45 zzso between zzso 1 and zzso 4 which can form a zzso identical to the zzso zzso for that zzso The 45 zzso zzso between zzso 1 and zzso 4 was unique for zzso and zzso and only matched a sequence in the zzso zzso region zzso zzso - zzso The three zzso zzso genes are zzso - zzso zzso they are related to the genes zzso zzso protein zzso of the black rat and the zzso genes of the mouse and the human and to the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and other members of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located just outside of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are in the zzso and have multiple stop zzso in their zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript was identified by zzso in the zzso and zzso but not in the liver and zzso
