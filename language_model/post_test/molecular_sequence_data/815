zzso regulatory peptides zzso and zzso are derived from distinct regions of zzso a zzso protein that was originally identified as a product of a nerve growth zzso gene in rat zzso zzso The zzso acid length of human zzso is 26, and that of rat zzso is zzso Human and rat zzso are both 38 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the storage zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of both rats and zzso Administration of zzso suppresses zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso release from the zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is a precursor of multiple zzso peptides with diverse neuroendocrine functions, and zzso are novel zzso peptides involved in the control of body fluid zzso by regulating zzso zzso
