The selective association of the zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso domain is a model for differential positive zzso control by zzso zzso zzso discriminates between the closely related zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by distinguishing among their seven zzso zzso these differences lie on the surface that is thought to be accessible when the zzso domain is bound to zzso Only two of these seven differences are recognized by zzso one in each of the first two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The major zzso for selective association with zzso in zzso and zzso positive control in zzso is a single zzso acid zzso at position 22 in the first zzso of the zzso zzso domain, but the zzso properties of this zzso are not critical for association with zzso in zzso or in zzso because it can be replaced by zzso with little or no deleterious zzso Mere replacement of the single corresponding zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain with the key zzso acid zzso is sufficient to zzso on the zzso zzso domain the ability to associate with zzso in zzso and respond to zzso positive control in zzso Thus, the specificity of zzso domain positive control can be zzso by a single zzso acid zzso
