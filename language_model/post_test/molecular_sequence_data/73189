zzso activity of the zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso gene was investigated in zzso cells zzso with zzso reporter zzso having successively deleted zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by the amounts of zzso zzso from the reporter zzso zzso of the sequence from zzso to zzso or zzso base pairs zzso increased zzso activity from 100 to 138 or zzso Further deletion from zzso to zzso zzso which contained an zzso site, decreased zzso activity to zzso zzso introduced into the zzso decreased zzso activity from 136 to zzso These findings suggested that the zzso increased zzso zzso When the sequence from zzso to zzso zzso was deleted, zzso activity was restored from 87 to zzso When this sequence was linked to the zzso zzso promoter, it also decreased zzso activity by zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not significantly alter zzso zzso Further deletion of the zzso sequences from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso dramatically decreased zzso activity from 135 to 87 and zzso zzso These findings indicate that multiple DNA zzso especially those in the zzso zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso activity of the zzso zzso
