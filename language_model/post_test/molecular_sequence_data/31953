Here we report results from a zzso zzso evaluation of four different zzso methods targeting the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso originally developed to detect zzso zzso contamination in coastal zzso The methods included a conventional zzso zzso method, a zzso Green zzso method, and two zzso zzso zzso Different techniques for data zzso and analysis were zzso Data analysis methods had a pronounced impact on zzso sensitivity and specificity zzso zzso zzso of metrics including the lower limit of zzso zzso target detected but not quantifiable zzso and target not detected zzso significantly improved results compared to results submitted by individual laboratories prior to definition zzso The unit of measure used for data zzso also had a pronounced effect on measured zzso zzso Data zzso to DNA mass improved quantitative method performance as compared to zzso zzso The zzso methods tested here were originally designed for zzso but were found in this study to also detect feces from other birds, particularly feces zzso from zzso zzso efforts showed that some pigeon feces from California contained sequences similar to zzso zzso found in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso geographic zzso and ecology of zzso zzso in host birds other than zzso require further zzso This study represents an important first step in the zzso assessment of these methods and highlights the need to broaden and zzso additional evaluations, including environmentally relevant target zzso in ambient waters from diverse geographic zzso
