zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Separate genes zzso the two zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is only activated during zzso cell zzso This stimulation allows for the formation of zzso zzso The zzso region of the mouse zzso gene was studied in order to define its zzso function in zzso zzso zzso binding sites for the zzso nuclear factors zzso zzso and zzso were identified within the first zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso region alone did not efficiently activate transient expression in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Additional DNA regulatory sequences found within zzso upstream of the zzso start site were required for zzso zzso zzso even though these regions zzso similar expression in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that zzso elements present in the zzso region are not responsible for maintenance of zzso zzso in zzso cell lines and that zzso regulation of zzso depends on other regions of the gene or on zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso factor 1 zzso response element was identified within the zzso upstream zzso zzso two zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso and a region located within zzso to zzso of the mouse zzso promoter were essential for zzso zzso during chemically induced differentiation of zzso cells, zzso their importance in zzso zzso specificity to the zzso zzso zzso This is the first study to zzso the zzso region responsible for zzso of the zzso promoter upon zzso induction in zzso zzso
