zzso of zzso zzso unless its zzso part is zzso by the protein export zzso Here we show that the sequence motif zzso that includes a specific arrest point zzso causes zzso arrest within the zzso zzso that bypass the zzso arrest were isolated in zzso zzso and zzso r zzso Such zzso zzso occurred at a few specific zzso of these zzso which all face the zzso zzso of the zzso exit zzso Thus, we suggest that this region of the exit tunnel interacts with nascent translation products and functions as a discriminating zzso
