zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso groups were prepared in an efficient manner starting from readily available zzso zzso zzso and zzso reactions of these compounds with zzso and zzso were zzso zzso conditions leading to the formation of the respective zzso zzso (up to zzso isolated zzso and to zzso zzso zzso with zzso unprotected (up to zzso isolated zzso were zzso Basing on these results, a novel approach for effective differentiation of zzso system and zzso group in zzso zzso was zzso The selectively protected derivatives prepared are valuable building blocks for the assembly of linear and zzso zzso
