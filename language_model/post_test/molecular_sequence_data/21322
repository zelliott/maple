zzso is the precursor for fatty acid synthesis and zzso It is also one of the building blocks for the zzso of some zzso zzso and many zzso zzso In plants as well as in animals, zzso is almost exclusively derived from zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, previous studies have suggested that zzso may also be made directly from zzso acid by zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso protein showed high activity against zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but little or no activity against other zzso or fatty acids zzso zzso zzso acid was toxic to zzso zzso and caused zzso of zzso and zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also grew poorly and accumulated zzso and zzso zzso These defects were zzso by an zzso zzso or by a bacterial zzso zzso gene under control of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is essential for healthy growth and development, probably because it is required for the zzso of zzso
