zzso pig zzso is a recently described member of the zzso family of zzso and is involved in a guinea pig model of zzso To determine whether zzso is a distinctive member of this family and to understand its zzso role, we have cloned the mouse zzso gene and determined its structure and aspects of its zzso zzso The sequence relationship between the mouse and guinea pig genes indicates that zzso is indeed a distinct member of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso maps to a region of mouse zzso 11 that encodes other zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso protein has direct zzso properties for zzso The zzso gene is widely (but not zzso expressed in normal mice and is strongly induced in cultured zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso is also induced locally in response to the transplantation of zzso zzso tumor cells, indicating that it likely contributes to the zzso recruitment and zzso effect of zzso zzso Such responses suggest that zzso may be involved in multiple inflammatory zzso
