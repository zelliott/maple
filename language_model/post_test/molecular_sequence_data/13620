To facilitate characterization of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso we have developed an affinity labeling zzso zzso affinity zzso which allows specific labeling of zzso binding sites in adrenal plasma zzso at high zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso group was attached to the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso and the zzso derivatives were zzso at zzso to obtain affinity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso labeling was carried out in a zzso fashion as zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso acid zzso or zzso to block zzso zzso zzso the affinity zzso was allowed to bind to the zzso at 0 degrees C for 1 zzso and zzso the zzso were washed to remove zzso zzso and were incubated at room temperature to effect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso followed by zzso revealed specific labeling of a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso the labeling yields were estimated to be zzso zzso and zzso for the reactions with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso labeling by the zzso procedure using zzso was zzso greater than that obtained by zzso labeling using zzso and zzso greater than that by direct zzso using zzso and zzso under comparable zzso zzso of the membrane protein labeled with zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave single zzso bands with apparent masses of 40, 18, and 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso separation of the zzso also gave single major zzso The confinement of the affinity label to one major zzso in each digest suggests that the zzso occurred at a single or a limited number of zzso The zzso affinity labeling with the high zzso yield and specificity may be useful for analyzing the zzso zzso binding site zzso
