We report the synthesis of collagen related peptides containing the zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso peptides behave as type III collagen zzso supporting zzso zzso while the zzso which does not exhibit a zzso zzso zzso type III zzso human zzso zzso The incorporation of the zzso sequence in type III collagen zzso peptides may lead to the loss of the zzso activity for a zzso zzso
