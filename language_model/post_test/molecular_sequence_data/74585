Although protein Z zzso has a domain arrangement similar to the essential zzso proteins zzso zzso FX, and protein C, its zzso zzso zzso domain is incomplete and does not exhibit zzso zzso We have generated a trial sequence of putative activated protein Z zzso by identifying zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain that might reasonably resurrect the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso The structure of the activated form was then modeled based on the proposed sequence using zzso modeling and zzso molecular dynamics zzso In zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso to the putative active site of zzso zzso along with structural comparison with its zzso zzso suggest that the designed zzso can possibly act as a zzso zzso
