The design and characterization of an open zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The design strategy involves the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which successive zzso are zzso by appropriately positioned zzso zzso zzso zzso using a single zzso zzso positioned at the center of the zzso strand results in a zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso effects firmly establish an zzso zzso in zzso In water, the outer strands are zzso but a zzso zzso zzso stabilized by a zzso bridge and a zzso cluster is determined from zzso zzso zzso of the precursor zzso with the zzso zzso reveals considerable enhancement of zzso content in the latter, suggesting that the zzso zzso is an effective strategy for the stabilization of zzso
