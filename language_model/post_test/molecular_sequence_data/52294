The growth functions of the zzso G protein zzso was studied by expression in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso to convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso in G protein zzso is thought to persistently activate G proteins by zzso their zzso zzso The wild type and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso These cells do not contain any measurable amounts of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of wild type or zzso zzso zzso under the control of a zzso promoter results in zzso zzso of the zzso and expression of the zzso The zzso but not wild type zzso stimulates zzso in zzso zzso without significantly stimulating zzso C zzso Continuous expression of zzso zzso zzso focus formation, whereas zzso with zzso alone or zzso containing the native zzso zzso were without significant transforming effect in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce focus formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are capable of zzso growth, as assessed by colony formation in soft zzso zzso transformed cells induced tumors when injected into zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso whose zzso activity is presumably inhibited can induce the zzso transformation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso
