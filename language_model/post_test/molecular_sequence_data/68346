zzso at the zzso locus of zzso zzso results in a complex zzso the most dramatic aspect of which being the abnormal flowers produced in zzso zzso zzso flowers show a random loss of floral zzso and organ development is zzso The zzso gene appears to be required in the floral zzso for correct initiation of floral organ zzso and for proper development of organ zzso Loss of zzso function also affects flowering time and leaf zzso Using a zzso derived by zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso gene and found that it encodes a protein zzso zzso with a novel zzso zzso This protein zzso gene identifies a novel zzso zzso used during development in zzso
