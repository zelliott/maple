We determined that a pigeon zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses two anchor zzso 46 and 54, for binding with the zzso zzso that are compatible to the position 1 zzso and position 9 zzso of the core region in the major zzso complex zzso class II binding zzso zzso In the present study to analyze each binding site between zzso and zzso of zzso to either zzso or T cell zzso zzso zzso we investigated T cell responses to a series of peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso charged zzso acid zzso for the zzso at zzso to zzso of zzso T cells from zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso or zzso did not mount appreciable zzso responses to the zzso but those primed with other peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed substantial responses in an zzso zzso It was demonstrated by binding studies that zzso and zzso functioned as main anchors and zzso and zzso functioned as secondary anchors to zzso zzso of zzso usage of T cell lines specific for these zzso suggested that zzso interacts with the zzso region 1 zzso of the zzso beta zzso Furthermore, sequencing of the zzso on T cell zzso specific for these zzso indicated that zzso interacts with the zzso of the zzso beta zzso The present findings are consistent with the three-dimensional structure of the zzso complex that has been reported for zzso class I zzso
