Random zzso were generated in the sequence for the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the coding sequence for the zzso leaders fused upstream of the zzso reporter in zzso and transformed into zzso coli, and white colonies were zzso Twelve single base pair changes were found at different positions in the zzso zzso in zzso white colonies zzso Seven of the 12 zzso leaders allowed zzso of abundant zzso zzso These zzso zzso leaders were zzso into an zzso expression cassette and transformed into the zzso of zzso zzso and into zzso zzso In zzso zzso growth rates and in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity varied considerably between different zzso but were remarkably similar for a given zzso expressed in the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The variable effect of the zzso on zzso reporter expression and their complete abolition of zzso reporter expression in zzso coli suggests differences in the interaction between the zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso coding zzso Several zzso zzso zzso affected the predicted folding pattern of the zzso by weakening the stability of stem zzso zzso secondary zzso generated to restore these structures in the second stem suppressed the loss of reporter activity caused by the original zzso Additional zzso zzso that were predicted to further strengthen zzso or weaken zzso the second stem of the zzso leader both resulted in reduced reporter zzso This genetic evidence combined with differences between zzso and zzso zzso melting profiles and zzso zzso protection gel shifts further indicate that the predicted zzso folding pattern in the zzso is likely to play an essential role in translation zzso
