The zzso outer membrane of zzso cells contains zzso zzso channels zzso also termed zzso Three zzso from wheat zzso zzso were isolated and zzso zzso zzso They share zzso similarity of their zzso acid zzso and therefore they probably represent zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of one of the zzso was found to be identical to the zzso zzso protein from wheat zzso zzso Secondary structure analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the three zzso zzso revealed a characteristic alpha zzso at their zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso The transcript levels of zzso 1 in all wheat zzso is at least zzso higher than zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso 2 has a low level of expression in all floral zzso whereas zzso 3 is highly expressed in zzso This is the first report on differential expression of zzso genes in zzso The zzso genes have been mapped on the wheat zzso zzso 1 is located on the long arm of zzso 5, zzso 2 on the long arm of zzso 1 and zzso 3 on the long arm of zzso zzso A zzso reconstruction indicates that zzso genes underwent numerous zzso events throughout their zzso All zzso occurred after the separation of plants from animals and zzso and no zzso genes are shared among zzso Within plants, some of the zzso gene zzso probably occurred before the zzso zzso
