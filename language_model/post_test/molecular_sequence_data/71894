We have cloned from rat brain a family of alternatively spliced zzso from a single zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso having variations at the zzso including both coding and zzso zzso This produces two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which differ at their zzso zzso The zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso revealed no zzso transport function but reduced functional expression of zzso when both zzso were expressed in the same zzso Thus, zzso potentially functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso reduced their transport zzso No reduction was found with the zzso zzso zzso Alternative zzso zzso of zzso suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic zzso
