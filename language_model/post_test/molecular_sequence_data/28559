We have investigated the functional consequences of three zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with different forms of zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced into human zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso or zzso cells (with zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced current density in both expression systems without changing single channel zzso zzso and zzso protein were expressed in zzso cells but failed to yield inward zzso currents zzso However, zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso and zzso shifted the zzso relationship to more positive zzso and enhanced zzso during zzso zzso (3 zzso and pulse trains zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso also slowed recovery from zzso Single channel recordings revealed a change in fast channel gating for zzso evident as a decrease in the mean open zzso Our data support the hypothesis that a pronounced loss of zzso zzso channel function zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso and zzso form at least partially functional zzso
