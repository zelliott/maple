zzso zzso are present in both plant and animal zzso and represents a growing family of zzso zzso These tiny zzso act as small guides and direct negative regulations usually in the process of development through sequence zzso to target zzso Although a large number of zzso have been identified from various animals, so far plant zzso studies have focused mainly on zzso Here we describe the identification of 20 zzso from a rice zzso zzso All the zzso were presumably processed from precursors with zzso structures and were positively detected in rice cells from at least one zzso some of which showed zzso zzso zzso unique rice genes were identified to be feasible targets for seven rice zzso including four members of zzso zzso factor, the targets of zzso that had been characterized in zzso zzso long zzso the regulatory targets of 13 zzso remain to be further zzso A possible mechanism of zzso zzso for plant zzso that lack perfect zzso to target zzso is zzso
