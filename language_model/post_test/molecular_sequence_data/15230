The present study investigated the zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso bacterial diversity in a weathered zzso sample collected from the deep subsurface zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gold mine in zzso South zzso zzso Chemical characterization of the sample by X-ray zzso zzso revealed a high amount of toxic heavy metals such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso community structures were determined by zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences retrieved from enrichment cultures growing in presence of zzso cellulose as the sole source of zzso All zzso retrieved from enrichment cultures were affiliated to zzso zzso zzso and zzso pure cultures belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from enrichment cultures, and selected cultures were studied for zzso zzso For a zzso isolate zzso the optimum pH and temperature for zzso zzso zzso were zzso and 55 degrees C, while for a zzso isolate zzso they were zzso and 75 degrees C, zzso Furthermore, zzso retained about zzso zzso activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 8 zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso retained zzso zzso activity at 60 degrees C up to a period of 300 zzso Overall, the present work revealed the presence of different zzso bacterial lineages in the unique deep subsurface environment of the zzso The results also have strong implications for biological conversion of cellulosic agricultural and zzso zzso to commodity chemicals including zzso
