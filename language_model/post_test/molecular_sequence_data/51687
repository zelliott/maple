A zzso library was prepared from the bulk zzso of mature wheat zzso and screened with mixed zzso zzso zzso that zzso parts of the partial zzso sequence for the zzso zzso zzso Each DNA insert in 11 zzso from a screen of zzso plaques zzso a zzso untranslated and a 3' untranslated region, in addition to an open reading frame (of 81 zzso zzso which, in every case, corresponded to at least 56 of the 59 zzso acids in the partial zzso sequence previously determined for the zzso zzso The three different zzso sequences zzso in the zzso probably zzso to zzso genes in the A, B and D zzso of zzso zzso A wheat zzso library was screened with zzso zzso and gave a single positive in a screen of 5 zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and a cap site for the zzso zzso was determined by primer zzso The zzso sequence encodes an zzso zzso for the zzso protein and contains appreciable amounts of zzso and 3' zzso zzso In addition to a putative zzso box, two zzso sequences and one zzso zzso the zzso flank in zzso contains a sequence similar to the zzso element in other zzso genes but does not contain sequences similar to the zzso elements in animal zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso shows that zzso of zzso zzso is abundant in immature zzso zzso in zzso zzso and can be induced by adding zzso acid, but not by adding zzso to the medium in which mature wheat zzso are zzso The findings suggest that the wheat zzso zzso zzso like zzso liver zzso zzso are conspicuously expressed during zzso
