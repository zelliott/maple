We report the identification of a zzso zzso of zzso a member of the family of zzso domain containing zzso These type I zzso proteins share the presence of zzso signals in their zzso tail as one common zzso We show that an alternatively spliced transcript of zzso is generated by differential processing of a composite zzso zzso This zzso zzso encodes a protein with an zzso zzso domain followed by a zzso module and a zzso domain identical with the already described zzso zzso but a divergent zzso zzso In contrast to the known zzso regions of the related zzso this zzso zzso contains no zzso or sorting zzso
