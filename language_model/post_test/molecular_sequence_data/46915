Little information is available zzso the structural properties of peptides with their zzso in terms of responses via zzso T zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso consisting of two copies of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the fusion protein of the zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso was able to induce zzso zzso responses in the absence of any zzso and zzso zzso The present work was undertaken to gain insight into structural features of the zzso zzso that may be important in zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso data, obtained in a buffer of zzso zzso strength and zzso strongly suggest a zzso state for the zzso which was confirmed by a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso association is accompanied by loss of overall zzso zzso zzso studies show that the unfolding of zzso zzso is significantly more pronounced than the unfolding of isolated zzso zzso zzso data, together with zzso limited zzso suggest the presence of a charged zzso acid within the zzso zzso This study should provide a basis for engineering more effective zzso peptides against the zzso virus by increasing the stability of the zzso zzso
