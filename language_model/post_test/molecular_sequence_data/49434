zzso lethal toxin produced by the zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of death in animals infected with zzso One component of this zzso lethal factor zzso zzso members of the zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso family through zzso of their zzso zzso However, neither the zzso requirements for zzso zzso nor the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso have been zzso By means of deletion zzso analysis and zzso zzso we have identified an zzso zzso interacting zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso adjacent to the zzso region, which is essential for zzso zzso of zzso Point zzso in this region block zzso but do not alter the zzso activity of zzso Similar zzso in zzso also prevent zzso indicating that this region is functionally zzso among zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was found to reduce not only the affinity of zzso for its zzso zzso protein zzso but also its intrinsic zzso activity, indicating that the zzso end of zzso is important not only for zzso interaction but also for zzso zzso
