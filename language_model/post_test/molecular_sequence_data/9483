zzso comparative zzso approaches have been employed to map and clone many important disease resistance zzso genes from zzso zzso wild relatives of potato and zzso These efforts will increase with the recent release of potato zzso sequence and the impending release of tomato zzso zzso Most R genes belong to the prominent zzso binding zzso rich repeat zzso class and zzso zzso protein motifs enable survey of the R gene space of a plant zzso by generation of resistance gene zzso zzso zzso chain reaction fragments derived from R zzso We generated a collection of 97 zzso from the zzso wild potato zzso zzso zzso smaller collections from other zzso zzso To further comparative zzso approaches, we combined all known zzso zzso and cloned zzso zzso gene zzso nearly 800 sequences in total, into a single zzso We defined R gene diversity bins that reflect both evolutionary relationships and DNA zzso zzso The resulting framework is zzso and zzso providing the research community with a common vocabulary for present and future study of R gene zzso Through a series of sequence and zzso experiments, we demonstrate that all tested R gene lineages are of ancient origin, are shared between zzso species, and can be successfully zzso via comparative zzso zzso
