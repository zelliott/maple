A serum zzso similar to the zzso protein which appears during zzso induced cardiac zzso in rats, was identified in human serum by Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso protein zzso The rat protein zzso gave a very strong positive signal when reacted with zzso obtained from cardiac patients, suggesting an induced level of this protein in patients' zzso when compared to normal zzso from healthy zzso Multiple injections of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso animals completely inhibited the development of cardiac zzso suggesting that this protein could be zzso zzso This was further substantiated by the decrease in the expression of a molecular marker such as the beta zzso heavy chain gene in zzso but zzso zzso Further, the presence of high levels of this protein in zzso and zzso zzso animals is also suggestive of the zzso nature of this protein as the heart is subjected to high pressure overload immediately after zzso
