The zzso zzso b genes in the zzso and zzso zzso carp as well as zzso common carp were isolated and completely zzso Their DNA sequences were compared with those derived from the zzso b genes of the red zzso zzso Japanese zzso zzso and common carp with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the sister relationships between zzso and zzso red zzso zzso between the zzso zzso carp and zzso Japanese zzso zzso and between zzso common carp and zzso common zzso Our results indicated the zzso b genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso common carp were zzso zzso Through maternal zzso the zzso b gene in the zzso zzso displayed extremely high similarity to that in the female parent red zzso carp after 11 generations (from F1 to zzso zzso Since the establishment of the new zzso stocks has great significance in analyzing evolutionary theory of zzso and in improving aquaculture industry, analysis of the zzso b gene and the zzso of the variation of the zzso b gene DNA in different zzso prove that zzso b is a useful genetic marker to monitor the variations in the progeny of the zzso
