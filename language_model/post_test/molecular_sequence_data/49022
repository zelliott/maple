The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso encodes a highly zzso regulatory gene product, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is incorporated into zzso In the infected cells, zzso expressed late in the virus cycle, is believed to function in the early zzso of zzso zzso such as nuclear migration of zzso complex, zzso of the zzso zzso viral zzso by blocking cells in zzso phase and regulation of zzso zzso zzso has a critical role in long term AIDS disease by inducing infection in zzso cells such as zzso and zzso To gain insight into the zzso relationships of zzso the zzso protein was zzso with 22 labeled zzso zzso Its zzso structure was analyzed in the presence of zzso and in pure water at low pH and refined by restrained simulated zzso The structure of the protein is characterized by three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso surrounded by flexible N and zzso zzso In contrast to the structure obtained in the presence of zzso the three zzso are folded around a zzso core constituted of zzso zzso Val and aromatic zzso as illustrated by numerous long range zzso This structure accounts for the interaction of zzso with different zzso
