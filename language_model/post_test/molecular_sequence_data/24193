zzso responsive factors zzso are important in regulating plant pathogen resistance, zzso stress tolerance and plant zzso Recent studies have greatly enlarged the zzso protein family and revealed more important roles of zzso in zzso Here, we report our finding of a tomato zzso protein zzso which is zzso zzso by zzso salicylic acid, or zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso specifically interacts in zzso with the zzso box, an element present in the promoters of many zzso zzso zzso Further investigation zzso that zzso activates in zzso the expression of reporter zzso gene controlled by zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso in tobacco and tomato zzso activates the expression of zzso zzso and subsequently enhancing transgenic plant resistance to the bacterial zzso caused by zzso zzso strain zzso Therefore our investigation not only extends the functions of zzso proteins in plant resistance to zzso zzso but also provides further clues to understanding the mechanism of host regulatory proteins in response to the infection of zzso
