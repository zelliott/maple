zzso comparison of in zzso evolved proteins with biological proteins will help determine the extent to which biological proteins sample the structural diversity available in protein sequence zzso We have previously isolated a family of zzso zzso binding proteins from an zzso random sequence zzso One of these proteins was further zzso for zzso binding to zzso but zzso characterization proved impossible due to poor zzso To determine if such zzso proteins can be zzso for improved folding stability, we performed multiple rounds of zzso selection under increasingly zzso zzso Starting from a pool of protein zzso we evolved a population of proteins capable of binding zzso in 3 M zzso zzso One protein was chosen for further zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescence, and zzso correlation zzso studies show that this protein has a unique folded zzso
