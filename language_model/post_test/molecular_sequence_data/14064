Two zzso repeated DNA sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso Both share a zzso repeated unit, which includes a zzso motif also found in zzso zzso and other repeated zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso sequences on zzso zzso of three zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied by zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were shown to possess large amounts of zzso and to have undergone multiple zzso during evolution, both zzso and zzso sequences were observed at various zzso sites: zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso stable zzso zzso which does not possess large amounts of zzso and seems to be a more ancestral species, possesses only zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso
