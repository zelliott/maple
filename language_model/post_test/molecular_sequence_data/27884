A new strategy is advanced for the zzso restriction of zzso zzso Our approach is to replace putative zzso hydrogen bonds with zzso zzso zzso Because on average every other zzso acid in a protein engages in this bond, the zzso of zzso shaped peptides can be zzso zzso methods for introducing a potential zzso mimic into a zzso with zzso potential is reported and the structural consequences are zzso The replacement of the hydrogen bond with a chemical link will modify as well as shape the zzso To explore the consequences of these changes, a potential synthetic vaccine for malaria, the repeating zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso to the shaped zzso zzso showed a strong cross reaction with zzso zzso zzso
