The interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso O, with the zzso origin zzso zzso has been zzso zzso of O, or its zzso fragment, causes a major structural change within a 60 zzso zzso region just to the right of the zzso zzso zzso or other molecular energy sources are not zzso The zzso as zzso by zzso sensitivity, is reduced when certain zzso zzso zzso which bind O but fail to zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso The modification of DNA structure caused by the interaction of O is absolutely dependent on the presence of zzso tension at the zzso origin zzso and has several properties consistent with a strand separation zzso We propose that this modification is a fundamental zzso event that is the first stage in initiation of zzso replication in zzso after O zzso
