The zzso zzso zzso high-level zzso resistance, was earlier found only on zzso Evidence is given here for an alternative location of this gene at a site identical to sites observed earlier for zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso All these genes and zzso are precisely inserted as discrete zzso elements at distinct zzso in very zzso surrounding zzso One of these zzso insertions was observed to occur in association with a similarly inserted zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso and zzso zzso Close to the zzso site, there is an open reading frame translating into a zzso zzso which shows striking similarities to zzso of the zzso family, zzso the zzso resistance zzso is very often found close to the zzso point forming a genetic zzso originally observed as a part of zzso zzso The alleged integration mechanism thus provides a zzso zzso for the genetic linkage of zzso and other zzso resistance zzso including the most frequently encountered gene for zzso resistance, zzso Furthermore, the newly observed location of zzso could shed light on the evolution of the zzso resistance region of zzso which could be able to take up genes by the same mechanism as that of zzso zzso
