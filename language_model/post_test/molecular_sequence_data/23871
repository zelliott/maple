The zzso transition of the first zzso of zzso into zzso occurs frequently during the diversification of zzso Such transitions may play important roles in zzso zzso The B class zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso are required for the development of petals in the second zzso and its zzso have been isolated and characterized from various zzso A recent study on zzso a zzso plant, indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso in the first and second whorls is consistent with the expansion of B class gene zzso Here, we report five B class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated and characterized from two zzso plants, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with distinct zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso studies using dissected floral zzso reveal a lack or low level of zzso gene expression in these zzso species in the first zzso in contrast to previous zzso The expression data suggest that zzso gene expression in zzso zzso with the production of zzso zzso in the first zzso
