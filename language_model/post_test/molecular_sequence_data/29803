zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with two mating types, zzso and zzso The mating zzso of this fungus has a number of zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso A modified differential display strategy was used to identify a gene zzso the zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso is 42 zzso acids in length and contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in three linked copies that span a zzso zzso of zzso DNA and maps to the zzso zzso Transformation studies showed that zzso induced filament formation only in zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso is functionally zzso zzso analysis of the predicted zzso and zzso proteins revealed that, in contrast to other zzso such as zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso genes are structurally and functionally zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso which is found in zzso strains of both varieties of zzso zzso zzso is specific for the zzso variety of zzso zzso
