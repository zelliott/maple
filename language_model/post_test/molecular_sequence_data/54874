zzso zzso are essential membrane integrated proteins that couple the flow of zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso zzso to the transport of zzso across biological zzso Here, we used a combination of molecular modeling techniques and evolutionary conservation analysis to construct and validate a first model of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli based on the crystal structure of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were employed to gain information about zzso involved in zzso zzso The proposed model is consistent with the available experimental data and was further validated by zzso acid zzso and kinetic and protein chemical zzso Combination of the results of molecular modeling and functional studies predicts the location and organization of the zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso as proposed zzso and discovered here zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso segments 4 and 7 are found to be particularly important for zzso function and suggested to participate in zzso binding and/or zzso
