The key zzso of zzso carbon zzso in C4 plants have evolved independently several times from zzso zzso that were present in the zzso ancestral zzso The C4 zzso of zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso of the C4 cycle, is specifically expressed at high levels in zzso cells of the leaves of C4 zzso We are interested in understanding the molecular changes that are responsible for the evolution of this zzso zzso expression pattern, and we are using the zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso It is known that zzso sequences for zzso expression of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso are located within a zzso promoter region zzso 

In this study we focus on the zzso region zzso of the zzso promoter of zzso zzso and present an analysis of its function in establishing a zzso expression zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso which account for high levels of zzso expression in the zzso Our results further suggest that an zzso in the zzso untranslated leader region of the zzso is not essential for the control of zzso gene zzso 

The allocation of zzso elements for enhanced expression levels to the zzso region of the zzso promoter provides further insight into the regulation of zzso expression in C4 zzso
