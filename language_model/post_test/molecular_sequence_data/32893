zzso zzso is a genetically zzso group of inherited disorders in the zzso cascade of zzso hormone synthesis that result in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso are one of the most common causes of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso gene defects in a cohort of patients with zzso zzso from Slovenia, Bosnia, and zzso 

zzso patients with permanent zzso and zzso zzso zzso from 39 unrelated families participated in the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene and part of its promoter consisted of zzso zzso zzso analysis, sequencing, and restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso were identified in zzso of zzso Seven different zzso were identified, four zzso of these being novel, namely zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso A zzso Only a single zzso zzso was identified in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

The results showed a higher prevalence of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso when compared with published zzso The high percentage of single zzso zzso implied possible zzso or regulatory zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso
