Human zzso zzso zzso can zzso clinical drugs such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso but the role of zzso remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso that contained an zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso substitution at either zzso 78 or 282 zzso or zzso showed a different migration compared with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso that contained N to Q zzso at both zzso 78 and 282 zzso showed a similar migration to zzso in human liver zzso zzso treated with zzso H zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso This result indicated that zzso was zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso types of zzso with the zzso and the zzso zzso showed dramatically lower zzso zzso activity than did the zzso zzso The treatment of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso which produces zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso However, the treatment of the zzso with zzso H caused no decrease of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso chain, per se, was not important for zzso activity in the mature zzso The zzso types of zzso containing the zzso and the zzso zzso were not detected by zzso analysis after zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso at zzso was important for proper protein zzso Overall, this study found that the zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso plays a crucial role in regulating zzso zzso zzso
