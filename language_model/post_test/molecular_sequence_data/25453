In rabbit we observed zzso at an exceptionally high level, the zzso occurring within the zzso region of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso was cloned in zzso and the zzso sequence analysis of an zzso III zzso encompassing the zzso region revealed that although there are common features with other zzso zzso zzso large zzso block, zzso blocks 1, 2 and 3 and zzso zzso the zzso region shows an unusual zzso two stretches of tandem repeats of 20 zzso and 153 zzso are present in a part containing the origin of zzso replication zzso and probably the promoters for zzso as judged from other zzso The long repeats are located between zzso and zzso sequence block 3 and the short repeats are located between zzso sequence blocks 1 and zzso When cloned in zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso DNA fragments containing the short repeats show length differences corresponding to various copy numbers of zzso zzso analysis of the appropriate restriction fragments of rabbit zzso reveals extended zzso and zzso length zzso Both sets of repeats are involved in the generation of zzso and are present in variable copy numbers from one zzso zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso of the motives of the short repeat are observed to different zzso in the zzso from one animal to zzso The zzso maintenance and possible involvement of these repeated zzso capable of forming stable secondary structures, are discussed in relation to their location in the region of control zzso
