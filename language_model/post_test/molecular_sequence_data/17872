zzso of zzso zzso with drugs, zzso zzso and other agents are in widespread use in therapeutic trials and as clinical research zzso The characterization of these zzso generally does not include determining the individual sites at which such agents are zzso We have begun to explore the attachment of the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso to the zzso of the light chains of the zzso zzso zzso The similarity between this zzso zzso agent and zzso zzso zzso zzso led us to develop methods to distinguish between zzso zzso groups and zzso groups by zzso zzso Practically all the zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso can be modified at neutral zzso while attachment at zzso side chains zzso at pH zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso shows that both are almost fully zzso This implies that modification of zzso zzso has little or no effect on zzso despite the fact that these zzso lie near the zzso zzso
