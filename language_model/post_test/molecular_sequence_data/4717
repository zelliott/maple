A protein of mass zzso Da and sequence identical to that of zzso zzso the pore part, of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, was zzso with cholesterol in zzso formed from a zzso extract of bovine brain gray matter plasma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of current by zzso analysis, showed an zzso zzso current at constant zzso typically of frequency zzso zzso The zzso state in zzso and man zzso zzso in which zzso c accumulates in zzso zzso a rich source of the zzso zzso zzso c from affected sheep liver (in the absence of zzso was also zzso the current displaying identical sodium zzso to those of brain zzso The results suggest that if a protein similar to zzso c resides in the plasma membrane of neural cells, it could be responsible for spontaneous zzso in brain zzso The relevance of these results to the zzso of zzso disease is zzso
