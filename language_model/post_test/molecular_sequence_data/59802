We have previously reported the isolation of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso from a tobacco cell suspension zzso Here we describe the expression patterns of zzso and of zzso a zzso 1 plant zzso in synchronized tobacco cell zzso Furthermore, the expression pattern of this zzso is compared to that of zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso While no zzso transcript was detected in cells synchronized in the zzso and S zzso zzso expression was observed in late zzso and early M zzso disappearing in the zzso of a new cell zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso exhibited a zzso expression during the cell zzso A functional analysis performed by zzso zzso zzso into immature zzso zzso indicates that zzso could participate in the control of the zzso transition in plant zzso zzso zzso expression was used to assess the status of zzso cells in expanded leaves of zzso zzso Depending on leaf position along the shoot zzso a large population of zzso cells appeared with a zzso DNA content, suggesting a zzso zzso It was found that leaves with such a population also contained high levels of zzso zzso With respect to these results concerning a naturally occurring zzso cell population, the regulation of zzso expression in zzso is zzso
