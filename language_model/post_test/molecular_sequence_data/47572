zzso growth zzso zzso is widely regarded as a potent zzso zzso growth zzso In cell culture, zzso has been shown to increase various zzso zzso zzso proteins and tissue zzso of zzso zzso while decreasing zzso zzso zzso providing the optimum environment for progressive zzso zzso This study, which uses the isolated zzso rat kidney zzso describes for the first time in a whole kidney preparation the action of zzso on factors associated with zzso zzso This model allows the study of the intact rat kidney with zzso zzso interactions in the absence of zzso systemic zzso Left zzso were removed from male zzso rats by a zzso technique and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the plasma volume zzso zzso zzso at constant pressure in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for 1 h either with zzso zzso 3) or without zzso zzso 3) zzso human zzso (20 zzso The effects of zzso were controlled by comparison with the zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in the zzso and zzso at the start and end of the experiment using an zzso zzso zzso to its biologically active zzso After zzso sections of the zzso were analyzed for changes in zzso by Northern zzso zzso increases in zzso for zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core protein zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso P zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso were observed after zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated no zzso change, whereas determination of zzso for tissue zzso an zzso capable of zzso many zzso zzso showed an zzso increase zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that in the zzso and in the absence of other zzso growth factors, zzso selectively increases the synthesis of zzso and tissue zzso without changes that would result in the reduction of zzso zzso
