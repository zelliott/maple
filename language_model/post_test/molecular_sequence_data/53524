During studies of the bacterial zzso in the zzso of mice, we isolated characteristic strains which lowered the pH of zzso broth containing zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso sequence comparison, these zzso were considered to belong to the zzso cluster in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and were divided into two zzso Their zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, were the same as those of the zzso zzso zzso The low level of zzso zzso with type strains in the zzso cluster confirmed the novel species status of these zzso It is proposed that these zzso be named zzso zzso the type strain of which is zzso zzso zzso zzso
