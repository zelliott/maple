The zzso zzso 2A zzso is an zzso cassette (ABC) protein that forms the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels in the zzso zzso binding and zzso at the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso control gating of zzso channels, and zzso in the zzso that affect zzso zzso and cellular trafficking cause cardiovascular zzso To date, there is limited information on the zzso zzso and the effects of zzso zzso on their structure and zzso zzso and zzso studies of zzso especially from zzso ABC proteins like zzso have been hindered by low zzso of the isolated zzso We hypothesized that the zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso depends on the precise definition of the domain zzso zzso boundaries of zzso zzso were identified by zzso sequence alignments and subsequently tested by exploring the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with different N and C zzso We have determined boundaries of zzso zzso that allow for soluble zzso expression of the zzso producing a folded domain with zzso binding zzso Surprisingly, our alignment and screening data indicate that zzso zzso contains two zzso previously unidentified, regulatory zzso a large insert within the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Our approach, which combines the use of zzso sequence alignments and predictions of zzso regions combined with zzso and zzso studies, may be applied as a general method for developing suitable zzso of other zzso of ABC zzso
