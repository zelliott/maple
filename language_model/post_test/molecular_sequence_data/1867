zzso zzso channel receptors mediate the response of fast zzso by opening in less than a zzso Here, we investigated the zzso mechanism of a zzso zzso zzso by systematically introducing zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that multiple zzso in the zzso region of the zzso which together can form a high affinity binding site for metal zzso would reveal changes in pore structure during zzso Using cadmium zzso as a probe, two zzso zzso in the zzso selectivity zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso showed high affinity zzso with zzso when applied zzso in the open zzso zzso zzso in zzso was attenuated if applied in the presence of an zzso inhibitor and showed zzso recovery, indicating a direct effect of zzso in the zzso When applied zzso zzso appeared to bind zzso receptors in the closed zzso The ability of zzso side chains at the 2' and zzso positions to coordinate zzso in both the native open and closed states of the channel suggests that the zzso selectivity filter of zzso receptors maintains a narrow pore during channel zzso
