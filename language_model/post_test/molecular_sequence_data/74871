zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a diverse array of zzso zzso zzso and has emerged as a versatile model system to study plant zzso zzso The plant is widely cultivated as the only commercial source of the narcotic analgesics zzso and zzso Variations in plant secondary metabolism as a result of genetic diversity are often associated with zzso in other zzso zzso As part of a functional zzso platform, we used zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso profiling for the analysis of primary and secondary metabolism in zzso zzso zzso and zzso extracts of six different zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso component analysis of the zzso zzso zzso for latex extracts clearly distinguished two zzso including a zzso variety and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was also made between zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Such zzso differences were not observed in root zzso zzso plots confirmed that zzso zzso contributed predominantly to the zzso in latex zzso zzso of 34 root and 21 latex zzso performed using zzso zzso Suite version zzso showed major differences in the zzso of specific zzso in the latex of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Relatively few differences were found in the levels of other zzso indicating that the variation was specific for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso included an increased zzso of the zzso precursor zzso and reduced levels of zzso some zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of 42 genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism showed differential gene expression mainly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso variety were associated with the reduced abundance of transcripts zzso several zzso zzso zzso
