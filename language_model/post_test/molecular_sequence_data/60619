In a previous investigation it was demonstrated that circulating zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with peripheral zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso from a bovine zzso zzso protein zzso using zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso protein was used to raise rabbit zzso zzso These zzso were used to screen a bovine zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Positive clones were zzso and zzso zzso were identified by DNA sequence zzso searches of the zzso DNA zzso 

A zzso clone that demonstrated strong binding to both the rabbit zzso zzso and patient zzso showed zzso zzso to rabbit zzso 3 zzso zzso is a basic zzso specific to zzso zzso No bovine DNA sequence for zzso is zzso However, bovine zzso is larger than rabbit zzso with a molecular weight of 66 zzso zzso using both patient zzso and the rabbit zzso demonstrated a zzso binding pattern on human zzso zzso 

This evidence suggests that the zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in zzso is zzso 3, and this may form the basis of a zzso zzso
