We performed this study to determine the zzso zzso sequences of the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to calculate the zzso distances between these two nutritionally zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonged to one zzso but this cluster was not closely related to other zzso zzso A comparative analysis of the sequences of these organisms and other zzso zzso bacteria revealed that the two zzso species formed a distinct cluster and were only remotely related to the zzso and zzso zzso The highest level of zzso zzso was found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species have zzso acid in their cell walls, but zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso as the zzso acid at position 3 in their zzso zzso On the basis of our findings and the results of previous zzso studies, we propose that the zzso species should be placed in a new zzso the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
