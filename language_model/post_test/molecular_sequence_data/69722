A new method has been developed that permits the rapid amplification of unknown DNA zzso a known site so that one can walk into an zzso region of zzso This method eliminates the steps and sequence artifacts associated with cloning and permits zzso walking into zzso regions of zzso In this method, human zzso DNA is restriction zzso zzso and then zzso to the 3' end of a zzso zzso using a short bridging zzso using a short bridging zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso is designed to create zzso extensions that are complementary to the known zzso Following zzso and zzso under dilute conditions that promote zzso zzso and under high zzso only those DNA strands that contain the known sequence will form a zzso structure with a recessed and zzso zzso zzso This zzso renders a zzso for a subsequent zzso zzso reaction to another zzso that zzso to the known sequence immediately adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso appended to the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso can, when present in its free, zzso form, prime DNA zzso amplification of those strands modified by zzso zzso to this same zzso This is followed by one or two zzso DNA zzso with the final amplification primed by the zzso zzso in its free, zzso zzso We successfully applied this method to the specific amplification of zzso zzso of DNA zzso the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso using zzso that zzso to the zzso sequence and to the specific amplification of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso DNA zzso the primer zzso zzso
