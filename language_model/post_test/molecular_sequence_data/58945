In zzso the zzso gene is required downstream of zzso zzso zzso for correct eye development, embryonic zzso wing vein formation, and border cell zzso Here we characterize a zzso zzso of zzso zzso that affects zzso eye zzso and early and late stages of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and existing zzso zzso zzso are viable and exhibit a range of eye and eggshell zzso zzso in the severity of these zzso in different zzso suggest that there are zzso effects of zzso in zzso Analysis of rescue zzso demonstrates that these differential zzso are due to loss of function in zzso alone and not due to effects on neighboring zzso zzso zzso at the zzso locus lay eggs with reduced or missing zzso eggshell zzso We observe dominant interactions between zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso is also zzso to zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso however, zzso females are moderately zzso laying eggs with zzso zzso that can hatch normal zzso These results suggest that zzso may have a different requirement in the patterning of the eggshell axis than in the patterning of the embryonic axis during zzso
