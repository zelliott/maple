zzso high level resistance to zzso in zzso zzso has become a therapeutic problem in many parts of the zzso zzso fast and accurate screening tests are required to enable rapid zzso 

To evaluate screening tests for high-level zzso resistance for their ability to predict the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso considered to exhibit zzso zzso and zzso resistance zzso to zzso were used to compare the screening tests, growth on zzso zzso disc testing, zzso and zzso content, with confirmation by zzso to the zzso zzso A zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso in zzso zzso was also zzso 

All strains defined as zzso zzso by the screening tests zzso with the zzso zzso None of the low-level resistant strains were positive in the screening tests or zzso with the zzso In addition, the zzso chain reaction zzso on whole bacterial cells detected zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso product gave three patterns suggesting genetic diversity within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso screening tests were found to be reliable zzso of zzso zzso was detected by zzso in all strains tested and exhibited some genetic variation that may be of use for zzso zzso
