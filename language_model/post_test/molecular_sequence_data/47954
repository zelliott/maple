Human zzso heavy chain constant regions are zzso by a cluster of zzso the zzso zzso on zzso Several forms of zzso deletions and zzso spanning one to five genes have been described in different zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Despite the common occurrence of these gene zzso little is known about the zzso zzso evidence obtained from deletions in the zzso locus and in other regions of the human zzso suggests that they zzso occur in highly zzso regions and might be favored by a variety of zzso zzso We present here a detailed study of three zzso for the most common type of zzso multiple gene zzso spanning the zzso zzso Using a combination of Southern zzso long-range zzso and automated sequencing, the unequal crossover events of all of the six studied zzso have been mapped to a region of approximately 2 zzso with almost complete zzso between zzso and zzso flanked by two zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that segments of complete zzso may be required for efficient zzso zzso in zzso The possible role of zzso as zzso signals is zzso in agreement with current zzso
