zzso is a recently described zzso that has been recognized as a key regulator of insulin sensitivity and tissue zzso It is produced by zzso tissue zzso and brown) and zzso in the blood at very high zzso It has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle and the zzso with prominent roles to improve zzso insulin sensitivity, increase fuel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and decrease vascular zzso zzso exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by zzso Recent data indicate that the zzso weight zzso complexes have the zzso action in the zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso and circulating levels are zzso zzso to body fat zzso zzso are further reduced in subjects with diabetes and coronary artery zzso zzso zzso many effects of zzso necrosis zzso and this, in turn, suppresses zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso from zzso is enhanced by zzso (which also act to antagonize zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be the common mechanism by which zzso zzso and the zzso zzso insulin resistance and zzso Two zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso have been identified and these are zzso zzso zzso is most highly expressed in skeletal muscle and has a prominent action to activate zzso and hence promote zzso zzso zzso is most highly expressed in liver, where it enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces zzso via zzso of zzso and increased zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in zzso and smooth muscle, has been identified as an zzso protein with preference for zzso zzso zzso Given the low levels of zzso in subjects with the zzso syndrome, and the beneficial effect of the zzso in animal studies, there is exciting potential for zzso replacement therapy in insulin resistance and related zzso
