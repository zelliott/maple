The zzso response element zzso mediates the zzso zzso of many genes zzso phase II zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Recent studies using knockout mice suggest that zzso factor 2 zzso along with small zzso zzso binds and activates the zzso In this study, using in zzso binding zzso zzso zzso were found to interact with high affinity to the zzso However, distinct differences were observed when this interaction was compared with that formed with nuclear proteins from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso cells, and this zzso was further increased by zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso but this zzso was no longer induced by zzso Using ARE zzso with point zzso in the core zzso we found that only zzso at the T or G zzso within the core zzso render the ARE unresponsive to zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso repression of ARE zzso zzso of the ARE by zzso was similarly antagonized by zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role zzso zzso activity of the ARE but that small zzso proteins are zzso and not zzso of zzso zzso
