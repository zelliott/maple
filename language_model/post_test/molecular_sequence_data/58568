The zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso is zzso induced by zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso genes of enteric bacteria, the zzso zzso zzso gene is not regulated by the zzso zzso as the zzso promoter remained strongly zzso zzso in strains lacking zzso A zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of the zzso promoter under a variety of zzso However, this zzso is predicted to increase the zzso concentration of zzso and this alone probably accounts for its effects on zzso zzso The zzso promoter was also strongly induced by zzso and the zzso zzso did not affect expression by this gratuitous zzso An open reading frame zzso zzso an zzso protein was found transcribed zzso from zzso zzso of this ORF, designated zzso abolished induction of the zzso promoter by zzso or zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso also zzso its own transcription, and this zzso was only slightly affected by zzso zzso The zzso start sites for the zzso and zzso genes are separated by 64 zzso suggesting that zzso could regulate both promoters by binding to a single zzso
