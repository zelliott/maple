The region of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso that is required for autonomous replication in zzso was isolated on a zzso DNA zzso The sequence analysis of the zzso yielded two open reading zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed similarity to the replication zzso protein of zzso zzso from zzso zzso to two proteins of unknown function zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and surprisingly to the mouse zzso element binding factor zzso The zzso gene of zzso is indispensable for replication suggesting that it encodes the replication zzso protein of zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso into zzso or deletion of 26 zzso at its zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso of sequences required for zzso expression also abolished zzso zzso experiments with zzso in trans identified the zzso of zzso within the zzso coding zzso The second zzso which is located downstream of zzso could be deleted without affecting zzso zzso It seems to be a zzso remainder of a rolling circle zzso of the zzso family, since its deduced zzso acid sequence resembles the zzso replication zzso The minimal zzso of zzso defined so far comprises zzso zzso Besides zzso no other zzso gene is required to mediate replication in zzso
