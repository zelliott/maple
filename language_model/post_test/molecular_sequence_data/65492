zzso lupus zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disease characterized by production of zzso and complex genetic zzso In a zzso scan using zzso zzso we identified an association between zzso and a zzso substitution zzso zzso in the zzso scaffold protein with zzso repeats zzso zzso We zzso the association in four independent zzso sets zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso We analyzed zzso zzso and found two zzso one full-length and the other alternatively spliced and lacking zzso 2 zzso zzso a protein without a putative zzso zzso The transcripts were zzso expressed depending on a branch zzso zzso zzso in strong linkage zzso zzso with zzso A third associated zzso was found in the zzso domain zzso zzso Our findings zzso zzso as a zzso gene for zzso with zzso affecting regulatory sites and key functional zzso The zzso zzso could contribute to sustained B zzso signaling and zzso zzso characteristic of this zzso
