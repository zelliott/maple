The sonic zzso zzso signaling zzso is necessary for a variety of development and differentiation during zzso as well as maintenance and zzso of diverse adult zzso However, an abnormal zzso of the signaling zzso is related to various zzso In this pathway, the zzso signaling zzso is facilitated by binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso In this study, we modeled the zzso structure of functionally important key loop peptides of zzso based on zzso zzso Using this loop model, the molecular interactions between the structural components present in the zzso site of zzso and key zzso of zzso was investigated in atomic level through molecular dynamics zzso zzso For the purpose of developing inhibitor candidates of the zzso signaling pathway, the zzso zzso site of this interface region was selected as a target to block the direct binding between zzso and zzso Two different zzso zzso models were generated considering the key loop of zzso and known zzso zzso changes of the zzso through MD zzso Finally two hit compounds were retrieved through a series of virtual screening combined with molecular zzso simulations and we propose two hit compounds as potential zzso lead candidates to block the zzso signaling zzso based on their strong interactions to zzso or inhibitor induced zzso of the zzso
