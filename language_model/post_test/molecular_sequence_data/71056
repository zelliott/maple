A cluster of genes for the zzso degradation of zzso has been described for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we provide an initial analysis of the regulation of zzso zzso degradation by examining the contributions of two zzso a new regulator, zzso zzso by the zzso degradation gene zzso and a previously described regulator, zzso whose gene lies outside the zzso zzso with single zzso in either zzso or zzso grew slowly on zzso but were relatively zzso in growth on zzso and several zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso double zzso was completely defective in zzso growth on zzso zzso of the regulators on zzso zzso were monitored with an zzso zzso strain carrying a zzso fusion of zzso to the zzso gene of the zzso zzso This zzso encodes zzso A zzso zzso an unusual zzso zzso that zzso the zzso ring reduction reaction that is the zzso step in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced zzso when cells grown zzso on zzso were shifted to zzso growth on zzso plus zzso The zzso gene was required for a zzso increase in expression that occurred in response to zzso and zzso was responsible for a further zzso increase in expression that occurred in response to zzso Further studies with the zzso fusion strain grown with various kinds of aromatic acids indicated that zzso probably responds to zzso acting as an zzso zzso zzso information indicates that zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso These studies expand the range of functions regulated by zzso family members to include zzso aromatic acid degradation and provide an example of a zzso protein that acts as a positive regulator rather than as a negative regulator, as do most zzso family zzso zzso resembles the zzso coli zzso regulator in sequence and contains zzso zzso that are spaced appropriately to serve in the capacity of a zzso zzso
