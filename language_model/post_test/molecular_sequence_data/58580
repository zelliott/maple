The gene zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso has been zzso Seven zzso and eight zzso are present, with the zzso positioned as zzso junctions between the major domain units of the zzso A total of zzso zzso of the gene was zzso and included zzso zzso of a zzso region, in which several high probability binding sites for liver zzso factors were present, as well as a zzso sequence and possible zzso zzso zzso extension analysis revealed that the major zzso start site was positioned only 9 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso thus providing a very short zzso region of the zzso The sequence of the zzso site in the zzso zzso gene matched exactly the consensus zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso of zzso zzso included a probable zzso site zzso and an appropriately positioned downstream consensus sequence zzso for the efficient formation of a 3' zzso of zzso These results indicate that all elements are present for zzso zzso of the gene for zzso factor zzso The sequence and restriction zzso map of this gene will facilitate construction of zzso deficient mice and mice containing zzso zzso zzso
