zzso expression of the zzso promoter from zzso zzso zzso was assessed throughout the development of transgenic tobacco plants using a zzso reporter zzso zzso exhibited high activity in roots but with different patterns of zzso The activity of the zzso promoter in vascular zzso increased from the base to the tip of the zzso The zzso promoter is wound zzso in a limited area adjacent to the wound zzso The time course of wound induction of zzso in transgenic tobacco containing an zzso zzso zzso fusion was similar to that previously described for genes involved in plant defense zzso A series of zzso deletions of the zzso promoter fused to the zzso gene was examined for expression in roots and leaves of transgenic zzso zzso elements that zzso quantitative expression of the zzso after wounding were zzso
