zzso factors influence whether cells are susceptible to transformation by zzso zzso Avian zzso resist transformation by zzso activated zzso zzso whereas zzso are transformed by this zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso In studies presented here, zzso cells resisted transformation by zzso This finding indicates that the zzso of zzso is zzso between avian and zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of zzso blocked transformation by a zzso zzso The zzso interference by zzso occurred despite expression at levels lower than for zzso Together with previous reports, the results indicate that zzso can exert opposite growth effects in different zzso The switch from positive to negative growth regulation, which depends on the cellular context, provides novel insight into zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso apparently contributes to the distinct tissue zzso of various zzso zzso
