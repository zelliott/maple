zzso exists in a variety of alternatively spliced zzso that include variable numbers of additional zzso from the membrane zzso domain zzso zzso zzso express high levels of a zzso zzso zzso with no additional variable zzso zzso binds zzso to zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso also express zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in a rat zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso expressed by normal activated zzso suggesting that the protein may function in the trafficking of both normal zzso and zzso zzso To identify the specific zzso transcripts in tumors from patients with primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare them with zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso B cells and zzso cells, we used a zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by size, zzso with zzso zzso and sequence zzso In comparison to primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had increased levels of zzso and additional zzso including a directly spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts in zzso and zzso zzso were similar to those in normal zzso zzso B cells, whereas zzso zzso contained decreased zzso and increased amounts of larger zzso zzso with additional zzso from the membrane zzso zzso The regulated expression of specific zzso zzso is likely to influence the trafficking of zzso and zzso zzso
