zzso zzso a zzso green zzso often experiences zzso soil conditions that activate zzso zzso We isolated three zzso zzso disrupted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso a major zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso were subjected to dark zzso conditions, they displayed an increased flux of zzso to zzso elevated zzso zzso ethanol zzso diminished zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and lowered zzso zzso The zzso zzso also accumulated high zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To further probe the system, we generated a double zzso zzso zzso that is unable to zzso both zzso and zzso This strain, like the zzso zzso zzso zzso but it also exhibited a significant increase in the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso and a decrease in dark, zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso primarily produces zzso and ethanol, the double zzso zzso zzso carbon to zzso and zzso Although the zzso adjustments observed in the zzso facilitate zzso zzso and sustained zzso under dark, zzso conditions, the observed changes could not have been predicted given our current knowledge of the regulation of zzso zzso
