The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso component of the zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso has been determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso simulated zzso The structure is compared with the solution structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall fold of the two structures, described as a zzso hybrid, is very zzso This agrees well with the high similarity of zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts, between the two zzso zzso The main structural differences between the two zzso zzso occur in a zzso loop close in space to the zzso zzso Despite their high structural zzso these zzso zzso show a high preference for being zzso zzso by their parent zzso acid zzso Potential zzso of the zzso domain involved in this process of molecular recognition are zzso
