zzso 6 is a zzso zzso expressed abundantly in normal adult human and zzso zzso and zzso is regulated by zzso In the case of zzso zzso disease, zzso expression in zzso occurs additionally in zzso and zzso inflammatory cells suggesting a role in zzso zzso we describe two unique transcripts that occur within the human and mouse zzso genes that differ in their zzso zzso These transcripts have identical translation initiation sites in zzso 3, are expressed in a zzso fashion and are zzso regulated in response to zzso zzso While the human and mouse zzso differ in sequence they are identical in zzso organization and zzso zzso The most zzso designated transcript 1, includes zzso zzso and was zzso in all zzso regions, but not in any zzso zzso examined zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and peripheral zzso In contrast, transcript 2 lacks zzso 1, but contains a unique sequence at the zzso of zzso 2, designated zzso zzso zzso 2 was expressed both in zzso and in each peripheral zzso In a zzso model of human zzso zzso inflammatory disease induced by zzso zzso mouse zzso transcript 1 was zzso in brain and spinal zzso at acute and more chronic zzso of zzso inflammation and zzso while overall transcript 2 expression was not significantly zzso However, in isolated zzso cultures, transcript 2 was zzso zzso by cellular zzso zzso expression patterns and differential regulation in zzso disease indicates that each zzso zzso is probably regulated by unique promoter elements and may serve as a molecular target to treat inflammatory zzso zzso
