zzso a zzso protein containing two zzso zzso and one zzso domain, is known as an essential element of the Ras zzso in multiple zzso One of the functions of zzso is to link zzso receptors to downstream zzso proteins via the zzso and zzso domain zzso To identify zzso proteins in Ras transformed zzso cells, we performed zzso experiments using zzso zzso fusion proteins and found a remarkably strong band of 100 zzso With zzso zzso acid sequencing, we identified the protein of 100 zzso as zzso zzso zzso II was also observed in the zzso with the zzso fusion protein of zzso or zzso domain of zzso but not in that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso association of zzso with zzso II was confirmed by competitive binding experiments with zzso whose sequence corresponded to that of zzso or zzso binding zzso The zzso II zzso was completely zzso by the addition of the zzso of zzso binding zzso but addition of zzso binding motif had no zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso II may be largely expressed and closely associated with zzso signaling in Ras transformed zzso
