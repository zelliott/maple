The binding of short zzso zzso stretches to zzso protein zzso is important for a wide range of cellular zzso including signal zzso protein zzso and immune zzso The often zzso nature of these interactions and the zzso flexibility of the zzso chain, sometimes even when bound, make the binding specificity of this type of protein interaction a challenge to zzso Here we develop and test a zzso zzso procedure for calculating zzso binding thermodynamics for many sequences in a single zzso The method explores both zzso sequence and zzso space simultaneously by simulating a joint probability distribution which, in particular, makes searching through zzso sequence space zzso zzso To test our method, we apply it to 3 different zzso protein zzso and test its ability to capture the zzso determined specificity zzso Insight into the molecular zzso of the observed zzso is obtained by analyzing the zzso zzso ensembles of a large number of zzso zzso We also explore the possibility of using our method to discover new zzso pockets on protein zzso
