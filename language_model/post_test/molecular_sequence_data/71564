The effect of zzso zzso A zzso on zzso zzso and zzso analysis have indicated the presence of zzso in guard cells of zzso zzso In this study, we identified a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of guard cell zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that zzso contained zzso zzso acid zzso and exhibited a strong similarity to previously described zzso zzso zzso from other zzso zzso had seven extra zzso acid zzso which is a characteristic of the zzso form of plant zzso A complex of zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso activity of bovine zzso a type zzso protein zzso with a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was measured in the zzso fraction of zzso using a zzso zzso basic protein zzso and the activity was increased by a zzso concentration of zzso (1 zzso This zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso suggesting the presence of both zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in guard zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso level of zzso was much higher in zzso than in root and leaf zzso of zzso
