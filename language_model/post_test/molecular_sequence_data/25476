The zzso of zzso zzso zzso fraction from pooled zzso of zzso zzso which were bred and selected for the expression of a high level of zzso chains positive for zzso but negative for zzso was carried zzso On the basis of specific binding to zzso zzso the zzso zzso chain fraction in serum zzso was shown to account for up to zzso of the total zzso light zzso the remaining zzso bearing the expected zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of the mixed light chains zzso + zzso zzso followed by zzso of the constant region fragments indicated that the C zzso region originated from the zzso sequence derived from a zzso zzso rabbit zzso identical to gene C zzso zzso as described in the preceding report zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a synthetic zzso encompassing zzso zzso of the constant region derived from the predicted sequence of gene C zzso 6 was shown to partially inhibit the zzso binding reaction in a sensitive zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the chemical and zzso data clearly demonstrate that gene C zzso 6 indeed encodes zzso zzso
