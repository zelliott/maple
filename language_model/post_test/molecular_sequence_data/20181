The alternative zzso factor zzso zzso or zzso plays a central role in the zzso regulation of the zzso major outer surface proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the zzso disease zzso zzso is one of the key environmental signals controlling zzso but the molecular mechanism by which the signal is zzso remains zzso zzso we identify and describe a small zzso zzso zzso that regulates the zzso increase in zzso A novel zzso end of the zzso zzso was identified and zzso has the potential to extensively zzso with the upstream region of this zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso strains lacking zzso do not zzso zzso and zzso in response to an increase in temperature, but do regulate zzso and zzso in response to changes in pH and cell zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso indicate that zzso regulates zzso zzso The zzso and 3' ends of zzso were zzso demonstrating that at least four species exist with sizes ranging from zzso to 352 zzso We zzso that zzso binds to the upstream region of the zzso zzso and stimulates translation by releasing the zzso sequence and start site from a stable secondary zzso zzso we zzso that zzso is a molecular thermometer regulating zzso in zzso zzso
