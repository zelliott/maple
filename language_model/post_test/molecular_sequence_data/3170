Several zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso of translation by a rabbit zzso zzso (as a signal of zzso zzso and for zzso DNA zzso activity, activities that are both due to the presence of a class of zzso called zzso proteins zzso currently classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso These activities were highest in zzso intermediate in flower zzso immature seed, zzso + zzso zzso and zzso and very low in all other zzso By zzso zzso four protein zzso with zzso activity on zzso translation were identified in extracts from seeds, and two proteins were isolated from zzso 1 and 4, all of which have the properties of zzso type 1 zzso One is zzso zzso protein zzso so far zzso only from zzso The second is a new protein that we propose to call zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso in several zzso was determined with a novel experimental approach based on liquid zzso zzso The direct zzso activity of zzso on several zzso is described here for the first zzso zzso zzso not only zzso in intact zzso thus zzso protein zzso but also other zzso such as zzso DNA, and tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso DNA was zzso more extensively than other zzso zzso the zzso activity of this protein may be better described as zzso zzso zzso activity rather than zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso does not zzso zzso with other commonly zzso zzso
