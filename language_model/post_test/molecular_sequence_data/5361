In zzso the induction of a zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso acid zzso and requires protein zzso for zzso gene zzso Previous experiments established that a zzso DNA zzso of the zzso promoter is sufficient for zzso and zzso gene expression and that this DNA zzso contains two closely located putative recognition sites for the basic zzso protein zzso and one putative recognition site for zzso We have carefully analyzed the zzso region of the zzso promoter in transgenic tobacco plants and found that both the first zzso site and the zzso recognition site function as zzso elements in the zzso expression of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso a zzso DNA binding protein was isolated by zzso binding zzso using the zzso region as a probe, and designated zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that has a typical DNA binding domain of a basic region zzso zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein binds specifically to the first zzso recognition site in the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso gene is induced by zzso stress and zzso treatment, and its induction precedes that of zzso We have reported a zzso and zzso gene that encodes the zzso protein zzso In a transient zzso experiment using zzso leaf zzso we demonstrated that both the zzso and zzso proteins activate zzso of the zzso promoter fused to the zzso reporter zzso These results indicate that both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins function as zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso
