zzso T4 zzso II zzso a zzso zzso lacking a zzso zzso domain, was subjected to zzso zzso to investigate roles of individual zzso acids in zzso recognition, zzso and zzso The structure of zzso was modeled on that of zzso We found zzso roles for zzso in the putative zzso surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to those described for zzso and zzso in addition, these zzso were found to be important for zzso recognition and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were essential for normal sequence zzso Our results are in agreement with a role for these zzso in forming the zzso surface and exposing the zzso zzso bond at the active zzso The zzso zzso zzso and an adjacent zzso zzso likely contribute to positioning the zzso domain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso share a strongly zzso middle region zzso zzso 72 to 93, likely zzso and possibly substituting for zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and a less strongly zzso zzso region zzso 12 to zzso Most of the zzso zzso in these two regions appeared to contribute to binding strength without affecting the mode of zzso binding at the zzso zzso zzso zzso part of a zzso zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso found to overlap the zzso affected both sequence recognition and zzso suggesting a more direct involvement in positioning the zzso Our data thus suggest roles for the MR and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in recognizing and binding the zzso
