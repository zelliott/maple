zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that contain zzso units of zzso beta zzso alpha zzso In this study, a zzso zzso activity was detected in washed zzso major zzso using synthetic zzso fragments of zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity had an apparent zzso for zzso of about zzso zzso and a pH optimum of zzso The activity showed a requirement for a zzso terminal beta Gal zzso and for one or more zzso units preceding the zzso zzso Based on these results, the activity may be defined as a zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso zzso This zzso specificity is consistent with a role for the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso rather than in the zzso of these zzso An identical or similar activity must exist in the zzso forms of the zzso that produce and zzso zzso material and the activity therefore represents a feasible target for the development of zzso
