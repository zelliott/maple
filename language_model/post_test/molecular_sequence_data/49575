An zzso responsible for zzso oxide zzso release in rabbit corpus zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso mass of zzso zzso was identified as zzso after determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso markedly relaxed the zzso this response was blocked by the NO synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides based on either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso scorpion zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso These peptides slightly relaxed the zzso and such an effect was independent of zzso channel zzso or NO zzso Our results indicate that zzso exerts zzso actions and contributes to the relaxing activity of zzso in zzso thus providing a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying nerve zzso in zzso zzso because NO released from zzso fibers plays a key role in the zzso zzso Our findings revealed the key importance of the zzso structure three-dimensional zzso maintenance for biological activity, because linear zzso sequences neither presented substantial relaxations nor was this effect related to zzso zzso
