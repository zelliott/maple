The complete human zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso 4A zzso library which was screened by zzso to a human zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso which include the entire zzso gene as well as over 1200 zzso of the zzso and 200 zzso of the 3' zzso zzso The zzso gene has 7 zzso and 6 zzso contained within approximately zzso zzso zzso extension experiments identified four possible zzso start points closely spaced between 29 and 33 zzso zzso zzso to the start of zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed 4 putative zzso regulatory zzso these sequences include a zzso box 29 zzso upstream from the major zzso start point zzso position zzso 2 zzso recognition sequences zzso zzso positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso and an zzso recognition sequence zzso zzso positions zzso to zzso The first 200 zzso zzso to the start point of zzso contain a G + zzso region zzso Additionally, an intriguing A + zzso region was found between zzso positions zzso and zzso which contained 17 zzso tandem zzso zzso of the zzso gene with the zzso rate zzso zzso disclosed extensive conservation of zzso organization between the two zzso
