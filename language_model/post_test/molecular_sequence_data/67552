The zzso zzso regulator zzso from zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso zzso protein that zzso a zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso bound to the zzso zzso was not zzso To that end, we generated and zzso three zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso examined their zzso properties in order to identify the native zzso zzso Electronic zzso resonance zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso like zzso zzso bind a zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso In contrast, electronic zzso and resonance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are most consistent with a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso neither of which are zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso is dominated by a large, zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that the native zzso motif is not maintained in this zzso Together, these data reveal that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by sequence zzso zzso is also implicated as the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso another zzso found in the same zzso
