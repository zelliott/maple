We have cloned and zzso a zzso from a human adult skeletal muscle zzso library, zzso for a novel zzso of zzso zzso that is zzso expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso A zzso DNA sequence from the zzso region zzso allowed us to determine the complete structure of the zzso gene that mirrors the zzso zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso We also cloned and zzso the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso The latter encodes for a protein that differs from its human counterpart in only three zzso zzso revealing an extreme rate of conservation that is even extended to both the 3' and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso comparison of these novel zzso with other known alpha zzso shows that zzso is the most divergent member of the zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso of the human and zzso zzso strongly suggests that they might have functional significance and, according to the zzso hypothesis, that they might play specific functional roles in the cell zzso
