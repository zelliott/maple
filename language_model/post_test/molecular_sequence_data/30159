zzso analyses using the zzso zzso from zzso bean and restriction zzso have been performed on a series of DNA fragments related to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bean zzso zzso DNA fragments exclusively in some, but not all, zzso regions as predicted by zzso secondary structural zzso zzso of zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso (a DNA zzso having the sequence of zzso and the zzso (the complement of zzso suggests that the zzso of the three molecules is very zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso and zzso restriction zzso at two zzso sites which would be in zzso regions (the zzso and zzso zzso if the two molecules adopt the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, minor zzso products show that the core region, zzso the extra loop area, is slightly more exposed in zzso and in zzso than in zzso zzso we submit that the global zzso of zzso acids is primarily dictated by the interaction of zzso and zzso bases with atoms and functional groups common to both zzso and zzso In this view the zzso group, in zzso at least, is an auxiliary structural feature whose role is limited to zzso local zzso which increase the stability of a given zzso
