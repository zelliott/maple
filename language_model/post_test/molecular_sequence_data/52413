The zzso chain reaction zzso is often used to assess the diversity of viral zzso sequences present in various biological samples zzso blood and zzso However, it is not clear how zzso this approach may zzso DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood zzso of a zzso that had been zzso zzso with zzso 6 months zzso The zzso gene was then amplified by the zzso on three separate occasions from this same template zzso A panel of clones was prepared from the product of each zzso the entire zzso gene was zzso and the sequences obtained compared with each zzso zzso analysis revealed that within each panel the same degree of sequence diversity was observed between zzso Furthermore, when the sequences obtained from all three panels were zzso the overall sequence diversity observed was no greater than that observed for each panel zzso These data indicate that the analysis of sequence diversity in zzso zzso populations by the zzso is reliable and, more important, zzso
