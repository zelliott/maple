zzso is a zzso vitamin that functions as a prosthetic group in zzso zzso In addition to its role as a zzso zzso has multiple roles in gene zzso We analyzed zzso effects on gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated by zzso zzso and Western analyses that all zzso genes zzso proteins involved in zzso metabolism are zzso following zzso zzso Many of these genes contain a zzso promoter element that is necessary and sufficient for zzso the zzso response and functions as an zzso zzso zzso lacking the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso display zzso high expression levels of zzso zzso However, they react normally to zzso precursors that do not require zzso for zzso The zzso effect of precursors with regard to gene expression requires their zzso conversion to zzso This demonstrates that zzso does not act as a sensor for zzso and that zzso zzso is crucial for gene zzso zzso with defects in zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso also display zzso high expression of zzso zzso Like zzso cells, they have reduced levels of protein zzso but unlike zzso zzso they possess normal levels of free zzso zzso This indicates that free zzso zzso is irrelevant for gene regulation and identifies zzso zzso as an important element of the zzso zzso in zzso
