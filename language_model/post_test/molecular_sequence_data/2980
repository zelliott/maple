zzso acid zzso complexes are a ubiquitous family of zzso systems that zzso the zzso zzso of various zzso acid zzso They play a key role in the primary energy zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid cycle zzso zzso zzso and in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of any of these complexes leads to a broad variety of clinical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex predominantly leads to zzso zzso combined with impairment of neurological function and/or delayed growth and zzso Maple urine disease is an zzso zzso error caused by dysfunction of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso An association between both zzso disease and Parkinson s disease and the zzso zzso gene has been zzso Currently a wealth of both genetic and structural information is zzso zzso structures of three components of the complex are presently zzso of the zzso zzso component zzso of the zzso zzso component zzso and of the zzso zzso component zzso Moreover, detailed information on the reaction zzso regulation and the interactions between the different components of the complex is now at zzso Although only one of the structures is of human origin zzso model building by zzso zzso allows us to investigate the causes of zzso In this review we have combined this knowledge to gain more insight into the structural basis of the zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso
