zzso modifications zzso play an important role in the regulation of protein zzso Mass zzso based zzso experiments nowadays identify tens of thousands of zzso in a single zzso A wealth of data has therefore become zzso zzso zzso the biological function of each zzso is the key question to be zzso however, such analyses focus primarily on single zzso zzso This ignores the fact that zzso may act in concert in the regulation of protein function, a process termed zzso zzso Relatively little is known on the frequency and functional relevance of zzso between zzso zzso In a zzso approach, we extracted zzso occurring in proximity in the protein sequence from zzso available zzso These zzso and their zzso sequences were subjected to stringent motif searches, including a scoring for evolutionary zzso Our zzso approach was able to detect a respectable set of zzso of which about half were described zzso Among these we could add many new proteins harboring these zzso We extracted also several novel zzso which through their widespread appearance and high conservation may pinpoint at previously zzso concerted zzso zzso By employing network analyses on these zzso we propose putative functional roles for these novel motifs with two zzso sites in close zzso
