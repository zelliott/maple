zzso zzso alters zzso state by zzso zzso on zzso and plays an important role in modulating gene zzso A dynamic balance of zzso zzso is maintained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that a family of zzso zzso may exist to regulate diverse cellular functions, including zzso structure, gene zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso We describe here a novel human zzso zzso named zzso cloned from human zzso zzso encodes 377 zzso acid zzso and shares extensive zzso to several known zzso in particular a zzso zzso from zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed that zzso expression pattern for zzso is distinct from that for zzso and zzso and expression of zzso zzso occurs in multiple zzso including heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also observed in several cell lines derived from zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso exhibited zzso activity toward zzso zzso indicating that this protein is a bona fide zzso zzso Its zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and other known zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, active zzso zzso was expressed and zzso from zzso zzso When zzso expressed in cells, zzso was found to be localized to the zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that expression of zzso zzso a viral zzso early promoter zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso family, which may play a role in the development of a broad range of zzso and potentially in the zzso of zzso
