To identify zzso zzso which play an important role in the process of zzso we have screened a zzso liver zzso library with zzso zzso domain as a zzso Using low stringency zzso we could isolate zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso show that the zzso domain of its predicted protein has significant zzso with that of the members of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed mainly in liver and faintly in heart, kidney and zzso Northern analysis further shows that in 2 out of 4 cell lines of human zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene is highly expressed compared to normal human zzso This is the first report showing a zzso zzso which may be specifically involved in the cell growth of zzso or in the step of zzso
