A strategy suggested by comparative zzso studies was used to amplify the entire zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and its zzso regions were zzso and compared with the deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of other known zzso zzso A zzso zzso segment at the zzso zzso contains many strongly zzso zzso and may be critical for the zzso interaction with zzso zzso This approach should allow rapid characterization of zzso from large numbers of zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso were zzso and zzso using a zzso expression zzso which zzso an zzso zzso segment zzso containing 6 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both found to bind to either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein was also shown to incorporate into zzso zzso in zzso This zzso strategy likely will have general zzso for the study of zzso proteins in zzso and in zzso
