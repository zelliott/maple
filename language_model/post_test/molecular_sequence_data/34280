The zzso domain of the influenza virus zzso protein 2 zzso is highly zzso between influenza A virus strains compared to zzso and zzso and has long been viewed as a potential and universal vaccine zzso zzso zzso no or only weak and transient immune responses following infection, making it difficult to detect zzso zzso producing zzso in human peripheral blood zzso Recently, using a zzso manipulation method, zzso array zzso on a chip zzso we obtained an zzso human zzso zzso from the peripheral blood of a healthy zzso In this report, we have demonstrate that zzso reacted not only to seasonal influenza A zzso but also to pandemic zzso 2009 virus zzso zzso and highly zzso avian influenza A virus, and that the zzso zzso of 2009 zzso zzso the virus with high affinity zzso More importantly, it inhibited 2009 zzso viral propagation in zzso These results suggest that zzso might be a potential candidate for zzso zzso for a wide range of influenza A zzso
