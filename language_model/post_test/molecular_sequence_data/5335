The zzso zzso zzso and the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso The zzso precursor was zzso by gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso column separation and then by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence analysis, determined by zzso degradation, zzso treatments and zzso assisted laser zzso time of zzso The structure of the zzso zzso material demonstrates considerable zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso but it is smaller, 15 zzso zzso 30 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is not only larger zzso zzso but it exhibits a higher sequence identity with guinea pig zzso zzso Both of the zzso materials possess zzso and zzso in a ratio of zzso for zzso and zzso in the zzso They also contain zzso and zzso sequences that are flanked by zzso zzso acid zzso demonstrating zzso zzso Furthermore, using sequence comparison with bovine zzso A zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is found in the zzso of both animals and it exhibits a zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso Finally, zzso binding experiments demonstrate the presence in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as also found human and zzso immune zzso This report constitutes the first complete zzso characterization of zzso zzso in zzso demonstrating its origin in simpler zzso
