The interaction of zzso zzso protein zzso with the potent zzso agent zzso and its 12 zzso zzso binding protein zzso was zzso The zzso complex inhibited the zzso zzso activity of each of two zzso zzso which contain either the zzso zzso A alpha or A beta zzso A alpha or A zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by the zzso complex irrespective of the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso in a zzso manner, and complete zzso of the zzso activity appeared to require a zzso excess of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed tissue differences in the concentration of zzso which may be of importance to the selectivity for zzso of all of the biological zzso zzso binding studies with zzso suggest that the ratio of zzso complex to zzso in zzso when zzso production is inhibited is well correlated with the ratio when zzso zzso activity is inhibited in zzso These results suggest that zzso is a relevant cellular target of zzso when bound to zzso
