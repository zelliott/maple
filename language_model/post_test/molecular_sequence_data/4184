The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned and disrupted in this zzso The zzso zzso did not accumulate zzso but accumulated high levels of zzso zzso of the two copies of the zzso gene did not abolish growth even at 42 degrees C, but decreased the growth zzso In the stationary phase, the zzso zzso zzso more than 50% of its cells became permeable to zzso zzso and a large amount of protein was found in the culture zzso zzso occurred only at pH values higher than 7 and was avoided by zzso it was never observed during the exponential phase of zzso The zzso formed colonies with a smooth border on zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells died after 8 days, while zzso of those zzso with the same number of zzso of the zzso zzso survived for at least 1 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the zzso of zzso interferes with the assembly of a normal cell zzso
