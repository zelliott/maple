zzso errors are necessary so as to allow gene expression in various zzso In zzso synthesis of pol gene products zzso either zzso of a stop zzso or zzso Here we present an experimental system that permits zzso of zzso errors in zzso It consists of a family of expression zzso carrying different zzso versions of the zzso gene as zzso zzso include both an zzso stop zzso and zzso deletions that require zzso or zzso respectively, to give rise to an active zzso This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in zzso zzso In addition, one of the zzso contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of zzso This latter zzso was used to zzso the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level zzso at the zzso junction of zzso The effect of zzso and zzso two antibiotics known to influence zzso zzso was also tested in cultured zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso affects zzso and zzso while zzso had no zzso This family of zzso can be used to zzso the influence of structural and external factors on zzso ambiguity in both zzso cells and zzso
