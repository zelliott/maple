The zzso linkage contributions to the circular zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso the zzso CD from the CD of the zzso For this purpose, the CD of zzso zzso and of other zzso zzso was zzso Application of empirical zzso rules indicates the observed CD to be that expected for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as derived from zzso data and modeling zzso The difference in CD sign in the two zzso arises from a zzso of the zzso zzso atom from one zzso to the neighboring zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the preceding zzso sugar zzso demonstrating the unusually high spatial resolution of zzso analysis that can be achieved with CD under favorable zzso
