The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso symmetrical zzso was solved by zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso The two independently folded zzso pack together by means of extensive zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso comprises three alpha zzso and a zzso mixed zzso sheet arranged to form a deep zzso zzso zzso important zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are located near the bottom of the cavity and positioned as expected from zzso zzso An unexpected acid group zzso is also located in the active site adjacent to zzso and kinetic and binding studies of the zzso to Ala zzso demonstrate that zzso contributes to zzso by stabilizing the zzso
