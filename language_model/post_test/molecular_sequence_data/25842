The DNA sequence of the zzso virus zzso corresponding to the zzso virus zzso to A1 region has been zzso zzso of this sequence reveals zzso gene zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and A1 genes of zzso zzso In contrast, no gene zzso for the zzso zzso virus zzso gene was present in zzso zzso Instead, a gene transcribed from the opposite strand to the zzso virus zzso gene showing no zzso to any previously zzso zzso gene was zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso had undergone substantial changes, including zzso which would be predicted to zzso the zzso zzso of a gene zzso composed of the zzso virus zzso promoter and the zzso gene into the zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso followed by zzso into zzso virus, was carried zzso zzso zzso zzso with the correct zzso were obtained for zzso and zzso which, when tested in chickens did not appear to have been zzso No stable zzso zzso were obtained for zzso indicating that this gene probably encodes a function which is essential for virus zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso virus represent useful zzso sites for the construction of zzso zzso virus zzso
