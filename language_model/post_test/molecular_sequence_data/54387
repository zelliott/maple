The zzso of specific proteins to form zzso zzso zzso is a characteristic feature of a number of age-related and debilitating zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso forms characteristic zzso zzso and is one of several zzso that accumulate in zzso deposits located within zzso zzso X-ray zzso analysis of aligned zzso zzso indicated a simple zzso composed of two parallel zzso zzso of zzso zzso using transmission electron zzso scanning transmission electron zzso and atomic force zzso indicated that the zzso are flat ribbons composed of one zzso zzso per zzso rise of the zzso zzso results using zzso substitution zzso are consistent with a parallel zzso structural model for zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of zzso zzso labeled with specific zzso provided distance constraints for selected zzso pairs located within the zzso These findings were used to develop a simple zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations showed that the model contained a stable zzso with a flexible connecting loop devoid of persistent secondary zzso The time course of the MD simulations revealed that charge clusters in the zzso rearrange to minimize the effects of zzso interactions inherent in parallel zzso zzso Our structural model for zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso fold and zzso to form a stable zzso containing relatively zzso connecting zzso
