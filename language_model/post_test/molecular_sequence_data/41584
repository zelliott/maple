Forest fires have been the major zzso zzso in zzso zzso To adapt to fire zzso different strategies have zzso This study focuses on wood zzso and a specific adaptation to forest fire: increased heat resistance in their zzso Fifteen species of wood zzso were selected and a zzso sorted in two groups according to their prevalence in zzso zzso The zzso were cultivated on fresh wood and exposed to 100, zzso 180, zzso for 5, 10, 15, 20 and zzso under laboratory zzso A clear difference was found among the two zzso Species prevalent in zzso zzso had a much higher survival rate over all combinations of time and temperature compared to species associated with other zzso Thus, the results indicate that fire adaptation in terms of increased heat resistance in zzso occurs in some species of wood zzso Such adaptation will influence the ecology and population dynamics of wood zzso as well as having implications for best practices during restoration zzso
