With the aim of interfering with the signaling pathways zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to the sequence zzso of zzso zzso which zzso the secondary zzso of zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso This zzso was modified to enter cells by zzso to the third zzso of zzso zzso which is able to zzso across cell zzso Here we present CD and zzso studies on the zzso behavior in zzso environments and on zzso interactions of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso These studies evidenced that zzso rather than zzso interactions determine the zzso zzso on zzso zzso performed with zzso protein containing the zzso domain of zzso fused with zzso and with isolated zzso zzso demonstrated that the presence of the zzso zzso zzso only slightly affects the binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In fact, it has been shown that in isolated zzso zzso both zzso zzso and its zzso zzso greatly affect either the zzso recruitment of the zzso to the zzso protein band 3 and the following zzso of the protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to enter cells has been demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso
