The complete primary structure of zzso from zzso zzso Y has been determined by analysis of peptides after zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were separated by zzso and analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The protein consists of 105 zzso (Mr zzso zzso its zzso acid sequence shows a clear zzso to the five known zzso from plant or bacterial sources, with zzso zzso identity when the proteins are aligned at the zzso zzso Not only the zzso regions are zzso but also zzso which belong to the zzso surface suggested to be important for binding of zzso zzso in zzso interactions with other proteins zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of zzso zzso zzso has been derived from the zzso coli zzso structure with computer zzso This model indicates that the overall structures as well as the active sites are closely zzso however, the zzso zzso allow both proteins to adopt different local folding as shown in the zzso zzso
