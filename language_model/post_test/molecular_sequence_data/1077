The zzso zzso is subject to damage from zzso acid zzso that promotes normal tissue injury resulting in the development of Barrett's zzso There is a selection pressure for mutating zzso in this zzso zzso thus identifying a zzso relevant model for discovering novel regulators of the zzso zzso zzso technologies were used to identify such zzso regulatory factors by identifying proteins that were zzso in Barrett's zzso A very abundant zzso selectively expressed in Barrett's zzso was identified as anterior zzso zzso methods confirmed that anterior zzso is universally zzso in Barrett's zzso relative to normal zzso tissue derived from the same zzso zzso of the anterior zzso gene into cells enhances colony formation, similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso suggesting that anterior zzso can function as a survival zzso zzso of the zzso 10 zzso acids of anterior zzso zzso the colony enhancing activity of the zzso suggesting a key role for this domain in enhancing cell zzso zzso zzso of anterior zzso does not alter zzso parameters in zzso cells, suggesting that this gene is not directly zzso the cell zzso However, cells zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso and silence zzso zzso function in ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 10 zzso acids of anterior zzso permits zzso at zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso motif promoting colony survival also contributes to suppression of the zzso zzso zzso These data identify anterior zzso as a novel survival factor whose study may shed light on cellular pathways that zzso the tumor zzso zzso
