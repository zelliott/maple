zzso zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that forms a complex with zzso and zzso Its zzso in humans leads to the zzso storage disorder zzso zzso The zzso manifestations in patients relate primarily to the severe zzso of zzso and the zzso significance of zzso A activity remains zzso The mouse model of zzso which closely resembles the human zzso shows that cells from numerous zzso especially the central nervous system zzso are affected by this zzso To study the site and level of expression of zzso zzso in zzso and human zzso we analyzed the promoter regions of the corresponding zzso Their zzso zzso regions were zzso similar in both organization and zzso A single zzso zzso transcript is present in humans, whereas mouse zzso have a major zzso and a minor zzso transcript, both of which are zzso zzso These two mouse zzso species differ only in their zzso untranslated region zzso The larger zzso unique to zzso is transcribed from an upstream zzso promoter, which is absent in the human zzso The downstream promoter, which transcribes the zzso zzso common to human and zzso has characteristics of zzso gene promoters and contains putative zzso binding sites and three zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that expression from the downstream promoter is higher than that from the upstream zzso zzso In zzso zzso of mouse tissue sections identified regions of the brain that zzso express the zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso zzso distribution and regulation in zzso zzso differs from that in human zzso
