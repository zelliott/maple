A novel B zzso activity, required for high levels of zzso zzso from an zzso heavy chain zzso promoter, was detected in an in zzso system consisting of zzso zzso extracts zzso with zzso B cell nuclear zzso The factor responsible for this activity was designated Oct zzso from B cells zzso zzso stimulates the zzso from an zzso promoter in conjunction with either zzso or zzso but shows no significant effect on the zzso zzso of the zzso expressed zzso zzso promoter and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso may be a major zzso for B zzso zzso of zzso zzso In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between Oct factors and zzso we propose a mechanism of action for zzso and discuss the implications of zzso for the zzso regulation of other zzso zzso
