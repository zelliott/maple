zzso zzso often adopts a zzso zzso lifestyle that differs greatly from that of zzso zzso zzso formation represents a protected mode of growth that allows cells to survive in hostile zzso In this study, in zzso comparative zzso analysis was carried out to identify genes that are zzso expressed in zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that about 12 % of genes showed significant differential expression: 139 were activated and 104 were zzso in zzso vs the zzso zzso The differential expression of 20 selected genes was confirmed by real-time zzso In addition, regulation of expression of these genes during zzso development was tested in 100 and 400 zzso deep zzso zzso comparison of optical images consistently demonstrated that changes in zzso thickness are accompanied by significant shifts in cell zzso From evaluation of gene expression patterns, it was shown that the majority of the genes tested were significantly zzso in 400 vs 100 zzso deep zzso This study provides a zzso synopsis and adds important insights into gene expression in zzso development processes of zzso zzso which are strongly associated with the zzso of dental zzso
