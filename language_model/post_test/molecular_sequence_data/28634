When the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported in 1993 the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso appeared to be missing, based on a comparison of all putative reading frames to the then known zzso zzso Since there has been a large increase in known zzso zzso the question of a zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso A previously described unknown reading frame of 161 zzso was found to be part of an zzso gene split by a single group III zzso This zzso zzso which is highly variable from species to species, was then isolated and characterized in five other zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso All seven zzso zzso genes have either one or three group III zzso The zzso gene products in zzso zzso appear to be the most variable in this gene family when compared to the zzso gene in other species of bacteria, algae and zzso Additionally, zzso zzso proteins lack a zzso domain required for interaction with some regulatory zzso a feature shared only with some zzso green zzso The zzso zzso gene is the zzso zzso of a zzso cluster that includes genes for zzso zzso zzso electron zzso an antenna complex and zzso zzso This study provides new insights into the zzso system of zzso zzso the organization of the zzso zzso group III zzso evolution and zzso zzso
