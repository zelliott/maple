We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from a rat liver zzso library using a reverse zzso zzso cloning zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and was 70 and zzso identical in zzso and zzso acid sequences respectively with human liver zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Thus zzso is probably a rat zzso of human BAT zzso zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso of adult rats and rats immediately after, but not before, zzso It was expressed in the zzso the zzso zzso cells and the zzso cells of the zzso An zzso zzso zzso detected a protein of molecular mass 46 zzso in the zzso After partial zzso the levels of zzso zzso decreased at 6 and 12 h in the zzso zzso In a zzso model, zzso expression of zzso zzso decreased at 6 and 12 h after zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso expression suggests that it may play a role in zzso zzso
