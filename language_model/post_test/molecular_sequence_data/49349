The zzso gene from zzso zzso encodes a protein that binds zzso zzso and antibiotics with high zzso Previously, it has been shown that shifting pH from 6 to 4 reduces binding activity of zzso by about zzso indicating that zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso In this study, molecular analysis of the zzso coding region revealed sequence discrepancies with the zzso sequence reported zzso which were probably due to sequencing zzso The zzso gene was subsequently cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso to establish the revised zzso zzso and molecular approaches were used to determine the functional role of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the corrected sequence for zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso reduced binding activity by about 95 zzso zzso treatment increased zzso at zzso zzso by an amount indicating conversion to zzso of a single zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso with zzso protected zzso against modification by zzso with a 1 : 1 zzso ratio of zzso to the protected zzso zzso Based on protein secondary structure and zzso acid surface probability zzso it is predicted that zzso might be the zzso required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso to either zzso or zzso resulted in about 32 % loss of binding activity, and deletion of zzso totally abolished binding zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso had no zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a key role either in an zzso interaction between zzso and zzso or in the zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso
