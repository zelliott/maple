A zzso transgenic mouse zzso detection system (Big zzso was used to determine the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous zzso in two rapidly dividing zzso zzso germ cells and zzso and one slowly dividing tissue zzso at 3 and 10 months of zzso By screening zzso million zzso zzso a total of zzso circular zzso plaques were recovered from the three zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were determined by sequencing the zzso gene and associated zzso operator in all samples and correcting for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were similar in all three zzso and there were no zzso or zzso zzso When the zzso spectrum in each tissue was compared by utilizing large numbers of independent zzso zzso 75 per zzso there was evidence for small zzso zzso The spectrum of zzso zzso which clearly represents in zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso providing additional evidence that observed zzso occur in zzso In the aggregate, the results suggest that there is: zzso a core zzso frequency and spectrum that is modified zzso by zzso zzso and zzso a zzso level of spontaneous zzso in adult mice reflecting the balance between the zzso of new zzso and the elimination of zzso cells by either selection against zzso cellular function or zzso triggered by accumulated DNA zzso
