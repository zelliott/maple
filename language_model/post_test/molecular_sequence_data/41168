A zzso zzso rod zzso was isolated from coastal soil samples of zzso Island zzso zzso Taiwan, and its zzso position was zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that isolate zzso was grouped into the zzso zzso with the highest similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities to all other species of the zzso zzso were lower than zzso The zzso pattern contained the major compounds zzso and zzso The fatty acid profile, zzso the major fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major zzso fatty acid, supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From these data, as well as from zzso and zzso tests, strain zzso could be clearly differentiated from the most closely related species of the zzso zzso It is concluded that strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
