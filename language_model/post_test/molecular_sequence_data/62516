We have previously reported that zzso zzso the major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso binds zzso with high affinity via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 75, zzso and produces zzso by catalyzing the reduction of zzso or zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso Huang, zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 75, zzso a feature characteristic of zzso soluble zzso extracted from the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso are most vulnerable to zzso we investigated whether modifications of these zzso were responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused by incubation with zzso was found to induce a zzso signal characteristic of zzso zzso Using zzso and a zzso specific zzso we confirmed that zzso (at zzso lower than that associated with zzso zzso zzso the generation of zzso zzso zzso of human, but not zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso strongly promoted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is initiated by interaction of zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso modification is significant since it is highly resistant to zzso and is known to play a role in increasing structural zzso Given the elevated concentration of zzso in senile zzso our results suggest that zzso interactions with zzso could be responsible for causing the zzso zzso of zzso in these zzso
