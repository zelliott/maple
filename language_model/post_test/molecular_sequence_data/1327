zzso plants are known to zzso acid zzso to digest zzso mainly insects, for nitrogen zzso In the present study, we have zzso for the first time, to zzso two acid zzso zzso I and zzso from the pitcher fluid of zzso zzso (a zzso known locally as zzso and investigated their zzso and structural zzso Both zzso were zzso active at pH zzso zzso towards zzso zzso the specificity of zzso I towards oxidized insulin B chain appears to be similar, but slightly wider than those of other zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso properties, however, the most notable is their unusual zzso both zzso were remarkably stable at or below 50 degrees C, especially zzso I was extremely stable over a wide range of pH from 3 to 10 for over 30 zzso This suggests an evolutionary adaptation of the zzso to their specific zzso We have also cloned the zzso and deduced the complete zzso acid sequences of the precursors of zzso I and II zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the pitcher tissue of zzso zzso Although the corresponding mature zzso (each zzso zzso are zzso with ordinary zzso zzso both zzso had a high content of zzso zzso (12 zzso which are assumed to form six unique zzso bonds as suggested by computer zzso and are supposed to contribute towards the remarkable stability of zzso Moreover, the zzso acid sequence identity of zzso with ordinary zzso including plant zzso zzso is remarkably low zzso zzso and zzso comparison shows that zzso are zzso related to them to form a novel zzso of zzso with a high content of zzso zzso and a characteristic zzso named 'the zzso zzso zzso that includes a large number of novel, zzso plant zzso emerging in the zzso zzso
