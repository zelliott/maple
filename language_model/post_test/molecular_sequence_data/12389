The zzso zzso b zzso is zzso by zzso zzso coli that cause zzso zzso in animals and zzso It is a zzso acid zzso containing two zzso bridges, between zzso 10 and 48 and 21 and 36, which are crucial for its biological zzso Here, we report the solution structure of zzso determined by two- and three-dimensional zzso zzso Approximate zzso distances derived from zzso data were used to construct structures of zzso using zzso and simulated zzso zzso The zzso structure shows that zzso is zzso between zzso 10 and 22 and zzso 38 and zzso The zzso structure in the region zzso is zzso and exposes several polar zzso to the zzso some of which have been shown to be important in determining the toxicity of zzso The zzso zzso on the opposite face of this zzso make contacts with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The loop region between zzso 21 and 36 has another cluster of zzso zzso and exposes zzso 29 and zzso 30, which have been shown to be important for zzso zzso zzso CD studies show that reduction of zzso bridges results in a dramatic loss of structure, which zzso with loss of zzso zzso zzso adopts a predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of native, fully reduced, and zzso species in equilibrium zzso of zzso in zzso buffers indicate that the formation of the two zzso bonds in zzso is only moderately zzso Similar zzso in the presence of 8 M zzso suggest that the native secondary structure significantly zzso the zzso zzso
