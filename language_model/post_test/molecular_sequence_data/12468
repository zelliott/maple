The zzso of primer zzso initiation and zzso by zzso coli zzso were zzso The zzso DNA template that was used to develop the system, zzso zzso zzso the preferred initiating zzso zzso zzso five zzso 3' to the zzso the minimum required for efficient primer zzso and zzso a single zzso placed near the zzso to facilitate study of zzso zzso analog incorporation at a unique zzso The zzso monitored zzso zzso incorporation into the zzso zzso The various zzso were separated by length using zzso zzso gel zzso Different types of zzso were observed when synthesis was monitored using zzso versus zzso zzso as the zzso When zzso incorporation was the probe, only zzso initiated with zzso from the unique template zzso were zzso The sequences of these zzso were complementary to that of the zzso No zzso shorter than a zzso zzso demonstrating that formation of the first zzso bond was much slower than that of the next 10 zzso zzso The longest primer observed when monitoring zzso incorporation was 16 zzso long, the correct length for a primer completely zzso and initiated at the unique zzso zzso of a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso indicated very poor zzso discrimination by this zzso When zzso was the probe for primer zzso all zzso zzso were observed whether or not they were initiated with zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso and the zzso template zzso zzso were zzso The template zzso zzso accumulated faster than the zzso zzso but, at long incubation times, the zzso zzso became the dominant zzso The zzso zzso were not fully related to the template zzso zzso since they were not initiated complementary to the template zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso did appear to arise as a consequence of the template zzso species since their length was double and they arose in the time course after the zzso zzso
