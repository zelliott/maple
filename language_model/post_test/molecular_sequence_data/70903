Type 2A zzso protein zzso zzso have been implicated as important zzso of a diverse array of zzso protein zzso events in zzso We have identified a novel zzso gene zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso type regulatory zzso of zzso The protein zzso by this gene is zzso identical and zzso similar to the previously identified zzso zzso The zzso delta gene appears to be expressed in all zzso zzso indicating its protein product has a basic zzso function in plant zzso Unlike certain zzso derived from the zzso gamma zzso zzso delta zzso do not zzso significantly in response to heat zzso Further analysis of zzso sequences derived from the zzso genes identified an alternatively spliced zzso derived from zzso zzso This zzso differs from the previously identified zzso gamma zzso by the absence of a zzso region in its zzso untranslated zzso The missing zzso region appears to constitute an zzso zzso and its presence in the zzso gamma gene was confirmed by zzso using zzso zzso DNA as a zzso zzso gamma zzso containing the zzso zzso accumulate in all zzso zzso and their levels zzso zzso in response to heat zzso The zzso insert contains two short open reading frames and hence might serve as a zzso control mechanism affecting zzso gamma protein zzso Finally we show, using both the zzso two hybrid system and in zzso binding zzso that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is able to associate with other zzso zzso supporting the notion that the zzso protein serves as a regulator of zzso activity in zzso
