The human zzso zzso zzso is comprised of a linear zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso envelope containing zzso zzso Of these zzso the zzso is the least well defined in terms of both protein content and zzso Several of the major zzso proteins are zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso open reading frame zzso zzso to zzso zzso structures and was shown recently to be essential for zzso To zzso the zzso zzso acid sequences necessary for its trafficking and function in the zzso replication cycle, two types of viral zzso were zzso Using a series of zzso viruses expressing various zzso fluorescent protein zzso we demonstrate that zzso at zzso 2 and an zzso cluster zzso zzso acids 44 to zzso are required for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso observed for zzso zzso A second approach involving the generation of several zzso deletion zzso indicated that at least the zzso two-thirds of this zzso is zzso for viral zzso Furthermore, the data suggest that an zzso region of zzso containing the zzso is required for viral zzso Regarding zzso incorporation or zzso zzso we provide evidence that suggests that a zzso form of zzso is zzso zzso is required, and sequences within the first 57 zzso acids are zzso
