zzso diseases and noxious stimuli to the brain enhance zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso gene encodes a zzso additional zzso zzso which exhibits distinct regulation, properties, and functional zzso zzso decreases expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may limit zzso injury associated to zzso of zzso in zzso Given that zzso express at least two zzso zzso zzso and zzso driven by distinct zzso any changes in zzso transcript level must be examined to define the zzso induced by each stimulus or neurological zzso
