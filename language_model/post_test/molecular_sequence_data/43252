zzso zzso which is thought to play a central role in the cooperative functioning of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso to test its proposed role in zzso cooperative oxygen zzso This results in an zzso increase in oxygen affinity and a marked decrease in zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding to the zzso zzso suggest an altered zzso zzso state, which has been confirmed by high resolution crystal structures in the zzso and carbon zzso zzso Analysis of the structures at zzso end points reveals them to be remarkably similar to the corresponding zzso structures, with differences confined to the disposition of zzso 97 side chain, zzso zzso and the interface water zzso Increased oxygen affinity results from the absence of the zzso side chain, whose tight packing in the zzso pocket of the zzso state normally restricts the zzso from assuming a high affinity zzso The absence of the zzso side chain is also associated with diminished zzso since zzso packs in the zzso pocket in both zzso zzso zzso appears to be coupled with observed structural transitions and suggests that parallel pathways for communication exist in zzso zzso zzso
