A class of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso has been identified in zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso receptors are formed partially or wholly of zzso zzso zzso These receptors generate a zzso current in response to zzso but differ from zzso receptors in a number of zzso zzso widely accepted as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso displays competitive and zzso antagonism of zzso receptors in perch and bovine zzso and zzso zzso 1 receptors expressed in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify the molecular basis of the two components of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso By using a zzso and zzso strategy, a difference in zzso sensitivity between zzso 1 and zzso 2 receptors was localized to a single zzso acid in the putative second zzso zzso zzso of this zzso acid with zzso found in the analogous position in highly zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso the competitive component of zzso zzso of the zzso 1 zzso receptors was almost zzso These findings demonstrate that an zzso acid in the putative channel domain of zzso zzso 1 receptors influences zzso sensitivity and mediates zzso binding by an zzso zzso
