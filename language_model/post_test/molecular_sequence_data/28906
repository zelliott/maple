zzso a zzso regulatory zzso has been shown to respond to environmental zzso To better understand how the aquatic zzso zzso zzso a fish zzso responds to environmental signals that may be necessary for survival in the aquatic and fish environment, zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The deduced protein sequences were 59 and zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made in each gene and functional analyses were zzso zzso analyses using a rainbow trout model showed that only the zzso zzso was slightly decreased in zzso indicating that zzso is not a major regulator of zzso zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso was zzso less zzso than the wild zzso Like many regulatory zzso zzso was shown to zzso regulate its own zzso zzso membrane protein zzso preparations from both zzso indicated that zzso and zzso positively regulate a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be a major zzso which zzso with an zzso to zzso an outer membrane zzso from zzso zzso and which has an zzso zzso zzso identical to that of zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso enhanced resistance to zzso zzso in the growth medium increased expression of the zzso zzso but did not affect expression of zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso forms a better zzso on a glass surface than the wild type, suggesting a new role for zzso in the response to environmental zzso
