The zzso of block of zzso zzso channels has been investigated extensively during the past 8 zzso In the last few years, cloned zzso zzso channels have become zzso Here we have discussed advantages and disadvantages of studying block phenomena in cloned zzso zzso Some recent work on the pore block of the cloned zzso zzso channels was critically reviewed and extended by data about the calcium zzso Novel effects of zzso on cloned zzso receptors and of zzso on cloned zzso receptors were reported and discussed with respect to recent work concerning possible occurrence of zzso hybrid zzso
