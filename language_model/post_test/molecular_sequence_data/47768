zzso resistance among South African clinical zzso of zzso zzso was shown to be due to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso analysis of 24 zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso within cluster I as well as novel zzso in an area designated zzso cluster zzso Of the 24 zzso zzso only 1 resistant isolate did not contain any zzso in the regions zzso Either the cluster I or the cluster III zzso separately zzso zzso of 32 to 128 zzso Clinical isolate 55, for which the zzso was 256 zzso was noted to contain 9 of the 10 zzso identified, which included the cluster I and cluster III zzso As in zzso coli, it is possible that cluster I zzso acids zzso to zzso and cluster III zzso acids 523 to zzso of zzso zzso interact to form part of the zzso binding site, thus accounting for the very high zzso observed for isolate zzso zzso products containing cluster I or cluster III zzso were able to transform zzso zzso zzso to zzso Although many of the zzso studied displayed identical zzso zzso gel zzso analysis revealed that the zzso were not of zzso zzso
