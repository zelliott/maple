Human zzso contains at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso that somewhat resembles zzso by containing an extended zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain is composed of 11 distinct zzso zzso Ten of these display high sequence zzso to zzso zzso 4 zzso The zzso coordinates for zzso were used to generate three-dimensional molecular models of the zzso zzso types, and the zzso region of zzso was used to compare the different potential zzso and zzso sites contained in each different zzso zzso of zzso A zzso site can be proposed for each zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso zzso sites, containing zzso and zzso are located on the surface of the zzso The zzso site of one zzso zzso model is almost identical to that of zzso and may be a zzso site of zzso Four other zzso zzso models appear to have structurally similar zzso sites, but with differences that may influence zzso zzso Five zzso zzso models have zzso sites that probably do not bind zzso one of these is the highly repeated zzso in the known zzso zzso
