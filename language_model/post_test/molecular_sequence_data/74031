Two major mechanisms for the regulation of zzso B cells that arise in the bone zzso are functional zzso zzso and zzso Studies to date suggest that low zzso interactions between B cells and zzso lead to B cell zzso whereas high zzso interactions lead to zzso zzso stranded zzso DNA zzso represent a zzso zzso in zzso Lupus zzso zzso An understanding of their regulation is critical to an understanding of zzso We now demonstrate in a transgenic model in which mice express the heavy chain of a potentially zzso zzso zzso that zzso affinity for zzso does not alone determine the fate of zzso B zzso B cells making zzso with similar affinities for zzso are regulated differently, depending on light chain zzso A major implication of this observation is that zzso may not be the self zzso responsible for cell fate zzso of zzso B zzso Light chain usage may determine zzso zzso and zzso zzso may regulate B cells that also bind zzso
