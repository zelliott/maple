Two zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso zzso (named zzso and zzso have been isolated from the liver zzso library in addition to the previously reported zzso zzso Although they have the identical zzso position with human zzso zzso the zzso sequences are distinct from those of human zzso Among these rabbit zzso zzso there are no significant differences in pharmacological zzso high affinity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and low affinity for zzso using zzso cells expressing each zzso by zzso binding zzso Competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso - zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso was expressed in liver, zzso zzso brain stem and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a distinct distribution pattern in zzso zzso zzso was expressed most abundantly in those zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing each zzso with zzso density zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso 1200 zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso respectively, showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso which was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso rate zzso in the zzso clones with zzso values of zzso 19 for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso concentration zzso in the zzso clones with zzso values of zzso 14 for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study shows the occurrence of three zzso zzso of rabbit zzso which are unique in zzso sequence and in tissue zzso They show similar pharmacological profiles in binding studies but zzso had the highest potency of zzso in functional studies in spite of the lowest zzso zzso These findings suggest that the structure of zzso of zzso may give the characteristic functional zzso
