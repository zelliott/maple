There is growing evidence that the zzso is not a passive zzso for zzso and zzso transport but serves a function for the zzso and/or zzso The zzso zzso zzso one or more specific zzso that associate with the egg after zzso Several published reports including our preliminary studies have suggested that the zzso zzso from the zzso exists in several zzso species including golden zzso However, little or almost no zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso To analyze the molecular structure of the zzso in detail, we have attempted molecular cloning of zzso corresponding to zzso A zzso library constructed from the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso A single positive clone was isolated, and the zzso sequence of the isolated zzso was zzso Rapid amplification of zzso end was carried out to obtain a zzso zzso zzso end of the zzso The zzso clone consisted of zzso zzso and the coding region contained 2013 zzso translating to zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence confirmed the chemically determined zzso sequence of a zzso and suggested that the derived zzso acid sequence contained a signal zzso region (21 zzso zzso and 650 zzso acids zzso zzso of the mature form of the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso appeared to have eight potential zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that a single message of approximately zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso but not in the zzso of several other zzso zzso The zzso showed high zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso zzso and human zzso zzso These results demonstrate that an zzso zzso zzso gene exists in various zzso species including zzso
