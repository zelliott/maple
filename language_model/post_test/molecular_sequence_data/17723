zzso and zzso zzso induce amplification of zzso DNA sequences integrated in the zzso of Chinese zzso cells and increase amplification of the zzso zzso zzso gene during zzso selection in human skin zzso of a patient with zzso zzso By cell fusion experiments it could be shown that zzso gene amplification is zzso by one or several zzso zzso factors induced or activated in a dose dependent manner by all types of zzso One of these factors binds to a 10 zzso sequence within the minimal origin of replication of zzso In zzso competition with an excess of a synthetic zzso zzso this sequence blocks zzso zzso
