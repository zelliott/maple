zzso zzso release a potent inhibitor of factor zzso previously identified as a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso form of the zzso precursor proteins zzso zzso Two zzso truncated forms of the beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso are shown to be the zzso zzso zzso by zzso The release of beta zzso from zzso is responsible for the higher concentration of beta zzso in serum compared with zzso and zzso zzso data show that release of beta zzso is most consistent with alpha zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso a limited and specific zzso of zzso beta zzso resulting in loss of a zzso zzso This phenomena is dependent on both zzso concentration and duration of incubation and is inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso characteristics that can be duplicated in a mixture of zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso A similar effect of zzso on full-length zzso forms of beta zzso would result in a zzso remnant containing the intact zzso zzso
