The mouse major zzso complex is composed of several genes arranged into the K, D, zzso and zzso zzso The D region of the zzso mouse includes genes zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso and zzso We have determined the DNA sequence of the zzso gene and compared it with the known sequences of several class I zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene is similar to other class I zzso It also contains similar zzso regulatory zzso A zzso occurs in zzso seven, resulting in a gene product with a truncated zzso zzso To examine the surface expression of the zzso zzso we generated an zzso construct containing the promoter and zzso zzso zzso the signal zzso alpha 1, and alpha 2 external zzso of the zzso gene linked to zzso zzso zzso the alpha 3, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The construct was zzso into mouse L cells, and a protein was detected at the cell surface by a zzso zzso zzso specific for the alpha 3 domain of zzso as well as by other class zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed at low levels, it may be a functional class I gene that most probably evolved from a zzso region zzso
