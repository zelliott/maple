zzso is the most abundant nuclear protein in zzso zzso and zzso The term zzso zzso was coined to describe its role in the assembly of the zzso zzso of zzso Although zzso and DNA can zzso into zzso zzso can facilitate this process in zzso by competing against zzso charge zzso In zzso zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso and transfers them to zzso Another zzso nuclear zzso zzso binds and transfers zzso zzso and zzso zzso has at least one other role in modulating zzso structure in zzso zzso It is required for the first stage of zzso zzso zzso It binds and removes zzso basic proteins and replaces them by zzso zzso and zzso again forming zzso and resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition we propose that the properties of the nuclear zzso signal of zzso can be explained by a model in which heat shock zzso protein zzso has a zzso role in signal presentation during nuclear zzso
