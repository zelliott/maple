zzso zzso zzso is the major constituent of paired zzso filaments zzso from Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso This conclusion has been based largely on the creation and characterization of zzso zzso raised against zzso which can be classified in three zzso zzso those recognizing unmodified primary sequences of zzso zzso those recognizing zzso zzso on zzso and zzso those recognizing zzso zzso on zzso Recent studies have suggested that the zzso recognizing primary sequence and zzso zzso on zzso are unable to distinguish between normal adult biopsy zzso and zzso We now present evidence for a new fourth class of zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso on zzso typified by zzso a zzso zzso raised to zzso from zzso brain zzso Studies using a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthetic peptides enable the precise zzso mapping of zzso Additional studies demonstrate that zzso zzso with zzso mouse zzso and zzso but does not recognize adult mouse zzso or zzso derived from normal human autopsy or biopsy zzso Further investigation reveals that zzso recognizes a unique zzso of zzso found almost exclusively in zzso from zzso zzso
