We have zzso the utility of native chemical zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the improved zzso catalyst zzso acid zzso native chemical zzso could be performed at zzso and zzso sites without side zzso After zzso zzso at a zzso site could also be used as a zzso site, with minimal levels of byproduct zzso However, zzso is not appropriate for use as a site for native chemical zzso because of formation of significant amounts of zzso zzso The feasibility of native chemical zzso at zzso enabled a zzso total chemical synthesis of the zzso forms of the zzso toxin protein zzso The zzso protein zzso was zzso less active in blocking the zzso channel than the zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso was used to obtain high-resolution X-ray zzso data for zzso zzso The structure was solved by direct methods and showed significant differences from the previously reported zzso structures in some regions of the zzso protein zzso
