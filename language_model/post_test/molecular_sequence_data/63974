The Japanese zzso zzso zzso presumably differentiated from eastern zzso zzso zzso zzso populations during the zzso and the two species are closely zzso In order to zzso zzso and zzso events in the Japanese zzso and to describe historical and current relationships among their zzso we zzso and zzso a zzso of zzso of zzso DNA zzso control region in 50 individuals belonging to six populations of Japanese zzso and compared these sequences with 89 eastern zzso zzso control region sequences from zzso zzso There were high genetic similarities between both species and only two positions were fixed within each species, which supports the inclusion of the Japanese zzso in a single species with eastern populations of zzso zzso Japanese zzso ancestors zzso Japan after the separation of the two species, estimated at between zzso and zzso million years ago zzso The zzso zzso zzso mismatch distribution, and lack of correlation between geographic and genetic distances are in accordance with a rapid zzso of zzso throughout the zzso after the arrival into zzso The species shows low genetic variation within populations and high levels of genetic differentiation among populations with no zzso zzso shared across zzso zzso distances between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and any other population of zzso zzso zzso subspecies are comparable to the distances between populations of zzso zzso and zzso not supporting the zzso of zzso zzso as a different zzso
