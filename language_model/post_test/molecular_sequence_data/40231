The extent to which zzso sugar transport activity affects zzso zzso and zzso processes in zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso led to increased zzso zzso import into isolated zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew faster than zzso plants on soil and in zzso zzso liquid zzso These effects were correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and nitrate zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso plants zzso less zzso than zzso plants and only about half the amount of zzso zzso by zzso zzso In sum, these data show that zzso activity in zzso plants limits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced larger seeds and greater total seed yield, which was associated with increased zzso and protein zzso These changes in seed properties were correlated with slightly decreased nocturnal zzso release and increased sugar export rates from detached source zzso The zzso zzso which codes for a zzso zzso that may be critical for zzso loading in leaves, has been identified as zzso zzso Thus, the observation that zzso zzso increased slightly in zzso zzso leaves, characterized by lowered zzso zzso levels than zzso leaves, provided further evidence of a zzso source zzso In zzso increased zzso activity in zzso induced modified zzso sugar zzso altered cellular sugar zzso affected zzso zzso increased the biomass of zzso seeds, and accelerated early plant zzso
