The zzso protein from zzso coli is a specialized zzso factor required for the zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso into zzso Discrimination of the zzso zzso requires the presence of a recognition element within the zzso which is located at the 3' side of the zzso zzso a hairpin structure can be formed within this zzso zzso By gel shift zzso a specific interaction between zzso and the zzso recognition element could be zzso zzso experiments, using zzso or zzso as zzso agents, showed that zzso binds to the loop region of the hairpin zzso In the presence of zzso zzso formed a complex with the charged zzso and the zzso The results indicate that targeted zzso of zzso is accomplished by the binding of the zzso protein to this zzso recognition element, resulting in the formation of a zzso complex at the zzso in the immediate neighborhood of the zzso zzso
