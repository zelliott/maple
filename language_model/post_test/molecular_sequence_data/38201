All members of the snail gene family are zzso zzso factors expressed early in embryonic development and are involved in the formation of zzso such as zzso and zzso neural zzso Here, we report the identification and structural zzso of two snail genes in the compact zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and examine the zzso relationships between these and other members of the snail gene zzso Both genes have a three zzso two zzso structure similar to that previously reported for human zzso While human zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wood, zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso expression and zzso map location on zzso zzso 51, zzso the human zzso gene zzso was previously zzso We have used sequence similarity to the zzso genes to identify a human zzso zzso and mapped this by radiation hybrid and physical mapping to the zzso end of human zzso This is likely to be the mapping location of the human zzso gene zzso
