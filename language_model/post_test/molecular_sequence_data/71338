zzso molecular switches composed of zzso were created by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso via structural zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso triggers a zzso change within the bridge, and this structural reorganization dictates the activity of the adjoining zzso The modular nature of these zzso zzso makes possible the rapid construction of precision zzso molecular switches that trigger only in the presence of their corresponding zzso By using similar zzso engineering strategies, new zzso switches can be made to operate as designer molecular sensors or as a new class of genetic control zzso
