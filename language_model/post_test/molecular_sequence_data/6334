The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 6 zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was modified to zzso six zzso zzso immediately after the initiation zzso and was placed under the control of the zzso zzso alcohol zzso promoter in the zzso zzso On the methanol zzso active zzso zzso was produced within the zzso cells, and following cell zzso was separated from zzso proteins by affinity zzso using zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with a range of zzso zzso was zzso Second order association rate zzso zzso were derived for the interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and activated protein C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By monitoring complex formation, zzso zzso was also shown to interact with factor zzso No complex formation was observed with zzso human zzso zzso zzso G and tissue zzso zzso although zzso is apparently a zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
