A zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso They are involved in zzso or zzso steroid zzso and also act as zzso zzso zzso The zzso family members characterized thus far in human and rat have a high degree of protein sequence similarity but exhibit distinct zzso zzso Here we report the identification of nine zzso zzso genes in a cluster on zzso 13 by a combination of molecular cloning and in zzso analysis of this zzso These include four previously isolated mouse zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso the more zzso related zzso and four novel zzso zzso These genes exhibit highly zzso zzso organization and protein sequence predictions indicate zzso zzso acid zzso The previously identified zzso protein active site zzso are zzso among all nine zzso but differences are observed in regions that have been implicated in determining zzso zzso zzso also occur in tissue expression patterns, with expression of some genes restricted to specific zzso and others expressed at high levels in multiple zzso Our findings dramatically expand the repertoire of zzso genes and identify zzso family members with potential roles in the regulation of steroid zzso
