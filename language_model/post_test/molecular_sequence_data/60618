To determine the expression pattern of zzso 1 during the process of lens zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso chain reaction was performed to amplify a partial zzso zzso 1 zzso In zzso zzso and zzso methods were used to detect the zzso 1 zzso and the zzso 1 zzso zzso 

zzso 1 zzso was present in the zzso and in the lens (in the zzso and bow zzso of the intact zzso zzso 1 protein was found to be predominantly present in the lens and zzso iris of the intact eye, although some trace levels of zzso 1 protein were detected in the zzso iris as zzso After zzso expression of the zzso was also pronounced in the zzso zzso iris and the zzso zzso The zzso iris also expressed zzso 1 but seemingly at lower zzso Although zzso 1 protein showed zzso in the zzso iris during the process of lens zzso trace levels were also detected in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso 1 protein was distributed in horizontal cells of the inner nuclear layer, whereas the zzso was expressed in all layers of the zzso 

zzso 1 was zzso distributed in the intact cells of the zzso zzso with significantly higher levels of zzso 1 protein present in the zzso versus the zzso zzso This protein was zzso regulated during the process of lens zzso with obvious zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 1 is the first zzso factor to be shown to be regulated in the zzso versus zzso iris during the process of lens zzso
