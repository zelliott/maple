zzso protein zzso zzso is required for the repair of zzso DNA breaks through the zzso DNA end joining zzso zzso activity is required for DNA repair, but zzso activity also appears to be attenuated through an zzso feedback zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso zzso occurs in trans at least three sites zzso terminal to the zzso domain and that two sites, zzso zzso and zzso determine zzso zzso in zzso zzso substitution in zzso zzso zzso compromised cellular resistance to zzso radiation without affecting DNA end joining, suggesting a requirement for zzso zzso for cell survival at a step after the rejoining of zzso DNA zzso
