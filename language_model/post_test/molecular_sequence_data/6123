We examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of Ross River zzso virus in Australia and the Pacific zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso genes of five zzso virus strains revealed remarkable conservation between 1959 and 1989 with a maximum divergence of only zzso zzso data from a zzso pair zzso of the zzso gene from 51 additional strains showed that zzso virus has zzso genetically into three separate groups although at least zzso sequence zzso was still maintained between all 56 zzso Each genetic type zzso in a particular geographic region of Australia and can be broadly defined as occurring in the zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso However, some zzso virus strains did not follow this pattern of geographic distribution indicating movement of virus by the travel of zzso humans or livestock across the zzso The Pacific Islands zzso all belong to the zzso zzso These findings suggest genetic divergence and independent evolution of zzso virus within geographically isolated zzso zzso however, selective pressures maintain high zzso conservation in zzso
