zzso zzso with zzso leads to irreversible zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso In order to zzso the zzso site, the zzso bridge structure was initially zzso by zzso A consistent pattern of changes in the ability of zzso to stimulate signal zzso after zzso zzso of zzso located zzso zzso indicated that zzso in the zzso domain is connected to zzso in the second zzso loop, while zzso in this loop is connected to the highly zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical analysis of radioactive fragments of zzso zzso zzso following zzso and zzso digest with zzso zzso and zzso before and after introduction or elimination of potential zzso zzso sites indicated that zzso zzso to a segment zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The existence of the zzso bridge was directly confirmed as a labeled fragment, including that zzso was resolvable only under reducing zzso The observation that the zzso zzso zzso fragments had identical apparent size under zzso conditions shows that the zzso reaction disconnected the zzso bridge between zzso and zzso and indicates that zzso is probably the zzso involved in zzso of the zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso of zzso through a zzso side chain located at position 6 in the middle of the zzso leads to continued zzso of the zzso presumably through zzso binding to zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso
