Two zzso zzso zzso families were analyzed to detect the presence of functional divergence using the program zzso These two families, zzso and zzso each contain members related by zzso acid sequence zzso retaining zzso mechanisms, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise zzso Clan B, with a shared zzso roll zzso and zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and zzso and is divided into five main zzso four of the former and one of the zzso zzso comparisons between three of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso identified specific zzso acid zzso that play a role in the functional divergence between the two zzso zzso zzso contains zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso with various zzso zzso and product zzso Four cluster comparisons between these four main zzso again have identified zzso acid zzso involved in functional divergence between the zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
