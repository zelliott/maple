The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso In this study, the zzso acid zzso and structure and function of zzso were zzso By zzso zzso mass zzso zzso the molecular weight of zzso was determined to be 25 zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined by zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso and its peptides derived from zzso zzso The theoretical molecular mass calculated from the primary structure agrees well with the molecular weight determined by zzso zzso consists of two homogeneous zzso bound zzso The zzso with an zzso blocked by zzso acid contains 110 zzso acid zzso including eight zzso zzso two of which are considered to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso search revealed that the primary structure of zzso is similar to that of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso with a sequential zzso of 45 and zzso zzso When injected zzso into a zzso an increase in zzso zzso was observed with zzso or zzso On the other hand, only zzso exerted a strong zzso effect after intravenous injection of samples into a zzso zzso zzso has a zzso effect on zzso zzso Through the use of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso concentration of zzso was determined to be zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso had a zzso concentration at zzso zzso When incubated with zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso the cell growth was zzso suggesting that the mechanism of action of zzso is similar to that of zzso
