zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso are zzso zzso which participate in protein interaction by recognizing zzso motifs on target zzso To identify new zzso zzso we performed a zzso screen with a zzso region of human zzso One of the specific zzso interacting clones that were isolated from a mouse brain zzso library defines a new protein that was named zzso 2 because of its zzso to the previously reported zzso zzso 2 is expressed in a number of mouse zzso through multiple zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso acid sequence of a brain form of zzso 2 zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso associates in zzso with elements of the zzso machinery such as zzso and zzso On a zzso surface, the zzso interaction appeared to be direct and partly dependent on a zzso sequence of zzso Association with zzso was also observed in zzso cells after cell stimulation with nerve growth factor, suggesting that zzso 2 may be connected to zzso signaling zzso This hypothesis is strengthened by the ability of zzso to interact with the zzso exchange factor zzso in zzso as a possible point of zzso between the zzso and signaling zzso
