Cell barriers are essential for the maintenance and regulation of the zzso of the human zzso zzso peptides have simplified the delivery of zzso zzso across the plasma zzso Here, the passage of three zzso peptides zzso the zzso analogue zzso 10, and zzso across a zzso human colon cancer cell layer in zzso was zzso The peptides were zzso into zzso zzso cells as zzso by indirect zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Studies of zzso zzso from cells showed that the peptides were in equilibrium across the plasma zzso The ability of the peptides to cross a zzso cell layer was tested in a zzso model zzso After 120 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of added zzso zzso 10 and zzso respectively was detected in the lower zzso Both zzso and zzso 10 zzso decreased the zzso electrical resistance of the barrier model, with minimum values after 60 zzso of zzso and zzso of control zzso zzso did not affect the resistance of the cell layer to the same zzso Although zzso markedly increased the passage of zzso the zzso flux of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that the zzso peptides pass the zzso cell layer mainly by a mechanism involving a zzso zzso
