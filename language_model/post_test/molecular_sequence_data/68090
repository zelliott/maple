It has recently been shown that the precursors of various structurally unrelated zzso zzso peptides share similar zzso zzso in turn, are highly identical to a zzso zzso inhibitor named zzso or zzso In this paper we report a novel zzso sequence of zzso bone zzso origin, zzso a protein characterized by a zzso zzso The putative protein is 147 zzso acid zzso long, with a calculated mass of zzso Da and appears to be the precursor of a recently isolated zzso zzso named zzso zzso The unique sequence of the mature zzso is located at the zzso of the zzso Similar to the previously reported zzso both the signal zzso and the zzso of zzso appear highly zzso
