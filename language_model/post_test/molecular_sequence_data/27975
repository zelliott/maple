The zzso gene product is required in conditions of zzso acid zzso to repress the synthesis of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso is also required unconditionally for cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso expression and temperature sensitivity for growth associated with zzso zzso known as zzso zzso are completely masked by zzso zzso a positive regulator of zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso can promote or at least partially substitute for zzso function in normal growth conditions, while acting as an zzso of zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso We report here that the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shows extensive similarity with the zzso portion of zzso Based on this finding, it seems likely that zzso zzso specifically affect the domain of zzso that is similar in sequence to zzso We propose that zzso can substitute for this domain in a zzso zzso grown in normal growth conditions, and that modification of zzso in zzso conditions causes it to interfere with, rather than substitute for zzso zzso A zzso deletion and zzso are each expected to zzso a second domain for which zzso cannot substitute, accounting for the inability of zzso to mask the zzso associated with these zzso
