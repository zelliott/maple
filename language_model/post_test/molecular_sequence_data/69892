Currently available techniques used to recognize point zzso in genetic disease are time consuming and are capable of screening only small pieces of zzso Moreover, they detect all sequence differences including zzso silent zzso zzso they are not convenient to zzso zzso in large, zzso zzso where a large fraction of pathological point zzso arises from early zzso as is the case for the one third zzso cases of zzso zzso zzso We have developed a rapid and sensitive method, the zzso zzso Test zzso zzso is based on a combination of zzso zzso and translation and selectively detects zzso zzso We demonstrate its effectiveness to detect point zzso in zzso and carrier zzso zzso should be widely zzso zzso in any disease where early zzso contribute substantially to the disease zzso
