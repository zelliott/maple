The zzso zzso leukemia virus is a zzso zzso zzso that was originally reported to induce zzso leukemia in some strains of mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso sequences as DNA zzso we identified a new common zzso integration site called zzso (for zzso integration site zzso zzso zzso in zzso were detected in zzso of the tumors zzso The zzso locus was mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso 6, 85 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso Such viral integration in zzso causes zzso of the normal zzso major transcript of zzso zzso but also zzso the expression of a new, alternatively spliced zzso transcript from the zzso zzso gene that encodes a truncated zzso zzso of 17 zzso The expression of this zzso transcript is specific to tumors in which zzso is rearranged but is also detected at low levels in normal zzso
