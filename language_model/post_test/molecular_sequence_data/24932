zzso muscle cells zzso are zzso with respect to their zzso zzso and zzso properties, though the regulatory factors responsible for their zzso diversity remain largely zzso To further our understanding of smooth muscle gene regulation, we characterized the zzso elements of the zzso zzso protein 1 gene zzso zzso is expressed in all muscle cell types during zzso and zzso in vascular and visceral zzso in the zzso We identified a zzso zzso within the zzso gene that is sufficient to drive expression in zzso but not zzso or visceral zzso in transgenic zzso This zzso also exhibits zzso activity in the zzso tract of the heart and the zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso we found a single zzso box that binds serum response factor zzso and by zzso analysis, demonstrate that the activity of the zzso is dependent on this zzso zzso Our findings provide further evidence for the existence of distinct regulatory programs within zzso and suggest a role for zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso
