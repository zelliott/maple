zzso zzso of the prion protein zzso has been observed in different species and cell zzso We have investigated this poorly understood phenomenon by expressing fusion proteins of sheep prion protein and green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso cells, with variable sequence context surrounding the start zzso zzso zzso expressed with the zzso sequence was transported normally through the zzso zzso to the cell surface with acquisition of zzso groups, but two zzso fragments of zzso were detected zzso starting in frame from zzso When zzso was expressed with a compromised zzso sequence zzso dispersed zzso zzso was zzso A similar switch from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was seen when analogous zzso of sheep zzso without inserted zzso were zzso showing that this phenomenon is not caused by the zzso zzso Western zzso revealed a reduction in zzso forms of zzso whereas the zzso fragments starting from zzso were still zzso zzso of these zzso fragments was completely abolished when zzso was replaced by zzso indicating that leaky zzso scanning occurs for normal sheep zzso and that translation from zzso is the cause of the zzso zzso zzso observed for a fraction of the zzso In contrast, the same phenomenon was not detected upon expression of similar zzso for mouse zzso Analysis of samples from sheep brain allowed zzso detection of zzso zzso fragments, indicating that sheep zzso is subject to similar processing mechanisms in zzso
