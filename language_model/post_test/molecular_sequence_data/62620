The zzso promoter of rice zzso zzso virus zzso is regulated in part by zzso zzso proteins that bind to Box II, an essential zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that the zzso protein zzso is involved in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso identified by its interaction with zzso binds to Box II in in zzso zzso as a zzso and as zzso zzso Like zzso zzso activates the zzso promoter in transient zzso and in transgenic tobacco zzso Both zzso and zzso are predominantly expressed in vascular zzso However, zzso and zzso have different zzso affinities to Box II, show distinctive expression patterns in different rice zzso and exhibit different patterns of zzso zzso Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of zzso exhibit a zzso zzso We propose that the regulation of zzso expression of the zzso promoter and potentially the control of zzso replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the Box II zzso element with multiple host factors, including zzso and zzso We also propose that zzso of these and perhaps other zzso factors by zzso is involved in the development of the symptoms of rice zzso zzso
