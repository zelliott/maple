The plasticity of two selected zzso was studied in two typical zzso muscles at different time intervals after zzso zzso The zzso zzso muscle of the rat zzso is exquisitely sensitive to zzso whereas the superficial zzso zzso zzso lacks such zzso In zzso translation of zzso isolated from both zzso indicated that zzso was among the most zzso proteins of the LA at day 10 zzso zzso zzso whereas the template activity of the zzso zzso remains virtually zzso We used an available zzso zzso and demonstrated that the expression of the LA zzso message is reduced by zzso in zzso days and can be recovered after testosterone zzso zzso injections zzso + zzso In contrast, the zzso expression in zzso remains constant up to day 20 zzso In the zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso in zzso days and decreased 34 and zzso in zzso days and zzso days, respectively, although the measured zzso activity, as well as the in zzso translation of the message, remained elevated in those two latter zzso Control level of the zzso zzso expression was recovered in the zzso + zzso zzso Again, the expression of the message was unchanged in zzso suggesting that the protein synthesis of this skeletal muscle is far less sensitive to zzso deprivation than that of the LA zzso
