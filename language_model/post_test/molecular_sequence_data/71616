The human zzso zzso zzso zzso Band 3) contains up to 14 zzso zzso with a single site of zzso at zzso in zzso zzso loop zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to determine the folding pattern of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso or zzso cells, retained a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso loop 4 showed that zzso zzso sites zzso spaced 12 zzso from the ends of adjacent zzso segments could be zzso An zzso site introduced at position 743 in zzso zzso loop 5 that could be zzso in a zzso translation system was not zzso in zzso zzso zzso designed to disrupt the folding of this loop enhanced the level of zzso at zzso in zzso The results suggest that this loop might be zzso exposed to the zzso of the zzso zzso during zzso but normally folds zzso zzso zzso zzso loop 4 insertions into positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 1, 2, 6 and 7 respectively were efficiently zzso showing that these regions were zzso zzso loop 4 insertions into positions zzso or zzso were poorly zzso which was inconsistent with an zzso disposition for these regions of zzso zzso of zzso loop 4 into positions zzso and 820 in zzso zzso 3 and 6 respectively were not zzso in cells, which was consistent with a zzso disposition for these zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was used to assess whether the zzso zzso were in a native zzso zzso with insertions at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed impaired inhibitor zzso whereas insertions at positions zzso 820 and zzso retained zzso The results indicate that the folding of the zzso region of zzso is more complex than originally proposed and that this region of the zzso might have a dynamic zzso
