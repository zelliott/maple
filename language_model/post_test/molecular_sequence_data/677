zzso repeat zzso such as zzso expand in the human zzso to cause several neurological zzso As part of the expansion process the formation of non-B DNA zzso by the repeat sequence has previously been zzso Furthermore, the base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been implicated in the repeat expansion zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In this work we have found that the non-B zzso adopted by zzso a zzso is zzso to DNA damage relative to the zzso duplex and, in particular, that a hot spot for DNA damage zzso Specifically, we find that a single zzso in the loop of the hairpin is susceptible to modification by zzso Interestingly, we find that human zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso from the loop of a hairpin zzso albeit with a marked decrease in efficiency relative to duplex zzso the zzso zzso removes zzso from the loop of a hairpin with a rate that is approximately zzso slower than that observed for DNA zzso Thus, while damage is zzso generated in the loop of the zzso DNA repair is less zzso These observed zzso patterns of DNA damage and repair may contribute to the zzso mechanism of zzso repeat zzso
