We report here the first demonstration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA transfer for zzso zzso Gene regions carried by a zzso coli zzso were identified that are sufficient for zzso zzso to zzso coli and zzso fetus zzso A broader functional range is zzso zzso DNA transfer involves the zzso and zzso genes of the type IV bacterial zzso system zzso by a zzso island of zzso fetus zzso zzso zzso of these zzso from expression constructions based on the promoter of the zzso fetus surface zzso protein zzso locus was temperature dependent, and a temperature regulation of the sap promoter was subsequently confirmed under laboratory zzso Gene transfer was sensitive to surface or entry exclusion functions in potential recipient cells carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso to zzso fetus zzso The zzso locus is also known to be involved in bacterial invasion and killing of cultured human cells in zzso Whether specifically zzso zzso proteins contribute to host colonization and infection activities is currently zzso Two putative zzso proteins carrying an zzso domain zzso in a few bacterial type III and type IV zzso proteins of pathogens were analyzed for zzso by the zzso fetus or zzso zzso zzso No evidence for zzso zzso of the zzso proteins was zzso
