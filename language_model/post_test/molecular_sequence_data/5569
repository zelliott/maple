Alternative zzso plays an important role in regulation of bovine zzso type 1 zzso gene zzso We have recently identified in zzso late zzso two zzso zzso zzso enhancers zzso and zzso which also stimulate zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso 3' zzso zzso In zzso studies now demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are required for preferential use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso site in zzso zzso zzso or zzso of either element in a zzso late zzso switches zzso to the zzso alternative 3' zzso site at zzso zzso To investigate the sequence specificity of these zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso or zzso elements were connected to zzso zzso and tested for their zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of U zzso for either A or G zzso in and around potential zzso binding sites in zzso or zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso in both enhancers had the largest effect, reducing zzso to near control zzso Further in zzso analyses showed that zzso enhancement by zzso could be zzso with excess zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso activity in zzso nuclear extracts is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso showed that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso could bind directly to zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments also identified a zzso protein which binds to zzso but not zzso This protein is present in both zzso nuclear extracts and zzso extracts but absent from zzso protein zzso suggesting that it is not a classical zzso zzso zzso zzso elements zzso zzso to zzso which had minimal zzso zzso activity also had very weak binding capacity for these zzso strongly suggesting that the binding of these proteins is required for zzso zzso zzso
