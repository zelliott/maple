The zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso and metabolism in bacteria, have been cloned and zzso The translated zzso acid sequences exhibit strong zzso to the zzso acid sequences of other bacterial zzso zzso After expression of the zzso zzso genes in zzso coli, both zzso zzso were zzso and were found to be zzso by zzso I and the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso The site of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined as zzso zzso zzso was used to replace zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso proteins could no longer be zzso confirming that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the site of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited an about zzso elevated activity compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither zzso from zzso coli nor the zzso domain of zzso zzso had an zzso effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso
