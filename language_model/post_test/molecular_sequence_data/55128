The zzso membrane protein type 2 is a novel identified zzso sorting zzso for zzso zzso zzso in both genes zzso human zzso causing action zzso failure syndrome zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso We now demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso triggers the zzso of zzso and zzso in late zzso zzso Moreover, we identified a single zzso zzso in zzso that is necessary for zzso and zzso zzso This zzso is in close proximity to a proposed zzso domain, which determines the binding to zzso and may function as a critical pH zzso
