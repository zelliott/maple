For the first time, a detailed zzso study of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) in zzso solution is zzso This zzso is a repeating unit of zzso a zzso with widespread biological and pharmaceutical zzso Relatively small changes in temperature, over typical experimental conditions zzso degrees zzso completely change the appearance of its one-dimensional zzso zzso spectrum at 500 zzso To determine the underlying cause for this temperature sensitivity, we analyzed zzso and zzso chemical shifts, temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constants, and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 as a function of zzso For comparison, we measured the temperature dependence of zzso chemical shifts and zzso zzso for related zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The temperature sensitivity of the zzso spectrum of 1 is caused by relatively larger values of delta zzso T for some ring zzso rather than a zzso zzso The effect is zzso by strong zzso To detect the presence of zzso zzso hydrogen bonds in the zzso we measured chemical shifts, delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of 1, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso at low zzso We compared zzso zzso parameters for 1, zzso and zzso in water with published values measured in zzso and concluded that interactions with water zzso We found no evidence for zzso zzso hydrogen bonds occurring in 1 in zzso zzso
