Changes in zzso zzso production have been implicated in the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso are major zzso cells within the zzso However, the mechanism for the effect of diabetes zzso on zzso zzso zzso production is zzso The present study therefore examined whether elevated zzso zzso activate protein zzso C zzso in GMC and whether this zzso zzso mediates an effect of elevated zzso zzso to increase the release of zzso acid and zzso production by zzso The percentage of zzso acid release per 30 zzso by preloaded GMC zzso was significantly increased after zzso exposure to high zzso (20 zzso medium zzso vs control zzso and this increase was sustained after zzso exposure to high zzso zzso zzso and zzso exposure to high zzso medium also increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production by zzso High zzso medium (20 zzso increased zzso activity in GMC at 3 and 24 h zzso vs zzso In contrast, zzso control media containing either zzso or zzso did not increase zzso acid release, zzso production, or zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso (1 zzso prevented zzso increases in zzso acid release and zzso production by zzso These data demonstrate that elevated zzso zzso zzso directly increase the release of zzso zzso acid and zzso by GMC via mechanisms dependent on zzso zzso zzso
