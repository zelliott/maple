A zzso pair segment from the zzso transfer region of zzso zzso DNA was cloned and zzso It contained zzso a gene essential for zzso zzso zzso for expression of the zzso zzso and for sensitivity to zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso to the zzso zzso of potential zzso involved in various types of transport zzso A fusion of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was constructed, and the resulting fusion protein was zzso from zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso of zzso and further zzso rendered zzso protein with more than zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso localized it both in the soluble fraction and in the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso is probably a peripheral outer membrane protein because it could be zzso by increasing salt concentration to zzso M zzso in the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso could zzso zzso zzso activity increased zzso in the presence of zzso mixed zzso To study the importance of the zzso site, Walker box A zzso present in zzso the zzso zzso zzso was replaced by zzso The zzso zzso expressed and zzso under the same conditions as the wild type, did not exhibit zzso zzso zzso was not able to complement the zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso of the zzso activity of the protein in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the dominant character of this zzso suggested that zzso was still able to interact either with itself or with other zzso of the zzso zzso
