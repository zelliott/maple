The zzso zzso factor regulates growth and differentiation of several zzso during embryonic zzso Several hypotheses as to how zzso zzso cellular growth in zzso have been zzso mainly from studies of tissue culture zzso In fetal liver it has been proposed that a short, centrally located, zzso zzso region zzso of zzso is responsible for the zzso function of the protein through its ability to interact with zzso and zzso thereby zzso their zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, carrying a modified zzso zzso lacking zzso acids 180 to zzso were born at the zzso ratio, reached adulthood, and displayed no apparent adverse zzso When fetal zzso from the zzso mice were analyzed for their expression of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso activity, and global gene zzso we failed to detect any cell cycle or zzso differences between the zzso mice and their control zzso These in zzso data demonstrate that any zzso growth repression via the zzso as well as the basic region is zzso for proper embryonic development of, and cell cycle control in, the zzso Surprisingly, control experiments performed in zzso zzso fetal zzso yielded similar zzso
