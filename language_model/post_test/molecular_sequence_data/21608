A novel bacterial strain capable of degrading the zzso zzso zzso was isolated from mixed wastewater and sludge zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso sequence revealed that the zzso belongs to the zzso zzso The zzso can zzso transform zzso at zzso at zzso and pH zzso in zzso zzso products of zzso from strain zzso were examined by gas zzso zzso and the results showed that the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso process to yield zzso alcohol, zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts from this strain showed that the optimal degrading conditions for degrading zzso were zzso and pH zzso and degradation efficiency was zzso and it might be potential using for rapid treating zzso for example, on the surface of fruits and zzso
