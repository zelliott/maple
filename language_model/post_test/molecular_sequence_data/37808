zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a remarkable zzso diversity that is quite unexpected, considering their homogeneous adult zzso In an attempt to zzso the evolutionary patterns of such zzso zzso diversity, zzso sequences of a portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were determined for seven zzso species and three zzso zzso Secondary zzso alignment resulted in a character zzso consisting of zzso zzso of zzso aligned zzso which were subjected to zzso analyses using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso tree zzso from the three methods were zzso with most zzso including that of the zzso zzso being strongly supported by various tree zzso The most zzso reconstruction of the three previously zzso distinct zzso zzso onto the molecular zzso revealed that one of the zzso had originated as the common zzso of the zzso the other two having diversified separately in two subsequent major zzso The patterns of such diversification are discussed in terms of the unusual zzso eye zzso and geographic zzso
