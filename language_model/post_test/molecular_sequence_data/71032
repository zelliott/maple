zzso zzso a zzso of zzso coli zzso plays a crucial role in zzso and/or zzso zzso and in the repair of zzso DNA zzso We have identified unique multiple alternative transcripts of a human zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene zzso One of the transcripts zzso a zzso protein with zzso overall zzso acid identity and zzso zzso similarity with the mouse zzso gene and had two zzso binding consensus zzso motif A and motif B, zzso among members of this zzso Other transcripts zzso truncated proteins with a partial zzso region of the zzso or short proteins lacking internal sequences which contain zzso binding zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that multiple transcripts of the human zzso gene were expressed in various zzso and their distribution was not zzso
