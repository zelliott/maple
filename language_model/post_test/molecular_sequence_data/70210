The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is required along with the zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso We have searched for human protein zzso that are related to the zzso protein zzso using the zzso chain zzso Different pairs of zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso acid motifs in the zzso domain of zzso were used as zzso in the zzso chain reaction to amplify partial complementary zzso zzso of protein zzso expressed in the zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso distinct zzso representing a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso protein zzso were identified, and the sequences for 21 of these protein zzso were found to be zzso Three of these zzso represent a family of protein zzso whose members are related to zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We discuss the success of this zzso chain reaction approach with respect to the use of multiple primer pairs, the influence of primer zzso and the tolerance of zzso amplification to zzso between zzso and template zzso
