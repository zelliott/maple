The present study establishes a method for the separation and characterization of rabbit liver zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso via a zzso zzso Directly zzso enables the extraction of specific molecular weight information and thereby zzso the identification of zzso when no reference materials are available, as in the case of zzso zzso The analysis described here revealed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonging to zzso sample, and zzso zzso and zzso belonging to zzso Several zzso forms were also detected as traces appearing with their respective zzso forms in both zzso Similar results were found when zzso experiments were performed, identifying all the zzso rabbit liver zzso as zzso as in the zzso zzso
