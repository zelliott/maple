The zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso protein plays an important zzso role in smooth and skeletal muscle zzso zzso is associated with increased muscle zzso and can be localized to the zzso thin filament via its binding interaction with zzso We sought to define the structural basis for the interaction of zzso with smooth muscle zzso as a first step to understanding the contribution of zzso to the zzso capacity of smooth zzso zzso we provide a zzso model for the zzso domain of zzso using a combination of zzso exchange mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies provide evidence that a portion of the zzso zzso zzso region forms zzso contacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ultimately, zzso between these structurally dissimilar regions is required for zzso binding to smooth muscle zzso Furthermore, it appears that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is required for zzso binding and presents a novel function for this protein zzso
