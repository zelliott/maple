zzso zzso essential zzso plays a key role in the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso involves the zzso halves of the zzso chains containing two putative zzso motifs (a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso a zzso region, and a zzso zinc finger zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we showed that the minimal zzso domain of zzso is the zzso segment and that both zzso and zzso zzso are necessary to restore the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso cell zzso We confirmed the association of the zzso domain in a zzso and investigated the specific role of zzso and zzso zzso in the building of the zzso Whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso with an association constant close to that of the zzso zzso the isolated zzso and zzso zzso respectively, formed zzso and zzso with weaker association zzso Upon zzso isolated zzso and zzso peptides associated to form a stable zzso as shown by gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose a structural model for the organization of the zzso domain of activated zzso in which three zzso zzso associate into a zzso forming a zzso zzso This model is discussed in relation to the mechanism of zzso of the zzso complex by upstream zzso
