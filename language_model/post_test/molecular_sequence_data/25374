The synthetic zzso signal zzso of zzso c zzso zzso IV was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso at its single zzso zzso zzso of small zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso resulted in a shift of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to shorter zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso was measured by the increase in the zzso zzso zzso A surface partition constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was derived from these zzso When the membrane zzso in addition to zzso zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were further shifted to shorter zzso and exhibited increased quantum zzso The apparent partition zzso were increased to zzso zzso for zzso with 20 or 100 zzso zzso zzso diffusion of the zzso was measured by zzso recovery after zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lateral diffusion zzso of the zzso in zzso of zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso at 21 degrees zzso were zzso greater than those of zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso at 21 degrees zzso but zzso smaller (3 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and at 21 degrees zzso than the zzso diffusion zzso in the zzso charged zzso It is concluded that the signal zzso associates with zzso zzso in two different forms, which depend on the zzso zzso The experiments with zzso zzso are well explained by a model in which the zzso partitions into the region of the zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso If zzso is present in the zzso zzso attractions between the basic zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso result in a deeper penetration of the zzso For this case, two models that are both consistent with the experimental data are discussed, in which the zzso either forms an zzso of three to six partially zzso zzso zzso or zzso into the zzso with its zzso zzso segment aligned parallel to the plane of the membrane and located near the zzso and outer hydrocarbon region of the zzso
