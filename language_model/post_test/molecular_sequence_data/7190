A novel experiment has been used to show proximity relationships between sites on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The artificial zzso iron zzso zzso was zzso to selected zzso zzso placed in zzso I or zzso II, with the aim of identifying zzso acid zzso within approximately 12 A of each site of zzso The zzso was activated with zzso and zzso for a few seconds, and zzso products were isolated and analyzed by zzso zzso Among other results, we found that zzso 39 of zzso II is near zzso 255 of zzso I in the putative zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso Since this technique is insensitive to the nature of the zzso acid side zzso it should prove generally valuable in revealing spatial relationships both within and between zzso in complex proteins where high-resolution structural information is not zzso
