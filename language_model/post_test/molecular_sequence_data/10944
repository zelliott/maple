The zzso gene zzso was identified as a target gene of the zzso zzso zzso by the avian zzso virus zzso zzso zzso by zzso requires signal zzso emanating from the cell surface while the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the DNA binding domain of zzso render it independent of signaling events and zzso abrogate the collaboration between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are involved in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in growth zzso zzso zzso zzso features and independence from zzso zzso reflecting distinct features of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso or factors it interacts with contribute to zzso lineage choice and differentiation in a signal zzso zzso
