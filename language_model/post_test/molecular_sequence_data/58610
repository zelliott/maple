zzso zzso zzso zzso symbol, zzso is a zzso zzso acting as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity causes zzso storage disease type III zzso To determine the molecular basis of zzso and zzso the mechanisms for controlling zzso gene zzso we report the isolation and structural organization of the human zzso zzso zzso The gene is 85 zzso in length and is composed of 35 zzso zzso a zzso zzso The first 2 zzso and 68 zzso of zzso 3 contain zzso untranslated zzso zzso begins in zzso 3, which encodes the first 27 zzso acids of the zzso zzso 4 to 35 zzso the remaining zzso zzso zzso Among the 6 zzso identified, the major zzso zzso 1) starts with zzso 1 and is widely zzso including expression in both liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, and 4) begin with zzso zzso zzso 5 and 6 are minor zzso that begin further within the zzso zzso zzso revealed that promoter region 1 (for zzso 1) was functional in liver zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter region 2 (for zzso zzso was active only in zzso These results suggest that the human zzso gene contains at least 2 promoter regions that zzso differential expression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
