Two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely regarded as the dominant zzso of zzso zzso and its multiple binding activities have been well zzso This large protein is produced and zzso at high levels by zzso zzso and significantly lower levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single zzso accessory zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were characterized by sequencing and functional analyses and are highly similar to those of zzso zzso The most distinctive feature of zzso zzso zzso is additional repeats in the zzso portion of the predicted zzso Interestingly, a point zzso in the zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to other zzso was found to be zzso to promoter activity and to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of zzso of zzso zzso were fully functional for zzso in zzso zzso Thus, the different levels of zzso zzso by these zzso species might reflect differences in zzso composition and structure of cell zzso or differential protein zzso zzso of zzso expression and function may provide clues as to the basis of host species zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso
