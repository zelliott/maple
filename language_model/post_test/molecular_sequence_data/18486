A novel, zzso and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a marine zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso is most closely related to the zzso zzso in the family zzso zzso zzso had a highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso with sequences of other type strains in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of strain zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and lower with those of other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to grow at zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso with optimal growth at zzso pH zzso and with zzso zzso The cells of strain zzso are zzso and did not lyse in distilled zzso The major polar lipids were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unidentified zzso and unidentified zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was determined zzso The zzso zzso experiment showed that there was less than zzso zzso between strain zzso and the reference species in the zzso zzso Based on this zzso zzso analysis, strain zzso is considered to represent a new species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
