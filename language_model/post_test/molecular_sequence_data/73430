Recent studies using zzso animal model systems indicate that clinical progression of zzso disease may be due to the sequential zzso of zzso characterized by extensive plasticity of self zzso In the present study, we addressed the question of whether a similar paradigm of self recognition is implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis zzso a zzso disease with a presumed zzso zzso Our approach was to determine serial changes over a zzso period in response to an zzso series of 265 zzso peptides of zzso zzso protein zzso by patients with isolated zzso zzso syndromes zzso a group of distinct clinical disorders with variable rates of progression to zzso Our data showed that an extensive array of zzso protein peptides could elicit zzso Moreover, differential zzso patterns were evident within zzso patient zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with no evidence of prior zzso disease typically showed fully sustained zzso characterized by extensive zzso zzso zzso shifting, and spreading of responses to new self zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso patients with putative evidence of prior zzso zzso formation typically showed partially sustained zzso characterized by abrupt zzso of responses to an extensive array of self zzso No sustained zzso was observed in normal control subjects or in patients with other zzso zzso Our results indicate that self recognition associated with the development of zzso is a zzso process characterized by zzso diversity, zzso and zzso
