The construction of integrated maps at all levels of resolution will facilitate determination of the DNA sequence and, ultimately, the entire gene content of the human zzso In the past two years, the need for extensive zzso on which to anchor the maps of the human zzso has been zzso The first framework has been provided following construction of the genetic map using zzso zzso This is now being united with extensive collections of expressed sequence tags and other landmarks using radiation hybrid mapping into higher resolution zzso Rapid progress is also being made towards zzso these zzso through the construction of physical clone maps using zzso artificial zzso which provide near-complete cloned coverage of human zzso
