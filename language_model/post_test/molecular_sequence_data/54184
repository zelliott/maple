Monitoring zzso water quality is important for protecting water resources and the health of zzso zzso monitoring relies on zzso zzso indicator bacteria zzso frequently using defined zzso zzso zzso zzso technology is designed to specifically enrich for zzso but a complete understanding of the zzso zzso requires zzso analysis of the zzso This study aimed to identify bacteria in positive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in environmental water samples and to zzso the degree of zzso results for samples from an urban creek by molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso either from urban creek dry weather flow or municipal zzso zzso diverse bacterial populations based on zzso zzso gene sequences and terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso Target zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified in pooled and individual positive zzso and zzso zzso based on terminal restriction fragments that were in common with those generated in zzso from clone zzso zzso rates of between 4 and zzso occurred for the urban creek samples, based on the absence of target terminal restriction fragments in individual positive zzso This study suggests that increased selective zzso of zzso bacteria could improve the accuracy of the zzso and zzso zzso
