The zzso protein is related to basic zzso growth factor zzso by zzso acid sequence zzso To assess its biological activity, we constructed zzso zzso containing four zzso of mouse zzso complementary DNA under the zzso control of the zzso promoter and tested their effects on human zzso adrenal cortical tumor zzso This cell line specifically requires zzso zzso 1, or transforming growth factor e for zzso growth in soft zzso Despite zzso a signal sequence that should direct the protein to the zzso pathway, zzso containing unmodified zzso complementary DNA, or a form zzso for translation initiation at the zzso zzso were incapable of inducing zzso growth in soft zzso However, zzso zzso expressing a construct zzso in which a mouse zzso signal zzso sequence is linked to the zzso coding zzso grew well in soft zzso The concentrated zzso medium from these zzso cells supported zzso growth of zzso indicator cells and zzso with zzso for binding to zzso Western zzso analysis with an zzso zzso detected Mr zzso zzso products in cell extracts and zzso medium from zzso zzso whereas the zzso medium from these and other zzso clones contained only low levels of zzso as measured in a specific zzso These data suggest that the product of the zzso gene can functionally replace zzso in modulating the zzso growth of zzso zzso
