In an attempt to characterize the mechanism of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, zzso were grown in the absence of zzso zzso The crystal structure was determined to a resolution of zzso A by the method of molecular replacement, using the known structure of the zzso active state as a starting model, and has been refined to a zzso zzso of zzso for all zzso Although the zzso solution would be expected to contain the zzso in its inactive zzso with a low affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso the structure in these zzso does not show the change in zzso structure seen in the inactive form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso determined at low zzso nor does it show any substantial change in the zzso zzso site from the structure seen in the zzso zzso Compared to the zzso form, there are considerable changes around the zzso zzso site, including the zzso of the last 19 zzso of the zzso It seems likely that the observed zzso zzso an active zzso form, in which the absence of zzso in the zzso site zzso structural changes that spread through much of the zzso but cause only minor changes in the active zzso It is not clear why the zzso should contain the zzso in a zzso zzso which presumably represents only a small fraction of the molecules in the zzso zzso However, this structure does identify the zzso changes involved in binding of the zzso zzso
