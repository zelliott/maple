A novel zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso strain with gliding zzso designated zzso was isolated from surface seawater of the South Pacific zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso zzso during the Integrated Ocean zzso Program zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso of strain zzso was zzso The dominant fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso zzso G, zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso The polar lipids of strain zzso comprised zzso one unknown zzso and three unknown polar zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the novel strain was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso A number of zzso characteristics distinguished strain zzso from described members of the zzso zzso On the basis of combined zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
