zzso colonization of the lungs by opportunist bacteria such as zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso from zzso zzso has been the subject of much interest because of its very strong affinity for zzso zzso have been identified in the opportunist bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso responsible for zzso in zzso zzso contains three genes that code for proteins with zzso zzso The shortest gene was cloned in zzso coli and pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The presence of native zzso in zzso zzso extracts was checked using a zzso zzso The specificity of zzso zzso was characterized using surface zzso resonance showing a preference for zzso and supported with zzso array experiments demonstrating a strict specificity for zzso zzso zzso The interaction thermodynamics of zzso with zzso zzso demonstrates a zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structure of the complex with zzso zzso was determined at zzso A (1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms zzso with one binding site per zzso acting zzso with the second zzso zzso Each zzso contains two zzso zzso and one sugar zzso Despite strong sequence zzso the differences between zzso and zzso in their zzso binding site and zzso mode indicate that the proteins should have different roles in the zzso
