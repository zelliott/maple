In the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of genetically male larvae zzso zzso zzso sex reversal whereas heat treatment of genetically female larvae zzso zzso zzso synthesis and leads to zzso sex zzso No data are available on zzso receptors in this zzso In the present study, we have isolated a unique full-length zzso zzso and its zzso region whose promoter activity was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso studies performed in adult animals using zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was present mainly in zzso zzso zzso fat body and zzso zzso transcript was also detected in liver, suggesting its implication in zzso control as in numerous zzso zzso The level of zzso transcripts was also studied during zzso differentiation by quantitative real-time zzso At stage zzso zzso expression in zzso of zzso larvae was significantly higher than in zzso zzso This zzso discrimination was confirmed when zzso complexes zzso taken at the same stage, were subjected to whole mount in zzso zzso In comparison, the zzso expression of zzso zzso which was studied as a control of zzso zzso was observed earlier zzso zzso In zzso larvae reared at 32 degrees C, a condition leading to sex zzso zzso zzso level at stage zzso was lower than in control zzso Taken together, these results showing a zzso and zzso expression of zzso suggest an important role for this zzso in zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
