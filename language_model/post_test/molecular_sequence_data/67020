zzso zzso is the main cause of a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and zzso In particular, in zzso diseases the normal cellular form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is converted into the infectious zzso through a zzso process during which it acquires a high zzso zzso zzso is a protein that shares a similar native fold, but lacks the zzso zzso zzso the molecular zzso of these different zzso is important both for biomedical and zzso zzso 

In this paper, the zzso and energetic properties of the two proteins in solution is comparatively analyzed by means of long time scale explicit zzso zzso molecular dynamics in different temperature zzso The zzso are analyzed by means of a recently introduced energy decomposition approach zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2004) aimed at identifying the key zzso for the stabilization and folding of the zzso Our analysis shows that zzso and zzso have two different zzso stabilizing the native state and that the relative contribution of the nucleus to the global stability of the protein for zzso is sensitively higher than for zzso Moreover, under zzso conditions the zzso core is zzso while the energy stabilization network of zzso is zzso 

These observations suggest that different sequences can share similar native zzso with different stabilizing interactions and that the sequences of the zzso and zzso proteins may have zzso under different evolutionary constraints resulting in different folding and stabilization zzso
