zzso zzso channels zzso are zzso zzso channels expressed in the peripheral and central nervous zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso is defined by zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso zzso The gate, formed by the intersection of the zzso zzso zzso near the zzso boundary of the plasma zzso We explored the contribution to zzso zzso and selectivity of zzso in the zzso segment of zzso Studies of accessibility with positively charged zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso in the open state zzso below the gate, restricting the passage to large zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso or zzso significantly increased the zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso shows a selectivity sequence for zzso metals of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at position zzso increased, to different zzso the relative zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso For these zzso zzso zzso was not a function of the diameter of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso encompasses an zzso coordination site that is essential for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed slightly increased zzso to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso at these positions influence zzso discrimination by altering molecular zzso Our results indicate that zzso selectivity is accomplished by the contribution of multiple sites in the pore of zzso
