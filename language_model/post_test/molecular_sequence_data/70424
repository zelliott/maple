An extensive study of the requirements for effective binding of zzso peptides to human zzso zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso A has been zzso These efforts afforded zzso generally in the zzso zzso range for these zzso zzso The most significant increase in potency was obtained with the introduction of a zzso group at the zzso position, suggesting a small zzso channel into the zzso zzso of zzso One particular compound, zzso zzso zzso is relatively selective for rabbit zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and may prove useful for zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso models of tissue zzso
