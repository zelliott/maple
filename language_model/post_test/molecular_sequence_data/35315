zzso acid zzso an important zzso chemical for a zzso industry, is zzso produced by zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso occurs via the intermediate zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso initiated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso for characterization of its activity and zzso zzso studies with zzso as zzso showed a maximum specific activity of zzso zzso which is zzso higher than that reported zzso zzso activity of 18 zzso was obtained at zzso concentration of 7 zzso above which zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was also seen with zzso A at a concentration above zzso and with zzso above 9 zzso A structure of zzso is proposed based on zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A and zzso respectively, showed a common binding site consisting of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso which through zzso zzso to zzso and kinetic studies, were confirmed as essential for the zzso activity of zzso
