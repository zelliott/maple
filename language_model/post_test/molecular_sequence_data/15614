Patients suffering from zzso zzso are more likely to develop a zzso condition with poor zzso The aim of the study is to investigate clinical and molecular features of zzso zzso syndromes in zzso in order to offer and provide zzso genetic testing for the affected families, as well as to evaluate the frequency of familial zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Six zzso patients along with three of their relatives were included in this zzso Two patients were selected from the zzso cancer database (from a total of zzso and four patients not affected with zzso cancer zzso were referred from the zzso facility of our zzso All the patients were examined during the period from January 1st, 2000 until June 30th, zzso Clinical data, zzso examinations and family cancer histories of the respective patients were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was performed in five patients and their zzso In addition, all patients underwent genetic zzso 

Two patients out of 2,552 from the zzso zzso Cancer Institute database fulfilled the clinical criteria for zzso Thus, the frequency of zzso is zzso zzso of all zzso cases, and comprises approximately zzso of the population of zzso zzso million zzso Unknown zzso was identified in two zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were detected in five out of seven examined patients and their zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso 

In this study, we report the first four zzso zzso zzso cases in zzso The present frequency of zzso is lower than that reported in Finland, Lithuania, and other zzso countries, but the numbers might increase if a more systematic identification approach is zzso zzso molecular examinations reveal partially unique spectrum of zzso gene zzso
