The nuclear zzso zzso and zzso are induced in response to a diverse array of zzso zzso Their protein products, zzso and zzso form a zzso complex that interacts with the DNA regulatory element known as the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso occurs via a parallel interaction of zzso zzso zzso and is required for DNA zzso In addition to the zzso zzso DNA binding requires two clusters of basic zzso acids adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso regions are highly zzso among the zzso and zzso families of related zzso zzso Thus, multiple protein complexes can be formed that may interact with zzso binding sites in numerous genes to affect gene expression in response to environmental zzso
