The zzso zzso are the key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso of zzso zzso was identified and zzso Two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by analysis of zzso zzso acid regions, and the former displayed the highest identity zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene knockout and zzso motif deletion resulted in the arrest of lycopene synthesis and the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso knockout zzso became more sensitive to acute zzso radiation and oxygen zzso zzso of the zzso with a zzso or zzso gene restored its zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was further confirmed by the zzso of zzso activity in zzso and zzso expression in zzso coli containing zzso and zzso genes (responsible for zzso zzso from zzso zzso In addition, the amount of lycopene synthesis in zzso coli resulting from the expression of zzso from zzso zzso was determined, and this had significant zzso effects on the survival rate of zzso coli exposed to hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso
