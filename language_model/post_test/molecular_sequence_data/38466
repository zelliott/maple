We have previously reported that zzso zzso proliferation of normal bone zzso zzso and of the zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso was shown to be necessary and sufficient to mediate zzso of zzso To investigate further the mechanism of growth arrest, we examined the effect of zzso on expression of cell cycle zzso We found that zzso treatment increases expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cannot induce zzso expression or block proliferation when zzso signaling is blocked by a dominant negative zzso or a zzso zzso which does not recruit zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso induction is not zzso An zzso active zzso zzso zzso B), which suppresses zzso cell zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter revealed two candidate zzso binding sites, and zzso treatment activated a reporter gene controlled by this zzso These data suggest that zzso induction of zzso mediates zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells significantly reduced their zzso Use of zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso confirmed that zzso is required for optimal zzso of proliferation by zzso and indicated that additional zzso signaling events contribute to this zzso These data indicate that zzso induction of zzso and zzso induction of zzso are important components of the mechanism by which zzso blocks proliferation in zzso
