Pig plasma zzso (Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso identical zzso out of a maximum 730 when compared to the zzso form of human zzso The zzso sequence also codes for a zzso of 33 zzso zzso to the zzso plasma extension sequence previously reported: these 33 zzso are highly zzso to the human signal zzso and plasma zzso zzso of the zzso sequences with chicken brush border zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso shows a strong evolutionary relationship between all these zzso There are six large repeating segments in zzso and zzso and three similar segments in zzso and zzso Although these multiple repeats cannot be related to any known function of these zzso zzso this zzso of proteins appears to have evolved from an ancestral sequence of 120 to 130 zzso acid zzso
