The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for an zzso acid sequence sharing zzso identity with the zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso and its product was functionally zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene from a zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity in crude extracts by two orders of zzso Upon disruption of the zzso zzso zzso activity was decreased by more than zzso and the sensitivity to zzso of the growth of zzso zzso was zzso The toxicity of zzso was also enhanced under conditions of nitrogen zzso which stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso In relation with these behaviors, the capacity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso could be zzso Finally, the zzso distribution of genes zzso to zzso was examined in connection with zzso zzso or zzso In the zzso zzso genes are systematically zzso In the zzso the putative occurrence of a zzso is zzso It possibly depends on the zzso anabolic zzso adopted by the zzso
