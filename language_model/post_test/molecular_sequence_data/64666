The zzso zzso family comprises two active zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the ubiquitous zzso Both share similar kinetic zzso zzso alignments predict the two proteins are structurally zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain zzso forms a zzso bound zzso zzso intermediate through zzso which lies on the zzso side of the zzso zzso We showed that zzso is also a zzso domain protein that forms a zzso bound zzso zzso intermediate during zzso zzso However, the intermediate was not zzso in zzso active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso in zzso is zzso and that it lies inside the zzso zzso with the active site zzso zzso and zzso Therefore zzso and zzso share a similar active site structure, zzso and mechanism of zzso
