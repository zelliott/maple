zzso zzso causes a wide range of human disease ranging from localized skin and soft tissue infections to potentially lethal systemic zzso zzso zzso has the zzso ability to generate numerous zzso factors that assist in zzso the innate immune system during disease zzso Recent studies have uncovered a set of zzso peptides produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute to skin infection and recruit and lyse zzso and truncated versions of these peptides possess zzso zzso In this study, novel zzso zzso derivatives were discovered by the use of microbial imaging mass zzso The novel zzso derivatives are compared with their parent full-length peptides for changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso A potential contribution of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in processing zzso is zzso Finally, we show that zzso processing occurs in multiple zzso strains by structural confirmation of additional novel zzso This work demonstrates that IMS can serve as a useful tool to go beyond zzso predictions and expand our understanding of the important family of small zzso zzso zzso
