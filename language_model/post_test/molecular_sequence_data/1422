The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso The zzso locus was mapped to a zzso artificial zzso zzso on zzso 1 from genetic analysis of a cross between the enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso candidate gene in this zzso was zzso amplified from zzso and transformed into zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic lines zzso resistance to zzso and at least four zzso zzso zzso virulent zzso of zzso zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso was isolated, and analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the gene encodes a zzso protein zzso with a distinct domain structure, composed of a signal zzso followed by zzso zzso repeats, a membrane spanning region, and a short zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso gene to be implicated in disease resistance in zzso enabling the deployment of zzso techniques to investigate the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso searches of the zzso zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso protein sequences as a starting point, identify 59 zzso including the already known zzso and zzso MANY zzso zzso A combination of sequence and zzso analysis of these predicted zzso reveals zzso structural features of the zzso
