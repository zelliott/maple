A novel, zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the sludge of a zzso zzso zzso treating municipal solid waste and sewage in Beijing, zzso The strain was a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Growth of the novel strain was observed at zzso degrees C zzso 60 degrees zzso and pH zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso grew on a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a variety of zzso compounds, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beef zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso products from zzso included zzso ethanol, zzso hydrogen and carbon zzso zzso was produced from zzso in addition to other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reduced with zzso as the electron zzso zzso was zzso zzso was not zzso zzso was not zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso was related to the members of cluster zzso of the zzso most closely to zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso On the basis of zzso evidence from this study, it is suggested that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
