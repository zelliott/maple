zzso zzso sequencing depends on high-quality zzso DNA, which is zzso prepared by zzso zzso While those procedures are effective for zzso number zzso purity and yields of zzso number plasmids are often not sufficient to achieve reasonable sequencing zzso Here, we describe a zzso and cheap procedure for the small-scale preparation of zzso DNA, which is based on the original Holmes and zzso zzso zzso a boiling and two selective zzso zzso Besides various other zzso this procedure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a key step to further purify zzso DNA tailored to automated zzso zzso Independent of the zzso size and copy number, the modified procedure yields zzso DNA, which gives average reading lengths of 800 and more bases with a standard zzso cycle sequencing zzso To demonstrate the efficiency and zzso of the method, sequencing data of various human zzso gene zzso cloned in different zzso are zzso This procedure offers an economical alternative to commercial zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso or zzso zzso and, moreover, is more reliable and consistent with respect to reading lengths and accuracy in automated zzso zzso
