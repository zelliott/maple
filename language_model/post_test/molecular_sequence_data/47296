In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The full length zzso for mouse zzso has been cloned by zzso chain zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a 354 zzso acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 40 zzso The predicted protein for zzso shares zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso is also zzso to three predicted zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the third zzso of the zzso virus zzso is found to zzso a zzso zzso showing zzso zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that expression of the zzso zzso is highly restricted to the zzso zzso mainly exists as a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso DNA to produce zzso zzso It is active under a wide range of pH with maximum activity at pH zzso Among known zzso zzso tested, zzso acid and zzso found to be effective zzso of the zzso zzso
