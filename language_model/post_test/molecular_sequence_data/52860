The small G zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the human zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and its protein product zzso It is unique in the zzso zzso and expressed only in the zzso zzso insect form, but not in the zzso zzso zzso form, as shown by northern blots and western blots developed with a specific zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed distinct zzso spots regularly distributed on the plasma zzso including the part lining the zzso and the zzso zzso By zzso experiments, it was found that zzso zzso zzso reached higher zzso in culture, but released significantly less zzso acid zzso in the zzso medium than the parental zzso When zzso blocked under the zzso zzso form or with an zzso potential zzso site was zzso the cells displayed an apparent zzso zzso but died earlier in the stationary zzso in contrast to parental cells, they showed a diffuse pattern of zzso zzso in the zzso and on the cell zzso zzso when a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso under the zzso zzso was zzso the zzso were immobile with a very short zzso a slow growth rate and a low level of acid zzso zzso the length of the zzso was zzso zzso to zzso protein zzso We concluded that zzso could be an essential gene involved in zzso zzso it may provide new approaches for control of the zzso at the insect zzso
