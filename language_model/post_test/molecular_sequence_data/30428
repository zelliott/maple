zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a rabbit kidney zzso zzso These three zzso exhibit greater than zzso zzso sequence identity across the coding zzso This degree of sequence identity is also seen with zzso an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso and that is elevated during pregnancy and induced by zzso in rabbit zzso The 3' untranslated regions of the three zzso display very little sequence identity, suggesting that they are the products of distinct zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences derived from each zzso and for zzso exhibit about zzso zzso Each zzso was inserted into an expression zzso for transient zzso of zzso zzso The zzso cells each expressed a protein recognized by zzso to zzso zzso isolated from the cells zzso with each zzso efficiently zzso the zzso of zzso acid with rates that greatly exceed that zzso by zzso isolated from the host cell zzso One of the zzso encodes an zzso that zzso zzso zzso however, the specific activity was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso selectivity of the kidney zzso zzso by these zzso is distinct from that of the lung zzso and that multiple zzso comprise zzso class zzso in the zzso
