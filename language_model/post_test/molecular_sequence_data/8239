Human zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All three zzso zzso were zzso to zzso either as single zzso or in zzso and one zzso was also zzso to zzso The zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso as fusion proteins with zzso protein and a zzso region containing a recognition site for the zzso zzso factor zzso After zzso by factor zzso all zzso were zzso to zzso and the kinetic and zzso properties of the proteins were zzso All the proteins had high zzso activities, but the affinity for zzso was increased for the zzso and zzso zzso and decreased for the zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso the contributions of the individual zzso zzso to the total intrinsic zzso of the protein were zzso On the basis of zzso of zzso containing only one zzso it was calculated that zzso zzso and zzso account for approximately 61, 13, and zzso of the total zzso zzso of zzso respectively, while the positions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the individual zzso were rather zzso After incubation with zzso the quantum yield of zzso zzso increases by zzso and the zzso maximum is shifted from zzso to 347 zzso This effect is mainly due to changes in the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso studies, this zzso acid is the most zzso of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
