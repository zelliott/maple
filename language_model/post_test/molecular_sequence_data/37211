zzso zzso networks zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso applied to model surfaces prevent protein zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso surfaces zzso with the zzso zzso domain from rat bone zzso zzso modulated bone cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso The objective of this study was to zzso the same zzso modification strategy to produce functionally similar zzso zzso on clinically relevant titanium zzso zzso angle zzso and X-ray zzso zzso zzso data were consistent with the presence of the intended surface zzso Cellular response was zzso by challenging the surfaces with primary rat zzso zzso zzso surfaces in zzso zzso zzso modified titanium and negative control zzso surfaces inhibit cell zzso and zzso while zzso zzso on titanium supported zzso attachment and zzso Furthermore, the latter surfaces supported significant zzso despite exhibiting lower levels of proliferation than positive control zzso These results suggest that with the appropriate zzso this approach may be practical for surface engineering of zzso zzso
