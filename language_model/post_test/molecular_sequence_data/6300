zzso zzso zzso was used to make simultaneous changes of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for other zzso Among 21 different zzso and zzso zzso obtained from this round of zzso proteins with zzso and zzso changes at one or both positions were found to be nearly as active as the wild type zzso Genes zzso zzso with each of the eight possible combinations of zzso and zzso changes of zzso and zzso to zzso and Met were constructed by zzso in zzso Whereas three of these eight zzso zzso are unstable in zzso coli, all are made at similar zzso levels in zzso zzso Three of the eight zzso zzso are lethal when zzso in zzso zzso because they zzso an induced zzso Two different activity zzso in zzso show that one of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso in its interactions with both zzso and zzso These results show that more general approaches to engineering active proteins with fewer zzso zzso may give rise to functional zzso without aromatic zzso and that zzso changes should be considered in cases where engineered changes of zzso to zzso or zzso do not zzso
