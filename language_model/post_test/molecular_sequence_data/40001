This study determines the genetic background of the change in zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso values, isolated either from the field or from zzso treated with zzso under experimental challenge zzso In the field strains of zzso that were either less susceptible or, occasionally, resistant to zzso point zzso had occurred in zzso acids at positions 83 zzso or 87 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso showing reduced zzso following experimental zzso treatment zzso in zzso from zzso or zzso to zzso zzso molecular analysis revealed a constantly recurring point zzso zzso at zzso acid position zzso zzso coli zzso of zzso resulting in an zzso acid change from zzso acid to zzso at position 87 of the zzso zzso which is a known hot spot for zzso zzso This study indicates that a single course of zzso treatment may contribute to the selection of the first zzso with reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso resistance is commonly encountered in zzso zzso This is the first time that the zzso mechanism of zzso resistance in zzso has been zzso
