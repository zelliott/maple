Two novel mouse genes and one novel human gene that define distinctive zzso zzso proteins zzso and are related to the zzso gene of zzso are zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso a short form zzso and a long form zzso of zzso clearly establish them as a new zzso gene family that is well zzso throughout zzso In addition to zzso zzso motifs A zzso and zzso members of this family share at least two highly zzso sequence zzso zzso motifs alpha and zzso Only one type of zzso gene has been observed thus far in zzso but there are two types in zzso One group includes mouse zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is characterized by a unique zzso sequence with four zzso zzso that is lacking in the other group, which includes mouse zzso human zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses of the two mouse genes show distinctive patterns consistent with this zzso Mouse zzso is mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso 17, whereas zzso is mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso Interestingly, both regions are zzso with human zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso breakage between zzso and zzso probably occurred during the evolution of mouse zzso
