We have isolated zzso clones for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by screening a zzso zzso zzso library with a zzso partial zzso zzso The zzso zzso probe was obtained by the zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso deduced from zzso zzso acids in the zzso chicken, zzso and fish zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and is expressed in the early stages of zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso acids contains two zzso motifs and an zzso zzso which are zzso among different zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso repeat in an zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of various species showed the repeated zzso zzso acids on the same face of the zzso that make the zzso zzso in the zzso and chicken zzso The presence of a zzso motif in the zzso domain suggests that this motif might be responsible for zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso may have novel functions, possibly involving its zzso and/or zzso with other nuclear zzso proteins and its regulation by zzso
