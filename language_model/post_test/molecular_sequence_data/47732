Various classes of zzso zzso with different zzso roles contain a zzso core zzso Less is known, however, about the distinguishing features of these zzso particularly those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso 9 A resolution crystal structure of zzso C virus zzso zzso protein zzso zzso presented here provides the first complete and detailed view of an zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso features exist in the structure, zzso adopts a unique shape due to extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb zzso zzso that serve to zzso the zzso active zzso Several insertions in the fingers zzso account for zzso linkages that include two extended zzso and a pair of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso structure reported here can accommodate a zzso duplex without global zzso changes, supporting the hypothesis that this structure is essentially preserved during the reaction zzso This zzso zzso model also allows identification of a new structural motif involved in stabilizing the nascent base zzso
