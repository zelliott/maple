A novel zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified using expressed sequence tag zzso database zzso The novel zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso and includes a previously unidentified zzso mapped zzso zzso downstream of zzso III, and encodes an zzso stop zzso generating a predicted truncated protein of approximately zzso zzso the smallest reported member of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is predicted to have only two zzso zzso however, the new zzso sequence includes two new potential protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected in many mouse zzso and several human cell lines including the zzso cell line zzso and the B cell line Ramos, indicating that the zzso zzso is zzso in mouse and zzso zzso is found zzso together with zzso in all of the zzso and cells under investigation, both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso into the zzso zzso lineage by zzso zzso zzso led to a marked increase in zzso and zzso expression in the zzso rather than zzso stages of zzso Furthermore, in the zzso line Ramos, differentiated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was altered to increase zzso zzso generation over zzso Here we have identified zzso the first reported normally occurring zzso zzso of zzso The sequence identity between mouse and human zzso strongly implies conservation in function and possibly a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
