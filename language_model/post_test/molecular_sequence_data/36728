zzso zzso is an often fatal zzso error of organic acid metabolism due to zzso of zzso zzso The cloning of genes zzso this zzso and the advent of technologies for gene transfer have introduced the possibility of zzso gene therapy for this zzso Gene therapy may require replacement of the defective zzso in zzso which have a greater capacity for zzso metabolism than other zzso cells and represent the principle zzso site of zzso zzso We describe construction of an zzso zzso zzso containing the human zzso zzso zzso This zzso is shown to zzso primary zzso zzso and restore levels of zzso metabolism by cultures of zzso cells to zzso This zzso will zzso primary human zzso and direct zzso of zzso human zzso from the integrated zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of zzso gene transfer of zzso zzso into primary human cells, including zzso which represent a difficult, but potentially necessary, target for gene therapy of zzso zzso
