It is not merely the position of zzso that is critically important for a zzso function and stability, but also their zzso We zzso by using a network construction on a set of zzso zzso zzso that regular packing is preserved in short-range zzso but short average path lengths are achieved through some long-range zzso Thus, lying between the two extremes of zzso and zzso zzso in folded proteins are distributed according to a zzso zzso Using this zzso we show that the core zzso have the same local packing arrangements irrespective of protein zzso Furthermore, we find that the average shortest path lengths are highly correlated with zzso zzso providing a link between the spatial arrangement of the zzso and protein zzso
