Human zzso virus type 2 zzso strains vary widely in their ability to grow in Old World monkey zzso zzso We previously evaluated several zzso zzso for their sensitivity to zzso monkey zzso zzso an zzso factor in zzso cells, and found that viruses carrying zzso at the 120th position of the zzso protein were sensitive to CM zzso whereas those with either zzso or zzso were zzso In the study presented here, we tested these zzso zzso for their sensitivity to zzso monkey zzso zzso and found that both CM zzso and zzso viruses were restricted by zzso zzso The variable region 1 of the zzso domain of zzso zzso appeared to be the zzso of this zzso Furthermore, a zzso study showed that three zzso acid zzso zzso at the zzso to zzso positions of zzso zzso are important for restricting zzso strains resistant to CM zzso
