Base pairing between the zzso components of box zzso small zzso zzso zzso and sequences in other zzso zzso target specific zzso for zzso An zzso called zzso has been developed that interacts with the zzso sequence targeted by the zzso zzso pocket of human zzso zzso the same way as intact zzso zzso zzso on both strands of the analog of the zzso zzso zzso pocket in zzso pair with its zzso zzso and the resulting complex, called zzso is strongly stabilized by zzso The solution structure of zzso reveals an zzso zzso interaction motif that has not previously been zzso which is likely to be common to all box zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the complex explains why the access of zzso sequences to zzso is facile and how zzso selection may occur when these complexes zzso
