A zzso gene composed of the mouse zzso promoter linked to the zzso end of the zzso pair rabbit zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso into baby zzso kidney zzso zzso Like the native zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by these cells was the product of a zzso pair transcript which was translated into a zzso protein of 57 zzso with a small amount of protein that zzso with the zzso form of the native protein at 61 zzso The zzso cells expressed levels of zzso zzso equal to or exceeding those of rabbit zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso may comprise zzso of the zzso zzso Although minimal zzso zzso zzso was seen when the zzso was activated with zzso or an zzso compound, the expression of full zzso activity of the zzso protein depended on the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a specific activity of zzso zzso of zzso (1 unit zzso 1 zzso of zzso at 37 degrees zzso when fully zzso which was accomplished by the specific zzso of the zzso bond of zzso by zzso We conclude that 1) these zzso zzso zzso cells represent a high yield source of zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso of zzso depends on the presence of zzso and 3) zzso zzso from this high yield source may be useful in future studies to zzso the detailed zzso involved in the zzso of this zzso
