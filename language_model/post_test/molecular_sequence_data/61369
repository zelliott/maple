zzso zzso zzso resistance in certain strains of zzso zzso is associated with reduction in the zzso activity of a particular zzso zzso This has been attributed to a zzso zzso zzso which zzso a structural zzso to an zzso resulting in the loss of its zzso activity but acquisition of zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that the zzso in Lucilia zzso is a zzso substitution in the active site of an zzso zzso by the zzso alpha zzso gene zzso zzso Campbell, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Russell, zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso acid substitution converts a zzso to an zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 94, zzso We now report the cloning and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Md alpha zzso zzso including the sequencing of zzso from the zzso resistant Rutgers and zzso susceptible zzso and WHO zzso The Md alpha zzso gene has the same zzso structure as zzso alpha zzso and encodes a protein with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso alpha zzso Comparisons between susceptible and resistance zzso show resistance in zzso zzso is associated with the same zzso zzso as in zzso zzso zzso expression of the Rutgers zzso shows its product has zzso zzso zzso The data indicate identical zzso mechanisms have evolved in zzso Md alpha zzso and zzso alpha zzso molecules to zzso zzso resistance on the two species of higher zzso
