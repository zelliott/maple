zzso have receptors for both human and avian influenza viruses and are a natural host for influenza A zzso The 2009 influenza zzso pandemic zzso virus that was derived from zzso human and zzso influenza viruses has infected pigs in various zzso 

To investigate the relationship between the zzso viruses isolated from zzso outbreaks in Australia and human samples associated with one of the outbreaks by zzso analysis, and to determine whether there was any zzso event occurring during the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and full zzso sequencing were carried out on zzso isolated from zzso zzso and/or virus zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso 

The influenza zzso outbreaks were detected in three pig farms located in three different states in zzso Further analysis of the zzso outbreak led to the identification of two distinct virus strains in the zzso Two staff working in the same zzso were also infected with the same two strains found in the zzso Full zzso sequence analysis on the viruses isolated from pigs and humans did not identify any zzso of these zzso viruses with seasonal or avian influenza A zzso 

This is the first report of zzso infected with influenza in Australia and marked the end of the zzso era for the Australian zzso zzso Although no zzso was detected in these cases, the ability of these viruses to cross between pigs and humans highlights the importance of monitoring zzso for novel influenza zzso
