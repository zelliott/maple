The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a mating response to the zzso sex zzso zzso zzso by zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso properties, were zzso with zzso zzso to obtain zzso that were induced (in the absence of zzso to transfer zzso DNA upon shifting from 32 to 42 degrees zzso Of 31 such zzso generated, the results of analyses of 7 are presented in zzso All seven strains were zzso in the zzso zzso host zzso colony zzso zzso and DNA transfer correlated well with each other at the two zzso In the zzso host zzso zzso zzso however, only one zzso zzso exhibited correlation of all three traits at both zzso Three zzso zzso and zzso zzso and had colonies characteristic of zzso cells at 32 degrees C but transferred zzso DNA at a higher frequency only at the elevated zzso The other three zzso zzso and zzso were zzso at both temperatures for all three zzso Four of the zzso including that of zzso mapped within the zzso zzso whereas two mapped zzso in a previously zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso a short zzso zzso downstream of the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and in the opposite zzso One zzso could not be located in the regions zzso Studies showed that the zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso in trans with a DNA zzso carrying the corresponding zzso
