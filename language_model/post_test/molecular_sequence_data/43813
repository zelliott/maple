A zzso of mouse zzso DNA containing a zzso corresponding to the processed transcript of the zzso locus was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso on comparison with the zzso locus and the corresponding zzso indicated the presence of several small deletions and point zzso In addition, the zzso showed a deletion for the second zzso of the zzso gene indicating the occurrence of an zzso zzso event during its zzso We also describe the zzso mapping of the zzso to zzso 1 by zzso in zzso zzso and distinguish it from the zzso of the actual zzso zzso zzso locus on mouse zzso zzso
