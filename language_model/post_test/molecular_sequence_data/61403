The zzso from zzso zzso contains a zzso named zzso zzso which displayed high affinity zzso in zzso zzso to zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments and the free acid form of zzso did not bind to zzso The truncated zzso fragments displayed very low affinity to zzso receptors and partially inhibited zzso binding to zzso zzso Several insect zzso the sequences of which related to the zzso fragments of zzso were observed to bind with similar affinity or even 20 times higher zzso and zzso affinity than zzso In contrast, no significant binding of these insect peptides was observed for zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be viewed as an zzso that binds with very high affinity to a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso zzso that share a similar zzso zzso acid zzso
