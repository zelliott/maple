Unlike the steroid hormone receptors that bind their response elements as zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso as well as zzso acid receptors and several other receptors have been shown to require zzso with zzso X receptors zzso for efficient binding to most response zzso In this article we have compared in detail zzso DNA binding and its zzso characteristics in the presence and absence of zzso We observe that in the absence of zzso zzso are able to bind with high affinity as zzso to a subset of zzso hormone response elements consisting of two zzso motifs arranged as zzso zzso This binding is inhibited by zzso which prevents zzso zzso from functioning as zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso can act as potent zzso zzso in particular when binding to sites 3' of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso appear to have important regulatory functions in the absence of zzso This is strongly supported by our observations that some naturally occurring zzso beta zzso that have been associated with generalized zzso hormone resistance as well as the zzso zzso are defective in this zzso Thus zzso repression by zzso is an important regulatory zzso
