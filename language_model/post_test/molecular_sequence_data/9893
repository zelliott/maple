The heavy and light chain genes zzso and zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso imaging of the cancer tissue zzso into nude mice showed that the zzso zzso retained the original zzso binding zzso We then replaced the zzso constant region of the zzso heavy chain gene with the human zzso constant region gene and zzso it with the light chain zzso This zzso was confirmed by a complete DNA sequencing and zzso zzso Despite the fact that the DNA zzso the expressed protein size, and the assembly of heavy and light chains were indicated to be normal, the zzso type zzso could not bind to the original zzso This result suggest that this zzso alters its zzso binding property upon zzso
