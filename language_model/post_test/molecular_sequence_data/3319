A zzso zzso found in Tompkins County, New York, zzso was identified as a strain of zzso wheat mosaic virus zzso by means of sequence analyses of portions of its zzso 1 and zzso The zzso sequences of several of its genes differed by zzso 9 to zzso from those of the corresponding zzso regions of the Nebraska type strain of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the putative translation products, however, suggested much closer zzso Thus, the zzso acid sequences of the coat proteins of the two virus strains were zzso identical despite the fact that their coding regions differed in as many as 68 zzso zzso The New York zzso strain of zzso is possibly closely related to an isolate from Illinois for which so far only the zzso sequences of its coat protein gene and the zzso untranslated region of its zzso 2 are zzso
