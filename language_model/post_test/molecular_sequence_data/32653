zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes promoters that comprise zzso sequences and a zzso zzso pair zzso stem DNA hairpin structure on zzso zzso Here, we defined the DNA structural and sequence requirements for zzso promoter zzso zzso binds a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso with high affinity zzso zzso 2 zzso to form a zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts specifically with the central base of the hairpin loop zzso and a base at the stem zzso and that the zzso zzso and zzso groups at both positions are essential for binding and complex salt zzso The major zzso zzso which must be presented to zzso in the context of a hairpin loop, appears to interact with zzso zzso This interaction requires template zzso at positions zzso and zzso Contacts with the promoter are disrupted when the zzso product becomes zzso zzso zzso This detailed description of zzso interaction with its promoter hairpin provides insights into zzso interactions and explains how the injected zzso which is present in one or two copies, recognizes its promoters on a single copy of the injected zzso
