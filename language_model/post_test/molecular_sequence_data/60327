The zzso zzso is an essential component of zzso but it also plays a dynamic role in invasive zzso zzso The zzso tail of the zzso zzso is uniquely large among zzso and includes two pairs of zzso type III zzso separated by a connecting zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of the first tandem domain pair, a module that is critical for zzso zzso The structure reveals a novel zzso interface and candidate zzso sites, including a large zzso zzso formed from the surfaces of both zzso and a prominent loop that is reminiscent of the zzso zzso loop of zzso This is the first crystal structure of either a zzso component or an zzso zzso domain, and it will enable the zzso functions of zzso to be dissected at the atomic zzso
