Three distinct zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a protein with 377 zzso acid zzso It is similar in sequence to members of a zzso group of zzso zzso zzso most closely resembling the zzso of ants, a praying zzso a locust and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso have 377 and zzso zzso zzso They belong to a related group of insect visual zzso that include the zzso zzso of flies as well as other insect zzso that are also thought to absorb at short zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso peaks, respectively, at green, blue and ultraviolet zzso There is evidence that zzso encodes the zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso encodes zzso and that zzso representing a class of zzso insect zzso encodes zzso
