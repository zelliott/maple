The zzso zzso genes from 2 species of the zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso The genes were zzso zzso and zzso The results revealed a zzso zzso tandem array with a zzso sequence in an zzso position within the zzso zzso region that corresponded to the U2 small nuclear zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis indicated that both genes could be functionally zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of both genes and the possible involvement of concerted evolution are zzso
