The sliding clamp zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso plays vital roles in many aspects of DNA replication and repair in zzso cells and in zzso zzso the full potential of zzso as a model for zzso function requires a combination of zzso and genetic zzso In order to provide a platform for subsequent reverse genetic analysis, zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was subjected to zzso zzso The gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and the protein was zzso by affinity zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined at zzso A resolution to a final R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was found to be zzso and to resemble other zzso zzso zzso but with several differences that appear to be associated with adaptation of the protein to the high zzso salt zzso found in zzso zzso zzso
