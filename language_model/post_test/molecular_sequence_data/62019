Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso incorporating two zzso motifs and various zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso The binding of these three peptides to a zzso zzso DNA duplex zzso zzso and to a zzso zzso DNA duplex zzso zzso zzso was investigated by quantitative zzso I zzso On the zzso Watson zzso the most distinctive zzso I zzso seen with all three peptides occur around positions zzso and zzso corresponding to the sequences zzso and zzso zzso However, on the complementary zzso zzso only zzso strongly discriminates the zzso site around positions zzso whereas both zzso and zzso have moderate binding around positions zzso zzso the sequence zzso zzso zzso and single interactions of the zzso functions and zzso zzso of the peptides with DNA bases are zzso
