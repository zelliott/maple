A plasma pool from 12 zzso carriers zzso for zzso against zzso B e zzso zzso contained zzso B virus zzso with zzso infectious doses of zzso and another pool from 12 carriers positive for zzso B e zzso zzso contained zzso doses or zzso The zzso pool contained zzso more zzso DNA than the zzso pool, reflecting the difference in zzso in zzso The zzso region sequences of zzso DNA in the two plasma pools were amplified by zzso chain reaction, and separate zzso DNA clones were zzso for determining the zzso zzso Of 114 clones from the zzso pool, 113 displayed a point zzso from zzso to zzso at zzso 83 in the zzso region, which converted zzso 28 for zzso zzso to a stop zzso zzso and the remaining clone had a point zzso from zzso to zzso at the first letter of zzso 1 zzso to inhibit the translation initiation of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso in contrast, were observed in only 10 zzso of 119 clones from the zzso zzso These results indicate the infectious capacity of zzso zzso defective in the zzso region and incapable of directing the synthesis and zzso of zzso which prevail in the circulation of hosts after they zzso from zzso to zzso
