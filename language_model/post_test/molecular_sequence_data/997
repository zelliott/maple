The experimental and clinical study of degenerative brain disorders would benefit from new surrogate markers for brain zzso To identify novel candidate markers for acute brain injury, we report that rat cortical zzso release over 60 zzso and other zzso as well as their zzso fragments into the medium during zzso zzso The profiles of released proteins differ for necrosis and zzso although a subset of proteins is released generally during zzso The value of this approach was established by zzso of the released proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso in zzso fluid zzso following traumatic brain injury zzso or transient zzso zzso in the zzso These results indicate that proteins and their zzso fragments released from zzso zzso are zzso fluid markers for acute brain damage and suggest that zzso of proteins from the injured brain may reflect underlying mechanisms for zzso
