A segregating second zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in the grass sheep's zzso zzso zzso We have earlier reported that a zzso analysis indicates that zzso has been zzso transferred from the reproductively separated grass zzso zzso Here we extend our analysis to include zzso and zzso information on 27 zzso sequences from 18 species representing five zzso and confirm our earlier zzso The origin of zzso can be traced to a group of closely zzso zzso and partially asexual zzso zzso The sequence most similar to zzso is found in zzso zzso with a zzso based on synonymous zzso of only zzso This value suggests that the transfer took place less than 600,000 years ago zzso zzso at a time when most extant zzso and zzso species already zzso
