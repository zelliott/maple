zzso zzso a zinc zzso catalyzing the zzso of carbon dioxide and zzso is nearly ubiquitous in the zzso of highly evolved zzso Here we report on the first known zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso cab gene was zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso produced protein was zzso zzso to apparent zzso The zzso designated zzso is zzso at temperatures up to 75 degrees zzso No zzso activity was detected with zzso as the zzso The zzso is an apparent zzso containing approximately one zinc per zzso as determined by plasma zzso zzso Cab has a zzso zzso activity with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso and 25 degrees zzso Western zzso analysis indicates that Cab zzso class) is expressed in zzso zzso moreover, a protein zzso to zzso raised against the gamma zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso extend not only into the zzso domain but also into the zzso zzso
