The zzso segment (the small segment zzso zzso the structural zzso zzso from the five United States zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso were amplified by the zzso method and cloned as full-length zzso The complete zzso sequence of each zzso gene segment was zzso Each zzso zzso segment of zzso 11, 13 and 17 was zzso zzso long and contained an open reading frame zzso capable of zzso a zzso acid zzso However, the zzso segment of zzso which also contained zzso zzso had a longer zzso region of zzso and contained an zzso capable only of zzso a zzso acid zzso Comparative analyses of the predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso segments of zzso 10, 11, 13 and 17 revealed that zzso was unusually high in zzso and contained few aromatic zzso zzso but a high concentration of charged zzso zzso which is a characteristic of a zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso 13 and 17 were more closely related than the other two US zzso zzso zzso was the most zzso zzso
