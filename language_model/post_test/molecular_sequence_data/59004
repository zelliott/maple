zzso genes share a high sequence identity with the zzso box present in the zzso determining gene zzso We have identified a zzso zzso sequence motif on six zzso zzso which zzso to a zzso zzso zzso A data base search revealed a high similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequence to the human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were assigned to zzso zzso by FISH zzso
