zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso system to the gene targeting technique allows for the conditional deletion of genes in zzso To selectively modify genes in B zzso we have generated mice zzso zzso which express zzso under the zzso control of the B zzso zzso zzso In a model system involving the cross of zzso mice with mice bearing a zzso zzso zzso we find a deletion efficiency of zzso in bone zzso zzso cells that increases to zzso in zzso B zzso
