zzso required for zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso a reaction whose function is to zzso zzso protein production, are zzso zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso to which at least two molecules of zzso protein can bind zzso but we demonstrate that the secondary structure of the zzso is not highly zzso A zzso analysis reveals that the zzso 20 zzso acids of zzso are essential for its zzso by the zzso zzso zzso transfer of these zzso acids to zzso zzso which is otherwise not affected by zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein containing only these 20 zzso zzso can interact in zzso with an zzso protein complex containing two zzso zzso but not with one containing a single zzso zzso explaining the requirement for two zzso sites on the zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso protein demonstrates that zzso acids zzso are required for zzso zzso A zzso synthetic zzso consisting of the zzso zzso zzso acids from this region has no zzso effect on zzso zzso However, the same zzso zzso when zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to this activity, the zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso and zzso formation in zzso without affecting zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso region of zzso with which it interacts is involved not only in zzso zzso but also in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
