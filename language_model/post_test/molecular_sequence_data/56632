3 zzso zzso (3 beta zzso in human zzso converts 3 zzso steroids producing zzso whereas 17 zzso zzso (17 beta zzso mediates the zzso of zzso and zzso We first showed that the expression of type I 17 beta zzso (17 beta zzso gene was zzso in human zzso zzso We then studied the effects of zzso and protein zzso pathways on the expression of 3 beta zzso and 17 beta zzso genes using an analog of zzso zzso zzso and a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Novel zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The 3 beta zzso zzso probe zzso to a single zzso zzso 3 beta zzso zzso species corresponding to the transcript of the 3 beta zzso zzso The 17 beta zzso zzso probe zzso to two 17 beta zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso 17 beta zzso zzso species was zzso whereas the zzso species was zzso expressed in zzso zzso When zzso cells were exposed to zzso or zzso 3 beta zzso and 17 beta zzso gene transcriptions were increased in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the combined effects of zzso and zzso on 3 beta zzso zzso levels was additive and synergistic on 17 beta zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso activated zzso of 3 beta zzso and 17 beta zzso zzso involved an zzso of the zzso The effects of a zzso zzso inhibitor and a zzso zzso inhibitor in zzso cells indicated that zzso acts on 3 beta zzso zzso via a zzso zzso but on 17 beta zzso zzso via another zzso zzso zzso Finally, the effect of zzso of both signaling pathways on expression of the 17 beta zzso gene as well as the effect of zzso on the 3 beta zzso gene did not require protein zzso These data provide strong evidence for the regulation of the 3 beta zzso and 17 beta zzso genes by zzso and zzso and, thus, indicate an important zzso and/or zzso regulation of steroid hormone production in human zzso
