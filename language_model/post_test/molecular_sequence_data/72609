In this study, zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso library made from zzso of three-week-old root zzso of zzso zzso employing a zzso zzso probe that zzso to a zzso region of small zzso zzso zzso The clones were sorted into groups by cross zzso and 3' sequencing, and 33 zzso were zzso in an orderly zzso zzso complete and six incomplete protein structures were zzso which represent three zzso of the zzso of signal zzso zzso zzso The 33 proteins are divided into nine zzso of which seven belong to the zzso zzso one zzso represents the zzso zzso and one zzso represents the Ran zzso of small zzso zzso The protein sequences were compared with related proteins from other plants, from zzso and other species, and discussed with respect to structure and function in different cellular zzso It is apparent that the number of genes zzso zzso proteins in plants must be quite large, since the large number of zzso found in other zzso is not fully represented in our zzso zzso patterns through root zzso development were zzso for 27 of the 33 zzso zzso expression patterns may reflect whether the coded gene product is of importance for organ zzso Most zzso appear to be zzso zzso however, a few unique zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show elevated levels in root zzso and certain zzso zzso and zzso species are enriched in aerial parts of the zzso This suggests that most small zzso have household functions, whereas a few may be required for specialized activities that are important for specialized zzso
