zzso zzso is observed with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso This provides direct kinetic evidence for a zzso mechanism and suggests that the breakdown of the zzso intermediate is the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool for zzso studies of zzso zzso since functional roles of active site zzso can be evaluated by studying their effects on the individual elementary steps associated with the formation and the breakdown of the zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso a zzso zzso that is present in the zzso signature zzso this zzso was altered by zzso zzso to zzso and zzso The effects of these zzso as observed in both zzso and zzso kinetic experiments with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso demonstrated that the zzso group of zzso is directly involved in zzso The zzso group at zzso 410 plays an important role in zzso the breakdown of the zzso zzso
