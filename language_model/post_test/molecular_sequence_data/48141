The usefulness and reliability of partial sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso gene amplification and zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso each member of the zzso group of the zzso zzso was zzso On the zzso tree based on zzso partial sequences zzso zzso from 96 zzso including all species currently within the zzso group isolated in different geographic areas zzso Japan and the zzso eight well separated clusters were generated corresponding to recognized species, and all strains fell into those clusters to which they had also been assigned by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was located within the zzso zzso zzso but the zzso gene of zzso zzso was very zzso and therefore could be separated from all other species zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene amplification approach could also be used to differentiate zzso zzso from other zzso The zzso amplification product of the zzso gene was successfully detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but failed to be detected in some strains of zzso zzso including the type strain and zzso zzso We conclude that the partial sequence analysis of the zzso gene could be applied globally as a reliable and easy method for the accurate identification of all species currently within the zzso zzso
