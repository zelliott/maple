zzso B virus zzso zzso F zzso is considered to be indigenous to the Americas, but its emergence and spread in the continent remain zzso Previously, only two zzso complete zzso sequences from Brazil were available, limiting the contribution of Brazilian zzso to the zzso studies of zzso The present study was carried out to assess the proportion and geographic zzso of zzso zzso in Brazil, to determine the full-length zzso sequences of zzso zzso from different Brazilian geographic regions, and to investigate the detailed evolutionary history and zzso of zzso in zzso 

Complete zzso zzso isolated from 12 Brazilian patients, representing the zzso zzso circulating in Brazil, were zzso and analyzed together with sequences retrieved from zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis using all Brazilian zzso zzso sequences available in zzso showed that zzso is found at higher zzso zzso and zzso to all sequences isolated in the Brazilian Amazon zzso In addition, the evolutionary analysis using complete zzso sequences estimated an older median ancestral age for the Brazilian zzso compared to the Brazilian zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso represents the original native zzso of zzso The zzso patterns suggested a zzso flow of zzso from Venezuela to Brazil, whereas zzso and zzso strains appeared to have spread from Argentina to zzso 

This study suggests a plausible route of introduction of zzso zzso in Brazil and demonstrates the usefulness of recently developed zzso tools for investigating the evolutionary history of zzso
