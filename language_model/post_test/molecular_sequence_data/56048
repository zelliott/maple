zzso protein 2 zzso has been described previously as an zzso zzso zzso zzso We report now the primary sequence of this protein as deduced from the corresponding zzso The protein possesses a zzso zzso retention sequence and three repeats of the zzso motive zzso and represents the rat zzso of zzso In contrast to earlier reports on zzso zzso possesses significant zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to zzso zzso is a zzso containing zzso zzso The amount of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells increases in parallel with that of zzso zzso protein under conditions which lead to impaired zzso while the amount of zzso another zzso zzso remains almost zzso
