zzso zzso zzso is a protein involved in zzso resistance as the outer membrane component for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso had zzso activity with an average single-channel zzso of only about 80 zzso in 1 M zzso The gene zzso zzso was subjected to zzso zzso by cloning of a foreign zzso from the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into 11 zzso In zzso coli, 8 of the 11 zzso zzso genes expressed proteins at levels comparable to those obtained with the zzso gene and the inserted zzso zzso were surface accessible as assessed by indirect zzso When moved to a zzso zzso zzso strain, seven of the zzso zzso genes expressed proteins at variable levels comparable to that of zzso zzso and three of these zzso zzso profiles resembling those of the zzso zzso while the other zzso forms showed variable zzso zzso zzso the data from these experiments, in conjunction with multiple sequence alignments and structure predictions, an zzso zzso model with 16 beta strands was zzso
