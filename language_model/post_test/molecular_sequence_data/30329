The zzso of zzso fruit is associated with the expression of a number of zzso zzso with overt changes in texture and zzso Two overlapping zzso for a zzso that accumulates during zzso were zzso zzso analysis of these two zzso revealed a zzso of zzso zzso acids with characteristics of a typical zzso an zzso zzso membrane anchor, a zzso zzso domain in the zzso region, and patches of similarity to various zzso family zzso Further evidence that this zzso represents a zzso zzso zzso comes from the recent isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso from ripe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) Plant zzso 89, zzso The N zzso of the predicted zzso in the zzso is identical to the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from fruit at various stages of zzso showed the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso protein predicted by the zzso zzso sequence shares less than zzso zzso identity with any known zzso gene zzso We propose therefore that it be placed in a separate family, zzso and that the corresponding gene from zzso be named zzso
