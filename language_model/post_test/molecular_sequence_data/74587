The zzso of zzso zzso contains two open reading frames zzso proteins which had been previously predicted to be DNA zzso zzso and zzso We show that while the former is indeed a DNA zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in an zzso reaction, suggesting that it is an zzso zzso We have solved the structure of zzso in complex with the zzso analog zzso by zzso anomalous zzso zzso zzso a structure with high structural similarity to the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso are also present, and one of these mediates contacts with a second zzso which is related by zzso zzso generating a zzso zzso These zzso zzso are terminated by short domain swaps which themselves end within 5 A of the active sites of the partner zzso Additionally, we show that the protein is indeed capable of zzso zzso molecules in an zzso zzso These structural and zzso results provide an insight into the potential zzso roles of zzso
