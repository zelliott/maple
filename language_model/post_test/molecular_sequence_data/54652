The zzso zzso zzso comprises species with extremely large zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Most North American species zzso zzso differ from zzso zzso species by their distinct zzso position and increased amounts of zzso This study examined the contribution of major repetitive elements to the zzso obesity found in zzso and identified repeats contributing to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Two zzso species of similar zzso size were selected for detailed analysis, one from each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso North zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed from their zzso zzso and used for zzso sequence zzso zzso and zzso zzso of clones containing highly repeated zzso 

zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso % of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, were zzso zzso and the zzso lineage of zzso group long terminal repeat zzso were identified as the zzso components of the highly repeated zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a heterogeneous, extremely zzso satellite repeat was isolated from zzso zzso The zzso repeat localized in zzso bands makes up zzso 26 % of the zzso zzso zzso and substantial zzso zzso in several other zzso zzso However, no evidence of a relationship between zzso content and zzso size variation was zzso Also, this study was unable to reveal any zzso repeats which tracked the zzso trends of zzso size evolution in zzso Instead, the giant zzso zzso seem to be composed of many diversified families of zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso obesity may be partly determined by the failure of removal mechanisms to counterbalance effectively the zzso zzso
