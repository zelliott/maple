zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that rapidly zzso cellulose with the aid of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of knockout zzso for zzso (also known as zzso zzso and zzso the most abundant zzso zzso was undertaken to gain insight into its role in zzso and microbial cellulose zzso zzso of the zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso were able to completely zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso The cellulose zzso rate of the S zzso strain was zzso lower than the parent strain, with the S zzso strain also exhibiting a zzso reduction in cell zzso The zzso produced by the S zzso strain was zzso by affinity zzso characterized zzso and found to have a zzso lower specific activity on zzso The composition of the zzso zzso was analyzed by tandem mass zzso with zzso zzso and no significant changes in abundance were observed in any of the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although most zzso bacteria have one family 48 zzso zzso zzso has two, zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a zzso and zzso double knockout was essentially the same as that of the zzso single zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso cellulose by zzso zzso can proceed to completion without expression of a family 48 zzso
