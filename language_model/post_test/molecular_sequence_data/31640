zzso recognition zzso with DNA zzso have tremendous potential as molecular tools for zzso zzso The type III zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a DNA binding domain consisting of tandem repeats that can be engineered to bind zzso specific DNA zzso We demonstrated that customized zzso zzso zzso constructed using a method called zzso zzso specifically target the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso bound to the target site and zzso zzso DNA in zzso and in zzso whereas the zzso binding elements have a 23 zzso zzso The zzso zzso I zzso and sequencing data show that zzso made zzso breaks, which were repaired by a zzso zzso zzso within the target zzso These data show the feasibility of applying customized zzso to target and modify the zzso with deletions in those organisms that are still in lacking gene target methods to provide zzso in breeding zzso
