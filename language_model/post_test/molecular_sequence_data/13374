zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso is contained within a zzso zzso zzso The zzso is transcribed from a single zzso zzso promoter, zzso that resembles the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso consensus promoter zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso at all stages of development in zzso zzso In addition, at the normal growth temperature of 30 degrees C, zzso transcript levels were shown to vary at different stages of development, being more abundant in young zzso cultures and in zzso undergoing zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso has been completed, revealing the gene organization zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso zzso Its predicted product displays high similarity to the zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso and to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein has been zzso in zzso coli, and zzso experiments indicate that it interacts specifically with the zzso region, binding to three partially related zzso repeat zzso they are centered at zzso zzso and zzso respectively, relative to the zzso start site of the zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a direct role in the regulation of the zzso zzso
