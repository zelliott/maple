Factor V zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso zzso disorder associated with moderate to severe bleeding zzso Conventional zzso screening leads to a complete molecular genetic diagnosis only in about zzso of zzso Large gene zzso which could explain at least part of the zzso zzso have not been reported so far in zzso zzso In this work, we investigated a family with zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso is compound zzso for a zzso zzso involving the first seven zzso of F5 , and the entire zzso zzso zzso and E zzso and for a novel zzso zzso zzso The deletion zzso determined by using a combination of zzso real-time zzso and long zzso zzso occurred within zzso repeat zzso suggesting an zzso unequal zzso zzso as the mechanism responsible for the zzso The in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso causes the skipping of zzso 12 and the zzso of a cryptic zzso zzso Low levels of residual zzso zzso were also zzso in agreement with the notion that the complete absence of zzso may be not compatible with zzso
