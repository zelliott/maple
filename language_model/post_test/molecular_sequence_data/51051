We prepared a novel rat zzso specific for zzso molecules bearing the zzso coded for by the alternative zzso 6 of the zzso zzso gene zzso Together with available zzso to alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), we found that the three alternative zzso show differential expressions on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that although B cells were zzso zzso the zzso T cells clearly included two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso T cells were separated into zzso and zzso zzso Such features of zzso expression on the cell surface correlate well with message levels of corresponding alternative zzso In the zzso T cells, messages of alternative zzso were associated with either one or two zzso forms of the zzso zzso In zzso T cells, there were transcripts with one, two, or three alternative zzso When zzso by an immobilized zzso zzso the zzso T cell subset zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells produced zzso Upon stimulation with zzso A, zzso T cells converted to zzso cells, and the level of zzso expression on the zzso T cell subset was zzso These changes were zzso and zzso zzso differential expression of zzso probably zzso the functional zzso of zzso zzso T cells that is associated with the stages of zzso T cell maturation or zzso
