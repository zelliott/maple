zzso with linear sequences recognized by zzso zzso from seven mothers of children with zzso heart block were recently zzso Eight of these zzso share sequence identity with three other proteins in addition to the original zzso zzso The three proteins are human cardiac zzso beta heavy chain, zzso B1 chain and the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a further three mothers bound to the La zzso and also to human cardiac zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso from three mothers of healthy children bound to the La zzso but showed minimal binding to either human cardiac zzso or mouse zzso zzso zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso zzso to both La and zzso These data support a role for maternal zzso crossing the zzso and recognizing zzso cardiac zzso accessible at a critical zzso stage during zzso We suggest that this would lead to complement zzso inflammation and the subsequent pathology associated with zzso heart zzso
