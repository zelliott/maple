zzso and functional properties of zzso are intricately and zzso zzso To cope with the functional requirements in auditory processing, the zzso of zzso developed distinct structural zzso such as a large number of active zones, large size, elaborate zzso and defined distribution of zzso zzso These zzso typically appear during zzso maturation within the first 3 weeks of life and are accompanied by marked changes in the properties of synaptic zzso We examined the arrangement of synaptic zzso at different zzso stages of maturation by genetically labeling zzso with the fluorescent fusion protein zzso green fluorescent zzso Fluorescence and electron zzso analyses revealed a new anatomical specialization in the mature zzso of zzso Within small, zzso compartments zzso synaptic zzso formed zzso zzso around a central cluster of interconnected zzso Adult zzso contained approximately 100 such structural units, each of them consisting of approximately 800 synaptic zzso six to nine zzso and five to nine active zzso A zzso of synaptic zzso measured approximately 1 zzso in diameter and was placed in a swelling with a volume of approximately 5 zzso Conspicuously, this structural specialization appears with the onset of hearing and may contribute to zzso changes in zzso zzso
