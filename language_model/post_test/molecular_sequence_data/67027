A molecular probe that selectively tags zzso a zzso zzso was zzso This probe was one of many compounds originally designed to target the active site of zzso zzso in zzso To our surprise, however, the probe almost exclusively labeled zzso even in a zzso of zzso zzso This finding led us to further characterize this zzso complex by a series of zzso and mass zzso zzso The zzso site on zzso was located within the zzso region of zzso zzso as we originally zzso However, the unexpected selectivity of this probe toward zzso suggests that subtle factors, which are difficult to predict based on zzso crystal structures, play important roles in probe zzso
