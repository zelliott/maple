To characterize and identify a novel contaminant of aviation zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from samples of aviation zzso A zzso that proved to have been unrecorded previously was isolated from more than one fuel zzso This novel zzso proved to be a new species of zzso and is described zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analyses of internal transcribed zzso zzso regions (including zzso zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso showed the strains to cluster within the zzso zzso zzso nearest to, but distinct from, zzso zzso zzso tests were identical for both zzso zzso and zzso tests supported their position as a separate zzso The zzso was assessed for its effect on the main constituent zzso of aviation zzso 

Two strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to the novel zzso species, zzso zzso were isolated from samples of aircraft fuel zzso characterized and described zzso with reference to their potential as zzso of aviation zzso 

As a result of zzso a novel zzso from aviation fuel, the implications for microbial contamination of such fuel should be considered more widely than previously zzso
