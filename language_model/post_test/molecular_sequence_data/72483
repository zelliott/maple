zzso Collins syndrome zzso is an zzso dominant disorder of zzso development, the features of which include zzso hearing loss and zzso zzso Recently, the demonstration of a series of 10 zzso within a zzso zzso clone have indicated that the zzso gene zzso has been zzso zzso Although it has been shown that the gene is expressed in a wide variety of fetal and adult zzso database sequence comparisons have failed to provide significant information on the function of the zzso In the current investigation, a combination of zzso library screening and rapid amplification of zzso ends has permitted the isolation of the complete coding sequence of zzso which is zzso by 26 zzso and predicts a low complexity, zzso protein of approximately 144 zzso The use of a variety of zzso tools has resulted in the identification of repeated units within the zzso each of which maps onto an individual zzso The predicted protein zzso contains numerous potential zzso sites, a number of which map to similar positions within the repeated units, and shows weak but significant zzso to the zzso zzso Although the precise function of zzso remains unknown, these observations suggest that zzso may be important for its role in early embryonic development and that it may play a role in zzso zzso The information presented in this study will allow continued zzso analysis in families with a history of zzso and should facilitate continued zzso to shed further light on the function of the zzso during development of the zzso zzso
