The application of the reporter zzso zzso method for identifying zzso complexes in the zzso analysis of zzso and zzso interactions in zzso is zzso To test the reliability of the method, it was applied to the zzso analysis of zzso complexes originating from specific interactions in solution and from zzso interactions in the zzso zzso These control experiments confirm the basic assumptions underlying the zzso method, namely that zzso zzso binding is a random process, and that the zzso zzso histories for specific and zzso complexes are zzso The application of the zzso method to the zzso analysis of the sequential binding of the zzso zzso a DNA zzso to single and double strand zzso is also zzso and highlights the general utility of the zzso
