To investigate the evolutionary dynamics at zzso class II DR genes of mice zzso zzso we zzso the zzso binding regions zzso of 41 zzso zzso E zzso genes and eight zzso zzso E zzso genes from 15 strains representing eight zzso As expected trees of these zzso sequences imply extensive maintenance of ancestral zzso zzso across zzso We use a zzso simulation model to show that the number of zzso zzso events zzso observed on these trees was higher than the number expected for neutral zzso and similar sample sizes and is more consistent with balancing selection that with zzso zzso of ancestral zzso in mouse zzso zzso were also used to examine the tempo of synonymous substitution in the zzso of mouse class II zzso Both absolute and relative rate tests on zzso and zzso genes imply increased substitution rates at two- and fourfold zzso sites of mice and rats relative to zzso and decreased rates for the zzso genes of primates relative to zzso and zzso zzso Thus rates of synonymous substitution at zzso DR genes in zzso appear to be subject to generation time effects in ways similar to those found at other zzso zzso
