The zzso gene product zzso is a nuclear zzso that regulates cell cycle zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor that regulates zzso gene expression during T cell zzso In this report, it is demonstrated that zzso contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the zzso binding sites of several viral zzso and binds to the pocket region of zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso binds exclusively to the zzso form of zzso and fails to bind to zzso zzso derived from patients with zzso zzso experiments demonstrated an association between zzso and zzso in resting normal human T zzso After T cell zzso the zzso of zzso results in the release of zzso which is correlated temporally with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso inhibited zzso zzso during T cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso interacts specifically with a zzso zzso zzso zzso This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of zzso zzso functions such as zzso production with cell cycle progression in activated T zzso
