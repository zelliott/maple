Using a strictly zzso soybean zzso max zzso zzso cell suspension, we studied the correlation of zzso cell proliferation and the activity of zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso generally associated with cell proliferation in animal, microbial and, as reported recently, also plant zzso We found the activity of zzso I to be modulated during the proliferation cycle, with a zzso activity between day 2 and day 4 of culture zzso After starving the culture of zzso for three subsequent zzso both the zzso activity and zzso could be zzso with zzso zzso activity reached its maximum 1 d before cell number was at a zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso
