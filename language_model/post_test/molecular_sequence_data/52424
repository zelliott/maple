The human zzso zzso system represents a naturally occurring zzso of human zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and has previously been implicated in the onset of two important clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis of the zzso underlying the zzso zzso system, we used the zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of amplified zzso zzso from zzso 161 to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso that zzso precisely with zzso zzso in twelve other individuals zzso This zzso substitution results in an zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso at zzso acid 143 of zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso is located within the putative zzso binding site zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso patterns of a zzso individual, however, were nearly normal in response to all zzso zzso tested, indicating that this zzso does not zzso affect zzso zzso Short synthetic peptides encompassing zzso 143 were unable to mimic either the Pena or zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are dependent upon proper folding of the zzso zzso Finally, we constructed zzso zzso forms of zzso that differed only at zzso acid zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso were able to recognize the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso only with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It thus appears that zzso acid 143 of zzso is not only associated with zzso zzso but specifically controls the formation and expression of the zzso zzso zzso
