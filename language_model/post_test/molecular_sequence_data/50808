The gene zzso a putative G zzso zzso zzso was cloned from human zzso DNA by low stringency zzso and found to be zzso to the recently described rat zzso B2 zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso encodes a high affinity BK zzso with an apparent zzso of 150 zzso zzso by BK zzso and zzso allowed the characterization of the zzso as a B2 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso cascade was demonstrated in zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium concentration were elevated in response to BK zzso The zzso and zzso properties of BK zzso do not match strictly the pharmacological profile described for the rat or guinea pig B2 zzso zzso or the putative B3 zzso This zzso is attributed either to species zzso or to differences in the zzso efficiency of receptors to the zzso cascade in different cell zzso From our results, the existence of B3 receptors and of B2 zzso appears zzso
