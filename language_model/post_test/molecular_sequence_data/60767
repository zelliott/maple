zzso major zzso proteins of human zzso zzso enter the zzso of host cells at two times during the viral life zzso 1) after infection and 2) later during the productive phase, when they assemble the zzso zzso zzso DNA into infectious zzso zzso proteins are stable in two zzso zzso as zzso zzso and as zzso composed of 72 zzso We found that intact zzso zzso of zzso type 11 cannot enter the nucleus, suggesting that zzso zzso may be required for zzso zzso nuclear zzso We established that zzso zzso is imported in a zzso manner into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the nuclear pore complexes via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited nuclear import of zzso zzso Moreover, nuclear import of zzso zzso could be zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In agreement with the zzso and import data, we found that zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and that this interaction is inhibited by a zzso representing the classical nuclear zzso signal of zzso T zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso enters the nucleus of the infected host cell via the zzso zzso zzso
