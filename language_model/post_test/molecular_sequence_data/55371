In order to search new zzso zzso and conduct zzso of microbial communities from high Andean forest soil, a zzso library of approximately 20,000 clones was constructed in zzso coli using zzso zzso II zzso The library covered zzso of the zzso DNA mainly from zzso zzso and zzso Two clones with zzso activity in zzso as a zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected and the entire zzso insert sequence was zzso The sequence had a zzso content of zzso and could be derived from an zzso zzso zzso One open reading frame zzso a zzso of 210 zzso acids zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso that contained the zzso zzso near the zzso essential for zzso activity and the putative zzso zzso was identified, also a putative zzso binding site located zzso upstream the zzso zzso start zzso was zzso The zzso analysis suggested that the protein belonged to a new zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a preference for short length fatty zzso with specific activity against zzso zzso of total zzso it was cold active with relative activity of zzso at zzso and moderately zzso active with relative activity of zzso at zzso and had a pH optimum of zzso at zzso
