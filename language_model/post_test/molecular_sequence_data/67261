zzso is a crucial step in many zzso including tumor growth and zzso Here, we show that zzso peptides exert zzso zzso zzso (or zzso peptides are short peptides known to destabilize zzso and zzso zzso and characterized by an zzso distribution of zzso zzso along the axis when zzso We have previously shown that zzso fragments of the human zzso hormone zzso family members are potent zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that all these fragments possess a zzso sequence having the characteristics of a zzso zzso The zzso peptides of human zzso and human growth hormone induce zzso cell zzso inhibit zzso cell zzso and inhibit zzso formation both in zzso and in zzso These zzso effects are abolished when the zzso zzso zzso is altered by zzso We further demonstrate that the well known zzso peptides of zzso zzso virus zzso and Alzheimer's zzso zzso are also zzso zzso Taken together, these results point to a potential new role for zzso peptides in regulating zzso
