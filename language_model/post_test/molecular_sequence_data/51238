zzso of the zzso zzso was studied in ten patients with multiple zzso and the DNA from nude mouse tumors formed by cells obtained from zzso zzso (in zzso selection zzso in these patients was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were identified in two of three patients investigated by in zzso selection zzso and in five of ten patients investigated by zzso analysis of DNA from myeloma zzso In the two former patients, zzso of the zzso zzso was observed at the 61st zzso Of the five zzso zzso patients investigated by the zzso analysis, one had a zzso at zzso 12, two had zzso at zzso 13, and two had zzso at zzso zzso None of the patients had zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the frequency of zzso gene zzso in multiple myeloma is higher than in other zzso zzso such as acute zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso and zzso zzso As the zzso was observed only at the zzso zzso level, it is speculated that zzso zzso zzso might play an important role in the progression of multiple zzso
