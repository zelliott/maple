The in zzso activity of zzso was characterized for cell zzso generation of zzso units zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso exhibited a significant increase in potency compared to zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso or an zzso combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that at 50% of the maximum response, the relative potency of zzso was zzso greater than the combination of zzso and zzso and zzso more potent than zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso a combination of zzso zzso and zzso resulted in greater numbers of zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso culture of peripheral blood or bone zzso zzso cells with zzso substantially increased total viable cells over cultures zzso with zzso zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso Culture with zzso resulted in a greater increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursor cells without depleting the zzso pool zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a more potent zzso of zzso proliferation and differentiation than the single zzso zzso zzso and zzso either alone or zzso These unique attributes suggest that zzso may enhance zzso zzso following zzso zzso
