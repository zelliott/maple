The zzso gene is specifically expressed in zzso cells and zzso and not in mature B and T cells or zzso zzso zzso that it may function in early zzso zzso We have previously described the cloning of an incomplete zzso for zzso Here we report the isolation of full-length zzso and zzso clones for the zzso zzso gene and the mapping of its location to mouse zzso zzso zzso analyses of different zzso zzso clones suggest that there may be at least three forms of the zzso protein generated by differential processing of the zzso zzso The zzso with the longest open reading frame encodes a putative protein that has seven zzso zzso similar to those of seven zzso zzso such as the classical G zzso zzso To directly address the role of the zzso protein in zzso development, zzso mice were generated by gene zzso and zzso development in these mice was zzso
