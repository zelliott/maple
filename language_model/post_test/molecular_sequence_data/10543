Human and monkey zzso alpha contain activated zzso groups on zzso acid zzso Three lines of evidence indicate the existence of unusual zzso 1) zzso alpha continued to be metabolically labeled with zzso acid despite a zzso at zzso the sole site of zzso in zzso bovine zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso De La Rosa, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso 2) Immediately upon cell zzso the pH stability zzso of metabolically labeled native zzso alpha or a zzso zzso resembled the pH stability curve of zzso zzso 3) After a brief incubation at pH 7, these zzso changed from a pattern diagnostic for an zzso zzso to that characteristic of a zzso or zzso zzso an observation consistent with transfer of zzso in zzso Our data indicate that most of zzso zzso zzso are subject zzso to zzso based on the observation that greater than zzso of the zzso initially found at pH 7 disappeared at the extremes of zzso Rapid loss of zzso was not affected by the presence of zzso zzso including 50 zzso sodium zzso 1 zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso missing could not be zzso but the zzso amount recovered on zzso or zzso depended heavily on conditions favoring the transient survival of zzso zzso Further analysis using zzso cells zzso in the presence of sodium zzso showed that: 1) zzso recovered on zzso alpha decreased zzso when zzso were treated with zzso 2) the zzso caused zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso 3) using zzso label was introduced into zzso a product derived from reductive zzso of zzso and 4) zzso was localized almost exclusively to a zzso with pronounced zzso to the zzso binding site of zzso a zzso zzso protein found in zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso alpha is zzso by virtue of zzso amounts of zzso zzso
