zzso zzso reduction dominates zzso carbon zzso in marine sediments with high zzso oxide zzso but the zzso responsible for this process are largely zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso in geographically zzso zzso zzso sediments from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso isotope probing zzso zzso reduction was the prevailing terminal zzso process in zzso zzso of surface zzso and even the addition of zzso zzso neither iron nor zzso zzso The three geographically distinct sediments zzso surprisingly similar communities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of members of the zzso zzso and zzso and of novel zzso within the zzso and zzso were detected in heavy zzso zzso from these three zzso Most probable number zzso analysis yielded up to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene clone library that was established from the highest zzso zzso was dominated by sequences of zzso and zzso species and members of the zzso supporting the obtained zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso sediments is zzso by members of zzso zzso zzso and zzso previously not known to possess this zzso function, zzso similar zzso zzso zzso thrive in geographically distinct regions and zzso the identified zzso zzso differ greatly from the extensively explored iron zzso in marine zzso
