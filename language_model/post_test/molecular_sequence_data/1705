The development of root hairs serves as an excellent model to study cell growth using both zzso and genetic zzso In the past, we have characterized zzso an zzso protein of zzso consisting of an zzso and a structural zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in root hairs and zzso zzso show severe deficiencies in root hair zzso In this work, we describe the characterization of zzso zzso of zzso zzso that were isolated in a visual screen of an zzso zzso zzso line for plants exhibiting an enhanced zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso were zzso three of which define new genetic zzso involved in root hair zzso The zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso result in additive zzso in zzso double zzso One zzso zzso is affected in the zzso gene and encodes a protein with a 22 zzso acid deletion at the zzso The comparison of molecular and zzso data of different zzso zzso suggests that the truncated zzso protein is still partially zzso
