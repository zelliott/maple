zzso zzso of proteins represents an important zzso of zzso zzso We zzso human growth hormone zzso a protein with a well defined zzso site, to study the detailed mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso Particularly zzso and zzso within the zzso site were zzso predominantly to zzso with the incorporated oxygen originating from molecular zzso based on zzso acid analysis, zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reduction of a zzso mixture by zzso generated a zzso complex with zzso spectral features different from those of native zzso and zzso The zzso reaction of this zzso complex with hydrogen zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that a fraction of zzso was bound at the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso of zzso required an intact zzso site and could largely (about zzso be inhibited by the presence of zzso zzso zzso which appears zzso to zzso the zzso site and zzso to interact with a zzso oxygen species formed at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso was significantly lower than that by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso reflecting a kinetic isotope effect close to that for the reaction of a zzso radical with zzso bonds of zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso zzso species in the zzso of zzso
