Members of the zzso family initiate translation of their zzso zzso by a zzso mechanism in which zzso bind to an internal site in the zzso untranslated region zzso This unique process requires an internal zzso entry site zzso a highly structured zzso whose function is zzso in part by interactions with cell zzso The zzso element of human zzso 2 zzso extends from zzso zzso 10 to between zzso 544 and zzso and has been shown to interact with two cell zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso To map the specific regions of zzso zzso that bind cell zzso mobility shift, zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses were zzso The results indicate that an zzso sequence from zzso 538 to 591 interacts with zzso and zzso two proteins previously shown to functionally interact with the zzso elements of several zzso Two additional zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso to zzso 538 to 591 zzso These four proteins interact with a zzso zzso portion of the zzso that contains a zzso tract and has been shown to be present at the 3' border of sequences that are essential for zzso function of zzso These zzso interactions are likely to play a role in internal initiation of zzso
