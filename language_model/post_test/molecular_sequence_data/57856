We have isolated a zzso zzso a high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is distinct from another zzso zzso zzso While the 3' sequences of these two zzso are zzso the zzso zzso regions and the zzso are completely zzso zzso is found only in the white matter of the zzso while zzso is found in the gray matter of the zzso as well as in zzso and mast cells in peripheral zzso Our findings suggest that zzso alternative zzso or alternative promoter usage from a single gene results in two zzso products zzso similar but distinct zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso supports the emerging status of zzso as a zzso neurotransmitter and suggests that zzso may function as a chemical zzso outside the zzso
