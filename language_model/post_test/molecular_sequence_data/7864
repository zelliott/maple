We have compared the variable regions of 14 new zzso zzso factors zzso produced in healthy human zzso donors zzso with zzso originating from patients with zzso arthritis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two groups with very restricted variable region structures were zzso Twelve zzso (3 zzso 3 zzso and 6 zzso zzso by variable heavy zzso chain zzso genes with closest zzso to zzso zzso the zzso variable light zzso chain zzso zzso These zzso have a remarkable restriction in the length zzso zzso zzso and structure of the zzso One zzso zzso has a zzso only two zzso acids different from the zzso of a zzso zzso Two sets of zzso related zzso one from an zzso patient and one from an zzso have zzso that differ by only three zzso zzso Five zzso (3 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso zzso by zzso zzso gene segments with closest zzso to zzso all use the zzso zzso zzso gene combined to J zzso zzso Four are rearranged to the zzso D segment in the same reading frame, with zzso of 16 to 17 zzso zzso Three zzso (1 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso have zzso differing by only three zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso in zzso from these two groups imply an initial selection to very similar, if not zzso zzso However, it remains to be seen whether zzso zzso alters the fine specificity of these zzso
