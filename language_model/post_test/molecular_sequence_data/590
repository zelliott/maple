Considering the complexity of the in zzso interactions established by a zzso zzso agent at the plant zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches were used to study a novel zzso gene coding for a plant cell wall zzso zzso A zzso analysis, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso system, allowed us to identify a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Spot zzso remarkably increased only in the presence of the zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso and corresponded to an expressed sequence tag from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library that was constructed in the presence of zzso zzso and used to isolate the zzso zzso Compared with the zzso strain, zzso zzso showed lower PG activity, less growth on zzso zzso and reduced capability to colonize tomato zzso These results were combined with zzso comparative data from the zzso of zzso plants zzso with the wild type or a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be required for active root colonization and plant defense induction by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso leaf zzso zzso were slightly smaller in plants zzso by zzso although no statistically significant differences were zzso
