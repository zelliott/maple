zzso bovine zzso derived from zzso zzso can be transformed by bovine zzso type 4 DNA only in the presence of an activated zzso zzso indicating that the virus does not zzso all the information required for zzso transformation of zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the complete zzso and zzso open reading frames zzso zzso transformation in cooperation with activated zzso but transformation is abolished when the zzso zzso is deleted at the 3' end, showing that this zzso encodes a necessary transforming zzso Transformation is more aggressive when the zzso and zzso zzso are placed under the zzso control of the long terminal repeat of the mouse zzso zzso virus, suggesting that the degree of transformation is dependent on the level of expression of these zzso
