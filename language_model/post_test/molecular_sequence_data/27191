The zzso family member zzso is the central regulator of nitrogen zzso response in zzso zzso While the zzso zzso was zzso characterized in great detail up to now, zzso questions of zzso binding were not zzso This study presents a characterization of functionally important zzso acids in the DNA binding domain of zzso and of crucial zzso in the zzso recognition zzso 

zzso zzso the characterization of corresponding zzso proteins by gel zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance and molecular zzso revealed several zzso zzso which are directly involved in DNA zzso while others have more structural zzso Furthermore, we could show that the spacing of the binding motif half sites is crucial for repression of zzso by zzso 

Although the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso is highly zzso and a core binding motif was identified for zzso and zzso the zzso binding domain shows individual properties compared to other zzso zzso Besides by distinct zzso acids of zzso DNA binding is influenced by zzso not only of the zzso binding motif but also by spacing zzso in zzso zzso
