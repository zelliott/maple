zzso toxin enters the zzso of zzso cells where it zzso cellular protein zzso leading to cell zzso Recently we found that the addition of a signal for zzso protein degradation to diphtheria toxin substantially reduced its zzso stability and zzso These results prompted us to construct a toxin containing a degradation signal that is removable through the action of a viral zzso In principle, such a toxin would be zzso zzso and thus zzso in cells expressing the viral zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells, thereby providing a specific zzso of these zzso In the present work we describe the construction of toxins that contain a signal for zzso degradation just upstream of a zzso site for the zzso from zzso type 1 zzso zzso We show that the toxins are zzso by zzso zzso exclusively at the introduced sites, and thereby are converted from unstable to stable zzso Furthermore, this zzso substantially increased the ability of the toxins to inhibit cellular protein zzso However, the toxins were unable to selectively eradicate zzso cells, apparently due to low zzso zzso zzso activity, since we could not detect zzso of the toxins by zzso zzso in infected zzso Alternative strategies for the construction of toxins that can specifically be activated by viral zzso are zzso
