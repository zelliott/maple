A protein consisting of human zzso A to which the zzso 16 zzso acids of zzso were fused was prepared by constructing an expression zzso by zzso zzso The hybrid protein zzso zzso was expressed under the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein was zzso with the use of a zzso zzso against zzso or the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso The zzso protein exhibited a single major band on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and has zzso activity on human and bovine zzso Unlike zzso A, but similar to zzso the hybrid zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso The introduction of a zzso site into zzso A by fusion of the region of zzso which contains the zzso site provides a new zzso for studies of zzso zzso zzso and other studies where labeled zzso are zzso Furthermore, the introduction of zzso sites into proteins provides a new principle for the preparation of a wide variety of zzso for many zzso
