zzso belonging to the zzso zzso reside in various natural zzso however, only zzso zzso strains have received attention while ecological function and zzso of zzso strains were often zzso Because high level of tolerance against zzso is a common trait of zzso we investigated the characteristics of zzso in zzso zzso zzso isolated from fermented seafood containing a high concentration of zzso Among the zzso zzso screened, zzso showed the highest zzso and zzso zzso activities under zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis with other zzso strains showed that zzso replication origins are highly zzso zzso the zzso strain has a high number of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso has many unique proteins zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis under zzso conditions showed that genes involved in cell zzso zzso zzso stress, zzso zzso and translation are highly zzso zzso may use the zzso zzso zzso to zzso some toxic zzso under zzso zzso Six new and three known zzso small zzso of the zzso strain were also found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses identified target zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso strain became resistant to zzso produced by the zzso strain only under zzso zzso Our data showed that the zzso strain adapted to zzso conditions by expressing core cellular processes zzso zzso zzso and defense genes zzso zzso compatible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could survive zzso exposure under zzso zzso
