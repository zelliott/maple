The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein complex involved in a variety of signaling and zzso processes through the regulation of protein zzso and zzso A known zzso role attributed to zzso is a zzso activity responsible for the zzso of zzso core components for several types of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso center resides in its zzso 5, which in zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso zzso are assembled into distinct zzso complexes in zzso which are present in drastically different zzso with zzso appearing to be the dominant zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins carrying a collection of single zzso in or surrounding the zzso zzso center are properly assembled into zzso complexes, but only zzso in zzso result in a zzso dominant negative zzso The extent of zzso effects caused by zzso in zzso is reflected at the molecular level by impairment in zzso zzso These results reveal that three key metal binding zzso as well as two other zzso acids outside the zzso center play important roles in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data provide zzso evidence on a positive role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso through zzso (for Related to zzso zzso and highlight the unequal role that zzso and zzso play in controlling the cellular zzso of zzso The initial characterization of zzso and zzso zzso zzso further supports these findings and provides genetic evidence on their unequal role in plant zzso
