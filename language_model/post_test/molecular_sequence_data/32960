Peanut zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso and cash crop in the semi-arid zzso where it often suffers from drought zzso Although its zzso responses are zzso little is known about the molecular events involved in its zzso responses to zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of membrane zzso and protein degrading zzso as well as protective proteins such as zzso zzso zzso protein in peanut zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a full-length zzso zzso a zzso protein were zzso Their expression in response to progressive water deficit and zzso was compared between zzso differing in their tolerance to zzso zzso gene expression pattern according to either water deficit intensity and zzso tolerance to drought were zzso A good correspondence between the molecular responses of the studied zzso and their zzso responses previously defined in greenhouse and field experiments was zzso zzso characters, as they were zzso at an early stage, could therefore be efficiently integrated in zzso breeding zzso for drought zzso Thus, the relevance of the target genes as drought tolerance indicators is zzso
