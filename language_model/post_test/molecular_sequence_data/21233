zzso zzso zzso are small, zzso regulatory zzso which can elicit zzso repression of zzso levels of target zzso Here, we report the identification of 67 mature and 42 precursor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of 26 precursor zzso and 35 mature zzso while we identified 16 precursor zzso and 32 mature zzso that displayed no zzso These zzso zzso zzso are located on seven zzso zzso and a sex zzso zzso zzso expansion through gene zzso was suggested for at least two zzso families zzso and zzso zzso target finding analysis identified zzso predicted zzso targets for the identified zzso and suggests that the zzso may be involved in female sexual zzso Given the important roles of zzso in animals, the identification and characterization of zzso in zzso zzso will facilitate novel approaches towards prevention and treatment of zzso
