The liquid zzso zzso of zzso are the alternative to the zzso organization of zzso in the zzso These zzso zzso have to devise novel ways to maintain active parts of the zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso has significant sequence identity with the bacterial zzso protein zzso zzso also has a secondary structure resembling zzso in zzso We have examined zzso in its zzso zzso zzso on zzso revealed its zzso activity is on the zzso zzso The zzso domain is responsible for zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso However, zzso could not complement zzso coli zzso zzso suggesting functional zzso In zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso but not ring closure as the zzso zzso zzso The basic zzso was an efficient DNA condensing agent, but it did not behave like an ordinary zzso zzso zzso also induced specific structures with DNA in a zzso manner, as demonstrated by atomic force zzso zzso At moderate concentration of zzso DNA bridging and bundling were zzso at high zzso the complexes were even more zzso These results are consistent with a zzso role for zzso in maintaining extended DNA zzso at the periphery of liquid zzso zzso
