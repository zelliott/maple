We have constructed zzso virus 40 zzso containing uniquely placed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso and zzso bypass zzso zzso for replication in a human zzso extract through the analysis of full-size labeled product molecules and restriction fragments spanning the T zzso T site resulted in the following findings: zzso The primary site of synthesis zzso with T zzso T in either the leading or lagging strand was one zzso before the zzso zzso zzso bypass of T zzso T was detected in both leading and lagging zzso The efficiency of synthesis past T zzso T was zzso for zzso T zzso T and zzso for zzso T zzso zzso zzso The zzso T zzso T resulted in blocked retrograde synthesis with the replication fork proceeding past the zzso resulting in daughter molecules containing small gaps zzso zzso zzso zzso With T zzso T in the zzso template, both the leading and lagging strands were zzso representing a stalled replication zzso zzso of the concerted synthesis of the two strands of the replication fork was observed, resulting in preferential zzso of the undamaged lagging zzso These data support a model of selective zzso downstream from the zzso on lagging strands due to Okazaki zzso with no zzso close to the damage site on leading strands zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
