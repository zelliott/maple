The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the highly zzso group of the class I steroid hormone zzso a zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso All class I receptors influence the expression of their target genes by binding zzso spaced partial zzso repeats of the core zzso zzso The implication that all class I receptors activate zzso by binding similar DNA zzso poses the problem of how the in zzso zzso of zzso control is zzso The zzso however, is able to interact with DNA motifs that are divergent from the classical hormone response zzso We will describe this zzso DNA interaction in the context of the general mechanisms that dictate the zzso of zzso and zzso of the nuclear zzso The zzso zzso is the only steroid hormone zzso that is able to interact with response elements that are essentially arranged as a direct repeat of the zzso zzso binding zzso We propose that the zzso domain of the zzso can interact with these zzso response elements in a zzso zzso similar to many other nuclear hormone zzso The fact that subtle differences in the sequence of response elements can dictate zzso responses is a new and intriguing zzso It creates new possibilities in the research on zzso action and provides a new angle in the search for selective zzso or zzso that might influence zzso zzso action via either type of DNA zzso
