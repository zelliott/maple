zzso are positively charged zzso that constitute about zzso of all proteins in zzso zzso they have a wide spectrum of biological zzso By CD zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown to have similar secondary structure in an zzso environment, with dominating zzso structure, and to vary in the twisting angle of the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown to incorporate into zzso structures without changes in the secondary structure of the zzso The binding of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso was associated with an increase in the zzso twisting and a sign change of the zzso angle of one zzso zzso The zzso were considerably different in zzso and zzso of the effect on human zzso leukemia cells zzso mouse zzso cells zzso and human zzso cells zzso The most toxic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possessed low zzso of interaction zzso zzso h zzso zzso unlike zzso less toxic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an intermediate position on the zzso scale and is characterized by h zzso zzso The zzso under study induced necrosis of zzso cells and failed to activate zzso The differences in zzso are supposed to be related not with features of the secondary structure of the zzso but with interactions of side chains of variable zzso acid zzso with lipids and/or membrane zzso
