The zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso protein zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso mediate the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso also interacts with proteins that are not zzso of the zzso zzso system, such as zzso and zzso Here, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain is reported at zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain adopts an zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso However, an zzso and three zzso in the zzso zzso domain are longer than their counterparts in the zzso zzso zzso The differences in these zzso elements are zzso clustered to define a more structured and extended zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso also differ substantially in the length and zzso of the longest connecting zzso More importantly, structural differences between the two zzso zzso lead to drastically different modes of zzso zzso zzso The zzso interface of the zzso zzso domain is defined by the zzso surface in one zzso and the zzso surface in the other zzso whereas for the zzso domain it is defined by either the zzso surfaces or the zzso surfaces in both zzso The zzso interaction of the zzso zzso domain is much more extensive, featuring a larger contact surface area, better shape zzso and more zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain also has the potential to bind two protein partners simultaneously using the zzso and zzso zzso The results of this structural study provide critical insights into how zzso may zzso (or zzso and interact with other regulatory proteins via the zzso zzso
