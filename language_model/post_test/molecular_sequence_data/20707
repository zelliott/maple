We have generated a set of zzso based on the zzso shuttle zzso zzso which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of zzso zzso and other members of the zzso A tandem reporter zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso genes downstream of a zzso site zzso can be used for identification of zzso regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned zzso The ability to detect zzso regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in zzso zzso using the cloned zzso zzso promoter zzso The resulting zzso zzso was used to identify a zzso defective in production of zzso the negative regulator of zzso among a bank of random zzso zzso as well as to detect induction of zzso following exposure of zzso zzso to ethanol or heat zzso zzso carrying the cloned zzso promoter of zzso zzso was functional in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two general expression zzso zzso and zzso which differ in their zzso resistance markers zzso and zzso respectively), were constructed for the zzso Both plasmids have the zzso zzso zzso promoter upstream of the zzso gene and an extended zzso Replacement of zzso with a gene of interest allows zzso and zzso gene zzso as evidenced by expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso rendering the latter zzso zzso
