We compared zzso and zzso the genes zzso the respective zzso zzso factors in zzso zzso The zzso ratio of zzso zzso was low without any stress, unlike that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso stress than the zzso zzso which are also sensitive to zzso zzso We compared the gene expressions of these strains by using a DNA zzso zzso Almost all the genes regulated by zzso were also regulated by zzso but zzso also regulated many genes that were not regulated by zzso including some genes zzso involved in zzso stress zzso The level of zzso the major zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso was significantly low only in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso during zzso was not observed only in the zzso zzso We therefore concluded that zzso is involved in zzso via carbon and nitrogen source zzso
