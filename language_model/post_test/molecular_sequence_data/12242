To evaluate the zzso properties of a panel of human zzso zzso zzso loop zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to be structurally zzso with the tip of the principle zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A panel of 120 zzso six tandem repeat zzso and 60 zzso three zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which the repeating zzso zzso is replaced by zzso zzso Each 20 zzso zzso contains one zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is presented in the native zzso zzso at the crest of each repeating zzso structure of the zzso zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso were compared using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patient zzso zzso effects of zzso interactions were determined using surface zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and linear zzso zzso zzso of three versus six zzso was measured in zzso 

Nine zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso backbone were equivalent to the 36 zzso zzso zzso loop in zzso The 120 zzso zzso induced high zzso zzso zzso M and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso efficiently detect zzso zzso in patient zzso zzso presentation of the zzso is advantageous for higher affinity zzso interactions and for inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso
