zzso growth zzso zzso has been reported as the zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso binding growth factor family, which includes zzso and basic zzso zzso and zzso based on sequence zzso The sequences of human zzso and rat zzso zzso complimentary DNA zzso sequences are zzso zzso zzso is expressed in brown zzso tissue during embryonic development but also shows some specificity for the zzso zzso In spite of the importance of other zzso family members in cardiac zzso there is scant information about zzso zzso As a first step towards exploiting mouse zzso in this regard, we have used reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso based on the zzso sequence to clone the adult mouse zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso of 624 base pairs was zzso Based on sequence analysis, zzso and zzso share at least zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso In terms of other family members, zzso is most closely related to zzso When used as a zzso probe, the zzso zzso detected a single zzso zzso transcript in adult mouse heart zzso The zzso zzso was also used to generate an zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso Using sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and taking into account the zzso tag, an zzso protein of zzso zzso was zzso The generation of cardiac zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein preparation are seen as important tools in the further characterization of zzso expression and function in the zzso zzso
