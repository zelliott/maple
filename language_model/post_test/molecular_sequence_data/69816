zzso zzso zzso were used for detection of zzso DNA segments in the mouse species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Twenty five zzso of 153 rat primer pairs amplified specific DNA zzso when zzso DNA of mice was used as a template in the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso variation among zzso strains of mice was found for 13 DNA segments zzso Eight out of the 13 zzso DNA segments were mapped to a particular zzso with two sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Similarly, mouse zzso zzso were used for detection of zzso DNA segments in rats zzso zzso Twenty zzso of 166 primer pairs amplified specific DNA segments from rat zzso zzso variation among zzso strains of rats was found for seven DNA segments zzso Eleven of these 20 DNA segments were mapped with a rat zzso mouse zzso cell hybrid clone panel and/or linkage analysis by use of zzso zzso Our results suggest that the mapped DNA segments are really zzso between mouse and zzso These zzso DNA segments are useful genetic zzso
