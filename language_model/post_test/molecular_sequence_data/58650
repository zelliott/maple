zzso signal recognition particle zzso and its zzso exhibit a zzso zzso zzso domain, whose predicted secondary structure exhibits a hairpin motif with two zzso zzso Two zzso fragments zzso one (24 zzso or two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso Each zzso binds specifically to the domain of the zzso coli zzso of the zzso zzso which is involved in signal sequence zzso The zzso zzso fragments exhibited a pronounced structural stabilization in the presence of zzso zzso of all base, zzso zzso and most zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso were obtained for the zzso zzso via zzso zzso and correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns permitted a coarse structural description, revealing a relatively compact zzso geometry for the zzso without any indications of zzso zzso zzso zzso or base zzso The zzso is structurally very similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, 1991, Science zzso zzso seems to stabilize the structure of the zzso zzso region, which involves zzso and zzso mismatch zzso zzso from ideal zzso zzso are found for a larger region than the predicted secondary structure zzso Although no explicit assignment effort has been dedicated to the zzso yet, striking similarity in chemical shift changes upon addition of zzso allowed some structural zzso The zzso present in both zzso fragments exhibits a similar, pronounced flexibility in the absence of zzso indicating that the additional zzso in the zzso does not stabilize the other zzso
