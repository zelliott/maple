zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso is the second zzso of the zzso zzso degradation zzso Based on the crystal structure of a related zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been suggested to function as a zzso zzso as for other members of the zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso In this study, substitution of each zzso zzso was examined in zzso At pH zzso turnover numbers relative to zzso zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso increased about zzso relatively little change was observed in the zzso for zzso The zzso zzso which showed little zzso activity at pH 7, was sharply activated by increasing the zzso reaching almost zzso of the activity of the zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso These three zzso are therefore critical for zzso activity, as suggested by the crystal structure and similarity to other zzso family zzso In addition, zzso showed a strong preference for zzso over zzso with a zzso higher specificity constant zzso Evidence is presented that the inefficient use of zzso by zzso might partly be due to the presence of an zzso zzso at position zzso
