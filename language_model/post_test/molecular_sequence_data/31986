The genes of the major zzso complex zzso are attractive candidates for investigating the link between zzso variation and individual zzso We improved rapid amplification of zzso ends to obtain the whole coding sequence of the zzso class zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the most common zzso in zzso We also used zzso walking to characterize the partial zzso adjacent to zzso 3 of the zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequences zzso we designed zzso zzso to investigate the molecular zzso of this species in southeast zzso The zzso class zzso gene showed a high level of genetic diversity, indicating that this species retains a relatively high potential for survival, despite a population decline among zzso species in general and many other zzso
