Previously, we have described the clinical and molecular characterization of a de zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso in size, in a patient with severe zzso zzso zzso and other clinical zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso structure of the human zzso protein gene 1 zzso approved gene symbol zzso a zzso zzso candidate gene for the neurological findings in our patient, and its zzso zzso The human zzso gene was mapped to zzso band zzso by zzso in zzso zzso of zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the 3' region of the zzso zzso spans about zzso zzso of human zzso DNA and is divided into 41 zzso An zzso processed zzso of zzso was found on human zzso band zzso The active locus zzso zzso a predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in zzso and zzso human zzso The zzso zzso zzso spans about 220 zzso of mouse zzso DNA and is also divided into 41 zzso zzso a predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso No zzso could be found in the available mouse sequence zzso Several zzso zzso were zzso Considering the location, expression profile, and predicted function, zzso is a strong candidate for several neurological features seen in zzso deletion zzso zzso we searched for zzso in the coding region of zzso in subjects from a family with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously linked to zzso zzso We identified two novel zzso in the zzso zzso however, they did not segregate only with affected subjects in the predicted model of an zzso dominant disease such as zzso
