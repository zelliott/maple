In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes by binding to a DNA sequence designated the zzso response zzso We generated a series of hybrid proteins of zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to define a zzso induction domain of zzso sufficient to mediate zzso zzso by these hybrid zzso A minimal zzso induction domain, delineated as zzso 301 to 335 of zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso for induction zzso zzso of the three zzso and zzso zzso within the minimal zzso induction domain did not affect zzso zzso indicating that the activity of this domain is not directly regulated by zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of the two zzso or their preceding zzso zzso led to a high level of zzso activity in the absence of zzso and consequently to the loss of zzso zzso This zzso high activity was not affected by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the function of the zzso induction domain is normally zzso in the absence of zzso By zzso analysis, this minimal domain interacts with two negative regulators, zzso and zzso (also designated zzso and zzso and the interaction is abolished by zzso of the zzso The zzso induction domain itself has weak and zzso zzso activity, and its ability to zzso zzso depends on the activity of an adjacent zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso induction domain of zzso mediates zzso induction via a zzso process: the relief of repression and synergistic zzso zzso with another zzso zzso
