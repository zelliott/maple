zzso have a critical role in zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso drugs, but also have the life-threatening adverse effect of causing zzso It is therefore desirable to develop new zzso that do not cause zzso zzso transmit signals zzso zzso zzso activates zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso formation and zzso zzso which requires zzso and greatly expands zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso bind to mutually exclusive but distinct sites within the zzso zzso zzso domain in opposing zzso The first zzso wave mediates zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso but is not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transient zzso zzso and zzso binding to an zzso motif (in which X denotes any zzso which selectively mediates zzso zzso and zzso zzso The second zzso wave is associated with zzso zzso An zzso inhibitor of zzso interaction selectively zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso zzso without affecting bleeding zzso Thus, we have discovered a new mechanism for the directional switch of zzso zzso and, on the basis of this zzso designed a potent new zzso drug that does not cause zzso
