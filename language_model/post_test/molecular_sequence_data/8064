During animal development, cell proliferation is controlled in many cases by regulation of the zzso to S phase zzso Studies of zzso tissue culture cells have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be rate limiting for progression from zzso to S zzso During zzso development, zzso of zzso E is required for zzso arrest in terminally zzso embryonic zzso zzso Whether zzso E expression limits progression into S phase in proliferating, as opposed to zzso cells during development has not been zzso Here we show that zzso zzso E zzso protein is absent in zzso phase cells but appears at the onset of S phase in zzso cells of the zzso zzso lobe and eye zzso zzso We have examined cells in the eye zzso zzso where a clearly defined zzso regulated zzso to S phase transition zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso premature entry of most of these zzso cells into S zzso Thus in these cells, control of zzso expression is required for regulated entry into S zzso zzso a band of eye zzso disc cells in zzso phase was not induced to enter S phase by zzso expression of zzso This provides evidence for additional regulatory mechanisms that operate during zzso phase to limit cell proliferation during zzso These results demonstrate that the role of zzso E in regulating progression into S phase in zzso tissue culture cells applies to some, but not all, cells during zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
