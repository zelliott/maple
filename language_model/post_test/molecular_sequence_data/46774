The zzso zzso resistance determining region was zzso from 13 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso resistant to zzso had zzso zzso a zzso frequently associated with the acquisition of resistance to zzso A mismatch amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol was developed that detects this zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso provides a means for routine detection of the zzso zzso without the need for sequencing the zzso zzso
