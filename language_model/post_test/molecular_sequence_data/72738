zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso transmit signals from membrane receptors to a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso associate with components of the signal zzso system, yet remain membrane attached throughout the cycle of zzso The zzso zzso remain attached to the plasma membrane through a combination of factors that are only partially zzso We now demonstrate that zzso acids within the zzso domain of zzso zzso are involved in membrane zzso We used in zzso translation, a technique widely zzso to characterize functional aspects of zzso and interactions with zzso zzso to demonstrate that zzso acids zzso of zzso contribute to membrane zzso The membrane binding of zzso lacking zzso acids zzso zzso was significantly reduced at all membrane zzso in comparison with zzso zzso Several other zzso zzso of zzso were characterized as controls, and these results indicate that differences in zzso zzso and zzso interactions do not account for the reduced membrane binding of zzso Furthermore, when membrane attachment of zzso and zzso was characterized in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso acids zzso contributed to membrane zzso These studies reveal that membrane binding of zzso zzso occurs by a combination of factors that include lipids and zzso acid zzso These regions may provide novel sites for interaction with membrane components and allow additional zzso of signal zzso
