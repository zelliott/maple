zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso zzso protein import zzso zzso and zzso are the receptors for the proteins zzso respectively, a zzso and a zzso zzso targeting sequence and cycle between the zzso and the zzso zzso belongs to the zzso complex located in the zzso membrane and acts in protein import downstream of zzso and zzso it is therefore required for the import of both zzso and zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso leads to an impairment of zzso commitment in the zzso fungus zzso zzso Here we report that both zzso and zzso receptors are zzso for this commitment but are needed for normal sexual zzso Data suggest also a new role of zzso and/or the zzso complex in addition to their role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso single and double knockout strains analyses indicate that zzso acts as a partial zzso of zzso life cycle zzso Moreover, contrary to zzso zzso zzso and zzso show zzso zzso zzso
