A new truncated zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis has been expressed and zzso zzso alignment of zzso with other zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and the zzso zzso and the B10 positions are occupied by zzso and zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso at the zzso position, surprisingly, is zzso making zzso the first exception in the zzso family that does not contain zzso at this zzso zzso zzso data suggest that a strong hydrogen bonding network, involving the B10 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and CO as evidenced by the relatively low frequency of the zzso stretching mode zzso zzso and the high frequency of the zzso stretching mode zzso zzso The presence of this hydrogen bonding network is supported by zzso studies with the B10 zzso or the zzso zzso zzso to zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate a rigid and polar zzso pocket in zzso which is significantly different from that of zzso the other zzso from zzso zzso The distinct features in the zzso active site structures and the zzso expression patterns of zzso and zzso suggest that these two zzso may have very different zzso zzso
