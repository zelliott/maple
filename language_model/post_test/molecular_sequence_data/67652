zzso E and F regulate diverse zzso functions including gastrointestinal zzso fever induction and zzso This multitude of biological effects is zzso via their four E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and F zzso zzso zzso Majority of these studies was performed in zzso species, while investigations on their roles were zzso by inadequate information on their receptors in avian zzso In present study, full-length zzso of chicken zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso - zzso and zzso - were cloned from adult zzso zzso The putative zzso and zzso share high zzso acid sequence identity with their respective zzso while the predicted zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso which lacks 107 zzso acids between zzso zzso 4 and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso are widely expressed in adult zzso zzso including zzso and zzso Using a zzso zzso reporter system, zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso upon zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso may functionally couple to zzso zzso Upon zzso addition, zzso was shown to potentially couple to zzso zzso zzso by zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso showed no zzso Using a zzso reporter system, both zzso and zzso exhibited potential zzso zzso by zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso characterization of these receptors paved the road to the better understanding of zzso and zzso roles in avian physiology and comparative zzso zzso
