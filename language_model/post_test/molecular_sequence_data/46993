We have recently reported that zzso protein zzso associates with the beta zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cha, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is able to catalyze the zzso of the human zzso protein in zzso which results in a decrease in zzso zzso binding zzso zzso acid analysis indicated that the zzso occurs on zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso deletion zzso indicates that the main zzso zzso are located within two fragments corresponding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso Based on our present results, we suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso is one of the mechanisms that regulates zzso targeting of zzso zzso and/or zzso assembly in the zzso
