Eight zzso zzso closely related to the zzso zzso gene family, have been isolated from a zzso library representing genes expressed in the first zzso human zzso zzso analysis of one clone shows it to be a zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso closely related to three other zzso beta G zzso recently zzso from a term zzso zzso The protein zzso by the zzso is predicted to be less high zzso than those reported previously and differs markedly in the zzso zzso The 3' untranslated region of the zzso is very similar to the equivalent region of beta zzso zzso beta G E except that it contains the zzso repeat sequence found zzso the zzso sequence in zzso and an additional zzso of sequence that appears to be derived from zzso
