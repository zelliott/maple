The zzso zzso complex regulates many of the dramatic cellular zzso observed at zzso Although predominantly zzso during zzso this zzso complex zzso zzso to the nucleus at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso location of zzso zzso reflects zzso albeit slow, nuclear import and much more rapid nuclear zzso In contrast, the sudden nuclear zzso of the complex before entry into zzso reflects a marked increase in the import rate, with a zzso zzso of zzso B1 nuclear zzso These dynamic changes in zzso zzso zzso are regulated by zzso of four zzso within a region of zzso B1 known as the zzso retention sequence zzso zzso of all four zzso is required for rapid nuclear entry, whereas zzso of only the last in the series zzso zzso is required to prevent nuclear export by zzso As these zzso represent key zzso of regulation, it is important to identify the zzso acting on these zzso Here we report that zzso zzso B1 is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso counter to previous speculation, is not required for zzso zzso zzso of the first two of the zzso zzso zzso 94 and zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso Although it was previously reported that zzso 113 is a zzso zzso we were unable to observe zzso of this zzso in isolation by zzso zzso Rather, in contrast to previously published data, we have found that the penultimate zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate a new role for zzso in zzso regulation, identify the zzso zzso zzso and provide a picture of zzso zzso regulation by the zzso action of distinct zzso
