zzso zzso at a locus containing a simple zzso zzso zzso repeat were isolated by zzso zzso zzso from populations of the zzso crab zzso zzso These zzso were zzso to assess zzso variation zzso Thirty-four distinct sequences zzso were identified in a region zzso zzso long that included the zzso zzso In the repeat region itself, zzso varied in zzso values from 5 to 11 across zzso except that a zzso class was not zzso zzso among zzso were due also to zzso at 22 sites in regions immediately zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these regions were used to estimate zzso relationships among zzso and the gene zzso was used to trace the evolution of length variation and CA repeat zzso A low correlation between size variation and zzso relationships among zzso suggests that absolute zzso size (as normally scored in zzso zzso is an unreliable indicator of historical affinities among zzso This finding on the molecular fine structure of zzso variation suggests the need for caution in the use of repeat counts at zzso zzso as secure indicators of zzso zzso
