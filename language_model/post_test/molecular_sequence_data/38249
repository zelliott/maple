The zzso parts of the promoters of the genes for zzso zzso are generally zzso but the promoter of the zzso gene of zzso zzso shows some unusual structural zzso It lacks typical zzso elements characteristic of all the zzso gene promoters described thus zzso We have zzso its functional activity in transgenic zzso zzso A fusion construct between the zzso promoter and the zzso reporter gene was expressed mainly in the central zone of the root zzso but the product was also detected in the zzso root zone and in roots in tissue zzso In roots of transgenic zzso the activity of the promoter was only zzso lower than in zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was also detected in tobacco zzso zzso zzso I has a higher sequence identity to zzso zzso and thus it groups within the zzso zzso zzso
