zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso a disease of significant morbidity and mortality in both human and animals in endemic zzso There is no vaccine towards the zzso available in the market, and the efficacy of many of the zzso surface and zzso proteins are currently being evaluated as vaccine zzso 

With the availability of the zzso zzso whole zzso zzso we undertook to identify genes zzso the known zzso outer membrane protein A zzso Twelve zzso zzso were identified and zzso containing these zzso were fully zzso Of the 12 zzso two of these zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso expressed as soluble protein and zzso Both proteins were zzso by zzso in zzso patients' zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso of zzso and zzso were assessed for their ability to protect zzso mice against zzso zzso zzso Mice were zzso with either zzso or zzso subsequently challenged with zzso colony forming units zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso route, and examined daily for 21 days zzso This pilot study has demonstrated that whilst all control zzso mice died by day 9 zzso two mice (out of 4) from both zzso groups survived beyond 21 days zzso 

We have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso in mice as well as zzso patients and should be further assessed as potential vaccine candidates against zzso zzso zzso
