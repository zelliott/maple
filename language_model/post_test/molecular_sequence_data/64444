To identify genes that are induced by zzso zzso in adrenal zzso cells, we carried out a differential zzso screening of adrenal zzso zzso zzso Some of the clones we identified represented tissue inhibitor of zzso 1 zzso zzso We examined zzso dependence of the expression of zzso in zzso in cultured bovine zzso cells, and in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from cells showed that the level of zzso zzso increases sharply within zzso after zzso zzso Since zzso zzso some cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso type, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso activity in bovine zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cultures to zzso for zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from rat adrenal zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that in both of these zones zzso expression was induced within zzso after zzso zzso zzso (9 zzso treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso levels nearly zzso in zzso zzso Overall, our results show that zzso causes induction of zzso and suppression of zzso activity, and suggest that zzso may zzso the activities of zzso and hence cell zzso zzso
