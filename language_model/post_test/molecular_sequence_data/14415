zzso zzso and DNA zzso play an important role in zzso zzso Many cloned animals showed zzso DNA zzso zzso However, there are fewer reports in cloned zzso because of a lack of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated DNA zzso patterns in zzso islands and zzso zzso regions of putative imprinted gene zzso and imprinted genes zzso zzso and zzso in cloned zzso Five zzso from two cloned zzso died shortly after birth and two normal controls were zzso We observed normal DNA zzso profiles in cloned zzso The imprinted genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso hearts, muscles and lungs of the two cloned zzso exhibited relatively normal DNA zzso except for zzso showing some differences between controls and cloned zzso Our results indicate that zzso cell nuclear zzso sheep exhibited relatively normal DNA zzso pattern and experienced normal DNA zzso zzso at imprinted zzso
