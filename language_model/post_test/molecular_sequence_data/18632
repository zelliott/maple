zzso zzso folate zzso and increases the risk for embryonic zzso However, the interplay between ethanol exposure and embryonic folate status remains zzso To investigate how ethanol exposure affects embryonic folate status and zzso zzso we incubated zzso zzso in ethanol and analyzed embryonic folate content and folate zzso zzso Exposure to zzso ethanol did not change embryonic total folate content but increased the zzso level approximately zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso zzso was increased in both zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso alleviated the zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso Further characterization of the zzso zzso promoter revealed that the zzso promoter zzso was the minimal region required for zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and binding analysis revealed that zzso is involved in the zzso level of expression of zzso but not in zzso zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso was the protein that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso with an approximately zzso increase of zzso promoter activity when zzso in zzso We concluded that zzso of zzso involving zzso helps relieve embryonic zzso stress induced by ethanol zzso
