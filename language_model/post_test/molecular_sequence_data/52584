The zzso protein of zzso virus zzso zzso the replication and segregation of the viral zzso in zzso infected cells and zzso the expression of other zzso zzso proteins through direct interactions with DNA sequences in the zzso zzso origin of zzso zzso To better understand how zzso controls these zzso we have assessed the contribution of various zzso sequences to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso 325 to 376 are responsible for the zzso activity of zzso This region zzso with the DNA looping domain previously shown to mediate interactions at a distance between zzso zzso zzso The same zzso mediate DNA segregation but have no apparent role in DNA zzso indicating that the replication and zzso zzso activities of zzso are zzso The zzso zzso tail of zzso was not found to contribute to zzso zzso or zzso We have also investigated the functional significance of two structural motifs within the DNA binding and zzso zzso of zzso the zzso loop and the zzso zzso Although the zzso acids in these motifs do not directly contact the DNA, both of these motifs were found to contribute to zzso functions by increasing the zzso ability of zzso zzso by which DNA binding is zzso by these motifs are zzso
