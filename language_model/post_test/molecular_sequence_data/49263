Three zzso zzso knockout zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso 2 were generated by zzso replacement from one North American and two European wild type zzso The zzso were characterized by Southern zzso Western zzso and zzso In zzso zzso testing showed that both wild type and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso factors in whole pig zzso To demonstrate the role of zzso during zzso zzso infection, four animal trials were carried out using young zzso Either high dose (4 zzso zzso or low dose zzso zzso zzso live cell zzso was applied to the zzso In one trial, a low challenge dose of North American strain zzso and its zzso zzso zzso strain zzso resulted in acute disease in zzso of pigs exposed to the wild type strain, while zzso of pigs exposed to the zzso strain survived the zzso In the repeat trial, zzso of pigs in wild type group and zzso of pigs in zzso group developed zzso The high dose trial with zzso pair showed that zzso pigs challenged with wild type and zzso of pigs challenged with zzso strain developed disease zzso The third low dose trial, using European strain zzso and its zzso zzso zzso strain zzso showed that zzso of pigs challenged with the wild type strain and zzso of pigs challenged with the corresponding zzso strain developed zzso All the diseased pigs showed fever, clinical signs and developed zzso zzso zzso was isolated from tissue samples such as brain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, heart or zzso zzso zzso zzso against cell surface proteins changed little while the zzso zzso against zzso increased only in the wild type group after zzso sly gene was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein showed 800 zzso units per zzso zzso In zzso study showed that zzso triggered zzso production by human zzso and zzso production by pig pulmonary zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the results of this study suggest that zzso does not seem to be a critical zzso factor for zzso zzso zzso 2 respiratory infection, but by stimulating zzso release it may play a role in innate zzso
