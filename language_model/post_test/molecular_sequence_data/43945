The zzso zzso zzso zzso is unique among the family of G zzso receptors in possessing an unusually large predicted second zzso zzso To isolate the mouse zzso a probe derived from this zzso loop was used to screen a mouse brain zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso an open reading frame of 477 zzso acids was zzso The predicted zzso acid contained four predicted zzso zzso sites and was zzso identical to the zzso zzso acids zzso the coding region of the human zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that this gene was expressed in a variety of mouse tissue and was especially abundant in heart and lung zzso The mouse zzso zzso was used as a probe to isolate a mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the mouse zzso zzso clone was identical to the zzso throughout the coding region, indicating that the zzso is zzso on a single zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso expression zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso cells was zzso in a zzso manner by increasing zzso of zzso zzso with a 50% zzso concentration of 10 zzso Similar to the human zzso zzso rat zzso cells zzso expressing this zzso responded in a zzso manner to zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso with a vigorous calcium zzso
