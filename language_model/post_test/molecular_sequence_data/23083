The coronavirus zzso gene encodes one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso implicated in the zzso processing of the zzso zzso and thus contributing to the formation of the viral zzso complex that mediates zzso zzso Using consensus fold recognition with the zzso zzso followed by model building and zzso we developed a structural model for the single zzso present in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso zzso based on significant structural relationships to the zzso core domain of zzso a zzso zzso zzso By combining the zzso zzso model with comparative sequence analyses we show that all currently known zzso zzso can be classified into two groups according to their binding site zzso One group includes all zzso and some of the zzso which are characterized by a restricted zzso binding zzso This group is designated the zzso The remaining zzso from some of the zzso form the other group, featuring a more open zzso binding site, and is referred to as the zzso This zzso binding zzso zzso is consistent with experimental data accumulated to date for the specificity of zzso zzso processing and zzso zzso It also provides an independent evaluation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites, as well as a basis for comparison with previous groupings based on zzso zzso
