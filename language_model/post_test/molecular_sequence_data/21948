zzso zzso strains zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso characterization with either zzso zzso or sequence analysis allowed to determine the zzso specificity of the zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso as zzso I, that is zzso of a zzso I zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso product of zzso allowed zzso to be characterized further into genetic lineages within the zzso zzso zzso the strains displayed significantly higher similarity (up to zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso level, zzso to human zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso or to the zzso Hungarian zzso human strains zzso designated as lineage V (up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso strain zzso lineage II zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is zzso classified as zzso Interestingly, no zzso zzso resembling the original zzso zzso strain, zzso was zzso while zzso zzso zzso clustered with the zzso zzso zzso human strain zzso By analysis of the 10th and 11th zzso zzso all the strains revealed a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso gene of zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest zzso transmission of zzso strains and/or zzso and may indicate the occurrence of at least 3 separate zzso transmission events between pigs and humans, providing convincing evidence that evolution of human zzso is tightly zzso with the evolution of animal zzso
