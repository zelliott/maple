A zzso was discovered in diseased specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibiting typical zzso zzso zzso amplification of DNA using zzso specific zzso detected zzso DNA in all of the diseased plants zzso No zzso DNA was found in healthy zzso zzso zzso patterns of amplified zzso zzso differed from the patterns previously described for other zzso including six zzso of foreign zzso zzso Based on the zzso the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso was classified as a representative of a new zzso in the zzso zzso zzso group I zzso zzso onion zzso all of the previously reported zzso zzso and related zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences from this and other group I zzso identified the zzso zzso as a member of a distinct zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the class zzso The zzso tree constructed from zzso zzso gene sequences was consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso and its closest known relatives, the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso yellow leaf zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso share a common zzso The unique properties of the DNA from the zzso zzso clearly establish that it represents a new zzso zzso zzso zzso
