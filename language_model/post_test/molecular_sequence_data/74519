Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from rice zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso results indicate they are zzso zzso and zzso zzso in length including complete open reading frame zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso 502 zzso acids and 536 zzso zzso zzso The zzso program suggested that both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso consist of potentially 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to investigate the gene expression patterns of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso transcripts of zzso were higher in source leaf zzso than in other zzso at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of zzso were less traceable in all zzso zzso In zzso zzso both transcripts of these two genes were high in zzso from the zzso stage to 7 days after flowering zzso and then sharply zzso The potential physiology functions of these two zzso zzso are zzso
