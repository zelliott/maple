zzso zzso acid zzso zzso represent a group of high affinity zzso zzso that are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso levels at zzso zzso zzso proteins have been found on zzso as well as on zzso cells where they act zzso to remove the released zzso In issue 81 of the Brain Research zzso Rico et zzso reported the identification and functional analysis of zzso zzso While this publication described several previously unpublished zzso zzso we simultaneously published a study analyzing the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso across zzso zzso Our study revealed several additional zzso family members as well as differences in the zzso grouping of zzso We identified two additional zzso zzso now called zzso and zzso In the present report, we now provide evidence that the zzso gene described by Rico et zzso may rather be an zzso zzso zzso analyses as well as zzso alignments demonstrate that zzso shares characteristics with zzso zzso In addition, comparison of expression of zzso family members localized zzso and zzso predominantly to zzso cells whereas zzso transcripts described by Rico et zzso are as zzso for zzso transcripts enriched in zzso
