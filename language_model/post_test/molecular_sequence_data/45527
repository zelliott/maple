In bacteria, zzso plants, and zzso zzso the aromatics compounds, such as aromatics zzso zzso are zzso through seven zzso from the zzso pathway, which are absent in zzso The absence of this zzso in zzso make them potential targets for development of new therapy against infectious diseases, such as zzso which is the world's second zzso cause of death from infectious zzso The last zzso of zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for conversion of the zzso to zzso Here, we report the zzso structure of zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso structure is similar to other zzso structures, presenting zzso sandwich structural zzso in which each zzso of zzso consists of a central zzso zzso The zzso can be described as a zzso formed by a zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso studies suggest the zzso is a zzso with a more zzso shape than observed on the zzso zzso and the existence of a low equilibrium between zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is concentration dependent and some zzso changes must be involved on that zzso
