The zzso zzso zzso zzso capping zzso is composed of two zzso of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated the alpha zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso In this report, with the aid of partial zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso capping zzso we isolated the zzso designated zzso zzso the zzso zzso capping zzso beta zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes for zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso which is unexpectedly smaller than the size estimated by zzso Gene disruption experiment showed that zzso is essential for zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene product, zzso exhibited an zzso zzso activity which specifically removed the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso but not from zzso zzso confirming the identity of the zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso was also studied by the zzso procedure using zzso zzso as zzso
