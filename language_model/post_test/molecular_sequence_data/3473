zzso and patterns of zzso diversity vary widely among zzso Because zzso species contain duplicated zzso zzso studies of zzso diversity at zzso zzso may facilitate insight into the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated zzso In this study, we describe patterns of sequence diversity from an alcohol zzso zzso locus pair zzso in zzso cotton zzso zzso These data are compared with equivalent information from another zzso alcohol zzso gene pair zzso zzso zzso and Wendel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has an overall slower evolutionary rate than zzso As expected from the predicted correlation between zzso diversity and evolutionary rate, zzso diversity was higher for zzso than for zzso In addition, zzso diversity is higher in the zzso of zzso cotton for zzso confirming earlier observations for zzso These observations indicate that for these two pairs of zzso zzso the zzso hypothesis of equivalent evolutionary dynamics for duplicated genes in zzso cotton is zzso
