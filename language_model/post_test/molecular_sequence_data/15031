For more than 140 years, zzso tube guidance in flowering plants has been thought to be zzso by zzso derived from target zzso However, there has been no convincing evidence of any particular zzso being the true zzso that actually controls the navigation of zzso tubes towards zzso Emerging data indicate that two zzso cells on the side of the egg cell emit a zzso zzso signal to attract the zzso tube at the last step of zzso tube zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso proteins are zzso derived from the zzso zzso We isolated zzso cells of zzso zzso a unique plant with a protruding zzso zzso to identify transcripts zzso zzso proteins as candidate molecules for the zzso We found two zzso abundantly and predominantly expressed in the zzso cell, which are zzso to the surface of the egg zzso Moreover, they showed activity in zzso to attract competent zzso tubes of their own species and were named as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso against the zzso impaired zzso tube attraction, supporting the finding that zzso are the zzso derived from the zzso cells of zzso zzso
