Experimental zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system zzso and has been used as an animal model for study of the human zzso disease, multiple sclerosis zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso of zzso cells into the zzso and by clinical manifestation of zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso is also under genetic control in that certain mouse strains are susceptible to disease induction while others are zzso Typically, zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso basic protein zzso fail to develop zzso zzso This zzso is certainly not due to defects in zzso processing or zzso presentation of zzso as an experimental protocol described here had been used to induce severe zzso in zzso mice as well as other reputed resistant mouse zzso In addition, zzso T cell clones from zzso and zzso mice zzso to zzso had been successfully isolated and zzso The experimental protocol involves using a cellular adoptive transfer system in which zzso zzso zzso zzso donor zzso zzso cells are isolated and cultured for five days with the zzso to expand the pool of zzso T zzso At the end of the culture period, 50 million viable cells are transferred into zzso zzso recipients through the tail zzso zzso mice so treated normally do not develop zzso thus zzso their resistant status, and they can remain normal zzso Ten days post cell transfer, recipient mice are challenged with complete Freund zzso zzso zzso in four sites in the zzso Severe zzso starts to develop in these mice ten to zzso days after zzso zzso showed that the induction of disease was zzso specific as challenge with irrelevant zzso did not induce clinical signs of zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso dose used to challenge the recipient mice showed that it could be as low as 5 zzso In addition, a kinetic study of the timing of zzso challenge showed that challenge to induce disease was effective as early as 5 days post zzso challenge and as long as over zzso days post zzso zzso These data strongly point toward the involvement of a zzso T cell population in maintaining zzso The involvement of regulatory T cells zzso in this system is not zzso
