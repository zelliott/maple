The zzso locus of zzso zzso which was on the basis of its ability to induce zzso in a zzso zzso strain, zzso the mating capacity of this zzso The gene functions required for induction of zzso and repression of zzso could be separated by zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso in the zzso zzso One of them zzso codes for a protein of 119 zzso acids which is required to induce zzso The other zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids that is able to repress zzso Both genes are oriented zzso from a central promoter region, which possesses putative zzso and zzso boxes for both zzso The product of zzso shows no zzso to any known protein and seems to represent a new class of zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso box with zzso to other zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In cells of both mating types, the regions zzso the zzso locus contain sequences with zzso to either zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso From zzso and zzso data we estimate that the zzso region is approximately 2 zzso long and is present only once in the zzso
