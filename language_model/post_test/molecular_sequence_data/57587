A zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso of each zzso nova zzso DNA zzso The zzso by itself binds to zzso zzso The zzso alone does not bind to DNA specifically but interacts with the zzso to form a very stable zzso zzso We show that the formation of zzso zzso complex is extremely zzso Furthermore, the zzso complex zzso has a zzso zzso of much less than 1 zzso addition of the zzso increases the zzso to approximately 100 zzso Libraries of plasmids with random deletions of the open reading frame for the zzso were introduced into zzso coli, and extracts were subsequently checked for both protein expression and zzso activity with or without added zzso The zzso was found to contain two structurally zzso zzso with distinct zzso The zzso two-thirds is necessary and sufficient for zzso DNA zzso The zzso one-third is responsible for zzso zzso When expressed separately in zzso coli, zzso and mixed together, these two zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso two-thirds of the zzso is necessary and sufficient both for zzso interactions and for zzso complex zzso We conclude that the zzso of the zzso zzso like many zzso factors, has zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso
