Two distinct zzso protein zzso zzso and b) zzso were isolated from a carp zzso zzso zzso These zzso contained a full-length open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and b were zzso zzso with 18 zzso zzso and showed a high degree of sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso including the common dual zzso motif of zzso By Northern zzso analysis, the carp zzso were found to be abundant in the brain and zzso zzso study by zzso zzso revealed ubiquitous expression of zzso although expression of zzso was specific to the brain and zzso The high level expression of both zzso and b in the zzso implies that zzso play an important role in egg maturation or zzso early zzso
