zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso with 72 zzso molecular mass and zzso zzso acids plays an important role in the zzso system and the dissolution of zzso clots in human zzso The collective production of this drug in plants such as cucumber, one of the most important vegetables in the world, could reduce its production zzso In this study, after scrutiny of the appropriate zzso of cucumber plant zzso zzso on zzso medium with zzso zzso acid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso 3 zzso zzso hormones, the cloned human zzso gene under the zzso zzso promoter and zzso zzso into zzso zzso was transferred into zzso zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso on the selective zzso the persistence of zzso gene in zzso plants was confirmed by zzso chain reaction zzso with specific zzso To evaluate the zzso gene expression in transgenic plants, zzso was extracted and the zzso gene zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Followed the extraction of protein from the leaves of transgenic plants, the presence of zzso protein was confirmed by dot zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis in order to survey the production of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso test was used for zzso zzso protein level in transgenic cucumber zzso It was counted between zzso and zzso and based on this, it was concluded that the presence of three expressions of regulatory factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal in the construct caused the increase of the zzso gene expression in cucumber zzso
