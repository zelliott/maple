zzso zzso and zzso zzso are responsible for zzso in bovine and zzso species and for zzso fever in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is an important zzso factor and can elicit protective zzso Because of their potential importance in vaccine design and in zzso diagnosis, we developed peptides mimicking the zzso properties of distinctive zzso zzso of zzso zzso These peptides were selected from several zzso display random zzso libraries for their ability to bind zzso zzso directed against the A- or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for two of the isolated peptides zzso after DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso Although these responses were only moderate in extent, these data further suggest the feasibility of using zzso mimics of zzso zzso as zzso a property which may be useful in the design of novel zzso zzso
