The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes an inhibitor zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that blocks them from zzso the zzso protein zzso and prevents exit from the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso and zzso involving zzso occur frequently in zzso zzso that zzso like zzso suppresses tumor zzso An unrelated protein zzso arises in major part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse zzso zzso and its zzso expression in the nucleus of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso phase zzso zzso zzso of coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in zzso zzso and the zzso inheritance of zzso and zzso may zzso their dual requirement in cell cycle zzso
