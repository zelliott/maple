The bacterial zzso trigger factor zzso is the first zzso to be encountered by a nascent protein chain as it emerges from the zzso exit zzso Experimental results suggest that zzso possesses considerable zzso flexibility, and in an attempt to provide an zzso view of this flexibility, we have performed independent zzso molecular dynamics simulations of zzso in explicit zzso using two different simulation force fields zzso and zzso zzso Both simulations indicate that zzso possesses tremendous flexibility, with huge excursions from the zzso zzso caused by zzso of the zzso constituent zzso both simulations also predict the formation of extensive contacts between zzso zzso domain and the zzso 1 domain that is involved in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso however, zzso rapidly settles into a very compact zzso that persists for at least 1 zzso whereas in the zzso zzso it remains highly zzso additional simulations in which the two force fields were swapped suggest that these differences are at least partly attributable to sampling zzso The simulation results provide potential zzso of a number of experimental observations regarding zzso zzso behavior and have implications for using simulations to model zzso function on translating zzso
