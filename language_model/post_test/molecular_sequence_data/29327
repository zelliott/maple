To set the stage for historical analyses of the ecology and behavior of tree swallows and their allies zzso zzso we reconstructed the zzso of the nine zzso species by comparing DNA sequences of six zzso zzso zzso b zzso base zzso the second zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso base zzso zzso zzso II (85 base zzso zzso 8 zzso base zzso zzso zzso base zzso and zzso zzso base zzso The zzso consisted of two main zzso South and Central American species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and North American and Caribbean species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genetic distances among the species suggested that zzso is a relatively old group compared to other New World swallow zzso One interesting zzso discovery was the close relationship between Caribbean and western North American zzso This historical connection occurs in other groups of swallows and zzso as zzso To reconstruct the zzso we employed zzso as well as traditional zzso zzso The zzso approach provided probability values for trees produced from the different genes and gene combinations, as well as probabilities of branches within those zzso We compared zzso and zzso zzso branch support and found that all branches with zzso probabilities zzso or zzso zzso received zzso support zzso
