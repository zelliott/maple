Pulmonary artery hypertension zzso is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery resistance and increased zzso thickness due to deregulation of vascular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso for bone zzso proteins zzso are identified in zzso of familial zzso zzso and zzso of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso reduction in zzso signal by zzso zzso may cause abnormal vascular zzso by promoting zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Here, we demonstrate that infusion of the zzso analog zzso during zzso treatment in rat zzso development of zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso a positive zzso of the zzso zzso that acts by stabilizing the zzso family signal zzso Through induction of zzso zzso promotes the zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by elevated expression of zzso genes and reduced cell growth and zzso zzso activates the zzso gene zzso via zzso of the zzso factor of activated T cell zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is a potential therapy for zzso and zzso
