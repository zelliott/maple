zzso zzso zzso by zzso is generally taken to indicate the presence of functionally important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso is zzso inhibited by zzso and possesses one or more essential zzso groups zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso To map the putative zzso zzso that mediate zzso binding to the zzso from zzso zzso we systematically zzso the 15 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and in zzso to Ala (13 zzso or zzso (2 zzso Six zzso zzso encompassing all 15 zzso zzso of the zzso were characterized in zzso The results revealed that zzso zzso and zzso and/or zzso were important for activity, since zzso at these positions reduced activity by zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, all of the zzso zzso retained the ability to bind a zzso zzso zzso with undiminished zzso and zzso All of the zzso zzso also remained susceptible to irreversible reaction with a zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso Prior reaction of the zzso with the zzso zzso blocked subsequent binding of the zzso zzso indicating that these two zzso bind at a single common zzso These results indicate that zzso binding of zzso zzso can occur by a zzso zzso
