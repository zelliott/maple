The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is a global regulator of zzso that zzso gene expression by zzso or repression at a range of promoters in zzso zzso A major function is to regulate the selection of nutrients required for zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of utilizing zzso zzso and nitrate as terminal electron zzso In the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso is reduced zzso despite nitrate being the zzso more zzso electron zzso Three zzso repeat sequences upstream of the zzso zzso zzso nap zzso reduction in the zzso zzso have high levels of similarity to the consensus sequence for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso In other zzso species a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso has a predicted zzso zzso genes involved in zzso reduction and zzso zzso The presence of zzso consensus sites within the zzso zzso zzso nap promoter prompted a search for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso This revealed the presence of a potential zzso zzso that we predict binds to zzso consensus sites such as those of the nap zzso Furthermore, we predict that much of the core zzso zzso predicted in other zzso species is zzso in zzso zzso
