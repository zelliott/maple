In a previous study, zzso zzso mass zzso was used to analyze the structure of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso of zzso differing in the length of their zzso chains were present at the final stage of zzso In order to determine the origin of this zzso zzso we analyzed by zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso the relative abundance of the different zzso zzso in zzso obtained after each zzso step, and directly in the zzso and in the fat body which produces zzso zzso clearly shows that the zzso procedure had no effect on the zzso zzso chains of zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso as a family of zzso zzso In addition, in these experiments, differential mapping by zzso of the zzso and fat body tissue from zzso and zzso larvae allowed us to detect induced or zzso molecules which may be involved in the immune response of zzso zzso
