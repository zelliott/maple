In zzso active complexes between zzso zzso and zzso the center of the melted region is zzso to the zzso activity of the zzso complex of zzso zzso In the first part of this work, using synthetic zzso and exploiting gel zzso zzso I demonstrate that DNA zzso is not the only zzso of this zzso zzso binding is directly zzso presumably participating in the stabilization of an intermediate required for the zzso In the second part of the work, I show that, from fine analysis of the zzso pattern of zzso promoter DNA towards zzso and zzso zzso it is possible to locate zzso and to characterize its contacts at any time during the early stages of zzso This analysis provides a description of the passage from the zzso zzso to the zzso mode in terms of, first, release of the upstream zzso and second, loss of zzso zzso Occupancy of the overlapping promoter, zzso has a positive effect on the escape of zzso from zzso zzso The involvement of zzso and beta zzso in the zzso pattern is discussed with respect to previous zzso zzso
