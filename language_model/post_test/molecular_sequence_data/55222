We describe the full genetic characterization of an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso mosquitoes collected in zzso This represents the first isolation and full characterization of an zzso from Portuguese zzso The virus, designated zzso for zzso zzso zzso was isolated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, and failed to replicate in zzso zzso cells in common with other zzso The zzso zzso encodes a single zzso with zzso zzso showing all the features expected for those of zzso zzso analyses based on all zzso sequences available to date, place zzso among zzso zzso grouping with recently published zzso partial sequences documented from mosquitoes collected in the zzso Peninsula, and with zzso zzso virus zzso in zzso as a close zzso No zzso sequences were found integrated in their zzso zzso using a range of specific zzso zzso designed to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
