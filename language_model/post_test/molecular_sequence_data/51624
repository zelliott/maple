zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso gene family consists of at least four zzso zzso zzso that zzso signals important in a variety of zzso and zzso processes related to cell growth and zzso Here we have characterized the binding of different zzso to zzso Our results establish an zzso binding profile for zzso with zzso having the highest zzso followed by zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was found to bind to zzso in zzso competition zzso Interestingly, the zzso gene was found to zzso only the zzso zzso in a region where both zzso and zzso show alternative zzso leading to differences in their zzso binding zzso and to zzso forms of these zzso zzso binding to zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso of a set of cellular zzso which differed from those zzso in zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso cells showed a considerably more extensive zzso zzso of zzso than the zzso zzso zzso and functional specificity within the zzso family exemplified by zzso may help to explain how zzso perform their diverse zzso
