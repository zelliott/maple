zzso zzso zzso III encodes 11 autonomously replicating sequence zzso elements that function as zzso zzso The essential zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso that binds the origin recognition complex zzso has been zzso defined for most of these zzso but not for zzso zzso which is one of the zzso zzso In this study, we performed a comprehensive zzso scan analysis of zzso zzso this zzso depends on a zzso match to the zzso that positions the zzso binding site only 6 zzso away from an zzso binding zzso Although a largely inactive zzso on the zzso zzso becomes active if the nearby zzso zzso is zzso We also performed a multiple sequence alignment of confirmed zzso on zzso III, zzso and zzso This analysis revealed a highly zzso zzso motif 17 to 19 zzso from the zzso that is functionally important and is apparent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso elements among the six zzso zzso zzso zzso
