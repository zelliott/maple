zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated at the protein level using zzso zzso This analysis has revealed that the zzso gene encodes two protein zzso a zzso zzso predicted from the sequence of a zzso clone and an additional zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso is observed first at the cellular zzso stage and is not zzso in zzso after 12 zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso protein lags behind that of the zzso zzso and then persists throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso protein is localized to the cell periphery during cellular zzso and zzso The cell zzso zzso is then resolved into zzso stripes along the fully extended germ zzso After the stripes fade, zzso zzso of the majority of cells within the central and peripheral nervous system is zzso The zzso protein was shown to represent the cell zzso form of the protein through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressing a heat shock zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso specific for the zzso protein indicates that the zzso protein is the nervous system zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso proteins are products of the zzso zzso which exhibit different zzso and spatial patterns of expression in the zzso
