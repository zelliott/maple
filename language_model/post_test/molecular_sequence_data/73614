The crystal structure of zzso zzso insulin zzso a virtually inactive analog of insulin, was determined at zzso A zzso In the refined structure model, zzso retains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso as its structural zzso while great zzso changes occur in the N and C zzso of zzso The zzso which lies in zzso in insulin and insulin zzso with high zzso no longer exists in zzso Relative motion is observed among the three zzso each as a rigid functional zzso In contrast, a region covering zzso and zzso exhibits a relatively stable zzso We interpret our results as zzso zzso the importance of zzso in determining the zzso potency of insulin and zzso a leading role of zzso in maintaining the zzso zzso
