The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso A zzso gene cloned in zzso coli was zzso The zzso A gene zzso consisted of zzso zzso which zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with an Mr of zzso The region upstream from the gene was characterized by a putative promoter consensus region zzso zzso a zzso site and zzso start zzso The zzso gene encodes a typical zzso zzso signal sequence which, when fused to alkaline zzso by means of zzso zzso was able to mediate transport of the alkaline zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso of up to 106 zzso from the C zzso of zzso did not result in the loss of zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso genes were not involved in the zzso into the medium of the cloned zzso in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed low overall zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso but significant zzso was detected with other zzso family zzso The zzso zzso K, another sodium zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso with zzso
