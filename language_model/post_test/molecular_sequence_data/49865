zzso zzso strain zzso produces a zzso zzso substance in its growth zzso This zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso and exhibits an apparent narrow range of zzso activity, essentially only affecting growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It remains active over a relatively wide pH and temperature range, showing no loss of activity following heat treatments up to 80 degrees zzso zzso of zzso zzso was achieved using several zzso steps, which resulted in the identification of two peptides with zzso zzso These two peptides were shown to possess identical zzso zzso but different molecular zzso
