zzso nonsense zzso provide a model system to investigate structural and functional aspects of zzso zzso and their genes in zzso To assess the role that zzso zzso sequences may have on the expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso ending in the zzso sequence or zzso sequence of a cloned human zzso amber zzso zzso gene were zzso The zzso expression of these zzso genes was examined by zzso in zzso cells and by measuring the efficiency with which they were able to suppress an amber zzso nonsense zzso in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region up to zzso position zzso with respect to the first zzso of the coding region had no effect on levels of nonsense suppression as compared to the zzso zzso however, deletion to zzso led to a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso up to zzso did not further reduce suppression zzso zzso of the zzso region up to 9 zzso downstream from the consecutive T zzso termination site resulted in only a slight reduction in functional zzso zzso In in zzso competition studies, the zzso deletion clone was less able to compete out the activity of a second zzso zzso gene than was the zzso corresponding zzso suggesting that the upstream region plays a role in the formation of active zzso complexes in zzso These results imply that the human zzso zzso gene contains an upstream regulatory region located between positions zzso and zzso that plays a positive role in modulating expression of this gene in zzso
