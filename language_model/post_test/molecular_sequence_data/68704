A single form of zzso exists in the zzso zzso to respond to the unique zzso zzso which specifies this zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the corresponding zzso which generate potential nonsense zzso zzso have been generated in zzso and tested in zzso for biological zzso The amber zzso and zzso zzso zzso show strong and weak activities respectively while the zzso zzso zzso has no zzso biological zzso To understand the basis for these differences, a set of synthetic zzso genes has been constructed to permit in zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of transcripts corresponding to the normal and zzso zzso zzso parameters for zzso of these transcripts by zzso zzso zzso zzso have been measured and compared to values observed using the naturally occurring zzso as a zzso The efficiency of zzso is reduced by 40, 2000, and 30,000 fold by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso change affects only zzso binding while zzso also alters zzso zzso We conclude that both zzso and zzso are major identity elements in the recognition of zzso by its zzso zzso These differences in zzso efficiency closely parallel the in zzso zzso activities of the zzso
