We determined the primary sequence of zzso zzso zzso C2 by sequencing its cloned structural zzso zzso The zzso structural gene contains an zzso open reading frame which encodes a zzso precursor with a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by removal of the signal zzso contains 239 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso A sequence comparison between zzso C2 and zzso C1 showed that the 167 zzso zzso acids in both toxins were zzso zzso In contrast, the 72 zzso zzso were zzso zzso This provides additional evidence that zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso toxins determine shared biological activities and zzso zzso
