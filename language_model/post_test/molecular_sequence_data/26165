We have characterized the structure and expression of transcripts zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gamma 3 heavy chain gene in certain zzso zzso The transcripts initiate upstream of the switch gamma 3 region, generating a zzso zzso that is spliced to C gamma 3 zzso zzso of this zzso transcript is induced when zzso B cells or zzso zzso cell lines are cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to these zzso zzso cultures dramatically zzso induction of the zzso gamma 3 zzso zzso of zzso gamma 3 transcripts occurs before the increased zzso of gamma zzso cells and zzso 3 zzso in cultures of zzso B zzso These data provide further evidence that zzso zzso zzso units are important components in the regulation of heavy chain zzso In addition, the zzso cell lines that we describe represent the first example of permanent cell lines that regulate expression of the zzso gamma locus in response to zzso plus zzso treatment in a manner analogous to normal B zzso therefore these lines should represent an excellent model system to further study the molecular mechanisms by which zzso expression is regulated by these zzso
