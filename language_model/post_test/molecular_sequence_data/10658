In an attempt to characterize an unusual zzso strain isolated from a 2-year-old Somali patient with zzso we applied various molecular methods not previously used for the zzso zzso of zzso This zzso designated zzso did not differ from zzso tuberculosis in the zzso tests and in its zzso zzso zzso but produced smooth and glossy zzso which is highly exceptional for this zzso This smooth zzso was unstable and switched zzso to a rough colony zzso with a low zzso The two colony types were equally virulent for the guinea zzso exhibiting characteristic zzso zzso Both zzso had shorter generation times than the zzso tuberculosis reference laboratory strain zzso and clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso isolate differed from all zzso tuberculosis complex strains described thus far by having only a single copy of zzso sequence zzso an unusual composition of the direct repeat zzso and a characteristic zzso zzso and zzso This zzso had previously been observed only in a smooth isolate of zzso tuberculosis obtained in 1969 by zzso in zzso Analysis of the zzso strain showed that it shared virtually all genetic properties characteristic of zzso distinguishing these two strains from the known zzso tuberculosis complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The natural zzso host range, and mode of transmission of the group of bacteria described in this paper are presently zzso This study, partly based on not previously used molecular criteria, supports the idea that the established members within the zzso tuberculosis complex and the newly described zzso grouping should be regarded as a single species, which likely will be designated zzso zzso
