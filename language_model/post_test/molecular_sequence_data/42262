zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso modified zzso zzso duplex, zzso zzso a site of zzso substitution is designated with the symbols zzso was achieved by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso phase zzso time zzso zzso correlation zzso In contrast to the parent zzso zzso sequence zzso which has been shown to exist entirely in the duplex zzso zzso under comparable conditions zzso zzso zzso the zzso analogue forms a hairpin zzso However, the duplex form of the zzso zzso can be stabilized at lower temperatures, higher salt and strand zzso The solution structure of the zzso duplex was calculated by an zzso hybrid relaxation zzso method zzso combined with zzso zzso restrained molecular zzso These backbone modified compounds, potentially attractive zzso zzso agents, are often assumed to possess similar structure as the parent zzso acid zzso zzso the refined structure of the zzso duplex shows a significant zzso from the parent zzso zzso zzso An overall bend and unwinding in the zzso duplex is zzso The structural distortion of the zzso duplex was confirmed by comparison of zzso parameters and groove zzso zzso the zzso twists of the zzso zzso zzso significantly from the parent zzso zzso The minor groove zzso of zzso duplex zzso varies between zzso and zzso A which is much wider than those of the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso The larger minor groove zzso of zzso duplex contributes to the unwinding of the backbone and indicates that the duplex has an overall zzso zzso in the region surrounding the zzso zzso
