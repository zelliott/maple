The structural gene for human zzso growth factor zzso a member of the zzso growth factor family, consists of three coding zzso and two zzso typical of other zzso growth factor zzso A portion of the zzso zzso located on zzso 15, is amplified to approximately 16 copies in the human zzso and these highly related copies (which consist of zzso 2, zzso 3, the zzso between them, and a 3' zzso segment of the zzso zzso are dispersed to multiple human zzso The zzso sequences are zzso active, zzso regulated in various zzso and composed of three distinct classes of coding sequences that are zzso divergent from each other and from the authentic zzso zzso Multiple copies of zzso genes were also discovered in the zzso zzso of zzso and gorilla but were not found in lesser apes zzso Old World monkeys zzso green monkey and zzso mice, or zzso The pattern of evolutionary occurrence suggests that a primordial zzso gene was amplified and zzso dispersed subsequent to the divergence of orangutan from African apes but before the zzso divergence of human, zzso and gorilla 5-8 million years zzso The appearance of a zzso active and zzso dispersed zzso zzso family may have implications in the evolution of the great apes and zzso
