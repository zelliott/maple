We have cloned the nap locus zzso the zzso nitrate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso with this zzso deleted is unable to grow under zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso shows that in contrast to the zzso strain, the level of synthesis of the zzso and zzso zzso is not increased by the addition of zzso Growth under zzso conditions and induction of N oxide zzso synthesis are both restored by the presence of a zzso containing the genes zzso the nitrate zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not possess an efficient zzso nitrate zzso and that nitrate is not the direct zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso In contrast, we show that zzso zzso the synthesis of the nitrate zzso
