We cloned two zzso genes from zzso zzso One zzso zzso is related in sequence to the family of zzso zzso genes previously identified in a number of plant species zzso zzso The second zzso zzso zzso represents a class of zzso zzso zzso 2) related in sequence to the symbiotic zzso genes of zzso and zzso The properties of these two zzso suggest that the two families of zzso zzso may differ in function from each other and from the symbiotic zzso zzso is zzso in both roots and zzso leaves, by low oxygen zzso zzso zzso has an oxygen affinity so high as to make it unlikely to function as an oxygen zzso zzso is expressed at a low level in zzso leaves and is low zzso zzso protein has a lower affinity for oxygen than zzso but is similar to zzso in having an unusually low, zzso oxygen zzso
