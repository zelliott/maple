zzso blood zzso involves numerous zzso most of which are the result of gene zzso that occurred early in zzso evolution and after the divergence of zzso As such, the zzso of the zzso fish zzso and zzso offer the best possibility for finding systems that might have a reduced set of the many zzso factors observed in higher zzso The most straightforward way of zzso these factors may be through whole zzso zzso In this regard, the zzso Trace database ( zzso ) for the zzso zzso zzso contains more than 18 million raw DNA sequences determined by zzso shotgun zzso The data are estimated to be about zzso zzso indicating that coverage is sufficiently complete to permit judgments about the presence or absence of particular zzso A search for 20 proteins whose sequences were determined prior to the trace database study found all zzso A subsequent search for specified zzso factors revealed a zzso system with a smaller number of components than is found in other zzso in that factors V and VIII seem to be represented by a single zzso and factor IX, which is zzso a zzso of factor VIII, is not zzso Fortuitously, after the completion of the survey of the Trace database, a draft assembly based on the same database was zzso The draft assembly allowed many of the identified Trace fragments to be linked into longer sequences that fully support the conclusion that zzso have a simpler zzso scheme compared with other zzso The data are also consistent with the hypothesis that a zzso zzso or other large scale block zzso occurred after the divergence of zzso fish from other zzso and allowed the simultaneous appearance of a second set of two functionally paired proteins in the zzso zzso zzso
