zzso play a key role in essential cellular zzso A deeper understanding of zzso molecular processes is hampered by the difficulty of incorporating foreign zzso acids into zzso zzso of most zzso species import zzso zzso Based on this natural process, we describe here a powerful shuttle system to zzso several types of zzso into isolated zzso We demonstrate that this tool is useful to investigate zzso processing or zzso editing in plant zzso Furthermore, we show that the same strategy can be used to address both zzso and zzso to isolated zzso zzso We anticipate our novel approach to be the starting point for various studies on zzso zzso Finally, our study provides new insights into the mechanism of zzso import into zzso
