The cellular slime zzso zzso zzso contains a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which is composed of two zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as a probe, a zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso expression zzso By hybrid selection of the complementary zzso and its translation in zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso both zzso zzso With the positive zzso as a probe, we isolated a series of overlapping zzso clones covering the coding region of both zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso in bacteria and sequence analysis showed that the zzso zzso are identical in zzso acid zzso zzso except that the small zzso is missing 37 zzso near its N zzso zzso analysis suggested that the two zzso transcripts are derived from a single zzso The zzso half of each zzso is rich in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and contains a large block of zzso zzso The zzso half has an zzso zzso zzso identity zzso with functionally conservative zzso with two zzso zzso by a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
