Groucho and zzso are members of a zzso family of zzso repeat proteins that interact with specific zzso factors to repress target zzso Here we show that zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso affect a motor zzso trait that also depends on zzso a zzso protein that controls zzso specificity in zzso zzso In zzso zzso VA motor zzso assume the pattern of synaptic input normally reserved for their zzso sister cells, the zzso motor zzso the loss of normal input to the zzso produces a distinctive backward movement zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the fifth zzso repeat in zzso zzso the zzso movement zzso zzso an zzso acid change zzso to zzso in the sixth zzso repeat of zzso is a strong zzso of zzso and of specific zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso expression in the VA motor zzso specifies the zzso pattern of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is also expressed in the zzso and that zzso activity in these zzso is sufficient to restore normal movement to zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso function together to prevent expression of genes that define the zzso pattern of synaptic zzso and thereby generate connections specific to the VA motor zzso In addition, we show that the zzso repeat zzso of zzso and of the human zzso zzso are functionally interchangeable in VA motor zzso which suggests that this highly zzso protein domain may also specify motor zzso identity and synaptic choice in more complex nervous zzso
