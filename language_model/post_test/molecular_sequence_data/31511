During a survey of zzso associated with zzso insects, 69 strains in the zzso zzso and related zzso were isolated from zzso and zzso zzso and the decayed wood inhabited by zzso The majority of these zzso was found to be capable of zzso zzso and was recognized as zzso zzso or its close relative zzso zzso which are known to be associated with zzso zzso and rotten zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also frequently zzso The remaining six strains were identified as representing four novel species in the zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso sequence analyses of nuclear zzso genes and four zzso zzso as well as other zzso zzso Two zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a zzso with zzso zzso and related zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso can survive at 40 zzso which is a rare property among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a sister zzso of zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA sequence comparisons in this study suggest that the zzso zzso needs to be circumscribed to the species near zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that can be characterized by the ability to zzso zzso
