zzso alcohol zzso zzso plays a role in many zzso zzso including the zzso of zzso to zzso the zzso step in the synthesis of zzso zzso Recent molecular genetic studies on human zzso genes has lent support to a zzso role for zzso in zzso acid zzso A region in the promoter for the human zzso gene was previously shown to function as a zzso acid response element zzso prompting an hypothesis for a positive feedback mechanism for controlling zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso contains three direct zzso repeats which constitute the critical zzso of zzso present in other zzso We compared the zzso zzso to zzso present in other genes and determined that a region containing two zzso motifs separated by 5 zzso was sufficient for regulating gene expression in tissue culture zzso Our experiments also indicate that zzso gene expression is zzso by zzso hormone zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The region of the zzso promoter containing the zzso was found to harbor a negative zzso hormone response zzso zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso and zzso hormones suggests that zzso plays an important role in zzso acid zzso
