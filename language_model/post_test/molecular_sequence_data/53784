This work presents a full zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso DNA and zzso zzso built by zzso zzso based on previously solved complete structures of DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the template proteins show high sequence zzso which indicates that they are evolutionary zzso However, they are zzso different: zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of template zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso The model developed in this work will be a good starting point and valuable help in designing zzso experiments to better understand the biological function of zzso and the process of domain zzso
