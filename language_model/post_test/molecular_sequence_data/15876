The maternal zzso D7 is a moderately abundant transcript in zzso zzso whose expression is highest in, and perhaps restricted to, zzso and early zzso The zzso sequence of cloned D7 zzso was determined and shown to have the capacity to code for a zzso zzso This zzso acid sequence was searched against a protein data base, and no zzso proteins were zzso zzso directed against D7 recognize in zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein with an apparent molecular weight on zzso gels of zzso The D7 protein is absent from zzso and first begins to accumulate during zzso zzso Its levels are highest during the first day of embryonic development and then zzso D7 protein was not detected in adult zzso D7 zzso was selectively destroyed by injection into zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of injected zzso by Northern and Western zzso showed zzso zzso and subsequent degradation of the D7 zzso and the failure of the D7 protein to accumulate during zzso zzso The loss of D7 protein affects the maturation process itself, significantly delaying the time course of zzso zzso zzso Thus, D7 is a newly described protein involved in zzso zzso
