Although zzso gene products are zzso zzso zzso mice display selective abnormalities in zzso development, suggesting a certain requirement of the zzso gene products during zzso zzso To gain insights into the mechanisms of zzso zzso regulation, we isolated the zzso clones which are composed of four zzso and one zzso zzso and span approximately 16 zzso The promoter region of zzso gene lacks a zzso box, and primer extension analysis showed several zzso initiation sites, a feature that characterizes zzso zzso The transient zzso zzso using the zzso region zzso zzso revealed that both positive zzso and negative zzso regulatory segments control zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, contribution of a certain segment to promoter activity was different between zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis of the zzso spanning the positive regulatory segments showed that the segment zzso played a critical role in the zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso although other segments within zzso to zzso also appeared to be zzso zzso analysis using the zzso zzso failed to demonstrate a single zzso responsible for the zzso promoter activity, suggesting that zzso promoter requires the interaction of multiple regulatory zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso demonstrated a highly specific complex comprised of a positive regulatory segment zzso and putative zzso zzso which might be necessary for the zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso
