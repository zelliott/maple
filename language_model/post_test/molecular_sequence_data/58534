The complete DNA sequence of the Smith strain of zzso zzso zzso was determined from zzso DNA by using a zzso shotgun zzso The zzso has an overall zzso content of zzso consists of zzso zzso and is arranged as a single unique sequence with short zzso terminal direct repeats and several short internal zzso zzso similarity to the zzso of the zzso human zzso zzso strain zzso is zzso particularly for 78 open reading frames zzso by the central part of the zzso There is a very similar distribution of zzso content across the two zzso zzso toward the ends of the zzso zzso zzso tandem zzso of zzso zzso zzso arranged as two gene zzso The left end encodes 15 zzso that represent one family, and the right end encodes a different family of 11 zzso A zzso zzso of cellular major zzso complex zzso class I genes is located at the end of the zzso opposite the zzso zzso class I zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occur in positions zzso with two zzso and zzso of the four putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of all of the known zzso zzso in zzso are present in the zzso zzso including the zzso gene zzso whose product zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the assembly protein zzso
