zzso zzso mice spontaneously develop type I zzso The disease starts with T cells zzso the zzso of zzso We therefore examined the zzso zzso zzso V beta region repertoire in zzso infiltrates from individual female zzso mice from 4 to 10 week old by zzso chain reaction zzso using V beta zzso beta 17 specific zzso The study revealed a limited zzso of zzso V beta transcripts with a predominance of V beta 1 at the onset of zzso zzso at 4 weeks of zzso The zzso zzso beta sequences of the V beta 1 zzso fragments were identical in most of the individual zzso Among several different mice, similarities in the zzso regions were zzso In contrast, a large zzso of zzso V beta usage was found in mice with advanced zzso zzso from 6 weeks of age zzso Thus, these data suggest a limited zzso of zzso V beta usage with a predominance of V beta 1 at the initiation phase of the zzso
