An zzso zzso of zzso was zzso from bovine red zzso The protein was characterized as regards the kinetic parameters and zzso acid zzso A simple and rapid sequencing strategy, based on a few experiments, was used for reconstructing the primary structure of the zzso since the zzso procedure gave a very low zzso The length of the zzso chain is 100 zzso zzso with the analogous human zzso indicates that the primary structure is about zzso zzso The presence of two additional zzso at the zzso zzso confirms the zzso for this region found in other zzso
