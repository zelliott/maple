In the tilapia, zzso zzso sex is determined by genetic factors zzso but temperature can also influence the zzso sex zzso zzso temperatures of 35 degrees C can generate functional male zzso if applied before and during sexual zzso The genes and mechanisms by which temperature acts on the cascade leading to sex differentiation have been zzso Two strategies have been zzso 1) Search for novel genes by differential display, and 2) zzso studies of candidate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were reared at 27 degrees C zzso zzso and at 35 degrees C zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using differential display, we isolated a 300 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso northern analysis revealed a zzso zzso transcript in 35 degrees C treated females and zzso but hardly any expression in natural females (27 degrees zzso zzso zzso established a zzso increase in zzso expression in 35 degrees C zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in natural males (27 degrees zzso with higher levels detected in those reared at 35 degrees zzso Furthermore, we have analyzed as a candidate gene the zzso zzso an important zzso zzso zzso Low levels of expression were found in natural zzso This zzso with low zzso of 11 zzso in the zzso before and during zzso sex zzso Higher expression levels of zzso were detected in male zzso at 35 degrees C but levels in zzso males were similar to those found for natural zzso Previous results reported that expression of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso can also stimulate the expression of other zzso
