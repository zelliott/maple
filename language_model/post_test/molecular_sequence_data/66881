zzso also known as superficial zone protein or zzso has many distinct biological functions, including zzso zzso and as a regulator of cell zzso This study investigated zzso in canine musculoskeletal zzso using zzso and zzso One or more zzso were noted in canine zzso zzso zzso zzso tendon, Achilles tendon, zzso tendon, zzso zzso anterior cruciate ligament zzso knee lateral collateral ligament zzso zzso cartilage, zzso muscle, and zzso We found 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso with larger sizes were identified in zzso tendon, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was distributed both on the tissue surfaces and at the interface of fiber zzso within zzso but this distribution varied by tissue zzso We conclude that zzso is present in many zzso variations in zzso and physical distribution suggest that the zzso of zzso may play different roles in different zzso
