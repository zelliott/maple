The detection of zzso zzso in tumor zzso genes is critical to their zzso as well as to the development of diagnostic zzso Most approaches for zzso screening of zzso specimens are complicated by the fact that zzso are zzso and that zzso zzso are difficult to interpret in the absence of information about protein zzso We describe a novel method using zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso in any gene of zzso The zzso coding sequence is inserted by zzso zzso into a zzso zzso fusion zzso and zzso are zzso for growth in the absence of zzso The high efficiency of zzso zzso in zzso ensures that both zzso are represented among zzso and achieves separation of zzso which zzso subsequent zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso The specificity of zzso initiation of the zzso gene leads to minimal zzso activity in zzso harboring an inserted stop zzso and hence to reliable distinction between specimens with zzso zzso and those with a zzso zzso zzso This zzso stop zzso zzso accurately detects zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene in patients with early onset of breast cancer and in the zzso gene in patients with familial zzso zzso This approach offers a rapid and reliable method for genetic diagnosis in individuals at high risk for zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso
