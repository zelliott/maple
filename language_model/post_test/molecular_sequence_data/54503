zzso zzso amplification zzso is an innovative technique that allows the rapid detection of target zzso acid sequences under zzso conditions without the need for complex zzso The development, zzso and clinical validation of a zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene for the rapid detection of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso specific detection of zzso zzso zzso type strains and clinical zzso was demonstrated, with no zzso with other zzso zzso or with a comprehensive panel of other common human zzso The lower limit of detection was 6 zzso gene copies zzso in 48 zzso with positive reactions readily identifiable visually via a simple color zzso Higher copy numbers could be detected in as little as 16 zzso When applied to a total of zzso clinical zzso the zzso zzso in comparison to a conventional zzso based real-time zzso chain reaction system demonstrated a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso The zzso method represents a zzso sensitive, and highly specific technique for the detection of zzso zzso and has the potential to be used as a zzso molecular test and in resource-poor zzso
