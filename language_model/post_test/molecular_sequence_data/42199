zzso zzso zzso contribute to increased pulmonary vascular zzso in inflammatory lung injury, but the mechanism of their action is zzso In the present study we examined possible effects of zzso zzso on the zzso of pulmonary zzso cell zzso grown on zzso filter zzso and exposed continuously to a zzso pressure of 10 zzso zzso zzso and serum free zzso zzso zzso zzso with 30 zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso presence of zzso were zzso the zzso were passed through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell ratio of zzso and more) increased zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso to zzso within zzso zzso At the same time the zzso reflection zzso decreased from zzso to zzso Phase contrast and scanning zzso showed a widening of zzso zzso The effects of the zzso zzso were blocked zzso by zzso of human zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso On quantitative grounds highly zzso zzso was similarly active as zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso were inhibited by zzso with zzso or heat, but not with zzso The data suggest that zzso is an effective and sufficient zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso zzso appears to act primarily zzso and not as a zzso zzso
