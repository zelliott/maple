zzso viral assembly and transport of viral DNA into nucleus for zzso essentially involve zzso protein zzso The zzso of interaction of Cotton Leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso coat protein zzso with DNA was studied by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso The zzso zzso with zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a sequence zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso zzso type zinc finger motif composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso resulted in reduced binding to DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed the least binding with approximately zzso fold loss in the association rate and a three order magnitude decrease in the binding affinity as compared to zzso The zzso interactions via the zinc finger motif could play a crucial role in virus assembly and in nuclear zzso
