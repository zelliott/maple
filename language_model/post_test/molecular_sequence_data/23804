We have isolated and zzso the genes zzso the membrane bound zzso B zzso and the transferring binding protein B zzso of the salmon pathogen zzso zzso The results of the sequence revealed two open reading frames that zzso proteins with calculated molecular weights of zzso and zzso The deduced zzso sequences of both proteins show a significant zzso to the respective protein from zzso related zzso zzso sequences coding the zzso and zzso regions of zzso and a sequence of zzso base pairs zzso the zzso region of zzso have been expressed in zzso zzso The strong zzso response zzso by these proteins in mouse confirmed the zzso properties of the zzso zzso A similar response was zzso by both proteins when injected zzso in Atlantic zzso The present data indicates that these proteins are good candidates to be used in zzso to study the protective immunity of salmon to infection by zzso zzso
