DNA zzso is vital for proper zzso structure and function in zzso zzso zzso removal of the zzso that catalyze DNA zzso results in defective zzso zzso zzso X zzso dosage compensation, and zzso zzso This zzso modification is interpreted by zzso binding domain zzso zzso zzso proteins respond to zzso DNA by recruiting zzso zzso zzso and other zzso repression factors to the zzso The zzso protein is zzso for animal zzso but it is implicated in the genesis of colon zzso Here we report that the zzso protein is controlled by zzso zzso We identify the protein zzso zzso zzso that catalyze this modification and show that zzso zzso zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso complex formation, reduces zzso repression complex formation, and zzso the zzso repression function of zzso in zzso Our report provides a molecular description of a potential regulatory mechanism for an zzso protein family zzso It is the first to demonstrate that protein zzso zzso participate in the DNA zzso system of zzso zzso
