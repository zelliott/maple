zzso zzso by zzso zzso was investigated according to the hypothesis that zzso zzso can breakdown zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso showed relatively high zzso activity compared to other zzso zzso zzso cloning of a zzso gene was performed in order to determine whether zzso zzso possesses an zzso zzso and resulted in the isolation of zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to 840 zzso acids zzso zzso has a zzso zzso Family 10 zzso zzso domain, zzso family 4 zzso binding domain and novel zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis implies that this gene has common zzso origin with other zzso genes of animal zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso revealed that zzso is likely to be expressed in the zzso cells in the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is produced in the same site as previously reported zzso zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso gene of this zzso The occurrence of an zzso zzso gene in addition to zzso genes in zzso zzso strongly supports our hypothesis that this species can decompose zzso structural zzso
