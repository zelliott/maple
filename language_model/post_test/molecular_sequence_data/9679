zzso in the delayed zzso zzso channel zzso zzso have been identified as responsible for both zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso inherited long zzso zzso We report the molecular cloning of a human zzso zzso that is expressed in several human zzso including zzso zzso studies revealed that the association of zzso with another zzso zzso zzso a channel responsible for the zzso current involved in zzso zzso zzso Six RW and two zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso All the zzso except zzso fail to produce functional zzso channels and reduce the zzso current when zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, in both zzso the main effect of the zzso is a zzso suppression of zzso zzso The zzso zzso have a smaller zzso effect, in agreement with the fact that the disease is zzso The zzso zzso forms a functional channel when expressed with zzso but with altered gating zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso is strongly shifted to more positive values, and zzso zzso are zzso This finding indicates the functional importance of a small positively charged zzso region of the zzso structure where two RW and one zzso zzso have been found to take zzso
