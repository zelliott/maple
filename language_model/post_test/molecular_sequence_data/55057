zzso zzso are zzso sequences that separate zzso in zzso genes and are removed from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Their origin has remained a mystery in biology since their discovery because zzso gains seem to be zzso in many zzso zzso Although a few recent zzso gains have been reported, none of the proposed gain mechanisms can convincingly explain the high number of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here we report on particular zzso zzso that share high sequence similarity and are reminiscent of zzso zzso These elements multiplied in unrelated genes of six zzso zzso and account for the vast majority of zzso gains in these zzso zzso Such zzso elements zzso contain all typical characteristics of regular zzso zzso zzso but are longer and predicted to harbor more stable secondary zzso However, dating of zzso events showed that they zzso in sequence and length within 100,000 years to eventually become indistinguishable from zzso We suggest that zzso not only account for zzso gains in six zzso but also in ancestral zzso to give rise to most zzso by a yet unknown zzso zzso
