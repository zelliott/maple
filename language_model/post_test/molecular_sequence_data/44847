Two types of zzso editing have been reported in the zzso of zzso extensive insertions of zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso strain of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso have a specific zzso zzso that promotes fusion of zzso We examined the editing of transcripts derived from the zzso zzso For analysis, we selected three regions of the zzso including a DNA zzso that corresponded to missing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso DNA zzso no zzso editing of the transcripts of the zzso zzso was zzso Our results suggest that the mechanism of zzso of the zzso zzso is independent of that of zzso indicating that the zzso has a different evolutionary origin from the zzso
