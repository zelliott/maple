The results of empirical studies have revealed links between zzso and zzso such as the frequent correlation between zzso a and bulk bacterial abundance and zzso Nevertheless, little is known about possible links at the level of specific zzso zzso To investigate this issue, seawater microcosm experiments were performed in the northwestern Mediterranean zzso zzso was used as a zzso means to induce zzso zzso dominated by different zzso zzso exposed to turbulence became dominated by zzso while small zzso gained importance under still zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene fragments showed that changes in zzso community composition were followed by shifts in zzso community zzso both as changes in the presence or absence of distinct bacterial zzso and as differences in the relative abundance of ubiquitous zzso zzso of zzso bands showed that four zzso zzso were present in all zzso The zzso with a higher proportion of zzso were characterized by four zzso of the zzso zzso two affiliated with the family zzso and two with the family zzso Two other zzso zzso were characteristic of the zzso zzso together with one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of published zzso zzso zzso gene sequences confirmed that members of the zzso are remarkably responsive to zzso zzso indicating these bacteria could be particularly important in the processing of organic matter during such zzso Our data suggest that quantitative and qualitative differences in zzso species composition may lead to pronounced differences in zzso species zzso
