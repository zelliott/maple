The zzso virus zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso is a functional zzso of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family and contributes substantially to the zzso potential of zzso through zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso are a class of small zzso molecules that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, development, and zzso and have recently been linked to cancer zzso Through zzso zzso analysis, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the expression of several cellular zzso including the most highly regulated of these, zzso zzso reverse zzso analysis confirmed induced expression of zzso by zzso Analysis of zzso expression in zzso zzso type III and type I cell lines revealed substantial expression of zzso in type III (which express zzso but not in type I cell zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso predominantly through two zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter and identified a role for an zzso site in zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso analysis of cellular zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso with an zzso zzso identified genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by zzso including a group of zzso genes that are inhibited by zzso Since zzso is known to be induced by agents that activate the zzso response zzso (including zzso these results suggest that zzso functions in a negative feedback loop to zzso the intensity and/or duration of the zzso zzso
