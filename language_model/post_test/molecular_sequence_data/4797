Using a new zzso raised against the mouse zzso we have identified and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel plasma membrane protein with an zzso zzso domain, five zzso segments zzso two short zzso zzso and two large zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences from zzso zzso predict the existence of a protein with the same features, suggesting that zzso is zzso between zzso and zzso zzso is found not only in the zzso but also in various other zzso of the mouse zzso In the adult zzso zzso has been detected in the brain zzso layer, and in kidney zzso In these zzso zzso is specific to the zzso surface, where it is selectively associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso upon expression in zzso cells, zzso is zzso localized to plasma membrane zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso These observations imply that zzso contains information to be targeted to, and/or retained in, plasma membrane zzso rather than the zzso cell zzso Moreover, our results show that the mechanisms underlying targeting of membrane proteins to zzso of zzso cells and to plasma membrane zzso of zzso cells are highly zzso
