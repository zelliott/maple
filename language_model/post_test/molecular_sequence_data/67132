An zzso zzso avian influenza virus zzso first appeared in the live bird marketing system zzso in the zzso United States in zzso Since then this lineage of virus has become the zzso zzso of zzso isolated from the zzso and has been linked to several costly commercial poultry zzso Concern for this low zzso isolate mutating to the highly zzso form has remained high because of the increasing number of basic zzso acids at the zzso zzso zzso site, which is known to be associated with increased zzso of zzso To address the risk of low zzso zzso zzso virus mutating to the highly zzso form of the virus, we generated a series of zzso viruses that have changes in the sequence at the zzso zzso site by using zzso reverse zzso We confirmed that a zzso zzso at -5 position from the zzso zzso site could be changed to a basic zzso acid, producing a virus with five basic zzso acids in a row at the zzso site, but with no increase in zzso Increased zzso was only observed when additional basic zzso acids were zzso We also observed that the virus preferred the zzso instead of zzso at the zzso position from the zzso site to manifest increased zzso both in zzso and in zzso Using helper zzso reverse zzso where only one zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso is used, we identified specific zzso zzso site sequences that were zzso incorporated into the low zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso viruses were highly zzso in zzso This study provides additional evidence that zzso avian influenza viruses require an zzso event to become highly zzso as compared to zzso viruses that can become highly zzso strictly by zzso or by zzso
