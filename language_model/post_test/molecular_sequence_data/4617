In the zzso zzso of zzso zzso eight mosaic open reading frames arose by zzso of fragments duplicated from one or more zzso zzso These zzso represent zzso zzso suggesting their derivation from zzso DNA rather than zzso Five of the zzso reading frames contain the information for the zzso of the original zzso and zzso upstream zzso These observations suggest that the generation of novel open reading frames in plant zzso can occur rather easily by chance extensions of duplicated gene zzso The presence of so many mosaic open reading frames in the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that such zzso sequences interfere only occasionally and zzso with the peak zzso performance presumably required during zzso zzso and usually do not cause a zzso male sterile zzso
