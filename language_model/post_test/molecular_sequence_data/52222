zzso canine kidney zzso cells deliver zzso zzso and zzso proteins directly to the appropriate zzso We are investigating the molecular signals on a model plasma membrane zzso zzso IV zzso Most newly zzso rat liver zzso is delivered directly to the zzso surface of zzso zzso zzso however, about zzso is delivered first to the zzso surface and reaches the zzso surface via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hubbard, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A soluble form of zzso zzso containing only the zzso domain of the protein was efficiently transported and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso If this domain contains zzso sorting information, we would expect zzso of the soluble protein to be zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso of the zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso The high efficiency of zzso zzso suggested that the zzso domain and zzso tail of zzso might contain competing zzso targeting zzso To test this hypothesis, we investigated the trafficking of a zzso in which the zzso tail and zzso zzso of zzso were joined to zzso an zzso protein which should not contain sorting zzso This protein was delivered predominantly to the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso domain of zzso carries dominant zzso sorting information while the zzso domain and zzso tail of the zzso contains competing zzso sorting zzso
