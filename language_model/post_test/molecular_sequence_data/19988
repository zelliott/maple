The gene of zzso an zzso zzso has been cloned from the zzso fish, zzso zzso From the first zzso initiation site, the zzso fish zzso gene extends zzso zzso to the end of the 3' untranslated region and contains four zzso and three zzso A predicted zzso zzso consists of three zzso a signal zzso zzso zzso a mature zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso (35 zzso The shortage of zzso motif in the zzso of zzso fish zzso and the similar gene structure between zzso zzso and zzso may indicate that they are derived from the same zzso zzso We thus suggest that zzso should be used as a zzso for these zzso peptides in the zzso The zzso fish zzso zzso was abundant in zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso by real-time zzso chain zzso After stimulation with zzso zzso zzso a marked increase in transcripts was observed in most zzso indicating that zzso is not only a zzso expressed zzso but also has an increased response to bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso fish zzso exhibited different zzso activity against different fish bacterial zzso especially against species of zzso which may to certain extent reflect the zzso of these zzso
