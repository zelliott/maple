Linear zzso disease is characterized by circulating zzso zzso recognizing basement membrane zone zzso including an zzso filament zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned the mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso organization of the corresponding gene zzso and determined its zzso zzso We have also characterized the promoter region of zzso and examined its zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene consists of 10 zzso spanning approximately zzso zzso of the mouse zzso on zzso 1, and Southern analysis suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso The coding region comprises zzso zzso and encodes a zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 59 zzso The deduced zzso contained two putative zzso and two zzso sites, and sequence analysis predicted a zzso signal zzso The zzso upstream region demonstrated the presence of consensus zzso for zzso and zzso and was zzso rich, consistent with zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed expression in cultured zzso but not in zzso with the zzso transcript being approximately zzso zzso in zzso A significant level of expression was also noted in the kidney and zzso and to a lesser degree in the liver, zzso and zzso zzso is a novel component of the basement zzso and may function in contributing to the stability of the association of the zzso layers with the underlying zzso
