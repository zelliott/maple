A novel zzso method has been developed for the identification of six commercially relevant zzso shrimp species in raw and processed food zzso The method can be completed within 8 zzso To implement the method, zzso amplification with the zzso zzso targeted to the amplification of a zzso 181 zzso region of the zzso b zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso was coupled to restriction analysis with zzso zzso and zzso The method was also applied successfully to the identification of shrimp species in complex processed foods, including this type of shellfish as an zzso food zzso The small size of this molecular target zzso amplification from fresh, frozen, or zzso samples, where DNA fragmentation may be relevant and zzso size zzso We also report the first zzso zzso sequences described to date for the species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and these nearly zzso current knowledge of reference zzso sequences in this zzso region for this group of zzso The zzso zzso gene may also be considered as a molecular marker for identification and zzso purposes in zzso shrimp zzso
