zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that creates a hole in the egg zzso envelope zzso through which the zzso swims to fuse with the zzso The dissolution of isolated zzso by zzso is species zzso zzso comparisons show that the most divergent region of zzso is the zzso segment of zzso zzso which is always zzso The zzso and three internal segments are moderately variable between species, but not species zzso Analysis of zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso rapidly by positive zzso selection, suggesting that there is zzso value in altering its zzso acid zzso The results reported here, in which segments of zzso were exchanged between two species, prove by direct zzso that the zzso variable zzso play major roles in the zzso recognition between zzso zzso and the egg zzso
