A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso appears to play a key role in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso Also an zzso from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells has been zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso Kriz, zzso zzso zzso Shaffer, zzso zzso zzso and Jones, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report zzso that the cloned zzso zzso is equivalent to the mouse zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso fragments from zzso cells using zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso revealed a high degree of zzso between the mouse and zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso acid levels zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the two proteins was further demonstrated by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, an zzso generated against the zzso zzso recognized the zzso cell zzso and gave similar molecular masses (about 83 zzso for the two zzso under the same experimental zzso Further, the zzso zzso has exactly the same sensitivity to zzso by a variety of compounds previously shown to inhibit the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso modification of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is dependent on active zzso as is the zzso zzso Finally, both zzso have the same specific activities under identical experimental zzso
