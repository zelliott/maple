Human zzso omega 1 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is a recently discovered protein structurally related to zzso and zzso the biological activities of zzso 1 and its zzso role are not known to zzso We have zzso zzso 1 from preparations of human zzso zzso derived from peripheral blood zzso induced with zzso virus, by two sequential cycles of zzso zzso affinity zzso The resulting protein was at least zzso pure as determined by zzso high performance liquid zzso and showed an Mr of zzso upon sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that only about zzso of the molecules have the zzso zzso expected on the basis of the sequence similarity to zzso whereas the others contain two additional zzso zzso This difference probably results from variable zzso of the zzso by the signal zzso No evidence for zzso zzso was zzso Essentially all zzso 1 molecules are zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction of the Mr to zzso zzso using several plant zzso indicated the presence of zzso complex zzso containing zzso zzso Two major zzso were observed upon zzso with zzso points of zzso and zzso The specific zzso activity of zzso zzso 1 zzso on human cells was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to that of other human class I zzso potent zzso activity was also observed on cells of bovine and zzso but not of zzso or zzso zzso
