zzso genes are plant genes specifically activated during the formation of zzso zzso on zzso zzso These genes are interesting to study since they are not only induced in a specific zzso fashion by signals coming directly or indirectly from the zzso zzso but are also expressed in a zzso zzso By examining the expression of zzso zzso genes in transgenic zzso plants it has been shown that zzso specific expression is zzso by DNA sequences present in the 5 upstream region of several zzso zzso Here we zzso the available data on these zzso elements and the zzso factors interacting with zzso We also review experiments designed to identify zzso zzso which may play a role in zzso specific gene zzso
