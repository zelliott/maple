zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso have made major contributions to our understanding of the molecular structures of zzso zzso including zzso formed by the zzso zzso associated with Alzheimer's disease, by proteins associated with zzso zzso and by a variety of other zzso Because solid-state zzso techniques can be used to determine zzso distances (both zzso and zzso place constraints on backbone and zzso zzso angles, and identify zzso and zzso zzso full molecular models for zzso zzso can be developed from solid-state zzso data, especially when supplemented by zzso structural constraints from electron zzso and other zzso In addition, solid-state zzso data can be used as experimental tests of various proposals and hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of zzso formation, the nature of intermediate structures, and the common structural features within zzso zzso This review introduces the basic experimental and conceptual principles behind solid-state zzso methods that are zzso to zzso zzso reviews the information about zzso structures that has been obtained to date with these methods, and discusses how solid-state zzso data provide insights into the molecular interactions that stabilize zzso structures, the generic propensity of zzso chains to form zzso zzso and a number of related issues that are of current interest in the zzso zzso
