In contrast to adult zzso which have limited capacities for zzso adult zzso undergo zzso cellular turnover during zzso and are even able to zzso a whole brain after zzso This enormous plasticity derives from zzso stem cells residing in the zzso body in large zzso It is still obscure how these stem cells are programmed for differentiation into specific cell lineages and how lineage identity is zzso Here we identify a zzso zzso factor of crucial importance for zzso zzso In addition to patterning defects that are zzso on the zzso zzso zzso factor gene zzso which is expressed with zzso at anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso results in zzso specific loss of zzso zzso zzso during zzso Besides its expression in terminally differentiated zzso zzso we found zzso in stem cell progeny committed to the zzso zzso Also, intact zzso zzso animals gradually lose zzso zzso a zzso that depends neither on increased zzso nor on stem zzso turnover or zzso into other zzso We propose that zzso is a terminal zzso gene for zzso zzso in zzso that controls not only their maturation but also their identity by regulating the expression of the zzso production and transport zzso Finally, we made use of this function of zzso and compared the zzso of zzso zzso with and without functional zzso zzso identifying at least three new zzso targets of zzso
