The zzso family of zzso plays a critical role in the execution of zzso However, efforts to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which zzso induce cell death have been greatly hindered by the lack of systematic and broadly zzso strategies to identify their zzso Here we describe a novel expression cloning strategy to rapidly isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso during zzso Small zzso pools zzso 100 clones each) are zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso these labeled protein pools are then incubated with zzso extracts from control and zzso zzso zzso pools zzso proteins that are specifically zzso by the zzso extract and whose zzso is prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso are subdivided and zzso until a single zzso is zzso Using this approach, we isolated a partial zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso and demonstrate that full-length human zzso is zzso by zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, zzso is zzso rapidly during zzso and zzso zzso in zzso by zzso or a closely related zzso Both of the major zzso zzso sites of zzso in zzso lie within its regulatory domain, suggesting that its activity may be zzso by zzso
