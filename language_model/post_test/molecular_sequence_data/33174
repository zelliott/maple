A zzso short zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in Beijing, zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso plates were zzso convex and zzso to zzso The strain grew in the presence of up to 1 % zzso zzso 0 % zzso Growth occurred at zzso degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was shown to belong to the class zzso being closely related to zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were summed feature 7 zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso and the zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso Based on comparative analysis of zzso and zzso data, it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
