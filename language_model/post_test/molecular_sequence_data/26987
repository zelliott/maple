We investigated the effect of chronic exposure to zzso aromatic zzso zzso on DNA zzso states zzso of zzso zzso zzso in Polish male zzso zzso workers and matched zzso zzso states of zzso promoters zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of zzso and zzso repetitive zzso as surrogate measures of global zzso were zzso by zzso in peripheral blood zzso zzso DNA zzso was evaluated in relation to zzso exposure, assessed by urinary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, a critical genetic damage from zzso We also evaluated whether zzso DNA zzso states were in turn associated with zzso in zzso an indicator of zzso zzso
