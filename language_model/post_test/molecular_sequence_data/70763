zzso zzso regulating zzso 1) was identified as a zzso protein that binds to zzso an zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso Together with six other putative zzso from a number of organisms, these proteins define a new protein zzso family that we have named the Ark zzso Lack of both zzso and zzso resulted in the formation of large zzso zzso zzso and severe defects in cell zzso These defects were rescued by zzso but not by zzso versions of the zzso zzso levels of either zzso or zzso caused a number of zzso and cell zzso defects that were not observed when the zzso versions were zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to zzso to zzso cortical patches, making these two zzso the first signaling proteins demonstrated to be patch zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may be downstream zzso of signaling pathways that control zzso patch organization and zzso Furthermore, results of zzso analyses suggest that zzso and zzso function in overlapping but distinct pathways that regulate the cortical zzso zzso
