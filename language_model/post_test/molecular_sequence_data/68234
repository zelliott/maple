zzso of two genes in the zzso gene family is controlled by zzso regulation in rice cultured zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso in rice cultured cells are zzso related to the concentration of sugar in the culture zzso Other genes in the rice zzso gene family have little or no expression in cultured zzso these expression levels are not controlled by zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene fusion was metabolically regulated in the transgenic rice cell line zzso just as the zzso zzso gene is zzso An zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells demonstrated that zzso expression is zzso when sugar is present in the culture medium and induced when sugar is removed from the zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter that was linked to the coding region of the zzso reporter gene thus contains all of the regulatory sequences necessary for zzso regulation of the zzso
