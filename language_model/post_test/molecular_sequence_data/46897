Previous zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso or VIII, using zzso and hybrid zzso suggested that the requirement for import into zzso might significantly restrict the scope of this test for compatible zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso domain of zzso zzso contains all known characteristics of a zzso targeting zzso whereas in zzso VIII such a signal is absent from the zzso domain, but possibly present in an internal region of the zzso Despite the fact that the characteristics of a zzso import signal are found in the zzso of all known zzso zzso in zzso import experiments show that the protein of human origin is not imported into zzso zzso In zzso import can be zzso however, by replacement of the zzso part of the human protein by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicating a requirement for zzso zzso Similar experiments were performed with zzso VIII and zzso zzso including a hybrid protein in which the zzso of the bovine heart zzso was replaced by that of zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to import this hybrid zzso in contrast with the bovine zzso zzso itself, indicates that for zzso VIII also the zzso in contradiction of theoretical predictions, contributes to the targeting zzso most likely via zzso zzso Our findings expose the limitations of the currently available criteria for prediction of the presence and location of a zzso targeting sequence and highlight the necessity of performing separate import studies for interpreting zzso studies as long as the zzso characteristics of the import signals have not been zzso
