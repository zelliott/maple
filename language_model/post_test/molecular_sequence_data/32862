zzso zzso are a class of mobile genetic elements containing two similar long terminal repeats zzso Currently, zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso mainly through the conventional zzso searching zzso zzso it is limited to zzso known zzso 

In this paper, we report a de zzso zzso method that can identify new zzso zzso without relying on a library of known zzso Specifically, our method identifies intact zzso zzso by using an approximate string matching technique and protein domain zzso In addition, it identifies partially deleted or solo zzso using profile Hidden zzso Models zzso As a result, this method can de zzso identify all types of zzso zzso We tested this method on the two pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso studied using conventional zzso zzso Comparing with previous work, we identified new intact zzso zzso and new putative families, which may imply that there may still be new zzso that are left to be discovered even in well-studied zzso To assess the sensitivity and accuracy of our method, we compared our results with a previously published method, zzso which predominantly identifies full-length zzso zzso In zzso both methods identified comparable number of intact zzso zzso But our method can identify nearly all known elements in zzso zzso while zzso missed about 1/3 of zzso Our method also identified more known zzso zzso than zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We also identified some zzso zzso in the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have not been completely zzso In contrast, the conventional method failed to identify those zzso Finally, the zzso and zzso zzso of the identified elements are zzso 

We report a novel method for de zzso identification of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with favorable performance over the existing zzso
