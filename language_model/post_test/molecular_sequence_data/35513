zzso constitute one of the largest and ancient zzso zzso within the domain bacteria and are well known for their secondary zzso zzso variation in the zzso properties, zzso size and zzso content of the members of this zzso has been zzso zzso the placement of new or existing species based on zzso zzso gene sometimes becomes problematic due to the low zzso zzso In the present study, zzso of zzso zzso zzso was reconstructed using single gene and whole zzso based zzso Where zzso zzso method was found to be more zzso the zzso of 94 proteins improved the resolution which all single gene based zzso failed to zzso The comprehensive analysis of 94 zzso proteins resulted in a total of zzso zzso sites, which is so far the largest zzso obtained for this zzso But the ultimate resolved zzso was obtained by generating a consensus tree by combining the information from single gene and zzso based zzso The present investigation clearly revealed that the consensus approach is a useful tool for zzso zzso and the zzso affiliations must be based on this zzso The consensus approach suggested that there is a need for zzso amendments of the orders zzso and zzso
