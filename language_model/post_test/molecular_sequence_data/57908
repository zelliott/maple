We have isolated zzso zzso the alpha and beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso The proteins zzso by these two zzso are zzso identical to the corresponding zzso of bovine and rat zzso and show regions of zzso with proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso expressed in zzso coli from a zzso coupled zzso had kinetic properties similar to those of zzso isolated from bovine zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding indicated that while neither individual zzso was capable of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso analog could be specifically zzso to the beta zzso of zzso zzso To further analyze zzso zzso and to detect functional similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso acid changes zzso to those found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made in the zzso of human zzso zzso in either the alpha or beta zzso that decrease the activity of zzso zzso zzso were also observed to impair human zzso zzso analyses showed that these zzso human zzso have zzso and zzso values that are altered with respect to zzso human zzso
