zzso exposure of zzso beta cells to elevated zzso zzso leads to decreased insulin gene zzso The reduction in expression is accompanied by diminished binding of a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso that interacts with two zzso elements within the zzso zzso control region of the insulin zzso In this study we examined whether zzso zzso to the recently cloned insulin gene zzso factor zzso a zzso protein whose expression is restricted to the nucleus of zzso cells of the zzso and zzso We found that an zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex formed from zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated a reduction in zzso zzso and protein levels that closely correlated with the change in zzso binding in zzso cells chronically cultured under zzso zzso zzso The reduction in zzso expression in these cells could be accounted for by a change in the rate of zzso gene transcription, suggesting a zzso control zzso In support of this hypothesis, no zzso zzso accumulated in zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso The only zzso species detected was a zzso zzso zzso species that zzso with zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso represents an zzso zzso precursor and that zzso of this zzso is defective in these zzso Overall, this study suggests that reduced expression of a key zzso regulatory factor, zzso contributes to the decrease in insulin gene zzso in zzso cells chronically cultured in zzso zzso zzso
