zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso is a major cause of zzso failure and is characterized by the formation of many zzso zzso in the zzso It is a systemic disorder that is caused by zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso of these genes at the cellular level, by a zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso formation but does not seem to be the sole mechanism for zzso We have generated a novel mouse model with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso This selection cassette causes zzso zzso of zzso 1, yielding only zzso normally spliced zzso transcripts in the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are viable, showing zzso enlarged zzso zzso This is in contrast to zzso zzso mice, which are embryonic zzso and zzso zzso mice that show only a very mild zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso mice showed zzso of pancreatic and liver zzso zzso and the mice had cardiovascular zzso zzso features similar to the human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso restored the zzso of zzso zzso These results show that a reduced dosage of zzso is sufficient to initiate zzso and vascular defects and indicate that low zzso gene expression levels can overcome the embryonic zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso We propose that in patients reduced zzso expression of the normal zzso below a critical level, due to zzso environmental or zzso factors, may lead to zzso formation in the zzso and other clinical features of zzso
