zzso is a hormonal protein involved in energy zzso that acts to inhibit food zzso to stimulate energy zzso and to influence insulin zzso zzso and sugar zzso Its action is zzso by a specific zzso whose zzso is highly zzso As a member of the zzso zzso zzso it has been predicted to be activated by zzso zzso However, recent evidence has indicated that this zzso exists as a zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Here, the zzso has been used to measure the zzso and zzso of the interaction between the zzso and its zzso Human or mouse zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso region of zzso were captured on to the sensor via protein zzso zzso data fitted to the simplest zzso zzso The observed zzso at zzso zzso was zzso zzso the binding mode and the reaction zzso allowed us to conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is not induced by zzso zzso This contradicts the common paradigm of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, data demonstrated a zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for human zzso with its zzso zzso Similar results were observed for the affinity of different species of zzso binding to mouse zzso zzso
