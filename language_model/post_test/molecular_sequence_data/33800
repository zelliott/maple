zzso factors are essential healing initiators participating in zzso zzso and tissue zzso especially on the surfaces of the gastrointestinal zzso This family has been cloned and characterized predominantly from zzso and zzso Avian species zzso stone and grit to help digest food, which may expose their gut to severe physical zzso To further the understanding of the function of the zzso gene family across species, we undertook this research to zzso zzso and characterize the zzso expression patterns of chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region and deduced zzso acid sequence demonstrated that zzso contained unique zzso specifically the chicken promoter has multiple start sites and the protein contains a series of zzso zzso Unlike zzso where zzso is detected primarily in the stomach, and occasionally in the zzso zzso chicken zzso transcripts are found throughout the gastrointestinal zzso with major expression sites in the zzso and muscular stomach as well as evident expression in the zzso small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso transcripts by quantitative zzso showed high levels in zzso and a trend of constant expression during embryonic and zzso development, with a reduction occurring around zzso zzso analysis highlighted the conservation of zzso proteins and functional divergence of zzso zzso which suggest a transitional role in the bird during zzso
