The genes zzso zzso toxin zzso the major zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso are carried on zzso zzso resident in all known zzso zzso The zzso genes are expressed only during zzso growth of these temperate zzso We cloned the gene zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined the DNA binding and zzso regulatory activities of the zzso zzso zzso Typical of nearly all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to three sites in zzso right operator zzso Also zzso when bound at zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso at the zzso promoter and a zzso at the zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso left operator zzso contains only two zzso binding sites, but the zzso zzso still efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction requires zzso of the zzso DNA binding zzso In all zzso examined thus far, this zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso event, with zzso occurring precisely in an zzso zzso sequence that is found within a zzso zzso region that joins the two zzso of these zzso However, zzso zzso protein contains neither an zzso nor an alternative zzso zzso zzso site anywhere in its zzso zzso We show here that the zzso occurs at a zzso zzso Thus, the specificity of the zzso zzso site is more variable than thought zzso
