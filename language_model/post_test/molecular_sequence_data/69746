zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso of zzso zzso with Ki zzso 22 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso modification of the zzso with a zzso of approximately 1 zzso zzso The reaction of zzso zzso with zzso also generated two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was stable at pH 2, 8, and 10 and stable to treatment with zzso Following zzso zzso of labeled zzso two labeled peptides corresponding to zzso of the zzso were isolated and zzso The results demonstrated the presence of a single modified zzso zzso zzso mass zzso suggested that the modified zzso acid is zzso which is linked to the inhibitor in an unprecedented zzso
