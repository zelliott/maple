zzso variation is usually high within zzso and differentiation is usually low among populations of zzso zzso zzso As a result, population contraction causes little change in the degree of genetic diversity and differentiation among zzso The aim of this work was to determine whether or not a recent population decline has influenced the zzso frequency spectrum and association among zzso of different sites on the nuclear zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the oak species zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 122 sequences from 18 populations were randomly sampled and analyzed in this zzso zzso showed that zzso variation was generally high within zzso and differentiation was very low among zzso zzso diversity was slightly reduced in samples taken from the area with a recent strong reduction in population zzso Nevertheless, the zzso frequency spectrum was skewed toward rare zzso and the association among zzso of different sites was significantly more zzso within these samples compared with those from the area without such a population size zzso This pattern was robustly supported by zzso zzso
