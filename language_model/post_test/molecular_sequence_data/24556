The zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was studied in zzso cells by zzso zzso Double zzso using mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso proved that zzso is localized in the zzso zzso The result was confirmed by the expression of zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein in the zzso in the same cell zzso zzso treatment proved zzso to be a zzso zzso Seven zzso deletion zzso were constructed to ascertain the zzso region relevant for zzso zzso The expression of each zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso and zzso Only the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso region, failed to be retained in the zzso after zzso zzso The other six deletion zzso in which either the basic region, the complete zzso pair domain, the two zzso motifs zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plus the zzso region is deleted, were localized to the zzso The zzso sequence within the zzso region is discussed as a novel zzso retention zzso
