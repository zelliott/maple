Different organisms produce different species of zzso zzso each with its own distinctive zzso These differences in length are commonly exploited in microbial zzso The side chain length of zzso is determined by the nature of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso To determine if the side chain length of zzso zzso has any distinct role to play in the metabolism of the cells in which it is found, we cloned the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso and expressed it in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene encodes a zzso protein which has similarity (27 to zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso coli and the zzso zzso resulting from a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso Both zzso coli and zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene mainly produced zzso zzso which resulted in the synthesis of zzso without any noticeable effect on the growth of the zzso Thus, it appears that zzso can replace the function of zzso in zzso coli and zzso in zzso zzso Taken together with previous results, the results described here imply that the side chain length of zzso is not a critical factor for the survival of zzso
