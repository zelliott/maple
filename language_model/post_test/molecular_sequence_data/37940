The zzso zzso zzso sequencing project zzso et zzso Nature 390 (1997) zzso identified zzso as a gene that potentially encodes a zzso class A zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of a zzso zzso fusion showed that zzso expression is zzso and is controlled predominantly by the zzso zzso factor zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso zzso extension analysis identified two zzso start sites located 26 and 27 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso located in the zzso and zzso regions relative to the zzso start sites showed good zzso to the consensus sequences for promoter elements of zzso zzso An zzso zzso in zzso had no significant effect on growth, zzso and zzso and zzso spores had normal zzso zzso structure, and zzso and outgrowth zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso coli resulted in cell zzso
