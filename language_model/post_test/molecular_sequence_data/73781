zzso zzso zzso assignments have been obtained for starch zzso using zzso and zzso experiments by comparison with the zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These assignments are valuable for the location and evaluation of the substitution pattern in modified zzso The bulk of the zzso zzso zzso of highly zzso starch strongly resembles the spectrum of zzso zzso in which all zzso are identified and display distinct chemical zzso The resolving power of the zzso experiment allowed the distinction of minor spin zzso zzso these strong signals pertaining to an average zzso linked zzso unit in an infinite chain, the combination of zzso and zzso experiments allowed the identification of these systems to the zzso zzso zzso and to partially zzso zzso zzso As an example, two different preparations of starch zzso with degrees of substitution zzso and zzso were zzso In one case, zzso demonstrates that the defects of zzso are random on the zzso chain (with corresponding signals for zzso secondary zzso positions at delta zzso and zzso while in another case, these signals are not zzso probably due to the presence of clusters of zzso zzso forming zzso zzso
