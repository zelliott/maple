zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso As a result of its activity, structural interactions among cell wall components during cell wall turnover and loosening are zzso In plants, zzso are typically zzso by a gene zzso This family has been studied in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to investigate the role of distinct zzso genes during fruit zzso and zzso By a combination of a zzso library screening and zzso four different zzso zzso zzso termed zzso to zzso have been zzso zzso expression of each zzso gene in various zzso and during fruit development was revealed by northern zzso zzso is specifically expressed in fruit, showing an increasing expression during the zzso process up to a maximum in the turning zzso zzso hormone regulation, zzso treatment increased zzso zzso levels in green fruit, whereas zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels in ripe and zzso zzso It is proposed that this repression of zzso expression could be involved in textural changes occurring during fruit zzso
