Human zzso zzso coli zzso produces a type IV zzso termed zzso which is zzso on large plasmids in association with colonization factor zzso zzso and zzso A zzso 7 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso with an zzso probe designed from the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso 22 zzso structural zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso DNA sequencing analysis revealed an open reading frame, designated zzso whose predicted zzso acid sequence matched perfectly the zzso sequence of zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso is the first gene described of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed a zzso protein of 236 zzso with a calculated mass of zzso zzso The zzso is apparently processed into a mature zzso of 206 zzso with a calculated mass of zzso zzso The predicted zzso sequence of zzso showed zzso and 37% identity to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso between zzso and zzso was more prominent towards the zzso zzso than within the zzso zzso Like other type IV zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso analysis of zzso strains expressing either zzso or zzso detected zzso differences between native and zzso zzso of these zzso In addition, differential regulation of zzso expression was identified when zzso strains were grown in different zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso are two distinct but yet highly related type IV zzso of zzso
