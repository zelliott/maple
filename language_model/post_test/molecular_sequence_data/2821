The large envelope zzso protein of zzso is the viral surface protein that contains zzso zzso We have zzso the E protein of the West Nile zzso zzso for zzso zzso generated from linear segments of the zzso if effective, these might allow the synthesis of peptides suitable for zzso For this study we used the E protein and defined fragments zzso as zzso in zzso The zzso thus zzso containing zzso to E protein as shown by Western zzso zzso were tested for zzso activity by the plaque reduction zzso zzso If the E protein used as zzso was reduced (the native E protein contains six zzso zzso and zzso the resulting zzso did not consistently demonstrate zzso zzso These results show that the E protein of zzso virus does not contain a linear segment that is able to induce zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso E protein fragments containing zzso of the intact zzso bridges showed that the local zzso primary structure of the protein involved in each of the six bridges was also insufficient for inducing the synthesis of zzso zzso The complete E zzso with all six zzso bridges intact, zzso by zzso zzso under the conditions used in our experiments could, however, induce the synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso These data indicate that at least one complex zzso which is able to induce zzso zzso is not completely zzso or can be reformed to some extent if the complete E protein has been subjected to zzso without prior destruction of the zzso zzso
