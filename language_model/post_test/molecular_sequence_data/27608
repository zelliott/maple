A novel zzso zzso was isolated from a rat lung zzso zzso library by zzso with the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of this clone was zzso and zzso similar to rat zzso and zzso zzso it was, therefore, designated zzso as the third member of the rat zzso zzso zzso demonstrates only zzso zzso acid similarity with zzso Interestingly, this zzso also shared zzso and zzso zzso acid similarities with human zzso and a mouse testosterone 15 zzso zzso respectively, indicating that these zzso are zzso counterparts to rat zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso cell hybrids, revealed that the zzso gene is localized on mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in rat zzso and its level was induced zzso by treatment of rats with zzso No zzso zzso was seen in the liver, zzso or zzso even after long exposure of Northern zzso filters to X-ray zzso In contrast, the zzso mouse and human zzso genes are expressed in zzso
