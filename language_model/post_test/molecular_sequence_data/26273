zzso is expressed in various zzso of the rabbit under complex hormonal zzso In the zzso the zzso gene is transcribed only in zzso cells after administration of zzso zzso In this paper we demonstrate that within the promoter region of the rabbit zzso zzso there is a functional zzso element zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso constructions containing sequences of the zzso promoter up to zzso linked to the zzso zzso gene of zzso coli respond to zzso in gene transfer experiments, whereas a deletion that removes half of the zzso does zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to the putative zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso to an otherwise unresponsive zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso from calf zzso reveal a zzso footprint over the zzso Within this protected region six zzso zzso that have been shown to be contacted by the zzso in other zzso are protected against zzso by zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso We compare this zzso with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and find that the relative affinity of the zzso zzso is slightly lower than that of the zzso zzso Thus, this zzso zzso could be involved in zzso regulation of zzso expression in the zzso zzso
