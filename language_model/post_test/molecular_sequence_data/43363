zzso protein degradation is a key regulatory mechanism in a diversity of complex zzso including the control of cell cycle zzso The selection of zzso for degradation clearly depends on the specificity of zzso mechanisms, but further regulation may occur within the zzso zzso cap complexes, which attach to the ends of the zzso zzso core and are thought to control entry of zzso into the zzso We have characterized a gene from zzso zzso that displays extensive sequence similarity to members of a family of zzso that are components of the zzso complex, including human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso termed zzso (for zzso cap zzso is identical to the recently described zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown that zzso function is essential for zzso A zzso zzso strain arrests principally in the second cycle after transfer to the restrictive temperature, blocking as zzso cells with a zzso content of zzso zzso zzso reveals that each arrested zzso cell has failed to duplicate its zzso pole body zzso which becomes enlarged as in other zzso zzso Additionally, we have shown zzso of a functional zzso fluorescent protein fusion to the nucleus throughout the cell zzso We zzso that zzso plays a role in the degradation of certain potentially nuclear zzso in a manner that specifically is required for zzso zzso
