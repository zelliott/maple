We have cloned the zzso promoter region and have determined that almost all zzso promoter activity resides within a zzso zzso zzso analysis of this promoter region has identified potential recognition motifs for a number of zzso and ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso have revealed that the zzso zzso factor interacts with a zzso site within the zzso promoter and appears to play an important role in the positive zzso regulation of this zzso
