The highly structured zzso untranslated region zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus is involved in zzso translation of the viral zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently expressed Luc both in a rabbit zzso zzso and when zzso into zzso zzso zzso of 3 zzso at position 665 in the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso resulted in greatly reduced Luc expression in zzso cells but had little effect on expression of Luc in rabbit zzso zzso This zzso was also introduced into a virulent zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The zzso of viral zzso and protein synthesis and virus production in zzso cells were slower for the zzso zzso zzso than for zzso however, the final virus yields were zzso zzso zzso of mice with the zzso revealed that zzso was completely attenuated in zzso The reduced zzso of zzso may be ascribed to its reduced growth in the central nervous system, most likely due to an impaired ability to zzso viral zzso
