Avian zzso zzso zzso zzso was incubated with zzso and zzso to form a stable zzso zzso zzso similarly incubated with zzso and either zzso or zzso resulted in no significant loss in activity over 30 zzso zzso incubated with zzso and zzso at pH zzso showed rapid zzso as observed by a zzso decrease in activity after 5 zzso The loss of activity is linear with the incorporation of zzso into zzso resulting in zzso activity for the zzso zzso zzso The incorporation of and zzso by zzso is protected by zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso complex with zzso results in a loss of zzso and full recovery of zzso The reduction and zzso are protected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso circular zzso and zzso studies all indicate that zzso has been selectively incorporated into the zzso site of zzso resulting in a zzso active zzso zzso The zzso form zzso complexes with zzso and the zzso reaction occurs as a second sphere complex as previously suggested zzso & zzso (1984) zzso 23, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex and isolation of the zzso zzso by reverse phase zzso were performed to identify the location of the zzso binding zzso From mass, zzso acid zzso and sequence analyses of the isolated zzso the region zzso is responsible for metal zzso This very zzso region, located in the central portion of zzso contains two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are the only feasible metal binding zzso
