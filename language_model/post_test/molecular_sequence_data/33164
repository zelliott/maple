Two novel zzso zzso strains were isolated from soil zzso Both show typical features of zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the strains are members of the family zzso The two strains contain zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso acid in the zzso zzso acid profiles clearly differentiate the two zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso are zzso in zzso while the major components for zzso are zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The two strains also differ in their major zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and in zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso while zzso also contains minor amounts of several unknown zzso in addition to these zzso The zzso zzso of both strains are zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the DNA is zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, we propose zzso zzso zzso to accommodate the two zzso with the description of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the type zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
