We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a 23 zzso segment from the left arm of zzso IV, which is carried by the zzso zzso This sequence contains the 3' coding region of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 13 complete open reading frames longer than 300 zzso of which ten zzso to putative new genes and three zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso The sequence from zzso zzso was obtained entirely by a combined zzso and walking primer zzso
