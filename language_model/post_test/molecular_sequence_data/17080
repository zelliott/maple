The zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso insects, most of which are actual or potential zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease (American zzso DNA sequence comparisons of zzso DNA zzso genes were used to zzso zzso relationships among 32 species of the zzso zzso 26 belonging to the zzso zzso and six species of different zzso We analyzed zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso from each of the 32 species, as well as of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso The zzso analyses zzso supported several clusters within the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso was placed tentatively within the zzso complex while zzso zzso was not included in any zzso zzso The placement of these species in the molecular zzso indicated that both belong to the zzso zzso We confirmed with a strong support the inclusion of zzso zzso a member of a different complex based on zzso within the zzso zzso On the other hand, the present zzso analysis did not support the zzso of the zzso complex species as it was suggested in our previous zzso While no strong zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso was provided by the zzso zzso the other species belonging to zzso analyzed could not be distinguished from the species of zzso
