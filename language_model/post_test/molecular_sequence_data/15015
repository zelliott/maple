zzso zzso zzso have recently been reported in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is not known whether zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso zzso To investigate zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso in zzso zzso we studied zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 20 of 43 zzso and all three zzso zzso zzso zzso There is a higher frequency of zzso zzso in zzso patients with stage III and IV zzso compared with stage I and zzso Novel zzso zzso zzso were detected in 12 zzso three zzso zzso of zzso zzso and one zzso as well as in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso These zzso did not have the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso resulting in an zzso truncated protein that contained only the zzso zzso domain and caused zzso zzso of zzso These zzso were significantly associated with advanced disease stage and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso Furthermore, expression of these zzso in zzso and zzso cells could activate the zzso zzso zzso pathway, transform them in zzso and induce zzso in nude zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso may function as an alternative mechanism for zzso zzso zzso Combination of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso may contribute towards disease progression to poorly differentiated zzso zzso
