The analysis of clones obtained by rapid amplification of the zzso end and by primer extension of the zzso for carrot zzso zzso zzso zzso showed transcripts of differing lengths that belonged to two zzso The longer transcripts were found to contain a translation start site 147 zzso upstream of, and in frame with, the one which is present in the shorter zzso The zzso that begins at this zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso which is much larger than mature zzso zzso The zzso region of this zzso shows features typical of plant transit zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso of the zzso zzso fraction suggested a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although plant cells were shown to contain folate pools in zzso in zzso and in the zzso few zzso of the folate zzso have been associated with any zzso zzso Thus, this is the first indication for the presence of an zzso of the folate zzso zzso in zzso The longer transcripts revealed the presence of a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
