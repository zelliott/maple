Many strains of zzso zzso zzso require exposure to prolonged cold for rapid zzso a process known as zzso zzso in zzso results in the suppression of zzso zzso C zzso a zzso of zzso In a screen for zzso that no longer require zzso for rapid zzso we identified a dominant zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso Group zzso and the zzso zzso protein contains a zzso transition in a zzso region that precedes the zzso zzso zzso plants are early flowering and have reduced zzso zzso but, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso do not display additional zzso zzso zzso zzso have elevated levels of zzso on zzso 27 of zzso zzso zzso at zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a zzso zzso and this zzso zzso zzso without some of the components required for zzso zzso In the course of this work, we also identified a marked difference in zzso levels at zzso between plants that contain and those that lack the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso appears to affect zzso occupancy at zzso thus, our work provides insight into the molecular role that zzso plays in delaying the onset of zzso
