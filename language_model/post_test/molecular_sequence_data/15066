zzso zzso is a member of the growth hormone zzso zzso family of zzso hormones, and is found in a variety of zzso zzso zzso is thought to be involved in a wide range of zzso actions, including zzso stress response, the regulation of zzso and zzso balance, growth, zzso and immune zzso We report here on the zzso structure of zzso from the zzso of zzso tilapia, zzso zzso and its gene expression in response to seawater zzso stress, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 230 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso is composed of a signal zzso of 23 zzso acids and a mature protein of zzso zzso zzso which has a possible zzso site at position 121 and seven zzso zzso zzso zzso shows over zzso zzso acid identity with zzso of advanced zzso such as zzso and flounder, and around 50% identity with zzso of carp and zzso zzso to seawater had no effect on zzso expression of zzso or on zzso expression of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, seawater zzso resulted in significant increases in zzso zzso expression and in zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress had no effect on zzso expression of either zzso or zzso or on zzso expression of zzso whereas a significant increase was seen in zzso expression in the zzso zzso for 4 weeks resulted in significant reductions in zzso transcripts both in fresh water and zzso It is highly likely that zzso is involved in zzso processes in zzso along with the zzso zzso
