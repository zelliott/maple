zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso gene of the zzso zzso Since zzso is a key regulatory factor of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso is a candidate for a novel human zzso factor involved in zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso from zzso zzso to human but not present in zzso zzso To further study its function, we cloned the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity and similarity between zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso is essential for growth and, using a construct which zzso expresses zzso which with low level expression growth was severely affected on zzso but normal on zzso carbon zzso DNA zzso analyses showed that the zzso of many genes involved in zzso metabolism and zzso acid metabolism were zzso in the zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso fusion of zzso was localized to the nucleus, fitting with the possibility of zzso as a zzso zzso
