In zzso zzso the zzso zzso system controls a downstream zzso protein zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso protein intermediate which is required for zzso group transfer from the sensor zzso zzso to the response regulator zzso In addition, zzso mediates zzso transfer from zzso to zzso the only other response regulator protein in zzso which plays a role in response to zzso stress and cell wall zzso The X-ray structure of zzso was solved at a resolution of zzso A by conventional multiple zzso replacement with anomalous zzso The zzso structure of zzso consists of six zzso and a short zzso A zzso bundle comprises the central core of the zzso and contains the zzso zzso that is zzso zzso comparisons of zzso to other proteins having a similar function, such as the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso bundle and several structural features around the zzso zzso zzso are zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Despite limited zzso acid sequence zzso among zzso zzso our analysis of zzso as a zzso family member, indicates that these zzso zzso are likely to share a similar fold and common features with regard to response regulator binding and mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
