zzso random zzso sequencing projects have been started for several organisms and are a valuable tool for the analysis of quantitative and qualitative aspects of gene zzso However, the reliability of the obtained data is limited as most of the clones are only partially zzso on one zzso As a consequence the sequence entries derived from random zzso sequencing projects usually comprise incomplete open reading zzso They nevertheless define complete and reliable coding zzso if two zzso are zzso zzso the clones zzso very small zzso and zzso the clones have a high frequency in the zzso The present study describes the use of zzso databases for the identification of zzso of three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex, termed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are only characterized for a small number of organisms, have a scarcely defined function and exhibit a low degree of structural conservation if compared between different zzso Several clones were identified for each zzso by searches with zzso using the known sequences as zzso Most of the database entries contain complete open reading frames and sequencing queries could be excluded due to the zzso of the zzso Multiple sequence alignments are presented for all three zzso and consensus sequences are given which may provide a basis for the investigation of the proteins by zzso zzso
