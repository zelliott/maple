zzso regulates the growth and proliferation of red blood cell zzso We demonstrated previously the important structural and functional roles of the zzso acid region zzso in the biological activity of the zzso zzso zzso Chung, zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso We have now performed zzso scanning zzso to identify which specific zzso in this region are essential for zzso Four zzso reduced the biological activity of zzso zzso substitution of zzso zzso and zzso reduced activity to 16, 44, and 37% that of the zzso zzso zzso Most significantly, substitution of zzso with Ala reduced activity to zzso levels, indicating a zzso zzso reduction in specific zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this substitution does not cause major changes in the zzso of the protein or large, localized zzso within the zzso acid region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are virtually zzso further indicating the structural similarity between these two zzso Based upon these findings, we propose that zzso plays an essential role in the biological activity of erythropoietin, presumably by interacting directly with the zzso zzso
