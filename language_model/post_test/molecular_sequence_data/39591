zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen of major medical importance in Latin zzso It is also an early zzso zzso that displays many unusual zzso zzso The completion of the zzso zzso zzso project has highlighted the need to extend the range of techniques available to study gene zzso To this end we report the development of a stable zzso expression zzso zzso to this zzso and describe in detail the parameters of the zzso 

We first produced zzso zzso cell lines that zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein from a zzso zzso An zzso zzso with an zzso expression site under the control of a zzso zzso promoter zzso was targeted to the zzso silent zzso zzso zzso region of these zzso and zzso selected using a zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso To test the system we used two marker zzso zzso and red fluorescent protein zzso and an zzso zzso protein (a zzso zzso zzso In each case we found that induction was both time and zzso zzso zzso could be induced by at least zzso and zzso activity up to zzso within 24 hours of the addition of zzso When we examined zzso induction by zzso zzso and zzso activated cell zzso we observed very high levels of expression zzso increase in zzso zzso although this was not zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in an zzso increase in cellular zzso The observation that a zzso version of the zzso was correctly targeted to the zzso demonstrates that our expression system may also provide a zzso strategy for zzso zzso 

Our results show that zzso represents a valuable addition to the genetic tools available for zzso zzso The zzso system is sufficiently flexible that it should have widespread uses including zzso expression of zzso zzso generation of conditional knockout cell lines and the application of zzso zzso
