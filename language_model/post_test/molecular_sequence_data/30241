A zzso zzso DNA library was prepared in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were screened for the zzso gene zzso using a synthetic zzso Southern zzso analysis of the positive clones revealed a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the zzso zzso This zzso was zzso into zzso and zzso The zzso sequence disclosed an open reading frame of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence corresponded with the known zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analysis using total zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells delineated a start site for the zzso zzso and zzso promoter regions, and a zzso zzso No transcripts were seen with the zzso derived from a zzso zzso Southern blots of DNA from a number of zzso zzso strains revealed zzso with the zzso structural zzso DNA from a zzso strain of zzso zzso also zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed in zzso coli with plasmids zzso zzso the zzso gene on the zzso zzso zzso fragment, zzso the zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso gene present on a zzso zzso insert containing extensive zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso coli, but from a promoter other than the one used in zzso zzso
