Since zzso zzso was first described in 1980, it has been recognized zzso as a zzso species, zzso three zzso indistinguishable zzso In this study, the sequence of the zzso zzso gene and the zzso sequences of six zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of all the currently known species of the zzso zzso were used to determine the zzso position of zzso zzso zzso 2 in the zzso zzso The zzso analyses grouped the zzso zzso zzso 2 strains in a zzso group together with representative strains of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso 2 strains were also grouped apart from the other species of the zzso zzso and far from the other two zzso of zzso zzso All of the observations made in this study support the conclusion that zzso zzso zzso 2 should be reclassified as zzso zzso
