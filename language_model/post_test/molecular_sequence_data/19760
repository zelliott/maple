zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso is a distinct entity with restricted zzso gene features and poor prognosis and is more frequently encountered in Northern than Southern zzso To further investigate this subset and its geographic distribution in the context of a country zzso with both zzso and Mediterranean areas, 37 zzso zzso were collected out of 1076 cases enrolled by different institutions from Northern or Central Southern zzso Of the 37 cases, 18 were identified as zzso zzso zzso and were found almost exclusively (16 of zzso in Northern zzso in contrast, 19 zzso cases were evenly distributed throughout zzso zzso poor zzso were documented for zzso zzso as well as for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at higher levels in zzso than zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiling zzso of 13 zzso versus 52 zzso zzso identified, among 122 zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cases, zzso Moreover, zzso of 7 zzso versus 6 zzso zzso yielded 20 zzso expressed zzso with zzso being that expressed at the highest levels in zzso zzso Altogether, zzso zzso including those with zzso had a peculiar global zzso in part explaining their worse clinical zzso
