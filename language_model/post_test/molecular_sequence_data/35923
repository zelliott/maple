We determined the zzso sequence of the zzso for zzso III zzso zzso from sheep zzso It encodes a protein of 465 zzso zzso including a signal zzso of 32 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mature protein shows a sequence identity of zzso zzso and zzso to the human, bovine and rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso bonds as well as potential zzso sites are zzso between the four zzso In contrast, the zzso acid sequence of the signal zzso shows a smaller identity, zzso zzso and zzso compared to the human and rabbit zzso zzso
