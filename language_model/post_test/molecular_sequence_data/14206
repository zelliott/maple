This paper presents a zzso approach towards obtaining solution structures of G zzso zzso The human zzso zzso was dissected into two to three zzso zzso fragments, which were individually studied by solution zzso We systematically compared various zzso routes for the expression of the fragments in zzso coli and discuss zzso zzso In particular, we have compared the production of zzso zzso fragments as inclusion bodies by using the zzso leader zzso with zzso expression by using zzso as the fusion partner, and developed methods for zzso zzso In addition, direct expression of zzso fragments into inclusion bodies is a successful route in some zzso With the exception of zzso we could produce all fragments in zzso form in quantities sufficient for zzso zzso Almost complete backbone resonance assignment was obtained for the first two zzso as well as for zzso 5 and 7, and a high degree was obtained for zzso while zzso exchange processes resulted in the disappearance of many signals from zzso In addition, complete assignments were obtained for all zzso of the zzso domain, as well as the zzso and zzso zzso (with the exception of an zzso segment in the second zzso loop, zzso and for the complete zzso zzso zzso In total, backbone zzso of zzso of all zzso were assigned for the zzso zzso zzso of secondary structure based on backbone chemical shifts indicate that most zzso from the TM regions adopt zzso zzso with exception of those around polar zzso or zzso However, the domain boundaries differ slightly from those predicted for zzso zzso We suggest that the obtained chemical shifts might be useful in assigning the full-length zzso
