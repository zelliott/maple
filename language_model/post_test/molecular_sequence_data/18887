The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso disease, which affects zzso million people today in Latin zzso In contrast to other zzso insects, the zzso gut is zzso into three segments that perform different functions during blood zzso Here we report analysis of zzso for each of the segments using zzso zzso zzso of transcript frequency in zzso libraries with a zzso library was used to evaluate expression zzso All classes of zzso zzso were highly zzso with a predominance of zzso and zzso zzso the latter showing a significant expansion through gene zzso Although no protein zzso is known to occur in the anterior zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found, suggesting zzso as zzso being possibly activated in the zzso zzso zzso As expected, genes related to zzso protein synthesis apparatus, protein traffic, and zzso were abundantly zzso Despite the absence of a zzso zzso membrane in zzso - which have instead a zzso zzso membrane lining over zzso zzso - several zzso zzso transcripts were found, suggesting that these proteins perform functions other than being a structural component of the zzso zzso Among zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were the most highly zzso several genes belonging to the Toll zzso - found at low levels in the gut of most insects - were identified, contrasting with a low abundance of transcripts from zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of transcripts related to zzso metabolism indicates that lipids play multiple roles, being a major energy source, a zzso for zzso membrane formation, and a source for zzso possibly to produce the wax layer of the zzso zzso related to zzso acid metabolism showed an unanticipated priority for degradation of zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of transcripts related to signaling pathways suggested a role for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso related to control of cell shape and zzso possibly in connection with regulation of cell survival, response of pathogens and zzso Together, our findings present a new view of the zzso zzso apparatus and will help us understand zzso interaction and allow insights into zzso zzso adaptations to a zzso zzso
