We have previously localized a cervical cancer tumor zzso gene to a 300 zzso zzso of zzso Analysis of candidate genes revealed loss of expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in 6 cervical cancer cell lines and 9 of 11 primary cervical zzso zzso of the three zzso in four cervical cancer cell lines, 19 primary tumors, and 21 normal controls revealed zzso deletion of zzso 1 sequences in one zzso Point zzso were observed in six other zzso Two tumors contained zzso at the consensus binding sites for zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in cervical zzso Introduction of these two point zzso using site directed zzso resulted in reduced binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although zzso were not observed in any cell lines, four cell lines and 12 of 18 tumors contained promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed after zzso zzso and/or zzso A treatment of cervical cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso confirming promoter zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in these two cell lines resulted in growth zzso There was also suppression of soft zzso colony formation by zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in decreased zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso L resulted in increased cell growth which was inhibited by the zzso of zzso zzso We zzso therefore, that zzso zzso is a cervical cancer zzso gene and that the gene is zzso by zzso zzso and promoter zzso
