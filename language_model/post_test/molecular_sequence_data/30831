A zzso was constructed that zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso beta zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso beta zzso assembled into functional zzso zzso that supplied greater than zzso of the zzso capacity of the zzso Excess beta zzso zzso into zzso inclusion bodies and was not deleterious to cell zzso By zzso of a zzso zzso sequence zzso and accompanying deletion of variable amounts of zzso zzso 13 structural zzso were isolated in the first and last thirds of the zzso zzso zzso Twelve of these zzso appeared to reduce or prevent assembly of zzso beta zzso into zzso zzso One zzso had no discernible effect on assembly or function of the beta zzso eight others appeared to inhibit assembly but still produced zzso zzso zzso Three of these nine zzso produced zzso zzso that inhibited cell growth at 32 degrees C, even though they were present in less than 50% of the cell zzso zzso When assembled into zzso zzso these three altered beta zzso apparently affected essential zzso zzso zzso Four of the recovered zzso appeared to inhibit completely or almost completely assembly of the beta zzso into zzso zzso The results are consistent with a hypothesis that sequences in the first third of the zzso zzso are especially important for proper folding and assembly of the beta zzso
