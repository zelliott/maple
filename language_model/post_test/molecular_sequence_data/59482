The zzso of the canine major zzso complex class II zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso 2 that encodes the zzso beta 1 domain was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso product from 250 dogs was cloned and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Most of the variation in zzso acid composition occurred at positions in the zzso binding zzso zzso of these sequences showed zzso segregation with one or two zzso per zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences subdivided the canine zzso zzso into three major zzso zzso The number of zzso changes was higher than the number of synonymous changes in the putative zzso recognition sites indicative of positive zzso The data generated can serve as a basis for developing a typing zzso for the canine zzso zzso
