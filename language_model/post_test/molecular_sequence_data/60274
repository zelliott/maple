We describe a permanent line of Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso a truncated form of zzso zzso zzso that is zzso into the culture medium in an zzso active zzso zzso a zzso zzso normally zzso the zzso loop of zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso This zzso zzso the zzso zzso process by which the zzso zzso of zzso are released from cell zzso for zzso to the nucleus, where they activate zzso of genes involved in the zzso and zzso of cholesterol and fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso produced by the zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, lacks the zzso membrane zzso Like native zzso this truncated protein zzso normal zzso processing after zzso 137 to release an zzso zzso thereby generating an active form, designated zzso Prior to zzso truncated zzso like native zzso is zzso further after zzso 186 to generate zzso which is the only form that appears in the culture zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso zzso a synthetic zzso that zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso to the internal zzso zzso site that generates zzso as described in the accompanying paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Goldstein, zzso zzso and Brown, zzso zzso (1999), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not cleave zzso a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso site in zzso However, zzso does cleave after this zzso when the zzso sequence is contained within a zzso zzso corresponding to the central portion of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso differs from that of zzso zzso two related zzso in its more alkaline pH optimum zzso zzso its relative resistance to calcium zzso agents, and its ability to cleave after zzso or zzso rather than zzso These data provide direct zzso evidence that zzso is the zzso that zzso zzso and thereby functions to control zzso zzso and zzso in animal zzso
