The zzso zzso zzso appeared to be associated with active zzso but how it functions is zzso We have dissected the properties of zzso containing zzso Atomic force zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso organizes only approximately 130 zzso of DNA, suggesting that 10 zzso of each end of zzso DNA are released from the zzso In agreement with this, the zzso angle of the zzso DNA ends formed an angle close to 180 degrees and the zzso analysis pointed to a lower stability of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso has no impact on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments showed that the overall structure and stability of the zzso but not its property to interfere with the zzso induced zzso were determined to a considerable extent by the zzso zzso zzso These data show that the whole zzso zzso fold domain is responsible for the unusual properties of the zzso zzso
