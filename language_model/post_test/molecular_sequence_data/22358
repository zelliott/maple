zzso in the human zzso DNA zzso zzso can not only decrease but also increase zzso to the zzso zzso analogue zzso The proximity of zzso which zzso resistance, and zzso which zzso zzso suggests a possible unifying mechanism that affects drug zzso in one direction or the zzso We found that the zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were literally indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso however, zzso to zzso was decreased or increased, zzso A comparison with the crystal structure model of the related zzso zzso suggests that zzso and zzso are located in the zzso zzso P that is implicated in zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso do not appear to make direct contacts with the incoming zzso it is conceivable that changes at these zzso could exert their effects through the zzso highly zzso zzso acids zzso and/or zzso Our data show that a zzso substitution in zzso causes reductions in rates of zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso is only marginally affected, while this zzso shows relatively high levels of resistance to zzso Based on these data, we suggest that zzso exerts its effects through subtle structural changes in zzso P that affect the precise positioning of zzso and, in turn, its zzso involvement in binding of zzso In contrast, the removal of a positive charge associated with the zzso change may facilitate access or increase affinity to the adjacent zzso
