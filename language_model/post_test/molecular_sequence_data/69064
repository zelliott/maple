A zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and a full-length zzso for zzso starch zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso the zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso in reserve zzso was zzso zzso of the cloned zzso showed that it has zzso identity with potato zzso and zzso identity with zzso from other plant zzso The zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein of which 78 zzso acids form a zzso transit zzso of zzso zzso The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins of various plant species and zzso zzso of bacteria showed extensive identity among the mature form of plant zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso form two separate branches in the evolutionary zzso From analysis of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso it is shown that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso transcript is zzso in a number of different zzso but most abundantly in zzso zzso plants were transformed with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso orientation fused between the potato zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso gene in these transgenic potato plants was partially or completely zzso Complete zzso of zzso activity by the zzso zzso gene resulted in absence of zzso protein and zzso giving rise to almost complete zzso potato zzso This shows that also zzso genes can be used to achieve zzso effects in other plant zzso
