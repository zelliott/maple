zzso zzso acids are prominent defense compounds against insect zzso and pathogens in zzso zzso and molecular analyses in grand zzso zzso zzso Norway spruce zzso zzso and zzso pine zzso zzso have identified two classes of genes and zzso that generate much of the structural diversity of zzso defense zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a single zzso zzso zzso families of zzso and zzso zzso zzso generate an array of zzso zzso zzso These zzso are converted to zzso zzso acids by activity of one or more zzso zzso A few conifer zzso zzso have previously been cloned and characterized in grand zzso and in Norway zzso We have also previously shown that the zzso pine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso of several zzso alcohols and zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to function in zzso while zzso can also be localized to zzso or to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso pine zzso zzso encodes a typical zzso conifer zzso zzso that forms zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to the grand zzso zzso zzso and Norway spruce zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, was shown with green fluorescent fusion protein expression in tobacco zzso These data suggest that zzso for conifer zzso zzso acid zzso are localized to at least two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso requiring efficient transport of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso acids into the zzso zzso
