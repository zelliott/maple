zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso agent, designated zzso zzso that demonstrated zzso activity against zzso zzso The agent was zzso into MRS zzso and was present in the zzso zzso from both overnight broth and zzso milk zzso It was heat zzso zzso by 50 degrees C for 30 zzso and was stable over the pH range zzso to zzso zzso of the substance was zzso and maximum yields were obtained in MRS broth cultures maintained at pH zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso following growth of the producing strain in a zzso MRS medium and zzso the zzso zzso with ammonium zzso to zzso zzso The cleared zzso fluid was then brought to zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The partially zzso inhibitor was sensitive to several zzso zzso and it was zzso in its mode of action against indicator cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that it was a zzso A DNA probe specific for the zzso J structural gene failed to zzso to total zzso DNA of zzso zzso 1829, indicating that zzso zzso is not significantly related to zzso zzso
