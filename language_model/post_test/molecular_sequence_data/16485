The gene zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with 310 zzso acid zzso and shows an zzso acid sequence identity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso such as pH zzso metal zzso requirement, and zzso mode of the zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was more stable than zzso zzso and the temperature zzso at which the zzso loses half of its activity upon incubation for 10 zzso was 55 degrees C for zzso zzso and 35 degrees C for zzso zzso The optimum temperature for zzso zzso activity was also shifted upward by roughly 20 degrees C as compared to that of zzso zzso The availability of such a zzso zzso will facilitate structural studies of zzso zzso
