zzso and zzso zzso sequences were extracted from the zzso and zzso zzso When zzso for number of zzso and degree of zzso in the zzso cattle reference families, zzso numbers range from 1 to 14 with zzso in the zzso systems ranging from zzso to zzso Six zzso of the 13 bovine systems tested gave specific and zzso products in zzso zzso 2 of the 4 zzso systems gave specific and zzso products in zzso These data define 11 bovine and 8 zzso zzso systems which are associated with known genes and are thus useful for comparative mapping zzso
