zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells and is a regulator of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone was isolated that contains the zzso end and putative promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso protection experiments detected 13 zzso initiation sites scattered 50 to 130 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to the strongest zzso initiation zzso of the zzso gene zzso region exhibited strong promoter activity in both zzso zzso zzso cells that express the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso cells that do not express the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter fragments containing as little as the zzso to zzso zzso sequence produced full zzso zzso However, a zzso to zzso promoter zzso directed significantly less transcription, and a zzso to zzso promoter zzso was zzso zzso In zzso binding zzso revealed zzso and widely expressed zzso activities that zzso within the zzso to zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso competition and zzso disruption studies indicated that these complexes contained the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site significantly decreased zzso promoter activity in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional zzso elements may be required to restrict zzso promoter activity to zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso
