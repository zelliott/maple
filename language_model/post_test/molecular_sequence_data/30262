The accessibility of zzso bonds in the DNA of zzso zzso junctions has been zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of protection were observed on all four strands of the zzso that tended to be longer on the strands that are exchanged between the zzso stacked pairs of zzso The protected regions on the continuous strands of the stacked zzso were not located exactly at the zzso but were displaced towards the 3' side of the zzso This is the region of backbone that becomes located in the major groove of the opposed zzso in the zzso right-handed structure for the zzso and might therefore be predicted to be protected against zzso by an zzso However, the major grooves of the structure remain accessible to the much smaller probe zzso zzso
