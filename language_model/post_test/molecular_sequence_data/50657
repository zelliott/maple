A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene of rabies virus zzso strain was cloned and inserted into a zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with this zzso virus produced a large quantity of new protein instead of the parental zzso zzso By zzso and zzso zzso the zzso protein was zzso similar to the authentic G zzso Its molecular mass estimated by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso however, was slightly smaller than that of the authentic one, and this observation was suggested to be due to the difference in zzso level between the two G zzso The zzso G protein expressed on the cell surface of the insect cells showed a fusion activity at low zzso The fusion activity was inhibited by zzso against either whole zzso or G protein of rabies zzso
