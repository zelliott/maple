The rat zzso hormone zzso gene encodes through alternative zzso at least three protein zzso with different functions, and three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso are detected using alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso In the present study, the identities of these zzso were analyzed by Northern analysis, and it was demonstrated that in rat brain the zzso protein is zzso by the minor zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso proteins are zzso by the major zzso zzso Relative quantities of these zzso were determined by zzso protection zzso and the ratio of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso in adult zzso The ratio between the zzso was regulated in both a zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels were also regulated by the zzso state of the animal showing an increased level in zzso rat liver while those in brain were not zzso Analysis of the zzso hormone zzso gene suggested that the choice between two zzso sites and subsequent zzso processing appear to generate the 3' zzso of these alternative zzso
