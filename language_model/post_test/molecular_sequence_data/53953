zzso zzso zzso has been shown to degrade a number of biologically important zzso including insulin and the zzso protein implicated in Alzheimer's zzso However, lack of a facile method to generate zzso zzso and related zzso has made it difficult to study the precise role of zzso in the clearance of these zzso zzso we determined whether zzso zzso and zzso human zzso can be zzso as functional zzso in zzso Three zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed, and the proteins expressed in zzso coli were zzso by metal affinity zzso zzso yield approximately 8 zzso per liter of zzso The zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso migrate with zzso apparent molecular masses in zzso gels and as a approximately zzso species in gel zzso Further analysis by native PAGE indicates that zzso can form zzso of different zzso The zzso zzso zzso degrades insulin with an efficiency similar to that of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso are stable at 4 degrees C for at least 1 zzso zzso zzso protein was used to raise specific zzso zzso that can zzso native zzso zzso Thus, the procedure described allows the rapid production of large amounts of zzso zzso and demonstrates that zzso can be produced in an active form in the absence of other potential interacting zzso zzso
