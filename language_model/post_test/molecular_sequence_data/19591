Between 1 and zzso of proteins coded for in the human zzso including all G protein gamma zzso are predicted to be zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso at the C zzso and zzso These reactions are generally obligatory events required for functional expression of zzso zzso The biological role of zzso zzso has made these reactions significant targets for zzso drug zzso zzso the zzso of this zzso will be key to success for this zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso cells they were completely processed according to the current understanding of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was processed to two zzso a minor one, fully processed as predicted, and a major one that was zzso without further zzso When the zzso motif of zzso zzso was exchanged for that of zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso zzso zzso was incompletely zzso zzso processing of zzso was found due to the presence of an aromatic zzso acid in its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso or zzso cells with zzso zzso identified multiple zzso zzso by mass zzso in either cell, but in both cases the most prominent one was zzso expressed without zzso processing after zzso This work indicates that zzso reactions can generate multiple products determined by the zzso zzso zzso Within the human zzso zzso of predicted zzso proteins have aromatic zzso acids in their zzso sequence and would likely generate the zzso pattern described zzso
