The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso whose function is critical for regulating gene expression in zzso zzso However, the molecular events that regulate zzso zzso activity are poorly zzso We evaluated zzso of the zzso zzso protein domain to determine its zzso Using expressed protein zzso the zzso zzso protein domain was generated in zzso form and found to have reduced zzso zzso This zzso zzso rate was zzso by zzso of several key zzso sites within an apparent zzso loop zzso This zzso modification and zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity is zzso analogous to the zzso of most protein zzso by zzso We therefore propose that this zzso loop could influence the impact of zzso on a wide variety of signaling and zzso zzso
