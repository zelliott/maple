zzso normal acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso represents a distinct disease entity with a favorable clinical zzso So far, it is not known whether other genetic zzso cooperate with zzso zzso during zzso To identify additional zzso we performed whole zzso sequencing of 5 zzso patients and detected zzso zzso zinc finger 1 zzso zzso in 2 of 5 zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso factors crucial for zzso zzso zzso or acquired zzso in both genes have been associated with zzso Further zzso screening detected novel zzso zzso zzso in 13 of 33 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso No zzso zzso were found in 38 zzso patients with a zzso zzso zzso and in 89 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso The presence of additional zzso zzso zzso did not significantly influence the clinical outcome of 26 zzso zzso In reporter gene zzso all tested zzso zzso zzso showed reduced capacity to enhance zzso zzso of transcription, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso may collaborate with zzso zzso to zzso target genes during zzso zzso We thus provide evidence for a genetically distinct zzso of zzso The German zzso cooperative group trials 1999 and 2008 are registered with the identifiers zzso and zzso at zzso
