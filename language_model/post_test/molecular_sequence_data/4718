Identification of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso as the major zzso for zzso entry has greatly assisted our understanding of zzso zzso transmission, and zzso However, most of our current knowledge on zzso usage comes from studies using zzso strains or zzso genes derived from the genetic zzso B zzso in North America and western zzso In this report, the zzso usage of 20 primary viral zzso representative of genetic zzso A, B, C, D, zzso and group O was zzso Thirty-nine full-length zzso sequences from individuals of diverse geographic origins were also obtained to examine the possible effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso serve as the two major zzso for viruses belonging to zzso zzso A, B, C, D, zzso and group O, whereas other zzso receptors such as zzso and zzso play only a minor role in zzso viral entry into zzso zzso zzso the zzso usage is determined by the viral zzso rather than its zzso because all zzso zzso irrespective of their zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas all zzso strains are able to use zzso and zzso there is no geographic zzso of zzso zzso in different ethnic zzso suggesting that zzso diversity is not the underlying explanation for differences in the spread of different zzso zzso zzso the uneven worldwide distribution of zzso zzso is more likely the result of zzso zzso
