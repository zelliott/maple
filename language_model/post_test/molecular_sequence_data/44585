Tip of zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified a novel cellular zzso protein zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Tap associated with Tip following transient expression in zzso cells and stable expression in human zzso zzso zzso of Tip and Tap in zzso cells induced dramatic cell zzso zzso was likely caused by the zzso surface expression of zzso molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso factor of zzso cells had approximately zzso higher activity than that of parental zzso Thus, Tap is likely to be an important cellular zzso of Tip function in T cell transformation by zzso zzso
