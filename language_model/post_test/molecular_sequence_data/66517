zzso zzso or disease zzso is a zzso disease of the hand that results in finger zzso zzso Increased cellular zzso levels have been identified as characteristic of this zzso As zzso are the most widely recognized upstream regulators of cellular zzso zzso we have examined zzso gene expression in surgical specimens and in zzso primary cell cultures grown in two-dimensional zzso culture or in three-dimensional zzso collagen lattice zzso 

The zzso expression profile of zzso zzso and unaffected control zzso zzso tissue was determined by a variety of complimentary zzso zzso zzso analysis, specific zzso and degenerative zzso zzso zzso zzso and Real Time zzso zzso analysis identified 13 zzso associated with zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso and 11, and to a lesser extent zzso and zzso as the major zzso family members expressed in our patient zzso Competitive zzso analysis identified significant differences between the levels of expression of zzso zzso zzso and 11 in tissue samples and in primary cell cultures grown as zzso or in zzso where the zzso levels in tissue zzso zzso cultures zzso zzso zzso Real Time zzso data confirmed the zzso of zzso 11 zzso in zzso while zzso zzso the most frequently isolated zzso in zzso and control zzso zzso displayed widely variable expression between the methods of zzso 

These data indicate that changes in zzso expression per zzso are unlikely to be the cause of the observed zzso of zzso expression in zzso
