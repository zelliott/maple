The evolution of human zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso zzso in a patient zzso infected with a contaminated batch of blood zzso factor IX was zzso zzso sequences were derived at 11, 25, and 41 months zzso from infected peripheral blood zzso cells after molecular cloning of zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationships among a total of 41 zzso sequences were established by split decomposition analysis and used as a basis to establish a substitution zzso and to score synonymous zzso and zzso zzso zzso The number of observed zzso stop zzso within the zzso sequences was comparable to that expected on a random zzso Similarly, the numbers of observed s and zzso zzso did not differ significantly from expected zzso No zzso position was zzso zzso The maximum sequence divergence increased in a linear manner, with approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso acid changes per zzso It appears that zzso processes strongly influence short-term zzso zzso zzso evolution in zzso
