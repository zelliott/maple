zzso zzso protects the zzso nervous system from zzso nerve agents by scavenging these zzso zzso human zzso produced from transgenic goat to treat nerve agent intoxication is currently under zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso relies on its ability to stay in the circulation for a prolonged period, which in turn depends on maintaining zzso zzso zzso Native human plasma zzso consists of zzso zzso and has a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso junctions and the central nervous system is anchored to zzso through interactions with zzso zzso collagen tail zzso and zzso zzso membrane zzso proteins containing zzso zzso zzso prepared in cell culture is primarily zzso unless expressed in the presence of zzso zzso We hypothesized that a zzso zzso is an intrinsic component of soluble plasma zzso zzso just as it is for zzso zzso We found that a series of zzso peptides was released from zzso human and horse plasma zzso Eight zzso with masses from zzso to zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso tandem zzso and zzso zzso All peptides derived from the same zzso core sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso but varied in length at their zzso and zzso The source of these peptides was identified through database searching as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1; zzso zzso A zzso zzso of 17 zzso acids derived from zzso drove the assembly of human zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells into zzso We propose that the zzso peptides organize the 4 zzso of zzso into a 340 zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
