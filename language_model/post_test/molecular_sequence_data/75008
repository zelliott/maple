The replication origin of the fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by the use of an in zzso replication system prepared from zzso coli, a host in which the zzso can be zzso zzso zzso were isolated from reaction zzso that contained zzso zzso thus limiting the average extent of in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated that the origin of replication is included within a zzso zzso zzso proceeds zzso in the same direction as zzso of zzso zzso Isolation of deletion derivatives allowed us to define the replication origin of zzso within a region of zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs through zzso zzso by a rolling circle zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by restriction zzso allowed the positioning of three major specific zzso sites in regions of high potential to form secondary zzso One of these zzso repeats is located in the region where the origin of replication of zzso has been zzso
