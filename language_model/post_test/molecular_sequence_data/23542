zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso shuttle that transfers reduction zzso from the zzso into the zzso Within the zzso zzso analysis localized human zzso to late zzso and to the zzso of zzso The expression of human zzso is regulated by two zzso zzso and here, we describe a third zzso promoter of human zzso The usage of this zzso promoter zzso with the expression of a shortened zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in zzso which is solely zzso from zzso zzso Within the zzso promoter, we detected a zzso element zzso site at zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso This recognition site zzso with a nuclear zzso binding zzso at zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso germ cell nuclear factor zzso Both factors compete for binding to the same DNA response zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells activated a zzso zzso construct in transient zzso zzso Additional zzso of zzso relieved this activity, suggesting a zzso of zzso zzso by zzso This effect was preserved by introducing the zzso zzso element into a zzso promoter zzso Our data suggest a zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso which might be a general regulation mechanism for several zzso expressed genes with a zzso expression peak during early zzso zzso
