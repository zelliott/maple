Two cucumber mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from sugar beet showing yellow mosaic symptom in zzso Xinjiang zzso zzso of zzso The coat protein gene of the two zzso zzso and their associated satellite zzso were amplified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and were cloned and zzso zzso of zzso gene sequences showed that zzso and zzso have the highest sequence identity with that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two types of satellite zzso zzso and zzso were found to be associated with the two zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and 336 zzso zzso zzso comparisons revealed that zzso and zzso were most closely related to zzso and zzso respectively, with zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequence and deduced zzso acid sequence of coat protein gene revealed that zzso and zzso belong to zzso zzso but there exist some variation between zzso Parallel analyses of zzso sequence of zzso and zzso suggested that these two satellite zzso probably originated from zzso
