This study was carried out to investigate presence and distribution of zzso and zzso species via microscopic examination and reverse line zzso zzso techniques in sheep and zzso in the Black Sea region of zzso For this purpose, zzso blood samples zzso sheep and 259 zzso were collected by active surveillance from sheep and zzso in different provinces of various cities in the region in the years 2010 and zzso zzso were prepared from the blood samples, stained with zzso and examined under the light microscope for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were extracted from blood zzso The length of zzso zzso in the variable zzso region of zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso and zzso species was amplified using the zzso The zzso chain reaction products were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A total of 38 animals zzso including 34 sheep zzso and 4 zzso zzso were found to be positive for zzso zzso zzso in microscopic examination of zzso while zzso zzso zzso could not zzso zzso rates were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and totally zzso for zzso zzso while zzso in sheep and totally zzso for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of sheep and zzso of all zzso besides zzso zzso zzso had zzso prevalence in sheep and zzso in zzso with a total zzso with zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined in both sheep and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed only in the zzso These results provide the first detailed molecular data for sheep and goat zzso and zzso in the zzso
