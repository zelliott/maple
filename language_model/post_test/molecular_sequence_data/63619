A zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized for the first time from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso consists of two identical zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso per zzso It contains zzso as a prosthetic group and uses zzso as the preferential zzso but can also reduce zzso The zzso zzso of the forward zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso reactions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A comparative study of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities was performed, the optimal temperature and pH being different for each: 55 degrees C, pH 7 and 89 degrees C, pH zzso zzso Although zzso is generally part of the zzso zzso complexes in zzso and zzso none of these complexes has yet been isolated from zzso The zzso role of zzso in these organisms is zzso
