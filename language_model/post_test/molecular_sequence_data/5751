A novel zzso zzso alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from a marine fish, zzso zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso acid zzso A high degree of identity was found with known zzso zzso proteins of cones zzso zzso or rods zzso zzso human zzso alpha zzso bovine zzso alpha zzso mouse zzso alpha zzso mouse zzso alpha zzso and bovine zzso alpha zzso Northern zzso analysis of different zzso revealed a transcript of about zzso zzso which is expressed only in the fish eye and not in other zzso from adult fish, supporting its identification as zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression during early development of zzso zzso determined by Northern zzso analysis, showed very low levels in larvae 3 days after zzso but not zzso zzso increased 3- and zzso on days 4 and 6 zzso compared with those on day 3 and remained essentially unchanged thereafter, until day 21 after zzso (the last day zzso Our results suggest that in fish only one alpha zzso of zzso is found, which shows similar identity with cone and rod alpha zzso of zzso
