zzso approaches to protein structure within zzso have proven enormously zzso When one zzso on the detailed manner through which membrane proteins actually traverse the cell zzso a simple observation zzso zzso zzso segments of 20 zzso acids each constitute the only tangible connection between the inside and outside of the zzso Thus, a major step towards understanding the key relationships between biological function and membrane protein structure can be taken through zzso by zzso zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso of zzso peptides designed as mimics of zzso zzso
