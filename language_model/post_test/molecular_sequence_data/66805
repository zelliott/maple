From a brain extract of the zzso fish, striped zzso zzso zzso two visceral zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated by means of reversed phase zzso together with zzso on fish zzso The primary structure of zzso was zzso to be zzso by zzso mass zzso The threshold concentration of zzso that changes spontaneous contraction of zzso zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to exert zzso activities on some other smooth muscle segments zzso and zzso of zzso but it did not show any effect on body wall muscle zzso zzso the present study suggests that zzso and zzso peptides act as factors that control visceral zzso of zzso gastrointestinal zzso
