The rat zzso 4 zzso 4) gene has been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library by zzso to the mouse zzso 4 zzso Like the mouse and human counterparts, it exists as a single copy gene in the zzso and consists of four zzso The overall structure of the zzso 4 locus seems highly zzso This is indicated by the low degree of restriction zzso length zzso in a number of laboratory and wild mice and by the conservation of the zzso size between human, zzso and mouse zzso 4 zzso Furthermore, evolutionary zzso elements are the promoter region, the position of zzso zzso and sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated regions that are believed to be involved in zzso of the zzso In contrast, the predicted zzso acid sequence of the rat zzso 4 gene shows low zzso zzso with the mouse zzso The divergence between mouse and rat zzso 4 genes is even more pronounced in the zzso region zzso zzso in the last 68 zzso zzso The ratio between replacement and silent zzso in the zzso 4 genes of different species suggests a complex pattern of selective forces acting on the zzso 4 zzso which includes both selection against and for zzso acid zzso in individual zzso The functional identity with zzso 4 has been confirmed by expression of the gene and the demonstration of the ability to induce zzso class II zzso expression on zzso zzso
