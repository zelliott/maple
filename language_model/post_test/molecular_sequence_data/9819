zzso zzso zzso is a zzso nuclear zinc finger protein which zzso in the immediate response of zzso cells exposed to DNA damaging zzso Given the complexity of the zzso reaction, we developed a large-scale screening procedure in zzso coli to identify randomly zzso acids involved in the various aspects of this zzso Random zzso were generated by the zzso chain reaction in a zzso sequence covering most of the zzso zzso Out of 26 individual zzso that zzso zzso the full-length zzso 22 were found at zzso positions in the primary structure, and 24 were located in the core domain formed by two zzso containing the active zzso Most of the zzso zzso were altered in zzso zzso and/or zzso The spatial proximity of some zzso involved in chain zzso zzso and branching zzso suggests a proximity or a zzso of these two zzso zzso Other zzso affected in branching were located at the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso contacts are necessary for optimal zzso zzso This screening procedure provides a simple and efficient method to explore further the zzso relationship of the zzso
