We have developed a zzso procedure to isolate the two different zzso types zzso and zzso of the European zzso zzso zzso On the basis of limited zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso protein sequencing and zzso sequencing, we have identified eight different zzso functional units zzso in zzso termed zzso to zzso and determined their linear arrangement within the zzso zzso zzso From a zzso zzso library, we have isolated and zzso a zzso clone which encodes the five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g and h of zzso As shown by multiple sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso structurally to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso of a zzso zzso to be zzso The new zzso zzso sequences are compared to their counterparts in zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from the latter, the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso have recently been zzso and discussed in relation to the recent zzso A X-ray structure of zzso from zzso zzso and the 15 A three-dimensional reconstruction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from electron zzso This data zzso for the first time, an insight into the evolution of the two functionally different zzso zzso found in marine zzso It appears that they evolved several hundred million years ago within the zzso after separation of the latter from the branch leading to the zzso Moreover, as a structural explanation for the inefficiency of the type 1 zzso to form zzso in zzso the additional zzso sites in zzso compared to zzso are zzso
