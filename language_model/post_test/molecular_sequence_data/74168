Five cases of zzso transmission of zzso E virus zzso have been reported so zzso The infection routes of the zzso donors remain zzso zzso Also, the progress of virus markers in the entire course of zzso infection has not been well zzso 

zzso acid testing was performed by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction targeting the open reading frame 2 region of zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso were detected by direct zzso 

zzso study of a zzso donor revealed that the zzso zzso donated from him 2 weeks previously contained zzso zzso and were zzso to a zzso Thirteen relatives including the donor were zzso to enjoy grilled pork meats together in a barbecue restaurant 23 days before the zzso zzso his father died of zzso zzso E and the other 6 members showed serum markers of zzso zzso In the recipient, zzso was detected in serum on Day 22 and reached the peak of zzso log copies per zzso on Day 44 followed by the steep increase of zzso zzso zzso G zzso emerged on Day zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso sequences from the donor and recipient were an zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso up to Day 97 in serum, Day 85 in feces, and Day 71 in zzso 

A zzso zzso E case by blood from a donor infected via the zzso food-borne route and the progress of zzso markers in the entire course are zzso Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology and the zzso risks for zzso even in zzso zzso
