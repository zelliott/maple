The complete zzso acid sequence zzso zzso of the human zzso gamma zzso of zzso zzso has been determined by a combination of direct zzso acid sequencing and zzso sequencing of cloned zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso alpha form of the zzso was also obtained which agreed almost entirely with the indirect zzso zzso zzso of the two human sequences shows no insertions or zzso but 72 zzso zzso of the human gamma form with the corresponding zzso from the rat shows only 7 replacements zzso to 27 changes between the human and rat alpha zzso We have identified regions of sequence difference between the human alpha and gamma forms that are mainly zzso in character zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are on the surface of the three-dimensional structure and could be useful as zzso to produce zzso specific for the zzso zzso
