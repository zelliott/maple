We have previously shown that a zzso zzso element, or zzso acts to specifically restrict zzso activity to zzso zzso Here we report a detailed characterization of this zzso The activity of the zzso is dependent on its position relative to the zzso The negative regulatory effect can be diminished by zzso with a zzso zzso competitor zzso suggesting that the function of the element is zzso by specific binding of a zzso zzso zzso The minimal region required for zzso function is contained between positions zzso and zzso relative to the start of the zzso zzso The specific interaction of a nuclear protein from zzso cells with this zzso DNA segment was shown by zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso A detailed examination of the zzso site for that protein clearly suggest that it belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso
