The zinc finger, a motif of zzso acid recognition broadly zzso among zzso is a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso coordination of zzso zzso to zzso is proposed to reflect differences in zzso stabilization energies zzso due to complete or incomplete occupancy of d zzso zzso predicts that the preference for zzso should be purely zzso in zzso with zzso studies of a zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso 41, zzso Despite its elegance, the general predominance of zzso is unclear as zzso the magnitude by which zzso prefers zzso is greater than that expected and zzso the analogous metal zzso selectivity of a zinc zzso zzso zzso is driven by changes in zzso rather than zzso Because zzso was designed to zzso zinc zzso we have investigated the zzso structure and metal zzso selectivity of a natural finger of lower stability derived from human zzso protein zzso zzso zzso suggests that the structure of the zzso domain is unaffected by interchange of zzso and zzso As in zzso preferential binding of zzso zzso to zzso is driven predominantly by differences in zzso but in this case the zzso advantage is less than that predicted by zzso A theoretical framework is presented to define the relationship between zzso and other zzso factors, such as metal zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the topography of the underlying folding zzso The contribution of environmental zzso to zzso compensation is delineated in a formal zzso zzso Together, these considerations indicate that zzso provides an important but incomplete description of the stringency and zzso origin of zzso zzso
