The differences in efficacy and molecular mechanisms of platinum zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso are thought to be partially due to the differences in the DNA zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso that form on adjacent zzso on DNA, which in turn influence the binding of zzso proteins that control downstream effects of the zzso Here we report a comprehensive comparison of the structural distortion of DNA caused by zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso sequence context using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and molecular dynamics zzso zzso When compared to our previous studies in other sequence zzso these structural studies help us understand the effect of the sequence context on the zzso of zzso DNA zzso We find that both the sequence context and the type of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso and the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso possibly explaining their influence on the ability of many zzso proteins to bind to zzso zzso
