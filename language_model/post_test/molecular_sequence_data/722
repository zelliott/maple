Gene expression can be zzso regulated by alternatively spliced zzso factors, providing a mechanism for precise control of diverse zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso (formerly known as zzso was described as a key regulator of the differentiation of the spinal zzso zzso circuit dedicated to the processing of zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of a zzso alternative zzso zzso that we termed zzso 

Mouse zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained by Rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution and the amount of zzso at different zzso ages were analyzed by in zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso and compared with those of zzso 

The amount of zzso was higher than that of the zzso zzso both in the zzso and the spinal zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso but differs from the previously identified zzso in the zzso part due to alternative zzso zzso This results in the lack of the zzso domain in the zzso primary zzso zzso is exclusively localized in zzso primarily involved in the processing of the pain zzso zzso zzso presents the same regional distribution pattern as zzso but differs as to the qualitative and quantitative expression profile at distinct zzso ages in the zzso root zzso and spinal zzso 

We suggest that the zzso role of the zzso gene may be sustained by an accurate balance in the ratio between the amount of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso which may be critical during zzso circuit zzso
