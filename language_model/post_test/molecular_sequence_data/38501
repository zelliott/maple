A prediction from the zzso theory of zzso origins is that pattern formation processes such as those controlled by the zzso cluster genes are required specifically for adult body plan zzso This prediction can be tested in animals that use zzso indirect development, in which the embryonic formation of the zzso and the zzso formation of the adult body plan are temporally and zzso zzso To this end, we zzso measured the amount of transcripts for five zzso genes in zzso of a zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex is shown not to be expressed during zzso but transcripts of all measured zzso complex genes are detected at significant levels during the initial stages of adult body plan zzso zzso zzso in the sequence of their zzso is observed, so that zzso follows the zzso arrangement of the zzso Moreover, zzso gene expression is zzso localized to the region of zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso This study shows that an indirectly developing zzso shares with an indirectly developing zzso the sea urchin, a common mode of zzso complex zzso construction of the zzso whether a zzso or zzso does not involve zzso cluster zzso but in both forms the complex is expressed in the zzso cells from which the adult body plan zzso
