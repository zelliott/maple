zzso shuttling activity of the African zzso fever virus zzso zzso a major structural protein of this highly complex virus, has been recently zzso The systematic characterization of the nuclear export ability of this protein constituted the major purpose of the present zzso We report that both the zzso and zzso regions of zzso protein are actively exported from the nucleus to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, experiments using zzso B and small interfering zzso targeting the zzso zzso have demonstrated that the export of zzso protein is zzso by both the zzso and zzso nuclear export zzso Two signals responsible for the zzso nuclear export of zzso protein were identified at the N zzso of the zzso and an additional signal was identified at the zzso region, which mediates the zzso nuclear zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso acids are critical to the function of these three nuclear export zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that two distinct pathways contribute to the strong nuclear export of full-length zzso zzso which is zzso by three independent nuclear export zzso The existence of overlapping nuclear export mechanisms, together with our observation that zzso protein is localized in the nucleus at early stages of infection and exclusively in the zzso at later zzso suggests that the nuclear transport ability of this protein may be critical to the African zzso fever virus replication zzso
