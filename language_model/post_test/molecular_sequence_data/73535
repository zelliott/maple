zzso zzso zzso secondary structure prediction was used in combination with comparative sequence analysis to construct models of folding for the zzso part of the zzso region of zzso belonging to four zzso zzso zzso of zzso secondary structure that are preserved among all the zzso studied were revealed, despite the high degree of sequence divergence between zzso At the same time, structural elements were observed that distinguish members of different zzso groups and, in particular, a region of remarkable structural divergence between the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Application of the genetic zzso also revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may take on alternative zzso which are not observed in the zzso of complementary minus strand zzso These alternative folding patterns may have roles in the regulation of zzso and translation initiation and in the switch between zzso
