zzso the structural basis for defects in protein function that zzso zzso genetic diseases is the fundamental requirement for development of zzso This situation is epitomized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene product known to be defective in zzso zzso appears particularly susceptible to zzso when its zzso is hampered by zzso at critical zzso While the primary zzso zzso in zzso has been localized to deletion of zzso binding fold zzso zzso zzso an increasing number of zzso (now zzso zzso are being associated with zzso disease of varying zzso Hundreds of these zzso occur in the zzso zzso domain, the site of the zzso zzso zzso This report summarizes our current knowledge on how zzso zzso of the zzso protein is recognized on the cellular zzso how specific types of zzso can contribute to the zzso process; and describes experimental approaches to detecting and zzso the structural consequences of zzso zzso
