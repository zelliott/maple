The zzso has been examined in mice of a range of synthetic zzso zzso which are based on a zzso backbone but which differ in zzso charge, zzso structure, and molecular zzso zzso zzso regardless of their size or primary structure at the zzso were cleared rapidly from the zzso the liver being the major site of zzso zzso with zzso acid in the side chain, which would be zzso under zzso conditions, showed a significantly prolonged blood survival, and this was seen with zzso in the range of molecular weights of 46,000 up to zzso Such zzso provide a useful system with which to investigate the effect of structural parameters on the zzso properties of carrier molecules and would allow the selection of candidate carriers for a variety of zzso
