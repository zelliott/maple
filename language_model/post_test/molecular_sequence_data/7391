The present study sought to resolve the contradictory evidence as to whether the zzso substitution at position zzso of the zzso gene promoter raises HDL cholesterol zzso levels by examining the effect of this zzso in French zzso a relatively genetically homogeneous zzso Among 308 women, carriers of the A zzso displayed zzso and zzso higher mean plasma zzso and zzso zzso respectively, than did zzso Among 345 men, no effect of the A zzso was zzso The frequency distribution of zzso levels in women carrying the A but not the G zzso appeared zzso with one peak corresponding to the mean of the zzso and a second to higher zzso Thus it appears that only a subset of A zzso zzso high zzso zzso This hypothesis was supported by data from four zzso within which some but not all A zzso zzso with zzso The data suggest that the A substitution in the zzso gene promoter does not directly zzso high zzso levels but may be in linkage zzso with other sequence zzso at this locus in a subset of zzso that raise zzso zzso
