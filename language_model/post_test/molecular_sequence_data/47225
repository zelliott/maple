zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso called zzso a systemic mobile signal that activates the synthesis of defense genes in zzso plants in response to zzso zzso The unusual primary structural features of the tomato zzso zzso and protein provided an extraordinary challenge in devising an expression system to obtain the full-length zzso zzso expression inhibited the growth of a zzso and several zzso hosts zzso zzso was initially zzso as a truncated protein of 185 zzso acids in length using a zzso zzso zzso expression system in zzso coli strain zzso The zzso was found to be due to two factors: zzso the zzso associations of the zzso coding region of the zzso sequence with the expression zzso zzso binding site and zzso the presence of a translation start site just prior to the zzso acid zzso at position zzso zzso that permitted the synthesis of the full-length zzso protein were introduced into the zzso zzso coding region of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso was zzso from zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso
