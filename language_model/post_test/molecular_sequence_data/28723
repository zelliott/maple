zzso reactions involving migration of zzso and, occasionally, other zzso have been found in the zzso zzso of zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso but not zzso + zzso zzso generated from several zzso carbohydrates and milk zzso zzso at their reducing zzso with aromatic zzso such as zzso Such zzso which are similar to those reported by other investigators from several zzso carbohydrates and zzso cause an apparent loss of sugar zzso from within a zzso chain and can produce ambiguous results during spectral zzso A zzso involving initial zzso of the zzso nitrogen atom of the zzso is proposed to account for the formation of the observed zzso
