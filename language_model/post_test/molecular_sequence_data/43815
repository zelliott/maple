We have analyzed the promoter and the coding sequences of the two zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso here termed zzso and zzso Both genes zzso proteins of 193 zzso acids and differ at just 16 zzso zzso zzso regulatory sequences identified in the promoter region are the same and are highly zzso However, significant differences exist in the zzso untranslated regions zzso of the transcribed sequences of these two zzso such as several deletions in the zzso of the zzso gene in comparison with the zzso gene zzso The zzso is a short sequence of about 200 zzso which is unexpected compared with the long zzso of zzso zzso zzso but it is in the same size range as in avian zzso zzso Thus, the main differences between these two genes are observed in sequences potentially involved in the regulation of the zzso gene expression such as the zzso The two genes are expressed during zzso and in several adult zzso We discuss these findings in terms of the evolution of zzso zzso genes in zzso and the appearance of zzso zzso in avian zzso
