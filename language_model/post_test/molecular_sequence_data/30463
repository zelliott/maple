zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso molecular weight zzso cell protein which is a highly zzso zzso for the induction of experimental zzso zzso zzso In this study we produced a series of zzso zzso zzso which define different zzso in the native zzso These zzso were further subdivided into three distinct groups based on a zzso and by zzso zzso using native zzso and synthetic peptides corresponding to its entire zzso acid zzso Group I zzso zzso and zzso bound to native zzso but not to any synthetic zzso suggesting that their zzso zzso are strictly zzso zzso Group II zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso to multiple peptides which shared zzso acid sequence similarity located within each of four zzso zzso indicating that these zzso are also zzso zzso In group III zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding was localized to a specific zzso The zzso binding site was further refined to zzso acid positions zzso to zzso in the native zzso zzso was also useful in zzso zzso in the mouse zzso by zzso zzso The application of these zzso in the study of zzso and zzso transport mechanisms is zzso
