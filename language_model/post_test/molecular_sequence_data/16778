Many embryonic patterning genes are remarkably zzso between zzso and zzso and the zzso genes are zzso examples of this zzso Yet even zzso genes can change dramatically in zzso Two genes in zzso and zzso zzso their ancestral roles as zzso genes and play very different zzso roles in the fruit fly zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso act in zzso zzso and in establishment of the zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso acts in zzso and zzso It would be valuable to know what mechanisms allowed zzso and zzso to abandon their ancestral roles as zzso genes and take on new zzso To explore the evolutionary transition of these zzso we analyzed their expression in a primitive zzso the zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns seem to represent a stage of evolution intermediate between the ancestral state seen in zzso zzso and the derived expression patterns in zzso These expression data help us to narrow the period in which the gene transitions took zzso zzso appears to have evolved directly into zzso within the insects, whereas zzso seems to have adopted the expression patterns of a zzso and zzso gene earlier in the zzso zzso
