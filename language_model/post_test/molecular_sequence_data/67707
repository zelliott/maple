The human nuclear factor related to zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein that is a component of the zzso zzso complex involved in zzso zzso zzso regulation, DNA replication and DNA zzso Although full length zzso is predicted to be around zzso zzso comparative sequence analysis identified several potentially structured sections in the zzso region of the zzso These regions were targeted for zzso studies, and the structure of one of these regions spanning zzso zzso was determined using the zzso zzso structure determination zzso The structure reveals a novel, mostly zzso domain reminiscent of the zzso fold typically involved in DNA zzso However, further analysis shows that this domain does not bind DNA, suggesting it may belong to a small group of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso
