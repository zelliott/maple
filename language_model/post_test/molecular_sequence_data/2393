Human zzso 18 zzso and zzso 8 zzso and their mouse zzso zzso B and zzso A, respectively, are expressed in adult mice primarily in a variety of simple zzso cell types in which they are normally found in equal amounts within the intermediate filament zzso zzso of zzso alone in mouse L cells or zzso zzso zzso from either the gene or a zzso expression zzso results in zzso protein which is zzso relatively rapidly without the formation of zzso A zzso zzso containing all coding sequences was isolated and expressed in mouse zzso either zzso or in combination with zzso zzso of zzso zzso L cells revealed that when zzso was expressed alone, it was zzso in a fashion similar to that seen previously for zzso However, expression of zzso in zzso that also expressed zzso resulted in stabilization of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed typical zzso filament organization in such zzso Thus, expression of a type I and a type II zzso was found to be both necessary and sufficient for formation of zzso filaments within zzso To determine whether a similar zzso system responsible for the degradation of zzso in zzso also exists in simple zzso cells which normally express a type I and a type II zzso a zzso truncated zzso protein missing the zzso tail domain and a zzso region of the central, zzso rod domain was expressed in mouse zzso zzso zzso This resulted in zzso of zzso zzso A and zzso B and zzso of the formation of typical zzso filament zzso zzso cells that normally express zzso contain a zzso system similar to that found in zzso manipulated zzso which degrades zzso proteins not found in their normal zzso zzso
