The zzso of human zzso virus type 3 zzso is a single zzso zzso strand zzso that is zzso zzso in zzso A zzso was constructed to zzso an zzso internally deleted version of zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the viral genes were replaced with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso gene was flanked in turn by sequences representing zzso zzso sequences of the first and last genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are presumed to be zzso signals, and zzso 3' zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso terminal regions of zzso zzso A second zzso was constructed to zzso the exact complement of zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso would zzso to the predicted zzso intermediate of zzso zzso When zzso in zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso separately into zzso cells, both zzso zzso and zzso were rescued with similar zzso that is, they were expressed to yield zzso and were packaged into particles that could be used to zzso fresh zzso zzso of zzso zzso was strictly dependent on zzso by zzso zzso could not be replaced by respiratory zzso virus or, unexpectedly, by a bovine strain of zzso zzso was blocked by prior incubation with zzso zzso zzso specific to the zzso attachment zzso Also, during nine serial passages, the expression of zzso by zzso zzso increased more than zzso These results indicated that the zzso 111 zzso and the zzso 115 zzso of zzso zzso which are present in zzso zzso contained all of the zzso zzso sequences required for zzso gene zzso and zzso
