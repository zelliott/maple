zzso and its closest relative zzso are members of the zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso zzso of zzso channels and are known to be zzso zzso By aligning the sequence of the putative zzso pore with the pore sequences of the other zzso members, we located in the loop between the fifth and the sixth zzso domain, a stretch of zzso acids zzso zzso as the potential selectivity zzso Two zzso charged zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso along the entire zzso zzso were identified as important zzso of zzso zzso through zzso because zzso of both zzso into an zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in channels with increased zzso for zzso and zzso decreased zzso red sensitivity and larger pore diameter compared to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso into zzso resulted in channels with lower zzso for zzso decreased sensitivity to zzso red block and reduced pore zzso Thus, these data demonstrate that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for channel function and that subtle zzso acid variation in the pore region accounts for zzso zzso zzso
