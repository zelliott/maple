The zzso clock in zzso is driven by an zzso zzso feedback mechanism that takes approximately 24 hours to zzso A key component of this mechanism is a zzso zzso zzso consisting of two basic zzso zzso zzso domain protein zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a complex containing the mouse zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals an unusual zzso zzso with the three zzso in each of the two zzso zzso and zzso intertwined and involved in zzso zzso resulting in three distinct protein zzso zzso that zzso the observed zzso zzso affect the stability and activity of the zzso complex as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso complex is a starting point for understanding at an atomic level the mechanism driving the zzso zzso zzso
