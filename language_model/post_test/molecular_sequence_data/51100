To probe the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso we determined the pH dependence of zzso and zzso zzso isotope effects on zzso and zzso pH zzso of zzso were determined for the zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso - zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso The pH zzso are all zzso with shoulders that extend from pH zzso to zzso The existence of a shoulder indicates that the reaction mechanism involves at least two routes to zzso These zzso are governed by three zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso isotope effect zzso provided the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso That zzso and zzso are different suggests that the zzso transition states for the processes governed by zzso and zzso cannot be the zzso We use these results, together with zzso to zzso zzso to develop a mechanism for zzso zzso
