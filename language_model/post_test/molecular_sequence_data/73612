zzso zzso by the zzso a zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso The identity of this zzso protein zzso is not yet known, but the recent identification of a new gene family zzso regulator of G protein signaling zzso proteins raises the possibility that the zzso GAP is an zzso zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso proteins act as zzso for alpha zzso of the zzso zzso of G zzso To identify an zzso protein that could be a GAP for the zzso alpha zzso we investigated the expression of zzso proteins in the zzso and identified a new zzso domain, zzso which is specifically expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso cells as well as in other cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso single turnover zzso of zzso by zzso We used zzso to isolate a full-length zzso zzso zzso a new zzso protein with a C zzso that zzso to zzso The zzso half of zzso contains a putative zzso domain and a string of nine zzso that are potential zzso for multiple zzso These findings suggest that zzso is an integral membrane protein and that it is a candidate for the zzso protein responsible for the GAP activity detected in zzso zzso
