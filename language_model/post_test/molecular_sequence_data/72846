During zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso whereas the later stages of spreading and focal zzso and stress fiber formation in primary zzso requires interactions of cell surface zzso with zzso zzso This zzso with protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso can become localized to focal zzso in normal, but not transformed, zzso zzso zzso has been thought to be downstream of initial zzso zzso We now show, however, that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The core protein of zzso can directly bind the zzso domain of zzso and zzso its zzso by zzso zzso It can also directly activate zzso in the absence of other zzso This activity resides in the sequence zzso in the center of the short zzso domain, and other zzso lack this sequence and zzso regulatory zzso zzso is a focal zzso zzso and this interaction may both zzso zzso and amplify its activity at sites of forming zzso This represents the first report of direct zzso signaling through cell surface zzso
