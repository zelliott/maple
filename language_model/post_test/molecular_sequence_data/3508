We report here the isolation and characterization of the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso We determined its complete zzso zzso its zzso organization, and zzso zzso Moreover, we analyzed the expression of this gene by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The structure of the gene was determined from a zzso zzso clone that encompasses the entire zzso zzso including the zzso zzso The zzso gene spans approximately 36 zzso and contains 49 zzso It is located on mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes at least two transcripts by alternative zzso of the second zzso the longest one being zzso zzso in zzso The deduced zzso contains zzso zzso zzso Its central region can be subdivided into 10 imperfect repeats, each composed of a zzso domain followed by a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is flanked by zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with its human zzso zzso revealed common features including high sequence similarities in the zzso and 3' regions, and the conservation of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso differs from its human zzso since no highly zzso repeated sequences could be identified within its central zzso zzso is expressed mainly in zzso zzso zzso and at a lesser extend in stomach and zzso
