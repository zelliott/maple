zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that zzso zzso resistance, has been cloned and zzso Replacement of an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso perfectly zzso in zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso zzso was found responsible for both zzso and zzso resistance zzso by zzso Gene fusion zzso designed to zzso zzso in zzso render zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso of zzso resistance was further demonstrated in zzso partial zzso carrying identical gene doses of both zzso zzso zzso cells have, at the same time, both the zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso activities were dramatically decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that this negative effect exerted by zzso results from the in zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
