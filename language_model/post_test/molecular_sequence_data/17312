zzso a zzso zzso binds to a number of plasma membrane zzso We characterized zzso promoter and carried out a detailed expression zzso The protein is widely distributed in adult cells and zzso zzso in the mouse zzso is apparent at day zzso zzso at day zzso and declines to its adult levels by day zzso The level of zzso zzso was minimally affected by exposure to zzso growth factors or zzso In zzso zzso early appearance, constant nature, and ubiquitous distribution suggest that it may be a key structural protein involved in mediation of zzso zzso
