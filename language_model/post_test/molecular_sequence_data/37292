In zzso zzso zzso strains from various European countries and from Africa, a new zzso sequence zzso zzso which is related to IS of the family of zzso zzso zzso has been identified by DNA sequence analysis and Southern zzso zzso zzso has a size of zzso and contains zzso repeats of zzso and a gene zzso the putative zzso on a single open reading zzso zzso is present only in the rarely isolated zzso zzso zzso G and H of zzso zzso where it is found in 1 to approximately 30 zzso The different patterns obtained by zzso of a zzso probe of zzso to zzso DNA cut with various restriction zzso correlate to some extent to the different zzso and to variations of the zzso sequences of the zzso genes of the different zzso Based on zzso zzso the strains of zzso zzso carrying zzso form a zzso separate from the other zzso IS patterns obtained with zzso allow a fine zzso of the zzso zzso zzso G and H of zzso zzso for zzso zzso The potential role of zzso and of its copy numbers on zzso and persistence of the respective strains requests further zzso
