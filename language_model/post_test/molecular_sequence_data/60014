Three of the four known mouse zzso genes have been mapped to zzso zzso To further characterize the spatial relationship of these zzso a bacterial artificial zzso zzso library of mouse zzso 14 was screened using mouse zzso protein zzso and zzso complementary zzso zzso One large clone zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso and was found by zzso chain reaction zzso to contain sequences from one of the mouse zzso zzso genes zzso We used Southern mapping and zzso of overlapping restriction fragments to characterize the gene zzso zzso was confirmed by fluorescent in zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA and by Southern zzso of restriction zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso and zzso genes reside zzso within a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are in the same zzso to 3' orientation and 16 zzso zzso The zzso gene is in the opposite orientation to the two other zzso zzso 13 zzso away from the 3' end of the zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene had not previously been zzso We found its size (13 zzso and organization to be similar to that of human zzso zzso I is zzso The second zzso is a hybrid zzso that contains signal for initiation of translation, signal zzso zzso domain, and the first seven collagen triplets of the zzso domain of the zzso Four short zzso zzso through zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso and zzso zzso and VIII the linking and the zzso zzso zzso
