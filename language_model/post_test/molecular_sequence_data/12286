An important zzso factor of zzso zzso is their ability to gain access to host zzso A type III zzso system zzso in the zzso and spa zzso of these organisms is essential for this zzso We have identified two zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso from the bacterial cells is dependent on this zzso The genes zzso these proteins are located at zzso 63 on the zzso zzso zzso immediately downstream of the previously identified zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso Tucker, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the genes zzso these proteins indicated that zzso and zzso have significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso rendered zzso zzso severely deficient for entry into cultured zzso zzso In addition, this zzso strain exhibited increased zzso of a selected group of proteins whose export is controlled by the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso in zzso did not result in an invasion zzso or in a significant decreased in zzso in a mouse model of zzso In addition, we have found an open reading frame immediately downstream of zzso that encodes a predicted protein with significant similarity to a family of zzso carrier zzso
