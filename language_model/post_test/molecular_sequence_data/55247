BK zzso zzso has recently been zzso as an emerging opportunistic pathogen of the human central nervous system zzso but it is not known whether specific strains are associated with the zzso character of zzso The presence of zzso large zzso DNA was examined in zzso zzso fluid zzso samples from neurological patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso Twenty patients had a large zzso zzso zzso The zzso control region zzso of the zzso strains amplified from zzso from these 20 patients, strains circulating in zzso and bone zzso transplant recipients and from healthy pregnant women was zzso The zzso zzso was the most prevalent in all groups and 14 of the neurological patients zzso zzso zzso while the remaining six patients possessed zzso with rearranged zzso similar to previously reported zzso from zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso cells revealed that five of six early and four of six late rearranged promoters of these zzso zzso showed significantly higher activity than the corresponding zzso zzso From seven of the neurological patients with zzso zzso zzso paired serum samples were zzso Five of them were negative for zzso DNA, while serum from the remaining two patients zzso zzso strains with zzso zzso that differed from those present in their zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso are not a hallmark for zzso zzso and the dissemination of a rearranged zzso from the blood may not be the origin of zzso zzso zzso
