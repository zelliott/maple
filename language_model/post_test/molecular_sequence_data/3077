The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes the sole zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso have dramatically enlarged zzso and cannot grow at elevated zzso Additionally, zzso zzso have nearly zzso levels of zzso suggesting that zzso functions to regulate zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we isolated a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the requirement for zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells suppresses the temperature sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso defects normally exhibited by zzso zzso We also identified a zzso zzso of zzso whose gene product contains a zzso zzso zzso domain, which suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells suppresses the temperature sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso and dramatically restores zzso zzso These results suggest that generation of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso whereas turnover of zzso is zzso in part by the zzso zzso zzso family member zzso
