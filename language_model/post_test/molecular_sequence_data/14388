zzso viruses are among the most important human pathogens and are responsible for annual zzso and zzso potentially devastating zzso The zzso immune response plays an important role in the defense against these zzso providing protection mainly by producing zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso However, their high genetic zzso allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal zzso The emergence of resistance to zzso drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of zzso The development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently zzso In this study, we describe a human zzso zzso zzso that recognizes a highly zzso zzso located on the stem region of the zzso and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with zzso and H5N1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus zzso
