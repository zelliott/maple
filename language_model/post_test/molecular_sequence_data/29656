Virtually all group A zzso zzso produce zzso S zzso a zzso toxin that is responsible for the zzso surrounding colonies of the organisms grown on blood zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso of zzso and recent studies have identified a zzso locus that is responsible for synthesis and transport of the zzso zzso is not zzso thus, no zzso zzso are evoked during the course of natural zzso In the present study, we show that a synthetic zzso containing zzso acid zzso 10 to 30 of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso in rabbits that completely neutralized the zzso activity of the toxin in zzso zzso of zzso was reversed by zzso of the immune serum with zzso zzso zzso indicating the specificity of the zzso In addition, zzso that were affinity zzso over an zzso zzso column completely inhibited zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not zzso group A zzso however, when combined with zzso M protein zzso the zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso by M protein zzso Thus, we have shown for the first time that it is possible to raise zzso zzso against one of the most potent bacterial zzso toxins zzso Our data also provide convincing evidence that the zzso gene actually encodes the zzso zzso of zzso The synthetic zzso may prove to be an important component of vaccines designed to prevent zzso zzso
