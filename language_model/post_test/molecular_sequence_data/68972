In this report it is suggested that at early stages of evolution zzso were responsible for zzso short zzso zzso packets which formed the zzso tandem repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso could have been the most probable template for such a zzso zzso has zzso with the zzso of tandem zzso repetitive elements of the zzso A model for the proposed participation of zzso in the genesis of zzso fragments is provided by analysis of the active center of zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso by the zzso in the context of mechanisms of zzso regulation, genes responsible for disease and human zzso memory formation are also zzso
