zzso zzso interactions are essential for controlling cell fate determination in both plants and zzso however, the chemical basis of zzso signals in plants remains little zzso A zzso factor named zzso mediates local and zzso zzso interactions required for zzso differentiation in zzso cells cultured in zzso Here we describe the zzso of zzso and cloning of its complementary DNA, and present evidence for its role in zzso The zzso backbone of zzso is a zzso zzso with properties of both zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly accumulates in the zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso has a polar zzso in the cell walls of zzso zzso zzso Double zzso of zzso lacking both genes that zzso zzso proteins show defects in vascular development: zzso zzso improperly interconnected vessel elements and simplified zzso Our results suggest that the polar zzso of zzso draws zzso cells into the zzso of vascular differentiation to direct continuous vascular development, thereby identifying a zzso that mediates an zzso zzso interaction involved in plant tissue zzso
