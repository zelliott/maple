The zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso of a normal cellular locus zzso A zzso zzso a zzso hormone zzso Although both the zzso A protein and zzso hormone zzso bind to DNA, the DNA sequence specificity of the viral zzso is altered from that of the normal cellular zzso zzso zzso acid differences in both the zzso domain and in a zzso zzso region of the zzso and zzso A zzso are jointly responsible for these differences in DNA zzso We demonstrate here that this newly recognized zzso zzso of DNA specificity appears to function by restricting the DNA sequence repertoire zzso by the zzso domain zzso The unique presence of a zzso in the N zzso of the zzso hormone zzso acts to abrogate this zzso thereby permitting this zzso to zzso response elements containing zzso zzso The ability of the N zzso to zzso the DNA recognition properties of nuclear hormone receptors extends to the zzso acid zzso and contributes to the distinct DNA zzso displayed by the zzso acid and zzso hormone zzso
