zzso zzso is a major structural protein of the inner root sheath cells and zzso layer of the hair zzso and, to a lesser extent, of other specialized zzso zzso is a high molecular weight zzso zzso protein that forms rigid structures as a result of zzso modifications by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso with loss of organized zzso The modified zzso is thought to serve as a zzso intermediate filament zzso protein and/or as a constituent of the cell zzso In this paper, we have explored in zzso the order of processing of zzso to fulfill these functions, using an expressed zzso more soluble form zzso zzso is a complete zzso for three known zzso expressed in zzso but the kinetic efficiency with zzso 3 is by far the zzso Following zzso conversion of its zzso to zzso zzso is zzso even more efficiently by zzso 3, using most zzso partially and all zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso of zzso or native pig tongue zzso can be zzso following zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest an in zzso model in which zzso located in zzso zzso droplets is first modified by zzso zzso which zzso it and makes it more zzso This renders it available for efficient zzso by zzso 3 to form highly zzso rigid structures in the zzso This zzso order of reaction is supported by the observation that zzso is expressed in hair zzso cells before the zzso 3 zzso
