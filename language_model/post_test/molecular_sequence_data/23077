zzso zzso zzso & zzso is a perennial herb belonging to the zzso family; its active zzso the zzso zzso zzso A, is a zzso zzso that produces zzso A comparative evaluation of zzso zzso fresh and dried leaves, zzso zzso fresh leaves, and dried zzso leaves claimed to be zzso zzso was zzso zzso data confirmed the presence of zzso A in both zzso zzso leaf extracts and the zzso leaves, whereas no zzso A was found in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene of all leaf samples and the dried zzso leaves was amplified by zzso using a pair of zzso located at the 3' and zzso ends of the coding sequence of zzso zzso The resulting zzso products (about zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were gel zzso zzso into zzso Easy zzso and zzso By aligning the isolated zzso zzso great zzso were found in the zzso region of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed on the sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso length zzso zzso method was applied using zzso and zzso restriction zzso An zzso site, absent in zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso region at zzso For zzso multiple sites zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso whereas a unique site was found in zzso zzso zzso The results of this work show that the combined use of zzso chemical zzso and molecular zzso zzso methods lead to the precise and unequivocal identification of zzso zzso
