To identify zzso regulated zzso associated with the cell cycle, we adopted the differential zzso display technique for cell cultures of zzso zzso synchronized by zzso heat zzso One zzso zzso that was expressed differently during zzso cell division had a greatly decreased expression at 30 zzso after the end of heat treatment zzso Using this zzso as a probe, we isolated the full-length zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a 651 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso shows zzso sequence identity compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso which zzso the formation of zzso from zzso via an zzso zzso The deduced sequence is also zzso and zzso identical compared with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced sequence of zzso zzso zzso also shares similar characteristics of the zzso motifs I and II in the zzso zzso To further investigate the actions of the gene zzso this zzso zzso expression was determined during the course of synchronized cell division in zzso zzso Northern zzso results show that the zzso level was dramatically decreased at 30 zzso after zzso prior to entering zzso cell division (which occurs 75 zzso after zzso suggesting that zzso expression of the zzso was associated with the cell cycle and that the zzso expression of zzso at 30 zzso after zzso would be required for the initiation of the oncoming zzso cell division in zzso zzso
