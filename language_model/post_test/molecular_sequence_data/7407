The gene zzso growth hormone zzso has been cloned from a rabbit zzso library, and its sequence has been zzso The rabbit zzso gene is similar to other zzso zzso being comprised of five zzso and four zzso As in zzso and zzso the rabbit zzso occurs as a single zzso with no evidence for a cluster of zzso zzso as is found in zzso The zzso acid sequence of rabbit zzso is similar to that of pig zzso and other zzso zzso zzso and, like these, differs markedly from the available sequences of zzso and zzso zzso This provides further support for the idea that, in zzso zzso show a slow underlying rate of evolution which has increased markedly on at least two zzso
