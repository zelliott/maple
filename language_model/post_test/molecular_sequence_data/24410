Using zzso from a zzso cell line as a template, zzso amplification was performed with the zzso and zzso zzso to isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the putative zzso acids induced by this zzso gave a fusion protein consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an extension protein of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso acid sequence of zzso was identical to those of humans, rats and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins were produced in zzso coli and zzso The fusion proteins had a molecular weight of about 42 zzso and were detected by zzso zzso with rabbit zzso zzso The zzso from zzso and zzso cells were subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular weights of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso cells were between 18 zzso and 24 zzso by zzso zzso These results suggested that there were more zzso proteins in the zzso zzso cells than in the zzso zzso
