zzso growth factor zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso induction and patterning of the developing inner zzso We have cloned the chick zzso of zzso and analyzed its expression pattern in the early chick zzso zzso is restricted to the zzso zzso and developing inner ear through all the stages zzso By the closed zzso stage, expression has resolved to anterior and zzso zzso that partially overlap with those of bone zzso protein 4 zzso a marker of the developing sensory patches, the zzso of the anterior and zzso semicircular zzso zzso growth factor alpha zzso another growth factor with restricted zzso zzso also zzso with zzso zzso The restricted expression pattern of zzso suggests a role for zzso signaling in the patterning of the sensory zzso together with zzso zzso
