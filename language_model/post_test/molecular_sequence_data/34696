The zzso complex is one of the components required for the regulation of the cell wall integrity checkpoint, which ensures the completion of cell wall zzso before zzso The core of the zzso complex is a backbone filament composed of zzso of an zzso zzso zzso which is also involved in nuclear zzso To examine the molecular basis for the dual functions of the zzso core zzso zzso in zzso we constructed 32 zzso zzso zzso We assessed the effects of the zzso on cell wall integrity checkpoint and nuclear migration functions and identified four categories of zzso 1) those showing no change from the wild type; 2) those resulting in a defective cell wall integrity checkpoint but normal nuclear zzso 3) those with a normal cell wall integrity checkpoint but defective nuclear zzso and 4) those defective in both the cell wall integrity checkpoint and nuclear migration zzso Our results show a separation of the two functions in the molecular structure of zzso and indicate that a local surface region of zzso is important in maintaining the cell wall integrity checkpoint zzso
