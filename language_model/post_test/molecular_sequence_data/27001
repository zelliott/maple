Two zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso marine bacteria, designated zzso and zzso were isolated from seawater samples collected in the shallow coastal region of zzso Harbour, zzso zzso zzso grown in broth cultures were straight rods that were zzso by means of a single polar zzso The two zzso required zzso for growth and grew zzso at about zzso degrees C, in zzso zzso and at pH zzso They grew zzso and could achieve zzso growth by zzso zzso or other zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the major cellular fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso had DNA zzso contents of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two strains had a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso and shared zzso sequence similarity with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso eight zzso species zzso two zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso eight zzso species zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite their high sequence zzso strains zzso and zzso had a zzso zzso value of only zzso The data obtained from these zzso zzso studies revealed that the two zzso zzso could be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type species and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso as a second zzso
