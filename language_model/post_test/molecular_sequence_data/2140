Our previously reported data from DNA sequence studies of the zzso locus show that the human zzso zzso 1 has an open reading frame capable of zzso a protein of 188 zzso acid zzso To confirm the presence of the open reading frame, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso that contains a segment of the zzso zzso zzso initiation region, a portion of the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso base pairs of the first zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso expresses a 38 zzso zzso protein zzso which was zzso by zzso liquid zzso The presence of zzso zzso 1 sequences in the zzso fusion protein was confirmed by partial zzso acid sequence zzso These experiments further establish that the first zzso of the human zzso gene contains an open reading frame capable of expressing a protein in zzso zzso
