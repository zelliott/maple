We established and characterized a new acute zzso leukemia zzso according to zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell line, zzso The zzso of the patient's zzso and zzso cells corresponded to that of zzso zzso The cells were positive for zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that the fresh zzso and zzso shared the same zzso gene zzso Conventional zzso analysis of fresh zzso from the patient and zzso cells revealed the zzso zzso the second most common additional zzso in zzso lymphoma, but no zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was not detected by Southern zzso zzso However, a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso The zzso cells were arrested at S phase with zzso and zzso and the synchronized cells progressed through the cell cycle in drug-free zzso The expression of zzso and max was observed throughout the cell cycle, as was found in the zzso zzso cell in zzso Our findings indicate that FISH analysis is of diagnostic value in detecting obscure zzso zzso and that zzso as well as zzso is expressed zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso
