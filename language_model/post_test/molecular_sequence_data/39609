zzso zzso was shown by theoretical analysis to be an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibited a zzso surface area of zzso zzso zzso possession of zzso structure at an zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso showed the zzso to be zzso zzso in the presence of zzso mimics of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso transition analysis showed the zzso to induce large decreases in the fluidity of these zzso coli membrane zzso and zzso trough analysis found the zzso to induce large surface pressure changes in zzso mimics of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso based on mixing zzso zzso and the Gibbs free energy of mixing zzso predicted that these zzso were zzso stable zzso and zzso each zzso but were zzso by the presence of the zzso zzso and zzso each zzso The zzso was found to have a minimum lethal concentration of 3 zzso against zzso coli and was seen to cause zzso of zzso at 5 zzso In zzso these data clearly show that zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest that both its zzso zzso characteristics and the composition of its target membrane are important zzso of its efficacy of zzso
