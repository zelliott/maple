The manipulation of a zzso zzso target by forming different zzso hybrids demonstrates the possibility of zzso the zzso strand within zzso This was achieved using the sequence composition of the zzso zzso an approach that results in various zzso zzso zzso in the zzso target, which is then zzso at these specific zzso sites under free metal zzso or metal complex zzso zzso zzso promoted by metal zzso were performed under mild conditions and characterized by separating the zzso fragments carrying end zzso The observed products result from zzso zzso causing zzso strand zzso No zzso zzso of the zzso was observed with either a fully complementary zzso hybrid or a zzso base in the zzso zzso A molecular modeling study of the zzso backbone suggests that the local zzso of the zzso backbone at a zzso in such hybrid duplexes greatly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within an zzso hybrid by metal complexes attached to the zzso zzso might lead to a new approach in zzso technology with artificial zzso which operate with zzso zzso
