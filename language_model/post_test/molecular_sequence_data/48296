zzso zzso is a component of the zzso protein complex, which is involved in the zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to determine the manner in which zzso of zzso human zzso zzso or zzso human zzso zzso zzso regulates brain functions and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso For this, we created transgenic zzso mice expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and measured their zzso as time zzso The zzso and zzso zzso groups exhibited greater behavioral dysfunction from 10 months of age than the zzso group, although their zzso zzso Further, activity and component levels of the zzso complex were significantly elevated in zzso zzso mice, expect for zzso These zzso induced stimulation of zzso processing, resulting in overproduction of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group, whereas the zzso zzso group showed a comparatively weaker zzso Furthermore, the highest expression levels of zzso and zzso were observed in the zzso zzso group, similar to other zzso zzso a zzso interference on the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso groups compare with zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso in zzso mice promoted active assembly of the zzso complex through zzso of zzso processing and behavior, whereas the lesser effect in zzso zzso mice was due to reduced expression of zzso These zzso mice could be useful for the development and application of therapeutic drugs in an animal model of Alzheimer's zzso
