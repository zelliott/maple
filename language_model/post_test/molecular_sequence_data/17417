To understand the genetic variations between the field strains of waterfowl zzso and their attenuated zzso we analyzed the complete zzso sequences of the viral protein 1 zzso genes of nine field strains and two vaccine strains of waterfowl zzso zzso comparison of the zzso proteins showed that these viruses could be divided into goose zzso zzso related and zzso duck zzso zzso related zzso The zzso acid difference between zzso and zzso groups ranged from zzso to zzso and the most variable region resided in the N zzso of zzso The vaccine strains of zzso and zzso exhibited only zzso and zzso difference in zzso acid when compared with their parental field zzso and most of these differences resided in zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that these zzso might be important for the zzso of zzso and zzso When the zzso strains isolated in 1982 (the strain zzso and in 2001 (the strain zzso were zzso only zzso difference in zzso acid was found, while zzso strains isolated in 1990 (the strain zzso and 1997 (the strain zzso showed only zzso difference in zzso zzso The result indicates that the zzso of waterfowl zzso had remained highly stable in the zzso
