zzso zzso acid bacteria zzso can potentially replace zzso in reducing the zzso of starchy zzso However, the drawback of using zzso is their low and delayed zzso zzso This zzso searching for efficient zzso and strategies to improve their zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 and zzso zzso zzso 24, isolated from zzso were used to zzso zzso in MRS zzso zzso zzso sweet zzso and commercial soluble zzso The zzso activity of zzso 21 was comparable to that of the zzso collection strain zzso zzso zzso while that of zzso 24 was extremely zzso zzso 21, zzso 24, and their zzso were compared to A6 and zzso zzso for ability to zzso and reduce the zzso of zzso zzso zzso dry zzso zzso and the zzso lowered the pH from zzso to zzso within 12 zzso while zzso as a carrier of wild starter took about 20 zzso zzso increased zzso acid yield by zzso and zzso compared to the yields of zzso 21 and zzso 24 zzso zzso The zzso accumulated significantly larger zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso and zzso than the zzso zzso zzso control and the zzso zzso more starch in zzso zzso than the zzso The zzso initiated changes in the zzso parameters storage zzso zzso loss zzso zzso phase angle zzso and complex zzso zzso earlier than its constituent zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was reduced significantly zzso zzso zzso from 1950 zzso to 110 zzso zzso 281 zzso zzso 382 zzso zzso zzso 713 zzso zzso 24), and zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso with weak zzso or zzso can be exploited for preparation of zzso weaning foods and increasing zzso acid yield from starchy zzso
