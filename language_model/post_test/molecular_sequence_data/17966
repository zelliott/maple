Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have an zzso core structure, the zzso complex, zzso from which extend zzso zzso This arrangement permits a novel approach to the analysis of zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso the types of DNA sequences zzso associated with the SC and the types located primarily in the zzso zzso can be zzso With zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso to zzso we present evidence for differential zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso is associated exclusively with the two ends of each zzso SC rather than with the zzso zzso The minor satellite DNA sequences are predominantly localized to the zzso region of the zzso as defined by zzso serum zzso zzso In contrast, the major satellite DNA probe zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and a probe containing a LINE sequence zzso to zzso zzso in general with no obvious preference for the zzso These observations demonstrate that, depending on the type of DNA zzso the zzso has different properties in regard to its association with the zzso
