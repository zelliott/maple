zzso zzso zzso exists as several zzso that are found in various compartments in plant zzso The zzso and zzso zzso appear to play important roles in zzso metabolism in plant cells, yet the function of zzso zzso is not well zzso In this study, the zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso was confirmed by studying the green fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein in transgenic zzso zzso was found to zzso with a reporter protein that was targeted to zzso by the zzso targeting signal zzso The function of zzso in zzso was investigated by zzso an zzso knockout zzso under normal and several stress zzso It was found that loss of function in zzso does not affect zzso growth and development, suggesting that zzso may not be an important zzso zzso in zzso at least under the conditions that were tested, or the function of zzso could be compensated by other zzso zzso in plant zzso
