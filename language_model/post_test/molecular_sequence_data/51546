The adhesive protein von zzso factor is essential for the formation of zzso zzso under flow conditions characterized by high zzso zzso This function requires the interaction with two distinct zzso zzso the zzso complexes zzso and zzso zzso with the former results in zzso zzso a necessary step for binding to the latter and supporting stable zzso The zzso of von zzso factor binding to zzso zzso can be achieved with small zzso fragments containing the specific functional domain of the zzso that interacts with this zzso zzso Such fragments may provide a new selective approach to zzso zzso
