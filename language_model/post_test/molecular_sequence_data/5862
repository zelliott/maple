In the past few years numerous binding and zzso motifs have been isolated from pools of random zzso acid zzso To extend the utility of this approach it is important to learn how to design zzso pools that provide zzso access to rare zzso In an effort to better define the relative merits of longer and shorter pools zzso pools with longer or shorter zzso zzso we have examined the zzso effect of excess arbitrary sequence on zzso activity and have evaluated whether this zzso zzso the calculated advantage of longer zzso 

The calculated advantage of longer sequences was highly dependent on the size and complexity of the desired zzso zzso simple motifs were not much more abundant in longer zzso In contrast, larger zzso particularly the most complex zzso zzso zzso were much more likely to be present in longer zzso The zzso determined zzso of activity by excess sequence was moderate, with bulk effects among four libraries ranging from no effect to zzso zzso The median effect among 60 clones was fivefold zzso 

For zzso simple motifs zzso motifs at least as small and simple as the zzso zzso zzso longer pools have little if any zzso For more complex zzso the zzso effect of excess sequence does not approach the calculated advantage of pools of longer zzso Thus, when seeking to access rare activities, the length of typical zzso pools zzso or zzso 70 random zzso is shorter than zzso As this conclusion holds over a range of incubation conditions, it may also be relevant when considering the emergence of new functional motifs during early zzso
