We had previously isolated six zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso named zzso to zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we cloned the zzso gene by zzso of the zzso growth zzso The zzso gene consists of three zzso and encodes a putative protein of 218 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence reveals that the protein is a potential membrane protein with four zzso zzso The zzso shows significant similarity to the zzso zzso putative protein zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso restores the ability to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene is expressed in both zzso cells of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso could be a component involved in zzso zzso
