A zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from activated sludge used for enhanced biological zzso removal in a sequencing batch zzso The cells of the isolate were zzso zzso zzso rods with single polar zzso Growth was observed to occur at zzso degrees C zzso at 30 degrees zzso and at pH zzso zzso at pH zzso The zzso fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso : zzso and summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso and the polar lipids comprised a large amount of zzso and a small amount of zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso % and the major zzso was zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analyses showed that strain zzso formed a zzso lineage with the zzso zzso within the family zzso The levels of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with respect to the type strains of zzso species ranged from zzso to zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and molecular data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
