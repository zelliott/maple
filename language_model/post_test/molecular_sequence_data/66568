Many zzso important zzso zzso bacterial zzso and viral envelope zzso are activated by the zzso zzso zzso which makes zzso inhibitor a hot target for basic research and drug zzso Although synthetic and zzso zzso of zzso have been well zzso its zzso inhibitor has not been directly zzso from zzso zzso to zzso In this study, three zzso were zzso from the zzso liver by using a combination of zzso techniques, and identified to be the zzso truncated fragments with different sizes of zzso zzso The gene of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso further confirming the determined zzso These three zzso fragments inhibited zzso with Ki values around 2 zzso zzso m while the full-length zzso zzso inhibited it with a lesser activity, suggesting that the zzso activity relies on the zzso zzso zzso Though the zzso was temporary, these zzso were specific, and the zzso site of one zzso zzso was zzso A 36 zzso acid zzso around the zzso site was zzso which could still inhibit zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso zzso zzso
