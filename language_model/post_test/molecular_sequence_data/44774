A zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso After zzso and characterization the zzso was found to be homogeneous by zzso and had a molecular mass of zzso Da by zzso and 72,000 Da by gel zzso indicating that it is zzso The zzso point was zzso and optimum pH was zzso It showed a specific activity of zzso zzso which is the highest of the values shown by known zzso The zzso zzso zzso I to zzso II and zzso released zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso could not cleave zzso zzso bonds, or zzso The zzso activity was completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but it was not affected by general zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso completely restored the original activity of the zzso zzso treated with zzso These results suggest that this zzso is a zinc zzso The characteristics of the zzso zzso are slightly different from those of the zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and considerably from those of the zzso from zzso zzso
