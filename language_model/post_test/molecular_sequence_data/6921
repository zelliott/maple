The rat complement regulator zzso zzso is present in a widespread distribution as at least two discrete proteins of Mr zzso and zzso The molecular basis for the different proteins has not been zzso We screened a zzso library derived from cultured rat zzso zzso cells with a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso probe for zzso and zzso Two identical clones with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso The sequence was identical to zzso zzso of the zzso for rat zzso zzso except for 11 zzso at the extreme zzso and 3' ends and an exact zzso of 186 bases that would zzso an additional complete short consensus repeat zzso By reverse zzso zzso we show that the two forms of zzso zzso exist in all rat zzso zzso It is likely that these two zzso zzso species differ by the absence or presence of a 186 base repeat that encodes a complete zzso These are translated into zzso zzso containing six and seven zzso respectively, which explains the different sizes of zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso remains to be zzso
