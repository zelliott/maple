The zzso zzso family of proteins mediate the transport of ammonium across cellular zzso in a wide range of zzso Certain zzso members of this group are required to initiate zzso zzso We have investigated the functions of two members of the zzso family from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are low- and zzso ammonium zzso respectively, and a zzso lacking both zzso is unable to grow under zzso zzso zzso is zzso induced in response to nitrogen zzso whereas zzso is zzso zzso Single and double zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso in two models of zzso zzso with this, the formation of two zzso zzso zzso factors, cell wall zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is not impaired in cells lacking either or both of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is, however, required for the initiation of invasive growth of zzso cells under zzso conditions and for the mating of zzso cells under the same zzso We propose that zzso may be a new zzso ammonium sensor and an element of the signaling zzso that govern the mating of zzso zzso in response to environmental nutritional zzso
