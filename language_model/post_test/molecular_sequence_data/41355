Inspired by bacterial zzso we present a promising strategy of how to engineer peptides to probe various mechanical strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment of bacterial zzso reveals that the bacterial zzso connecting the zzso binding motifs recognizing zzso show considerable zzso in zzso Their length regulates the zzso affinities for zzso zzso when stretched into different mechanical strain zzso This platform has potential applications in probing zzso zzso fiber strains in zzso
