To analyze the region upstream of zzso a number of novel zzso were zzso These were generated by zzso walking starting from the zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso line 380 and by cloning the zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso cell line zzso Using the newly isolated zzso a detailed physical map of 500 zzso of the region upstream of zzso was established applying zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells was mapped to a site 55 zzso zzso of zzso A region 20 zzso in length and containing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was identified zzso zzso upstream of zzso In addition the zzso integration site in zzso cells was located between 340 and 500 zzso zzso of zzso The zzso were used to define the zzso amplification units in zzso and zzso cells as well as in four cases of small cell lung zzso Evidence is provided that the zzso of zzso cells is zzso zzso
