zzso of the upstream region of a human G gamma gene linked to the zzso zzso revealed a zzso deletion between site zzso and zzso Further analysis revealed that this zzso is present in 37% of the zzso cell anemia patients bearing the zzso zzso and is absent in the other zzso linked to the beta S zzso as well as in most zzso bearing the beta zzso zzso The most zzso interpretation of the data is that the deletion is a very recent event which occurred in the subset of zzso zzso already bearing a gene conversion of the A gamma gene by the G gamma zzso Its presence in black beta S zzso is most probably the consequence of a zzso between a zzso beta S zzso (with deletion and gene zzso and a beta A zzso
