The turnover of a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso has earlier been found to increase during periods of zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso expression was analyzed by zzso in zzso zzso in zzso Learning of an active avoidance response resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso expression 20 zzso to 4 h after acquisition of the zzso In contrast, zzso control animals that were exposed to the same numbers of zzso and zzso stimuli in a random, zzso manner exhibited a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso signals were also increased by injection of zzso zzso into brain zzso zzso zzso was exclusively localized to zzso zzso of the inner zzso cell zzso zzso microscopic investigation, however, revealed zzso also in distinct zzso and zzso cell populations in which no zzso zzso had been zzso zzso of zzso protein factors into zzso and zzso cells may therefore be of functional importance for plastic adaptations of the zzso
