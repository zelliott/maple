The zzso of zzso cell surface zzso follows cellular zzso and changes in the pattern of expression are seen in various zzso and zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso chain zzso structures zzso zzso 2 chain, zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso group system was investigated in 19 normal fetal zzso zzso age 16 to 39 weeks) and in 19 zzso in order to study possible zzso changes in the zzso zzso The material was investigated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso tissue using zzso zzso with defined zzso In fetal zzso the zzso cells of the zzso and the zzso bodies strongly expressed zzso zzso structures zzso zzso and zzso In a few cases the cortical zzso cells zzso expressed zzso and zzso Compared with fetal zzso 16 of the zzso showed a total loss, or a very much reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso which zzso had been reclassified according to zzso & zzso zzso as high grade zzso zzso revealed strong expression of zzso moderate expression of zzso and weak expression of zzso This is of interest as in other tumors zzso is correlated with increased cell zzso and with poor zzso
