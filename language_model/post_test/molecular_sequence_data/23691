zzso in zzso of zzso have been shown to zzso expression of several genes that are normally zzso by zzso A zzso zzso the zzso operator zzso was identified near promoters of zzso zzso in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso factor needed for zzso zzso and the two zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences abolished zzso zzso Most of these genes were zzso expressed in the zzso host, zzso zzso but introduction of the cloned zzso gene zzso expression of these zzso genes in this zzso host if the corresponding zzso sequences were also zzso These observations are the first to examine the mechanisms of zzso which has no sequence similarity to well-known zzso regulators such as zzso or zzso They provide strong circumstantial evidence that zzso is a zzso regulator that binds to zzso regulatory sequences near the promoters of at least some of the genes whose expression it controls in response to zzso zzso
