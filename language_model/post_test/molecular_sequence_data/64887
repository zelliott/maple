zzso changes of peptides containing the zzso dye zzso acid zzso are studied with zzso zzso zzso peptides are a new class of molecules where the zzso dye zzso is linked to the zzso zzso via a flexible zzso zzso The zzso reactions in the zzso to zzso time domain are investigated for the optical switch zzso a linear and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso containing an additional zzso zzso These molecules with increasing zzso constraints are studied for the zzso to trans and the trans to zzso zzso For the zzso to trans reaction the zzso of the zzso occurs fast in the zzso range, whereas it is slower zzso zzso in the trans to zzso zzso In all peptides the structural changes of the zzso lead to modifications in the zzso structure in the zzso time zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso acts simultaneously as a fast molecular switch and as a sensor for initial zzso dynamics in the zzso zzso in the zzso range where the structural changes of the zzso backbone are directly observed demonstrate that the essential part of the structural dynamics in the zzso zzso zzso occurs faster than 10 zzso
