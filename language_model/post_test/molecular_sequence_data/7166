The avian neural zzso zzso is derived from zzso zzso precursors which differentiate after terminal zzso and become organized in cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells can be induced by infection with zzso zzso virus zzso and requires the expression of a functional zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene expressed exclusively at the stage of growth arrest and differentiation during retinal zzso In zzso cells infected with zzso an zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso capacity, zzso expression is zzso in zzso cells at 37 degrees C and is fully restored when the cells become zzso as a result of zzso zzso at 41 degrees zzso We were able to arrest proliferation of zzso quail zzso cells expressing an active zzso protein by serum zzso at 37 degrees zzso This allowed us to investigate the role of cell growth in regulating zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells at 37 degrees C compared with that in zzso cells maintained at the same zzso Growth zzso stimulation of zzso zzso requires the integrity of the A box, a previously characterized zzso element responsible for zzso zzso stimulation upon zzso zzso and during retinal zzso We also show that formation of the C1 complex on the A box is increased upon growth arrest by serum zzso in the presence of an active zzso zzso Thus, the C1 complex represents an important link between cell cycle and zzso control of zzso gene zzso during zzso differentiation and zzso zzso By using zzso directed against different zzso proteins of the zzso zzso family and competition with zzso consensus zzso zzso in a gel shift zzso we show that the C1 complex is likely to contain a zzso zzso We also show that a zzso zzso expressed zzso protein is able to bind the A box and that the level of a zzso zzso protein is increased upon growth arrest in infected retinal zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso quail zzso cells is able to stimulate zzso of a zzso reporter gene through the A zzso zzso zzso appears to be the first target gene for a zzso zzso in the zzso
