The zzso zzso zzso has a zzso life cycle, alternating between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and reside in the zzso environment of the zzso zzso show distinct zzso and zzso changes during differentiation into zzso These zzso are believed to be regulated by zzso expression of a discrete number of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso technique, identified two genes zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel gene family, zzso and a zzso expressed zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed zzso expression of these genes and zzso showed a zzso higher abundance of zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso zzso The zzso gene was predicted to contain a zzso open reading frame zzso that was zzso repeated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis predicted that the zzso zzso encodes either a zzso or a zzso protein that may have a functional role in zzso differentiation or zzso zzso zzso
