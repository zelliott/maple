Comparative zzso approaches and zzso biology are valuable tools for genetic zzso zzso connections between genes zzso in human disease states and zzso in model organisms can be particularly powerful, as zzso gene function data and experimental approaches can shed light on the molecular mechanisms defective in the zzso We describe a project that is systematically identifying novel expressed sequence tag zzso sequences that are highly related to genes in model organisms and mapping them to positions on the mouse and human zzso This process effectively zzso model zzso genes with mapped zzso zzso zzso the identification of genes zzso in human disease states via the zzso candidate zzso A public database, zzso zzso disseminates similarity search, mapping and zzso zzso information and increases the rate at which these zzso connections are zzso
