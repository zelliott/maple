zzso late gene expression is initiated as an infected zzso cell zzso through the zzso layers of the zzso resulting in the onset of zzso viral DNA replication and the expression of viral late zzso We have used a large synthetic zzso library displayed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to isolate three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which recognize distinct zzso on the zzso late protein of zzso A zzso zzso zzso was generated by zzso technology, and zzso zzso zzso was prepared by zzso zzso zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso had an affinity for zzso of approximately zzso zzso All zzso recognized the protein in zzso archival material, allowing us to map events in the late stages of virus zzso zzso of zzso in zzso does not coincide with synthesis of the major virus coat protein zzso but precedes it by 1 or 2 cell layers in zzso zzso caused by zzso and by up to 20 cell layers in zzso zzso In higher grade zzso associated with zzso zzso is produced in the absence of zzso By contrast, zzso viral DNA replication and zzso expression correlate exactly and in some zzso begin as the infected zzso cell leaves the zzso zzso zzso markers such as zzso zzso and certain zzso are not zzso in zzso cells, and nuclear zzso is zzso zzso zzso has a zzso distribution in the lower zzso zzso but associates with solitary zzso structures in more differentiated zzso zzso to the zzso of the protein stained these structures zzso Our findings are compatible with a role for the zzso zzso protein in zzso DNA replication or in zzso the zzso of the infected cell to favor virus synthesis or virus zzso The zzso will be of value in the evaluation of model systems for mimicking zzso infection in zzso
