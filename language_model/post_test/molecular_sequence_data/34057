We present here the first structural report derived from breast cancer zzso zzso 1 zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein group, which, during recent years, have drawn much attention since they suppress zzso without affecting the growth of the primary zzso The relevance of the predicted zzso coiled zzso on the molecular recognition of some of the zzso partners, on its cellular zzso and on the role of zzso biological functions such as zzso repression prompted us to characterize its three-dimensional structure by X-ray zzso The structure of zzso zzso region reveals that zzso zzso form an zzso zzso motif and, also, that it has the capability of zzso in a zzso zzso by forming a zzso of zzso zzso We have also performed zzso experiments that strongly supported the prevalence in solution of this zzso structure for zzso This work explores the structural features of zzso zzso region to help clarify the role of this area in the context of the full-length zzso Our zzso and zzso results suggest that the biological function of zzso may be affected by its ability to promote molecular zzso through its zzso zzso zzso
