zzso zzso profound deafness affects about 1 in 2000 children prior to language zzso In zzso of the cases, the mode of transmission is zzso zzso The number of genes involved in these zzso forms of isolated deafness zzso zzso has been estimated to between 30 and zzso So far, ten zzso genes have been mapped to human zzso one of which has been zzso By linkage analysis of a single family whose members were affected with profound deafness, some of them presenting with zzso dysfunction, zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene responsible for a form of Usher syndrome type I, zzso has been assigned to the same zzso zzso Usher syndrome associates profound zzso deafness and zzso dysfunction with zzso zzso In the zzso zzso region are located the zzso zzso responsible for deafness and zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso result from zzso in the gene zzso zzso Based on mapping data as well as on the similarities between the zzso of zzso patients and zzso mouse zzso we have proposed that a defective zzso may also be responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of each of the coding zzso of the zzso gene zzso was thus undertaken in the zzso zzso In the last zzso of zzso 15, a G to A transition was zzso a type of zzso that is known to decrease the efficiency of zzso zzso this result shows that different zzso in zzso result in either an isolated or a zzso form of zzso
