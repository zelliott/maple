zzso acid zzso is the major fatty acid of seeds of zzso zzso This fatty acid contains structural features that are not typically found in plant fatty zzso including a zzso zzso group, zzso double bonds, and zzso zzso zzso sequence tag analysis was conducted to determine the zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso for two divergent forms of zzso acid zzso designated zzso and zzso were identified among expressed sequence tags generated from developing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and soybean zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso rather than the more typical zzso zzso When zzso with zzso in soybean zzso or zzso zzso converted zzso into zzso zzso When zzso was expressed alone in soybean zzso or together with a typical zzso acid zzso in zzso trace amounts of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso were formed from zzso activity with zzso acid zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso the conversion of the zzso double bond of zzso acid into a zzso zzso group and zzso double bond and displays a zzso preference for the zzso rather than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso these data are consistent with a zzso zzso of zzso acid involving the concerted activities of zzso and zzso The evolution of two divergent zzso acid zzso for the zzso of an unusual fatty acid is unprecedented in zzso
