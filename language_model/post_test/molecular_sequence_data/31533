The evolutionary interplay between zzso virus zzso and the European rabbit zzso zzso following release of the virus in Australia in 1950 as a biological control is a classic example of zzso zzso We present a detailed zzso and zzso analysis of 30 strains of zzso including the Australian zzso strain Standard Laboratory zzso zzso 24 Australian viruses isolated from 1951 to 1999, and three zzso from the early radiation in Britain from 1954 and zzso We show that in Australia zzso has spread rapidly on a spatial scale, with multiple lineages zzso within individual zzso and that both highly virulent and attenuated viruses were still present in the field through the zzso In addition, the detection of closely related virus lineages at sites 1,000 zzso apart suggests that zzso moves freely in geographic space, with zzso zzso and rabbit migration all providing means of zzso zzso despite multiple introductions, all modern viruses appear to be ultimately derived from the original introductions of zzso The zzso of zzso evolution was also apparent at the zzso scale, with gene zzso documented in a number of zzso zzso of potential zzso genes may be important in increasing the expression of zzso proteins and provides the basis for the evolution of novel zzso zzso leading to loss of open reading frames were surprisingly frequent and in some cases may explain zzso but no common zzso that correlated with zzso or zzso were zzso
