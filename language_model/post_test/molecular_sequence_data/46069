While zzso primer design for the amplification of known sequences is usually quite straightforward, the design, and successful application of zzso aimed at the detection of as yet unknown genes is often zzso The search for genes that are presumed to be zzso related to a known gene zzso such as zzso genes in different species, zzso in the same zzso or novel pathogens in diverse zzso often turns into the proverbial search for the needle in the zzso zzso methods commonly used to address this issue involve the use of either consensus zzso or zzso zzso both of which have significant shortcomings regarding sensitivity and zzso We have developed a novel primer design approach that diminishes these shortcomings and instead takes advantage of the strengths of both consensus and zzso primer designs, by combining the two concepts into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a relatively short zzso 3' core and a zzso zzso zzso The 3' zzso core consists of a pool of zzso containing all possible zzso for a zzso zzso motif that is highly zzso in multiply aligned sequences from known members of a protein zzso Each primer in the pool also contains a single zzso zzso zzso sequence derived from a zzso consensus across the aligned zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso During the initial zzso amplification cycles, the zzso core is responsible for specific binding to sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso The longer consensus clamp region serves to stabilize the primer and allows the participation of all zzso in the pool in the efficient amplification of products during later zzso zzso We have developed an interactive web site and zzso zzso for designing zzso zzso zzso from multiply aligned protein zzso which is freely available zzso Here, we describe the zzso of a typical zzso zzso zzso design and zzso and give a specific zzso example along with zzso zzso
