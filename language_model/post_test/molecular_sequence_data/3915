zzso zzso 1 zzso is the most common inherited zzso disease in zzso The disorder, characterized by zzso muscle wasting and zzso zzso insulin resistance, and mental zzso is caused by the expansion of an unstable zzso repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of zzso The repeat expansion suppresses the expression of the zzso gene zzso We describe here an experimental system to identify downstream zzso targets of mouse zzso in order to zzso the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso By zzso a zzso active zzso zzso using zzso gene transfer in zzso cells and subsequent expression profiling using zzso zzso 21 zzso whose expression level increased by the treatment, were identified as potential target zzso Genes expressed in the zzso skeletal muscles, brain and zzso comprised the majority, suggesting the role of zzso in the development and function of zzso zzso and zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso a component of zzso signaling is a direct zzso Moreover, the overall expression level of zzso was decreased in zzso mouse zzso and the response of human zzso to zzso muscle conversion was altered in cells of zzso zzso Our results not only identify zzso as an zzso that directs zzso expression but also suggest that reduced zzso expression in zzso might contribute to specific aspects of the zzso zzso
