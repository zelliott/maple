zzso are a family of zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso which are supposed to zzso zzso of a zzso protein within the zzso It remains unclear whether zzso of the zzso zzso have a common sequence feature that allows specific zzso by zzso We showed previously that zzso the zzso coli zzso can cleave a type I model membrane protein zzso having the second zzso region of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso region in zzso and in zzso and that zzso for zzso reside within the zzso zzso Here we characterized sequence features in zzso that allow efficient zzso by zzso and identified two zzso a zzso region encompassing the zzso site and zzso zzso in the downstream zzso zzso zzso of the positioning of zzso relative to the zzso site was zzso These two elements appear to zzso promote zzso of zzso by zzso Finally, random zzso of the zzso site zzso in combination with in zzso screening revealed that zzso prefers zzso with a small side chain and a negative charge at the zzso and zzso sites zzso
