Through a variety of techniques, several investigators have demonstrated the presence of an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso collecting zzso suggesting that this zzso serves an important zzso role in the regulation of zzso balance and zzso zzso by the zzso The present study was designed to zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso in rat and rabbit kidney by zzso in zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso of rabbit zzso zzso zzso was used to produce zzso zzso by in zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso demonstrated transcripts in rat gastric zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso on kidney tissue sections demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, including zzso cells in the connecting segment and cortical and zzso collecting zzso principal cells in the inner stripe of the outer zzso collecting zzso and inner zzso collecting duct cells in both the rat and the zzso These observations provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso is present throughout the collecting duct of the zzso The distribution of this message is consistent with a role for zzso in zzso zzso in both the outer and inner zzso collecting zzso
