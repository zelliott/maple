zzso birds rely on stored food to survive the winter, and spatial memory has been shown to be critical in successful zzso zzso Both spatial memory and the zzso an area of the brain involved in spatial memory, exhibit significant geographic variation linked to zzso environmental harshness and the potential reliance on food zzso for zzso Such geographic variation has been suggested to have a zzso basis associated with differential zzso Here, we ask whether population genetic differentiation and potential isolation among multiple populations of zzso zzso zzso is associated with differences in memory and zzso zzso by exploring population genetic structure within and among groups of populations that are divergent to different degrees in zzso zzso Using zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso we found that population divergence in zzso zzso is not significantly associated with neutral genetic divergence or geographic distance, but instead is significantly associated with differences in winter zzso These results are consistent with variation in a history of natural selection on memory and zzso zzso that creates and maintains differences in these traits regardless of population genetic structure and likely associated gene zzso
