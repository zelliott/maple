The crystal structure of zzso binding protein 4 zzso from zzso coli, which has both zzso and zzso activity, is zzso zzso is one of 12 zzso binding proteins in zzso coli involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the cell zzso The model contains a zzso binding domain similar to known structures, but includes a large zzso which folds into zzso with unique zzso The structures of the protein zzso attached to five different antibiotics presented here show the active site zzso are zzso compared to the zzso but nearby surface zzso and zzso are displaced in some zzso The altered geometry of zzso active site zzso compared with those of other zzso suggests a possible cause for the slow zzso rate of zzso
