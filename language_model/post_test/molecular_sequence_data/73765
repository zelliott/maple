zzso zzso zzso regulates many target zzso by zzso to an zzso target zzso of variable zzso This study compares the equilibrium zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to target peptides derived from five different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso II, skeletal and smooth zzso light chain zzso and the plasma membrane zzso The results reveal that different target peptides can tune the zzso binding affinities and zzso of the two zzso zzso over a wide range of zzso zzso and time zzso The five peptides increase the zzso affinity of the zzso regulatory domain from zzso to zzso and slow its zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso Smaller effects are observed for the zzso domain, where peptides increase the apparent zzso affinity 8- to zzso and slow zzso zzso zzso to zzso In full-length skeletal zzso light chain zzso the zzso tuning provided by the isolated target zzso is further modulated by other tuning zzso resulting in a zzso complex that has a zzso lower zzso affinity than the analogous zzso zzso Unlike the zzso complexes, zzso zzso from the protein complex follows zzso zzso in which all four zzso zzso zzso at a rate comparable to the slow rate observed in the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso domain are substantially zzso in the zzso zzso Overall, the results indicate that the cellular zzso of zzso light chain zzso is likely to be triggered by the binding of free zzso or zzso after a zzso signal has begun and that zzso of the complex is initiated by a single zzso event, which is proposed to be either the direct zzso of zzso zzso from the bound zzso domain or the zzso of zzso loaded zzso domain from zzso The observed zzso variations in zzso affinities and zzso rates could serve to tune zzso zzso and zzso for different cellular zzso and also must counterbalance the variable energetic costs of driving the zzso zzso change in different target zzso
