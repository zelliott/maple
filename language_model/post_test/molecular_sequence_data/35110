It is clear that the coordinated and zzso actions of zzso and zzso are fundamental in the regulation of development and growth of the malaria zzso zzso zzso type 1 is a key zzso playing diverse and essential roles in cell zzso Its zzso zzso is governed by the interaction of its zzso zzso zzso with regulatory zzso Among these, zzso zzso is one of the most zzso ancient zzso zzso In zzso studies in various organisms revealed a zzso in zzso segregation and cell cycle progression when the function of zzso is zzso 

In this report, we present evidence that zzso zzso the zzso agent of the most deadly form of malaria, expresses a structural zzso of zzso zzso named zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso studies revealed that zzso binds zzso and zzso its zzso We further showed that the motifs zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using the zzso zzso model revealed that zzso is able to overcome the zzso cell cycle checkpoint by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggest an essential role of zzso as no viable zzso with a disrupted zzso gene were zzso Additionally, peptides derived from zzso and competing with zzso binding sites in zzso exhibit zzso activity against blood stage zzso in zzso 

Taken together, our data suggest that the zzso protein could play a role in the regulation of the zzso zzso cell cycle through its zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso studies of this regulator led to the identification of peptides with zzso activity against blood stage zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso interactions could be a novel means to control zzso
