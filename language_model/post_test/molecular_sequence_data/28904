Analysis of zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that there may be a network of zzso regulatory systems producing multiple zzso in this zzso Using a strain lacking a zzso zzso which carries some of the zzso zzso we isolated zzso in two genes zzso and zzso that are required for production of zzso The zzso genes are located adjacent to dad genes zzso in zzso zzso on a large indigenous zzso zzso is predicted to be a typical zzso zzso regulator and is required for zzso zzso The zzso gene was expressed at a low level, possibly from a zzso promoter, and its expression was increased under the influence of the upstream zzso zzso Using gene zzso and analysis of zzso produced, we showed that expression of zzso is strongly reduced in strains carrying zzso in zzso or zzso genes which determine a zzso zzso system that is required for normal expression of zzso The product of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso zzso although higher levels of expression are induced by other zzso zzso of zzso in a strain of zzso that makes no zzso resulted in the identification of zzso zzso zzso as the major product of zzso although other zzso that zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also made at low zzso The zzso gene was strongly induced by zzso (the product of zzso but could also be induced by other zzso suggesting that the zzso promoter can be activated by other zzso systems within a network of regulation which also involves zzso determined by genes on the symbiotic zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso genes are part of a complex regulatory network that influences AHL zzso in zzso zzso
