The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in human zzso We studied the effects of zzso in comparison with those of zzso zzso zzso a well known zzso zzso zzso zzso and of other zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and human zzso cells zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding in zzso zzso with a Ki zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso by zzso of high affinity zzso (the zzso activity of zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso formation, and zzso release with Ki values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso less potent than zzso in zzso zzso binding and zzso to zzso less potent than zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso rises in zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso formation by zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso rises in zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso rises in zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso whereas zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit the rises in zzso induced by several other stimuli in zzso cells and zzso zzso Our results show that 1) zzso is a more potent zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso 2) unlike zzso zzso is zzso and 3) zzso which is present at position 11 of the zzso acid sequence of zzso but not of other zzso is crucial for zzso zzso
