A bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso was constructed from a partial zzso clone and a zzso zzso We report that the zzso sequence of zzso in a transient expression zzso in zzso cells, codes for an zzso active zzso zzso There is an approximately zzso increase in the zzso activity in zzso cells compared to cells zzso with the zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso The increased activity is correlated with the increase in bovine zzso zzso which is distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso with a zzso probe of zzso The expressed zzso activity is modulated by zzso which changes the zzso specificity to zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso bovine milk zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso region of the protein zzso by zzso bind the expressed zzso and the resulting zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso
