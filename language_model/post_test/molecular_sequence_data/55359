zzso protein switches provide an efficient means of controlling protein functions using chemical signals and zzso zzso exclusive zzso in which only the host or guest domain can remain folded at a given time zzso to zzso strain, have been used to engineer novel protein switches that can switch zzso functions on and off in response to zzso zzso To further explore the potential of mutually exclusive proteins as protein switches and sensors, we report here a new zzso approach to engineer a mutually exclusive zzso protein zzso By introducing a zzso bond into the host domain of a mutually exclusive zzso we demonstrate that it is feasible to use zzso potential to switch the host domain between its folded and unfolded zzso via the mutually exclusive folding zzso and thus switching the functionality of the host domain on and zzso Our study opens a new and potentially general avenue that uses mutually exclusive proteins to design novel switches able to control the function of a variety of zzso
