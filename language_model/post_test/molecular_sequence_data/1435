In zzso box zzso small zzso zzso zzso guide sites of zzso zzso formation in zzso These zzso reside in zzso complexes containing the putative zzso zzso zzso In this study we have identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso an early zzso zzso by zzso zzso complexes from cellular zzso We characterized one box zzso zzso which, however, does not appear to guide zzso formation in zzso We also identified four single zzso box zzso zzso We determined target sites for these putative zzso zzso and confirmed that the predicted zzso modifications do, in fact, occur at these positions in zzso zzso The zzso zzso appear to be zzso by zzso zzso some of which are clustered in the zzso together with zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso and zzso genes are the first ones to be reported in zzso zzso the evolutionary sister group to the zzso zzso zzso we also found and have partially characterized a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
