The zzso domain of zzso zzso has been implicated in various nuclear functions, including gene zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Many of these have been identified by using zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In a recent paper, zzso et zzso use this approach to show that zzso in which all four zzso zzso zzso are zzso with zzso accumulate increased levels of DNA zzso A single zzso but not an zzso anywhere in the zzso domain suppresses this zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso plays a role in maintaining zzso integrity through the cell cycle, possibly by a mechanism involving zzso zzso
