The bacterial zzso motor is a tiny molecular machine that uses a zzso flux of zzso or zzso zzso to drive zzso zzso In zzso motors, the membrane proteins zzso and zzso interact via their zzso regions to form a zzso zzso The zzso zzso that power the polar zzso of zzso species contain zzso of zzso and zzso called zzso and zzso They require the unique proteins zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated how zzso selectivity is determined in zzso and sodium zzso We found that zzso coli zzso restore zzso in zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso isolated from this zzso zzso strain contain zzso in zzso We constructed proteins in which segments of zzso were fused to complementary portions of zzso A zzso joining the N zzso of zzso to the zzso C zzso of zzso zzso functioned with zzso as the zzso of a sodium zzso with or without zzso This zzso zzso supported zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso cells, and the swimming speed was even higher than with the original zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso However, zzso expressed with a B zzso containing the N zzso of zzso fused to the zzso domain of zzso zzso supported zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, although the zzso domain of zzso is not necessary for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso it can convert a zzso zzso motor into a sodium zzso
