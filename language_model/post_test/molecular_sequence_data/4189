zzso among bacterial zzso zzso zzso plays a major evolutionary role by creating genetic diversity, and provides the potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental zzso Previously, a 7 zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso protein zzso gene was isolated and characterized from an original zzso line zzso of onion zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso that inhabits the zzso of both plant and insect zzso zzso found in zzso was not present in a zzso line zzso derived from zzso A 4 zzso zzso zzso was also isolated and characterized from zzso and its zzso rep gene was zzso This paper describes the isolation and sequencing of an zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and its counterpart zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso contained seven and six zzso zzso They both zzso a zzso zzso and a putative zzso protein zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that no more zzso with a rep gene exist in either zzso or zzso which means that the complete set of zzso has been cloned from the zzso and zzso lines of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and zzso have zzso structures of previously characterized zzso and zzso suggesting that they have a zzso zzso This is the first evidence of zzso zzso between zzso in zzso The possible implications of these findings in increasing the biological diversity of zzso are zzso
