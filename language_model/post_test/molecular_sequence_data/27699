The generation of zzso zzso zzso has permitted the identification of various zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The relationship of the sites on zzso recognized by such zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction site has been determined using zzso zzso However, interpretation of this type of experiment is limited by problems of zzso zzso Thus, to accomplish precise mapping on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso R interaction site and the binding sites of various zzso zzso we employed zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso To this end we have constructed and expressed a zzso zzso constant zzso heavy chain zzso zzso gene bearing a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso in the C zzso 3 and C zzso 4 zzso of this zzso C zzso gene were prepared and expressed by zzso into the light zzso zzso myeloma cell zzso The resulting zzso zzso were tested for binding to mast cells and to various zzso zzso The zzso produced include a zzso to zzso point zzso at zzso acid zzso zzso in the C zzso 3 domain, a zzso with a truncated C zzso 4 domain, a zzso with a 45 zzso acid deletion in the zzso end of C zzso 3, and a zzso human C zzso in which the human C zzso 3 was replaced by the zzso mouse C zzso 3 zzso These zzso have permitted the zzso to the C zzso 3 domain, of the zzso recognized by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognizes a site on zzso which is identical or very close to the zzso zzso R binding site, and zzso recognizes a site on zzso which is zzso but not identical to the zzso zzso R binding zzso The zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso which is inefficient at blocking the zzso zzso R interaction, has been mapped to the C zzso 4 zzso When tested for binding to the zzso zzso R on zzso cells, the point zzso bound to the zzso zzso R with twofold reduced zzso while the C zzso 3 deletion zzso and the zzso truncated in C zzso 4 lost all zzso binding zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
