zzso A4 zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zinc zzso with both an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso from the African claw zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to, unlike the human zzso convert zzso to two zzso zzso zzso and another biologically active product zzso zzso zzso In order to study the molecular aspect of the formation of this product we have characterized the structure and function of zzso We solved the structure of zzso to a resolution of zzso It is a zzso structure where each zzso has three zzso with the active site in between the zzso similar as to the human zzso An important difference between the human and zzso zzso is the zzso to zzso exchange at position zzso Our studies show that mutating zzso in zzso to zzso zzso the formation of the zzso zzso product zzso In an attempt to understand how one zzso acid exchange leads to a new product profile as seen in the zzso we performed a zzso analysis of the zzso part of the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso with the observed distribution of zzso We suggest that the observed difference in product profile between the human and the zzso arises from different level of discrimination between zzso zzso zzso
