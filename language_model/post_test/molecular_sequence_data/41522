zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major mechanisms underlying copy number variation in the human zzso Although several zzso zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed in great detail, hotspots for zzso zzso are not well zzso zzso zzso zzso which are predominantly of zzso origin, constitute a highly zzso model with which to investigate the features of zzso zzso Here, a zzso zzso and zzso approach was used to identify 23 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these 23 zzso zzso together with 17 zzso zzso deletions identified zzso revealed that the zzso are zzso distributed within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, the analysis of this large group of zzso deletions revealed zzso recurrence within short segments zzso in size from 57 to zzso as well as the existence of a novel zzso hotspot of zzso zzso zzso This hotspot zzso zzso zzso of the zzso deletion zzso and contains the zzso zzso zzso region zzso in which four independent zzso deletion zzso were zzso Our findings indicate that a combination of an open zzso zzso and short non-B zzso repeats may zzso to zzso zzso zzso events between zzso and its zzso
