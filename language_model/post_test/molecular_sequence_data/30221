zzso analysis of multiple zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso reveals the existence of a zzso open reading frame, designated zzso that partially zzso the zzso zzso and zzso coding zzso Here we show that in zzso translation of zzso derived from this region of the viral zzso yields a 17 zzso fusion zzso the result of a minus one zzso event in the overlap between the zzso and T open reading zzso It is also shown that zzso zzso species accumulate in zzso infection from which the 17 zzso protein can be zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso events may result in the zzso of viral regulatory as well as viral structural zzso
