zzso comprise a principal family of zzso light sensors in zzso Although zzso were thought originally to be confined to zzso organisms, we have recently detected zzso proteins in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that these form part of a widespread family of zzso zzso with zzso to zzso sensor zzso zzso Whereas plant zzso use zzso as the zzso zzso assemble with zzso an immediate breakdown product of zzso to generate zzso zzso that are modulated by red and zzso zzso In some cases, a unique zzso zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso with a zzso zzso and a zzso source is sufficient to assemble zzso in zzso Both their presence in many diverse bacteria and their simplified assembly with zzso suggest that zzso are the zzso of zzso zzso
