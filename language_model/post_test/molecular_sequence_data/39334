The Tomato spotted zzso virus zzso zzso zzso movement protein zzso zzso spread of the viral zzso through structurally modified zzso zzso has been zzso as bait in zzso zzso interaction trap zzso As a result, a protein of unknown function, called zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso against zzso expressed zzso Western zzso analysis of protein extracts isolated from different plant species as well as zzso database screenings showed that zzso of zzso seemed to be zzso by many vascular zzso For zzso zzso studies, zzso was fused to green fluorescent zzso and corresponding expression zzso were used in particle zzso and zzso zzso zzso laser zzso revealed that zzso assembled in zzso spots at the cell zzso The protein accumulated zzso in a polarized fashion, appearing in only one-half of a bombarded zzso cell, and, moreover, moved from cell to cell, forming zzso bodies seemingly located at both zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso zzso with a plant virus movement protein zzso known to reside in zzso zzso membrane structures located in close vicinity to zzso Thus, zzso belongs to a new family of plant proteins capable of directed zzso and zzso zzso
