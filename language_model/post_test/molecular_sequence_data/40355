zzso is a zzso found in the zzso of the soft zzso zzso zzso It could be assigned to the tick zzso family based on zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso described in zzso The mature sequence is composed of 188 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso A zzso for zzso was found in a whole body zzso from a related soft tick zzso zzso while other tick zzso zzso derived zzso retrieved from the zzso sequence database are more zzso zzso zzso modeling supports the inclusion of zzso into the zzso zzso The model as well as multiple alignments suggests the presence of five zzso zzso Two zzso zzso bonds are found in hard and soft tick zzso A third zzso bond is shared with the zzso of zzso C4 binding soft tick zzso and a fourth is shared with a zzso from the hard tick zzso zzso The fifth zzso bond is unique and links strands zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is a distant relative of zzso zzso derived zzso but groups within a zzso that is possibly zzso zzso zzso It lacks the zzso zzso motif associated with tick zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso profiles indicate that zzso is found in zzso zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso after bacterial challenge and in zzso and zzso after zzso Given its tissue distribution and zzso of zzso it is possible that this zzso functions in tick development after feeding or in an zzso zzso
