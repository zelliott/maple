zzso zzso generation can be zzso in a zzso system using zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and zzso are closely related small zzso differing primarily in the zzso 10 zzso where zzso but not zzso contains a zzso zzso In their zzso forms, zzso was highly effective in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso high zzso whereas zzso was only minimally effective zzso zzso low zzso In contrast, low zzso of zzso zzso and zzso both supported high rates of zzso zzso Like full length zzso truncated forms of both zzso and zzso in which the zzso 10 zzso were eliminated were poorly zzso pointing to the C zzso of zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso of single positively charged zzso in the C zzso of zzso zzso markedly reduced its ability to support zzso generation, affecting both its zzso and the zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso of the C zzso failed to affect the zzso of zzso a zzso protein zzso The zzso for zzso increased with increasing salt zzso whereas that of zzso was independent of salt, implicating the involvement of zzso forces for the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso the zzso for zzso but not zzso decreased zzso zzso when an zzso zzso zzso was present, supporting a role for the zzso zzso C zzso in binding to the zzso A model in which zzso must associate simultaneously both with zzso and with the membrane to activate the zzso zzso can account for the above zzso
