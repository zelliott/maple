zzso about the origins and evolution of crop species represents an important prerequisite for efficient conservation and use of existing plant zzso This study was designed to solve the ongoing debate on the origins of the common bean by investigating the zzso diversity at five gene zzso of a large sample that represents the entire geographical distribution of the wild forms of this zzso Our data clearly indicate a zzso origin of the common zzso They also strongly support the occurrence of a bottleneck during the formation of the Andean gene pool that predates the zzso which was suggested by recent studies based on zzso molecular zzso Furthermore, a remarkable result was the genetic structure that was seen for the zzso zzso with the identification of four different genetic groups that have different relationships with the sets of wild zzso from the zzso and northern zzso This finding implies that both of the gene pools from South America originated through different migration events from the zzso populations that were characteristic of central zzso
