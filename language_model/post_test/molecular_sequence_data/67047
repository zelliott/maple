Many early molecular events in symbiotic infection have been zzso although factors enabling zzso to progress within the zzso infection thread and ultimately survive within the zzso zzso compartment as mature zzso zzso are poorly zzso zzso surface zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso exist in close proximity to zzso zzso throughout the infection zzso zzso are essential for bacterial survival, adaptation, and as potential zzso of zzso and/or host zzso Relatively few studies have examined the role of zzso in these zzso However, we constructed a zzso that lacks genes essential for the production of the zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso acid, in the broad host range zzso zzso zzso The complete structure of the zzso of strain zzso was established, and it consists of zzso repeating units of zzso and zzso acid having the structure zzso zzso zzso zzso of three genes located in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and part of zzso abolished zzso acid zzso yielding a zzso in which the zzso zzso was totally zzso other surface zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso appeared zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso showing reduced zzso efficiency on several zzso zzso production was found to decline after zzso were exposed to plant zzso and the decrease coincided with induction of a zzso active zzso zzso suggesting an exchange of zzso occurs during bacterial differentiation in the developing zzso
