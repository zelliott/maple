The zzso sequence zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso consists of two sets of 11 zzso zzso zzso Here we zzso the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso by its migration anomaly in zzso zzso The 159 zzso long zzso is strongly curved with anomaly values zzso close to zzso The properties of the zzso zzso agree with those of other curved DNA zzso zzso contains two regions of zzso repeated zzso separated by 39 zzso We modified 4 zzso within this intermediate sequence so that we could zzso the two zzso repeated regions zzso The analysis shows that the two repeat regions are not independently curved parts of zzso but that the overall zzso is a property of the whole zzso Since the zzso sequence of an zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso sequences show DNA zzso we speculate that zzso might be a general property of zzso
