Several studies have documented the process of early embryonic development in zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso regulation are poorly zzso particularly in zzso In this study, we analyzed differential gene expression of zzso 6 and 25 h following zzso to determine which genes regulate the early zzso stage in zzso Among 216 randomly selected zzso 39 zzso zzso that function in zzso transcription, transportation, zzso cell cycle, cell zzso and zzso were zzso Additionally, the full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso was zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction analyses were performed to detect expression levels of the selected genes during early and late embryonic zzso which revealed that these genes are expressed in a particular spatial and zzso zzso These results indicate that these genes may play pivotal roles in the process of area zzso formation through a complex and precise regulatory network during development in duck zzso
