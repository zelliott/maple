zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor II zzso is a zzso zzso that belongs to the squash family of zzso zzso zzso zzso we report synthesis and biological activity of three zzso zzso In each of zzso a pair of zzso zzso forming a native zzso bridge was individually replaced by a pair of zzso zzso All zzso zzso were chemically zzso using the zzso protocol and subsequently folded in the presence of oxidized and reduced zzso The zzso containing a zzso bridge displayed association zzso with zzso that ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso retained low zzso zzso zzso and only the zzso bridge adjacent to the zzso binding loop weakened the interactions with zzso by approximately zzso We discuss these findings in the context of a broader use of zzso zzso as proxies to study zzso zzso
