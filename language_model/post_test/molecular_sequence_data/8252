The effects of organic zzso on the kinetic characteristics of two zzso zzso zzso A and zzso 1, were zzso In each case, addition of the zzso resulted in a decrease in the apparent zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two factors were identified as being responsible for this decrease in zzso activity: zzso zzso of the zzso in favor of the bulk zzso and decrease in the water content of the zzso The former reflects the zzso nature of the zzso interaction and the effect can be corrected for by using the zzso to water partition zzso of the zzso in the mixed zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso corrected for the effect of zzso zzso was demonstrated to be sixth order in water for zzso A and third order in water for zzso zzso Variation in water concentration did not produce zzso even at zzso close to zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso bound water molecules are essential to mediate the interaction between zzso and zzso The sensitivity of these zzso to water concentration could be an important mechanism for regulating zzso activity in zzso
