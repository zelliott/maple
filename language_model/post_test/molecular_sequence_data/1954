zzso of proteins to zzso zzso has been shown to be an essential part of zzso gene zzso Four zzso proteins zzso 47, 55, and 60 zzso have been identified that bind to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high affinity and zzso We have cloned a zzso that represents the 38 zzso protein zzso and show that it encodes a novel zzso binding protein that is primarily localized within the zzso zzso zzso contains four 70 zzso acid repeats with a high percentage of basic zzso zzso as well as an zzso extension predicted to act as a zzso import zzso We demonstrate that the 38 zzso precursor protein is imported into isolated zzso and interacts with high specificity to zzso regions within the zzso region of the zzso zzso While database searches have identified hypothetical proteins from several other zzso species with high sequence similarity to the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso no proteins with zzso to zzso have been zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso together with structure analysis using circular zzso and protein zzso suggests that the 70 zzso acid repeats within zzso are similar in fold to previously identified zzso binding zzso despite limited sequence zzso
