zzso is a novel zzso domain protein that zzso to the zzso stress fibers and focal zzso zzso We previously have demonstrated that two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are generated from a single zzso In the majority of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, the expression of zzso is significantly reduced, while the expression of zzso is either zzso or zzso To understand the basis of this differential regulation, we have determined the organization of the human zzso zzso The human zzso and consists of 11 zzso The zzso zzso requires all 11 zzso while the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso The zzso start sites of zzso were mapped within the third zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso ends of zzso were mapped upstream of zzso zzso The DNA sequences zzso the zzso or zzso zzso start sites were capable of stimulating the expression of promoter reporter zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso could be zzso by serum, indicating that the expression of two zzso zzso can be independently zzso A consensus serum response element was present within zzso upstream of the zzso start sites of zzso The activity of zzso zzso promoter reporter construct could be enhanced by activated zzso indicating that this serum response element is zzso
