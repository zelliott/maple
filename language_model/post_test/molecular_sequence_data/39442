Three distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso in bacteria catalyze the first step in zzso A zzso The structures of the type II zzso zzso zzso and type III zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that they assemble nearly identical zzso with zzso folds into zzso that exhibit distinct zzso zzso zzso has a fully enclosed zzso binding pocket and requires a zzso zzso to zzso bind zzso in an open cavity that does not interact with the zzso zzso zzso binds to an open pocket in zzso that strongly binds zzso by using a classical P loop architecture coupled with specific interactions with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex explains the resistance of bacteria possessing this zzso to the zzso zzso and the similarity between zzso and human zzso zzso 2 explains the molecular basis for the development of the neurodegenerative zzso in three zzso in the human zzso
