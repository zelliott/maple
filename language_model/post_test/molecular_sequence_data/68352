The zzso gene of zzso zzso is essential for the cell viability of zzso petite zzso for the ability to zzso zzso and ethanol on synthetic zzso and for cell growth at higher zzso By zzso analysis the gene was assigned to zzso III, zzso zzso of zzso The zzso gene has been isolated and cloned by the zzso of a zzso zzso The molecular analysis of the zzso insert carrying zzso revealed that this gene zzso to the zzso open reading frame on the complete DNA sequence of zzso zzso The putative zzso protein is characterized by a low molecular weight of approximately 17 zzso a low zzso adaptation index, and a high zzso zzso
