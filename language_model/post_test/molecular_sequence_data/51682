zzso zzso is well established as a regulatory mechanism in higher plants, but only a handful of plant zzso are known to be regulated in this manner, and relatively few plant protein zzso have been zzso zzso protein zzso regulates key zzso of zzso fatty acid, zzso and zzso zzso including zzso A zzso zzso We now show that there is an activity in higher plants which, by functional criteria, is a zzso of the zzso protein zzso although it is not regulated by zzso The plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso mapping suggests that it zzso the same sites on these proteins as the zzso zzso However, with the target zzso zzso from plant sources, it zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso is located in the zzso and not the zzso fraction of leaf cells, consistent with the idea that it regulates zzso zzso and hence zzso zzso in zzso The plant zzso also appears to be part of a protein zzso cascade which has been highly zzso during evolution, since the zzso is zzso and zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This contrasts with the situation for many other zzso protein zzso involved in signal zzso which appear to have no close zzso in higher zzso To our knowledge, this represents the first direct evidence for a protein zzso cascade in higher zzso
