The zzso of lung zzso in zzso type II cells is a complex process involving the fusion of zzso bodies with the plasma zzso This process is somewhat different from the zzso of hormones and zzso For example, it is a relatively slower process, and zzso bodies are very large zzso with a diameter of approximately 1 zzso zzso proteins are the zzso molecular machinery of zzso in the majority of zzso zzso However, their involvement in zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we showed that zzso 2 and zzso are expressed in zzso type II zzso Both proteins are associated with the plasma zzso and to some degree with zzso zzso An zzso zzso complementary to zzso 2 decreased its zzso and protein zzso The same zzso also inhibited zzso zzso independent of zzso A zzso derived from the zzso of zzso 2 or the zzso of zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso type II cells in a zzso zzso Furthermore, introduction of zzso 2 or zzso zzso into zzso type II cells also inhibited zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso 2 and zzso are required for regulated zzso zzso
