We have shown previously that the zzso zzso zzso are the zzso targets for zzso zzso blood cell zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso anemia zzso The aim of the current work was to determine whether activated T cells from such patients also mount recall responses to zzso on these zzso Two panels of overlapping zzso zzso corresponding to the sequences of the zzso zzso proteins associated with expression of the D and zzso blood group zzso were zzso and screened for the ability to stimulate the in zzso proliferation of zzso cells from the peripheral blood or zzso of nine zzso zzso Culture conditions were chosen that favor recall proliferation by previously activated T cells, rather than primary zzso In seven of the patients, including all four cases with zzso to the zzso zzso two or more peptides zzso zzso but cells from eight of nine patients with other zzso and seven of nine healthy donors failed to respond to the zzso Multiple peptides were also zzso in two positive control donors who had been zzso with zzso zzso zzso Six different profiles of peptides zzso responses in the zzso patients, and this variation may reflect the different zzso types in the zzso zzso peptides were identified throughout zzso shared between, or specific to, each of the related zzso zzso zzso but T cells that responded to zzso regions did not zzso with the alternative zzso zzso zzso complex class II zzso blocked the responses and depletion experiments confirmed that the zzso zzso cells were T zzso zzso zzso T cells that proliferated against multiple zzso peptides also responded to intact zzso We propose that zzso zzso production in many cases of zzso is driven by the zzso of zzso cells specific for previously cryptic zzso on the zzso zzso
