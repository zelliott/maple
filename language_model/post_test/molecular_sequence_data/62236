With the influx of various zzso zzso zzso in recent years, there has been a need for an zzso that is zzso yet cost effective, and could be performed using standard zzso zzso In this context, zzso markers have been shown to meet these zzso However, converting zzso to zzso markers can be a difficult process if done zzso In order to address this problem, we describe a computer program, zzso that zzso the zzso conversion of zzso markers into zzso zzso 413 multiple aligned sequences derived from barley zzso were zzso for the presence of zzso in 235 distinct restriction zzso 282 zzso of 314 alignments that contain sequence variation due to zzso and zzso revealed at least one zzso restriction zzso After reducing the number of restriction zzso from 235 to 10, zzso of the zzso sites could still be zzso In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this tool for marker development, we zzso validated some of the results predicted by zzso
