It is well known that the functions of zzso generally originate from their zzso zzso However, the intrinsic nature of individual motifs remains unknown, particularly the details about zzso effects on the folding of zzso the converse is also unknown, although there is no doubt that the motif is the core of the zzso for each zzso In this study, we focused our attention on the zzso motif of the zzso clan family, zzso this family contains the general zzso sequence zzso zzso and the extended zzso zzso We adopted the motif sequence of zzso and investigated the folding properties of the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zinc zzso in zzso zzso environments by circular zzso zzso zzso We zzso successful incorporation of these zinc peptides into zzso using zzso of zzso zzso zzso of CD studies indicated that two of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso folding in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso The zzso structural analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso in the zzso zzso region significantly zzso between the zzso state in the zzso and the reported zzso state of zzso in crystal zzso The structural analyses of the qualitative zzso properties of this motif zzso provide an interesting zzso zzso the minimum consensus motif in the zzso clan, a basic zzso motif with an extended zzso region, has the potential to serve as a zzso zzso binding scaffold in a zzso zzso
