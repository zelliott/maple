In an effort to better understand the mechanism of toxicity of zzso zzso we employed an zzso search of human expressed sequence tags to identify novel zzso zzso proteins that interact with either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso We characterized five new zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso that are similar in size and structural organization to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso variable zzso zzso contained the characteristic zzso domain and a variable C zzso it is possible that the zzso contains a zzso domain, but the entire open reading frame has yet to be zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso analysis, and transient zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and that these complexes are zzso active at defined DNA zzso sequences in zzso zzso was found to associate with the zzso in zzso but not in zzso This zzso coupled with the fact that zzso formed tighter associations with the zzso heat shock protein than the human zzso suggests that zzso may be a zzso active zzso protein that requires zzso by an unknown zzso The expression profiles of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled with the observation that they all share zzso as a common zzso partner, suggests that the cellular pathways zzso by zzso and zzso may influence or respond to the zzso signaling zzso
