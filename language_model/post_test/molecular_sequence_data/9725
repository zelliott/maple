To investigate the role of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso in zzso we created a series of zzso and expressed them in a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tail to 20 zzso acids had little or no effect on zzso or signal zzso but further zzso resulted in marked functional zzso Upon incubation with zzso zzso protein 1, zzso underwent rapid and extensive zzso and this was impaired progressively as the zzso tail was truncated from 52 to 8 zzso zzso zzso of all of the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso tail to zzso also resulted in markedly impaired zzso zzso but did not affect signaling or zzso We conclude that the zzso portion of the zzso zzso tail of zzso is critically involved in zzso and signal zzso but neither zzso of zzso zzso or zzso nor zzso of the zzso is required for robust zzso
