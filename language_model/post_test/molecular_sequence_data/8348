It has been suggested that the zzso itself may contribute to the inflammatory process observed in zzso zzso by releasing the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but studies of zzso gene expression in zzso have been limited and zzso A zzso reverse zzso technique has been used to investigate the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso and in cultures of primary human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso levels were examined over a zzso period, and the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected in zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso for 12 h produced an increase in the level of zzso alpha zzso in both primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were increased by the addition of zzso in both cell types, and this effect was detected throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on zzso gene zzso A higher concentration of zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on the expression of zzso alpha or zzso but produced an increase in the level of zzso zzso in primary cultures and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso (1 zzso produced an increase in the level of zzso alpha zzso in primary zzso and zzso cells, at 12 and 24 zzso zzso had no significant effect on the expression of zzso or zzso zzso These results demonstrate that human zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that this expression can be modulated by zzso zzso and zzso
