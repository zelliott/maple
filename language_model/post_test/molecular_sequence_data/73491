zzso coli leader zzso which zzso the zzso of signal peptides from zzso is an essential, integral membrane zzso zzso that has its active site residing in the zzso zzso It contains a zzso zzso zzso that has been proposed to act as the general base, zzso the zzso from the side chain zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso To help zzso the role of the essential zzso 145 in the activity of zzso coli leader zzso we have combined zzso zzso and chemical modification methods to introduce zzso zzso acid side chains at the zzso We show that partial activity can be restored to an inactive zzso leader zzso zzso by reacting it with zzso to produce a zzso analog zzso at the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso also allowed for partial restoration of activity showing that there is some flexibility in the length requirements of this essential zzso zzso with zzso to form a positively charged, zzso side chain at the zzso failed to restore activity to the inactive zzso leader zzso zzso This result, along with an inactive zzso zzso result, supports the claim that the zzso side chain at the zzso is essential due to its ability to form a hydrogen zzso or to act as a general base rather than because of an ability to form a critical salt zzso We find that leader zzso processes the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, with maximum efficiency at pH zzso and apparent zzso values for zzso groups at approximately zzso and zzso are zzso We show that the zzso modifier zzso zzso zzso leader zzso by reacting with zzso zzso The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso at the zzso of leader zzso functions as the active site general zzso A model of the active site region of leader zzso is presented based on the structure of the zzso coli zzso and a mechanism for bacterial leader zzso is zzso
