zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso is the only known protein in zzso cells that contains the unusual zzso acid zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso is essential for the function of zzso in zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso is the first of the two zzso that zzso the maturation of zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso bovine and human zzso zzso into a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso bovine and human zzso zzso have been zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso using zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso of the zzso from both human and bovine have been measured by their ability to convert the zzso precursor protein to the zzso zzso form of zzso Our results have shown that bovine zzso zzso has considerably higher activity than human zzso zzso in catalyzing the synthesis of zzso
