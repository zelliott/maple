zzso D zzso and zzso zzso both play important, diverse roles in cellular regulation and signal zzso Here we have determined the physical interaction between plant zzso and the only zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso and the molecular basis for the zzso zzso expressed in either zzso coli or zzso was zzso with zzso zzso contains a sequence motif analogous to the G zzso zzso motif normally zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the central zzso zzso zzso of this motif abolished the zzso zzso whereas zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso inhibited zzso activity, whereas the zzso zzso that disrupted the zzso binding abolished the zzso zzso relieved the zzso zzso of zzso activity and also inhibited the binding between zzso and zzso Meanwhile, the zzso interaction zzso the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso zzso these results have demonstrated the direct binding between zzso and zzso identified the zzso motif on zzso as the site for the interaction, and indicated that the interaction zzso zzso the activities of zzso and zzso
