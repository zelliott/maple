zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a family of structurally closely related zzso derivatives dubbed zzso of which zzso A is the major zzso The function of zzso in the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with their host plants presently is zzso It is hypothesized that they may constitute zzso zzso However, zzso are zzso recognized and reacted to by zzso plant species, and zzso A has been shown to induce hypersensitive death of cells zzso by powdery zzso in wheat and, thus, to zzso a compatible interaction into an incompatible zzso zzso A is an unusual zzso of a zzso that contains a zzso ring consisting of the zzso acids zzso acid and zzso two zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso sequencing, and analysis of genes involved in the zzso of zzso zzso The genes zzso proteins consisting of zzso typical for zzso zzso zzso and type I zzso zzso as well as proteins likely involved in the zzso regulation of zzso A zzso and in zzso A zzso The structure and arrangement of the zzso lead to the zzso of a model explaining the synthesis of the zzso including the formation of the two zzso zzso acids in the ring structure of zzso zzso
