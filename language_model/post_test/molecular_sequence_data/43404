The zzso gene zzso a novel zzso protein zzso protein was found to be disrupted in a zzso zzso of zzso that grows as giant and zzso cells in a dish zzso The predicted sequence of the zzso protein showed considerable zzso to those of zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso half of zzso zzso the similarity extending beyond the zzso zzso In suspension culture, zzso cells showed normal growth in terms of the increase in cell mass, but zzso zzso occurred to produce zzso giant zzso zzso recording of the dynamics of cell division in a dish culture revealed that, in the case of zzso cells, zzso was very frequently reversed at the step in which the zzso connecting the daughter cells should be zzso Earlier steps of zzso in the zzso cells seemed to be normal, since zzso II was accumulated at the zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso cells developed and formed zzso bodies with viable spores, like the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein is specifically involved in the completion of zzso Recently, it was reported that zzso are putative zzso for zzso and zzso members of the zzso family of zzso and participate in reorganization of the zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso zzso zzso in the severing of the zzso by regulating the zzso zzso through an interaction with a member of small zzso
