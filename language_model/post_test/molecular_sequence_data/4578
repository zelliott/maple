zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso hormone which acts on target cells via a G zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of four potent zzso and zzso CT zzso each of which contains a single zzso zzso inserted at different and discrete locations within the CT zzso Replacement of all zzso zzso in salmon CT zzso with zzso followed by replacement of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso was found to preserve high biological zzso We zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso the zzso by a zzso zzso thus distributing the zzso zzso in the different zzso across a large portion of the CT zzso With both zzso and zzso zzso from several species, all four zzso zzso were shown to be virtually indistinguishable from the parent zzso analog in both zzso binding properties and stimulation of zzso zzso Upon zzso in the presence of zzso the zzso zzso CT analog zzso zzso zzso labels a membrane component of approximately 70 zzso zzso zzso is inhibited specifically in the presence of excess zzso We also examined the interaction of these CT zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso displayed CT binding and zzso zzso stimulation identical with native zzso Both zzso and another zzso analog zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso to the zzso These zzso CT zzso should facilitate studies of zzso interactions and allow the direct identification of a CT binding zzso within the zzso by the analysis of zzso zzso zzso
