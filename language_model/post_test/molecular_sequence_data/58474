The zzso the target sequence for the Rev protein of zzso is a highly structured zzso sequence characterized by multiple stem zzso Although agreement on the zzso organization outside the zzso site was reached some time ago by several laboratories, recent work has suggested an alternative structure in which sequences from two of the zzso zzso and zzso pair to form one long zzso zzso when enough zzso material is present to allow the formation of an extended central stem structure zzso Here we address the contribution of the original and alternative structures to function in zzso zzso with short and extended zzso zzso We confirm that extended zzso structures improve zzso function and may stabilize the overall zzso However, we find no evidence that an extended zzso structure zzso zzso either alternative structure with respect to the zzso The two alternative structures are approximately functionally zzso and both are probably present in an in zzso population of zzso
