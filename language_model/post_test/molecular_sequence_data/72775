zzso gene central regions from 111 zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained from soil during a field release experiment were zzso using a combined zzso technique to look for zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso gene sequence from the original strain and the last isolate obtained from the release site were zzso There was no variation in zzso gene sequences indicating that the gene was stable over the period of the release, and that the zzso gene is a suitable marker for use in the detection of bacteria in release zzso A comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso revealed closest zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
