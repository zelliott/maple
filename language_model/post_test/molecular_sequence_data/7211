The stomach serves as a barrier to enteric infection because of the zzso effect of the zzso acid in gastric zzso In this study, we tested the ability of the enteric pathogen zzso zzso to tolerate a pH range of zzso to zzso and found that under the conditions of a normal human zzso stomach zzso zzso 3 and a gastric zzso time of 2 zzso zzso zzso is highly acid zzso showing approximately zzso zzso The resistance of zzso zzso to acid in zzso depended on the bacterial growth phase and the concentration of zzso in the zzso being zzso during stationary phase in the presence of at least zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were constructed by zzso the zzso gene complex of a virulent strain of zzso zzso Compared with the wild type, these zzso showed an approximately zzso decrease in the ability to tolerate acid in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in viability after passage through the zzso of zzso zzso of the disrupted zzso genes in trans restored the ability of zzso zzso to tolerate low pH in zzso and gastric acidity to approximately zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is responsible for acid resistance in zzso zzso and suggest that zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso by enhancing the likelihood of bacterial survival during passage through the zzso
