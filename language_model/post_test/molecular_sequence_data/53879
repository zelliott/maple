The zzso gene encodes a focal zzso protein that has striking similarity to zzso zzso clones of the mouse zzso gene were isolated, and included 10 zzso that covered the whole mouse zzso zzso zzso of the sequence with those in the expressed sequence tag database suggested that the zzso gene contained an extra zzso (named zzso zzso located about zzso upstream of zzso 1, and mouse cells seemed to express two alternatively spliced forms of zzso All the zzso boundaries followed the zzso zzso Physical mapping and fluorescent in zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene is located on mouse zzso 7, zzso zzso from the zzso
