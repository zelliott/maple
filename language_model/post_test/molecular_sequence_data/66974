zzso genes play a prominent role in the nervous system differentiation of several zzso models, and in particular, they are involved in the differentiation of sensory zzso in numerous zzso and zzso zzso In the present report, cloning and expression profile of a class IV zzso gene in zzso was assessed for understanding its role in the sensory systems zzso A single class IV zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso From a zzso point of view, zzso appears to be strictly related to the zzso one, sharing a high zzso ratio especially with all zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found in the most anterior neural plate and in scattered zzso cells on the zzso of zzso such zzso cells resemble the characteristic zzso and position of zzso and zzso developing sensory zzso Later on, the expression was confined in some zzso at level of the zzso and in some zzso arranged zzso in the zzso Such expression is also maintained in larvae, and a new site of zzso expression was also found in rostrum and mouth edge zzso sensory cells of the zzso In conclusion, our data suggest an evolutionary zzso role of zzso zzso factors in the zzso and differentiation of the sensory system in both zzso and zzso and underline the importance of zzso as linking step between zzso
