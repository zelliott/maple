We investigated the effect of zzso zzso which has specific zzso properties, on human zzso zzso zzso zzso induced with collagen was observed following zzso of zzso in zzso plasma zzso or washed zzso suspension zzso with zzso at 37 degrees C for 30 zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso only at the highest examined concentration (1 zzso zzso zzso Although zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso in zzso which contained zzso it did when the zzso had been zzso with zzso and zzso The most effective concentration in zzso was 1 zzso zzso zzso The effect could be inhibited by adding zzso or alpha zzso The highest generation of zzso in the same zzso fluid was detected at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso in zzso by generating zzso and/or zzso degradation products, but is only partially effective in zzso because of the existence of alpha zzso
