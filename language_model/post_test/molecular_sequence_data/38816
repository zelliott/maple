zzso zzso zzso is a catalyst of folding of zzso proteins and also a zzso zzso that acts as the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso transfer protein zzso The principal zzso site of zzso is located in the zzso domain, but all zzso contribute to the binding of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso part of the zzso domain have significant effects on the assembly of the zzso zzso and other functions of zzso In this study we have addressed the question of whether these zzso in the zzso part of the zzso domain, which affect zzso zzso also affect zzso binding to zzso We observed a strong correlation between zzso assembly competence and zzso zzso zzso of zzso that failed to form a functional zzso zzso were also inactive in zzso zzso However, there was also a correlation between zzso in these zzso and indicators of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso binding activity could be restored in zzso zzso zzso by selective zzso removal of the zzso zzso zzso Hence we propose that structural changes in the zzso domain indirectly affect zzso binding to the zzso zzso
