To understand the early evolution of zzso zzso it is important to know the zzso partners of zzso and zzso for zzso lineages of vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso found at three localities gave an opportunity to study their zzso and anatomy and to identify and describe their zzso unknown zzso zzso In addition, zzso were screened for zzso zzso 

zzso with attached young zzso were zzso and their anatomy and their associated zzso were studied by light zzso DNA was isolated and amplified with both universal and zzso zzso zzso for the ITS region, the large zzso and small zzso of the nuclear zzso respectively, to identify the zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso zzso by a fungus with zzso zzso forming coils and zzso Its zzso resembles that of the zzso zzso zzso Both ITS and zzso sequences were identified as zzso group B, a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This fungus was detected in 11 zzso from two localities and in zzso of adjacent zzso zzso zzso plants, but was absent in roots of zzso In addition, several zzso and zzso were found by DNA zzso 

Our study suggests a fungus belonging to zzso group B as the main zzso host of the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso group B zzso occur as well in adjacent zzso plants; therefore, we assume the zzso zzso to be zzso on zzso which would explain the steady association of these zzso
