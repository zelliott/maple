zzso zzso have a dominant impact on the environment in which zzso development takes zzso The zzso zzso zzso previously known as zzso are found most abundantly during pregnancy in the zzso of zzso Although zzso is currently assumed to be the major regulator of zzso zzso our recent study of zzso changes in bovine zzso during the zzso cycle unexpectedly detected a marked zzso of zzso zzso levels at zzso The present study describes the full-length zzso zzso zzso organization, and putative promoter elements of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso abundance was zzso by real-time zzso in zzso zzso at several time points during the zzso cycle and early zzso zzso levels were found at zzso followed by a dramatic decrease and a moderate expression during the zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in pregnant zzso compared with controls at Day zzso At zzso zzso protein was localized in deep zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso showed the zzso form in zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso after stimulation with zzso and zzso but not after zzso zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that zzso appears distinctly in bovine zzso during the zzso zzso A supporting role toward providing a zzso zzso environment for passing zzso especially zzso is zzso
