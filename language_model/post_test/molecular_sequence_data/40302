The larvae of the fish zzso zzso zzso develop a flat and adhesive structure on the top of their heads that we have called zzso zzso zzso meaning zzso We hypothesized that the zzso may be a zzso zzso of the well-studied zzso cement zzso despite their different positions and zzso Here we show that the zzso has an zzso origin, zzso zzso expresses bone zzso protein 4 zzso and zzso zzso 1/2 zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and has a role in the control and the development of the zzso swimming zzso These zzso zzso and behavioral functional data support a level of deep zzso between the zzso cement zzso and the zzso zzso and suggest that attachment zzso can develop in varied positions on the head zzso by recruitment of a zzso zzso zzso We also show that the attachment zzso of the zzso zzso zzso larvae display some of these zzso We discuss the possibility that these highly diversified attachment zzso may be ancestral to zzso and have been lost zzso in many zzso zzso
