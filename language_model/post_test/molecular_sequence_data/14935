zzso zzso zzso zzso are a class of widely used flame zzso that have been highly accumulated in zzso It is reported that zzso play an important role in the reductive zzso of zzso in zzso zzso However, little is known about the effects of electron donors on the microbial community structure and their zzso capacity in zzso zzso In this study, alternate carbon zzso were used as electron donors to enrich the zzso microbial zzso to evaluate the effects of electron donors on zzso microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the dominant (more than zzso zzso zzso in all zzso and the percentage of zzso was deceased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (no electron zzso while the relative zzso of most zzso zzso increased after zzso incubation compared to the initial profile of zzso zzso shifts in the microbial community structure among different amendments were observed based on zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified to be the zzso organisms and the zzso of Band zzso which was associated with zzso zzso zzso was well correlated with the zzso rate of zzso Finally, the microbial community structure was highly correlated with the concentration of zzso zzso and total zzso These results provide insights into in zzso zzso of environments contaminated by zzso and our understanding of microbial ecology associated with zzso
