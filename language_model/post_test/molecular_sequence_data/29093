The ubiquitous zzso zzso channel is thought to contribute to zzso zzso zzso but the distribution of the zzso protein in human zzso has not been zzso We have studied the distribution of zzso in adult human and rat zzso and airways by zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso was present in the lateral zzso of zzso zzso and was zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso colon zzso The expression pattern of zzso in the human zzso differed significantly, because zzso was mainly detected in a zzso compartment of colon zzso We found significant expression of zzso at the zzso of zzso cells in both rat and human zzso These results show that the distribution of zzso in airways is consistent with participation of zzso channels in zzso zzso and indicate that zzso of results from studies of zzso function in rat zzso to human zzso is not zzso
