Two zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso expression library prepared from zzso of human zzso zzso cells differentiated to the zzso zzso with zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso are 350 zzso acids long (Mr zzso they differ from each other by two zzso changes at positions 101 and zzso and by significant differences in the zzso and 3' untranslated zzso Both clones were able to transfer to zzso cells the capacity to specifically bind a new and highly efficient zzso zzso of zzso referred to as zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso form of the zzso zzso in zzso cells has a molecular weight (Mr zzso similar to that observed for the native zzso in differentiated zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a major transcript of zzso zzso and two minor zzso signals of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a related family of zzso The complex zzso pattern obtained with restricted zzso DNA was consistent with either two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso or a single gene with at least one zzso in the coding zzso zzso comparison established that the zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso The structural similarities observed with zzso a zzso isolated from a dog zzso zzso library, which shares weak zzso with other members of the family, suggests that the zzso zzso is representative of a new zzso
