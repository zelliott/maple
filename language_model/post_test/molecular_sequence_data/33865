The discovery of zzso zzso vents in 1977 revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel primary productivity on zzso zzso zzso zzso are dominated by animals that live in zzso with zzso zzso So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power zzso zzso reduced zzso compounds and zzso Using zzso sequencing, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso shipboard zzso and in zzso mass zzso we show here that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary zzso In addition, we show that the zzso of zzso zzso from Pacific vents have zzso the key gene for hydrogen zzso Furthermore, the zzso of other zzso animals such as the zzso zzso zzso and the shrimp zzso zzso also have zzso We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in zzso zzso zzso particularly at sites where hydrogen is zzso
