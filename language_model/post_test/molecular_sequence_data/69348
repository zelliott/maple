Using fixed zzso zzso cell zzso the molecules involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso large cell zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were identified by affinity zzso zzso zzso obtained from poorly zzso or highly zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso cells to bind to fixed zzso cell zzso and zzso the bound components indicated that several tumor cell surface molecules zzso 70, approximately 35, approximately 32, approximately 22, and approximately 14 zzso might be involved in zzso zzso cell zzso The approximately 35 zzso component was zzso dependent in its binding to target zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration had no effect on binding of the approximately 35 zzso component to zzso cell zzso whereas treatment with zzso M zzso resulted in its selective zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso from cell zzso zzso cells resulted in selective depletion of the approximately 35 zzso zzso suggesting that the binding is zzso This zzso zzso zzso is one of the major tumor cell surface components bound by several types of zzso cells and zzso zzso whereas there was poor binding of this component to zzso or fixed human red blood zzso The zzso partially zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso acid sequence identity with zzso but not bovine zzso II, indicating that it was not bound from the bovine serum used to grow zzso zzso Using zzso specific for zzso II flow zzso indicated equivalent amounts of zzso II are expressed on zzso cell surfaces in the absence or presence of excess zzso whereas zzso I was only found in low amounts on the surfaces of zzso zzso zzso II zzso inhibited by approximately zzso the zzso of zzso tumor cells to live or fixed zzso cells, and zzso tumor cell surface zzso containing the approximately 35 zzso component partially inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The data indicate that zzso II is expressed on the zzso surface of zzso cells, and cell zzso II mediates a portion of the zzso zzso cell zzso to liver zzso zzso zzso
