zzso are thought to be critical components of the defense of plants against damage to DNA by solar ultraviolet light, but nothing is known about their molecular or zzso zzso The molecular cloning of a zzso from mustard zzso zzso described here is intended to increase the knowledge about this important repair mechanism in plant species at a molecular zzso The gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 57 zzso There is a strong sequence similarity to bacterial and zzso zzso with a close relationship to zzso with a zzso zzso The plant zzso is shown to be functional in zzso coli which also indicates conservation of zzso during zzso It is demonstrated that zzso expression in plants is light zzso thus providing good evidence for the adaptation of plants to their environment in order to diminish the harmful effects of zzso
