zzso repeated zzso are important for identifying zzso components of hybrid organisms in plant breeding and in zzso studies, and we have previously described the zzso and zzso families of highly repetitive DNA sequences in zzso Here we describe a new family of highly repetitive DNA sequences termed zzso zzso zzso that we have isolated from zzso zzso zzso and characterized and that is specific for the zzso of several species of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso sequences are present in three pairs of zzso of zzso zzso six pairs of zzso of zzso zzso and only one pair of zzso of zzso zzso at an zzso zzso The zzso family is not present in the zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso sequences appeared to be organized in tandem zzso in which local DNA structures sensitive to single zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso revealed a zzso of 220 zzso equal to the length of the repeat zzso The inner zzso in zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso family is frequently zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso units are zzso zzso in length and show zzso mutual zzso They exhibit properties characteristic for molecules that possess stable intrinsic zzso but there are differences among individual zzso in the degree of zzso zzso sequences like zzso and zzso zzso were found to specify zzso zzso
