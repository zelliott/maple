The diversity of zzso markers of zzso zzso depends on transmission zzso It has been reported that the diversity of the zzso surface protein 2 zzso is greater in areas of high compared to low zzso however, results for zzso were zzso These previous reports relied on low resolution zzso zzso 

In the present study, a high-resolution zzso zzso technique was applied to zzso samples from areas of different zzso in zzso New zzso and zzso For both endemic settings, the diversity of zzso and zzso was zzso the mean zzso of infection zzso and the zzso values were determined to investigate whether more accurate zzso generates different zzso 

The results of the present study confirmed previous reports of a higher mean zzso for both marker genes and increased genetic diversity in areas of higher zzso as estimated by the total number of distinct zzso for zzso For zzso a minor increase in diversity was zzso zzso of between population zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicated little genetic differentiation for both marker genes between the two populations from different endemic zzso zzso adjusted for the probability of multiple infections sharing the same zzso was estimated by using the zzso zzso frequency distribution and the distribution of observed numbers of concurrent zzso For the high-resolution typing technique applied in this study, this adjustment made little difference to the estimated mean zzso compared to the observed mean zzso
