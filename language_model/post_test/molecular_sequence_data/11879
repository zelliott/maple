We previously showed that zzso from zzso mice zzso against the E6 protein of human zzso virus zzso type 16 recognized a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids 131 to zzso We show in this study that the minimal zzso 130 to zzso is a zzso zzso presented by zzso class I zzso At position zzso the 130 to 137 zzso contains a zzso zzso anchor zzso but zzso and zzso do not contain the typical anchor zzso that are frequently found in zzso zzso Analysis with zzso peptides indicates that the zzso at zzso acts as an alternative anchor zzso zzso zzso while an zzso at zzso is a zzso contact zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso 130 to 138 are as efficiently recognized by zzso as 130 to 137 zzso Analysis of extracts of zzso cells suggests that zzso processing may produce multiple peptides containing the minimal 130 to 137 zzso In zzso binding studies indicate that zzso binding of zzso 130 to 137 is approximately five orders of magnitude less efficient than zzso binding of previously identified zzso zzso In contrast, the E6 protein contains another potential zzso zzso in the region of zzso acids 41 to zzso A synthetic zzso spanning this region binds very strongly to zzso and is capable of stimulating a strong zzso zzso zzso In the context of the whole zzso however, this zzso remains zzso
