Although zzso has been recognized as an independent risk factor for zzso its zzso are not well zzso Because zzso and zzso of zzso such as zzso and T cells have been demonstrated to be critical events in the initiation and development of zzso we investigated the effect of homocysteine zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso interactions under inflammatory zzso zzso When zzso were zzso with zzso followed by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso increased in a zzso zzso The significant increase in zzso cell zzso to zzso was also observed when zzso cells were treated with zzso or when both cell types were treated with zzso We also demonstrated that zzso increases zzso surface expression and zzso level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso to zzso by zzso zzso directed to specific zzso molecules demonstrated that both zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso with vitamin E was effective in preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso cell interaction is one potential mechanism by which zzso may lead to the development of zzso under inflammatory zzso zzso antioxidants such as vitamin E may zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and may help reduce the risk of vascular disease associated with zzso
