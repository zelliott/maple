Since the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso the target zzso of zzso disease, the zzso has been expressed in a variety of zzso cells to obtain a functional zzso Despite this success, the levels of zzso expression have been marginally higher than the extremely low levels found in zzso cells, preventing any progress on the zzso of the zzso In this study, the large zzso region of the zzso without the membrane spanning zzso has been expressed in insect cells using zzso zzso to generate substantial quantities of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso previously generated to a bacterial zzso fusion protein was used to characterize and monitor the expression of the truncated zzso in insect zzso Two zzso of 63 and 49 zzso were recognized as the components of the truncated zzso zzso The 63 zzso protein was shown to be the zzso form of the smaller, 49 zzso zzso zzso in different insect cell lines showed that an increase in expression of approximately tenfold was apparent in High Five cells when compared with zzso zzso Very small quantities of the truncated zzso were zzso by the three insect cell lines zzso with the majority of the zzso being retained within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso quantities of the truncated zzso was achieved using the zzso zzso The availability of the zzso zzso has allowed the establishment of an zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso Although the truncated zzso interacts with zzso our results show that it does not bind zzso and differs in this respect from other zzso hormone zzso
