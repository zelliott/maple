The folding and assembly of zzso occurs within the cell through a series of discrete steps leading to the formation of a stable zzso consisting of three distinct zzso the zzso the zzso and the collagen triple zzso flanked at either end by short zzso We have established a zzso cell system which allows us to study the initial stages in the folding and assembly of zzso as they would occur in the intact zzso By studying the folding and assembly of the zzso domain in isolation, and a zzso zzso which lacks the zzso we have shown that this domain directs the initial association event and is required to allow triple zzso zzso However, the essential function of this domain does not include triple zzso nucleation or zzso since this can occur when the zzso is zzso with a single zzso zzso Also the zzso region is not involved in triple zzso zzso however, a minimum of two zzso zzso triplets at the zzso end of the triple zzso are required for nucleation to zzso Thus, the zzso is required solely to ensure association of the zzso zzso once these are brought together, the triple zzso is able to zzso and fold to form a correctly aligned triple zzso
