zzso d is a zzso zzso that, based on chemical zzso has only recently been recognized to be widespread in oceanic and zzso zzso However, the diversity of organisms zzso this zzso is not zzso Until now, the zzso zzso zzso marina is the only characterized zzso that uses zzso d as a major zzso In this study we describe a new zzso possessing a high amount of zzso zzso which was isolated from waters around zzso Island, Great zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso divergent from the two previously described zzso of zzso marina, which were isolated from waters around the zzso islands zzso zzso and the zzso Sea lake zzso suggesting that it belongs to a different zzso within the zzso zzso An overview sequence analysis of its zzso based on zzso technology yielded zzso zzso with an accumulated length of zzso Their analysis revealed typical features associated with zzso such as an extended gene family for zzso zzso However, compared with zzso marina zzso distinct zzso zzso and zzso differences were zzso Light zzso is reached at lower light zzso zzso zzso ratios are less variable with light intensity and the zzso zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso occur in distinct zzso These data characterize zzso as a zzso zzso and show that more rigorous attempts are worthwhile to zzso cultivate and zzso zzso zzso zzso for understanding the zzso of these zzso
