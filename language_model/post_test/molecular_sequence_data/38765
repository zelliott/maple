This paper describes the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso as zzso Lewis X zzso that contain a zzso to position the zzso group in a zzso zzso It was found that compound 4 is more active as a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 19 zzso than the parent zzso 2, which contains a flexible zzso group zzso zzso 193 zzso This result is consistent with that observed in the previous zzso study of zzso Lewis X bound to zzso The chemistry described here should be useful for the development of selective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
