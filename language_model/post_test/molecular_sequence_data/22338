We present a fusion system suited to determine the crystal structure of small zzso zzso zzso a hybrid inhibitor zzso knot zzso was produced as a soluble fusion to a zzso inactive zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as a versatile tag, zzso facilitated zzso zzso and high-resolution structure zzso zzso of the zzso region allows for different relative zzso of zzso and the fusion partner in two zzso independent molecules and may thereby facilitate crystal zzso Nevertheless, the zzso region is well ordered in both zzso This system may prove more generally useful to determine the crystal structure of peptides and small zzso
