zzso affects diverse zzso processes in zzso zzso zzso was previously identified as an zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso proteins contain a zzso motif and a zzso domain in their zzso and extreme zzso regions, zzso zzso expressed zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity in zzso which was zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in their zzso zzso In zzso targeting experiments using an zzso zzso system showed that all three zzso are localized to the zzso Although zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso were expressed zzso in all zzso zzso their promoter activities were zzso detected in a zzso fashion in zzso transgenic zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are predominantly expressed in major zzso such as zzso leaves, zzso zzso roots, and zzso while zzso expression is restricted to the root tips and leaf zzso We suggest that a zzso zzso involving these zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the growth and development of zzso
