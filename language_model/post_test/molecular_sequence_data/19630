zzso increases zzso hormone zzso gene expression in in zzso models of zzso zzso Early growth zzso zzso is a zzso factor that mediates the effect of insulin on target zzso In the zzso cell zzso immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso zzso increases zzso zzso after zzso of treatment and zzso protein and zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso small interfering zzso blocks the zzso increase in zzso promoter activity, measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso DNA in a zzso region of the zzso promoter but not DNA in a zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso binding site within the zzso region blocks the zzso increase in zzso promoter zzso Thus, zzso binds the zzso promoter at a site between zzso and zzso from the zzso start site to mediate the zzso increase in zzso gene zzso
