The zzso zzso of the constant region of the rabbit zzso zzso 1 zzso light chain zzso zzso was discovered in wild populations from northern zzso At the zzso level, the zzso zzso is characterized by the presentation of all zzso zzso while an zzso zzso which is shared between the nominal zzso and zzso zzso is zzso The DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso was amplified by means of the zzso chain reaction, and zzso directly by zzso When compared with the sequence of the nominal zzso zzso the zzso sequence differs at zzso zzso positions zzso zzso This variation zzso to zzso acid replacements at 1) the three positions zzso to the zzso junction with the variable region zzso acid positions zzso 2) the four positions zzso to the zzso zzso bond zzso and 3) two positions in the vicinity of the zzso zzso bond zzso and zzso The nature and distribution of the observed zzso zzso strongly suggest a possible role of the extra zzso zzso bond in the unusual evolutionary dynamics of the rabbit zzso light zzso
