Previous analysis of the zzso of advanced zzso by culture and real-time zzso emphasized the high zzso and abundance of zzso zzso species, particularly zzso zzso The diversity of zzso bacteria was further explored by analyzing pooled bacterial DNA from zzso of zzso zzso This was achieved by amplification of a region of the zzso zzso DNA with a zzso zzso forward primer and a universal bacterial reverse zzso followed by cloning and zzso zzso zzso species commonly associated with oral zzso constituted only zzso of the zzso clones isolated from advanced zzso zzso The remaining zzso consisted of a diverse range of zzso These included five clusters of previously recognized but zzso oral zzso zzso and a major cluster containing zzso bacteria most closely related to zzso rumen zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the numbers of bacteria within clusters were zzso by real-time zzso confirming the abundance of these zzso The data indicated that advanced dental zzso provides a unique environment for a complex array of novel and zzso zzso and zzso bacteria which, in some cases, may dominate the diverse zzso community associated with the zzso
