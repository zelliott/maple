To examine zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso tissue from patients with zzso arthritis zzso compared with zzso specimens from patients with zzso zzso or other zzso zzso samples from zzso without any signs of joint disease, were used as control zzso 

Using a combination of zzso chain reaction zzso and automated sequencing of the amplified zzso product, regions around zzso 12, 13, and 61 of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Confirmation of zzso was based on restriction zzso length zzso analysis and/or zzso zzso 

Four zzso of 72 patients with zzso 2 zzso of 16 with zzso and 1 zzso of 12 with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso at zzso 13 for the zzso zzso zzso An unexpected zzso was found in the zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed over zzso zzso The zzso for this zzso was zzso zzso of zzso in zzso patients, zzso (15 of zzso in zzso patients, and zzso (5 of zzso in patients with other zzso All samples carrying the zzso 13 zzso of zzso were also zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso point zzso were also detected in a few zzso specimens obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso including a single case of double zzso All specimens showed normal zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso by point zzso in zzso 13 and 14 occurred in the zzso tissue of patients with zzso zzso or other zzso as well as, to some extent, in the control zzso indicating that the phenomenon is not specific for zzso In zzso 14, zzso of the zzso point zzso was highest in zzso zzso The possible significance of this zzso zzso zzso gene needs to be zzso
