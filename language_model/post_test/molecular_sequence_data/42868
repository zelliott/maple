zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were estimated in natural zzso and strains of zzso from zzso in zzso A simultaneous analysis method of zzso and zzso was applied to natural bloom samples, which has been dominated by several species and the strains of zzso which produced simultaneously both zzso The natural zzso examined in the present study were mainly composed of zzso and zzso but most also contained zzso and other zzso Only one sample was almost zzso zzso zzso collected from Lake zzso The toxins in 14 samples collected from nine different natural zzso during zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the main toxins contained in these natural zzso with zzso not being detected or of very little zzso zzso was detected in samples only from Lake zzso Five strains of zzso isolated from waters in Japan produced a small amount of zzso but no zzso One half of the strains of zzso produced zzso and/or zzso This is the first study showing zzso producing both zzso and zzso
