Using a gel zzso zzso a protein factor that specifically interacts with a 33 zzso zzso sequence of the highly expressed and zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso This binding site is located in a transcribed region and within the open reading frame zzso zzso to zzso relative to the first base of the initiation zzso A zzso strain carrying a deletion of this binding site showed a dramatic decrease in zzso levels of zzso zzso This decline is not the result of a decrease in zzso stability, since expression of hybrid genes in which the zzso promoter was replaced by the zzso zzso promoter was not affected by the binding site zzso These findings suggest that the 33 zzso sequence contains a zzso downstream zzso element which is involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed similarities between a site located within the 33 zzso sequence and the zzso consensus binding site of the zzso (also named zzso factor and zzso interference experiments confirmed that this site was involved in the zzso zzso Both the results of competition experiments with upstream zzso sequences of zzso protein genes zzso which are targets for zzso zzso and determination of the apparent molecular weight of the zzso zzso protein indicated that zzso factor recognized the zzso 33 zzso zzso The 33 zzso sequence was found to be unable to provide zzso activity when placed upstream of the zzso box and zzso start zzso
