The rabbit zzso zzso zzso has been widely zzso to study the direct effects of zzso II zzso zzso on zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to characterize the binding properties of zzso zzso II zzso using zzso antagonists, and to clone a rabbit zzso zzso II zzso In rat and rabbit kidney cortical zzso and zzso zzso specific binding of zzso II was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a rabbit kidney zzso zzso library, we isolated zzso zzso an zzso II zzso with an zzso frame sharing a high degree of sequence zzso to previously cloned zzso zzso II zzso In zzso zzso cells, this rabbit zzso II zzso had properties of the zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed high levels of zzso expression for this zzso in rabbit kidney zzso and adrenal zzso Within the zzso message was detected in primary cultures of rabbit zzso cells, as well as in freshly isolated rabbit zzso zzso zzso was also present in cells of the mouse zzso line, zzso and in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso derived from the 1st and 4th zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso II zzso a zzso DNA zzso was amplified from zzso zzso from rabbit zzso zzso This DNA zzso an zzso acid sequence identical to that zzso by the rabbit kidney zzso clone in the corresponding region and differed by a single base zzso Southern analysis of rabbit zzso DNA restriction zzso with the rabbit zzso II zzso probe revealed zzso to a single band in each zzso These results indicate that an zzso zzso II zzso is present in the zzso and that a single gene codes for the zzso zzso in zzso The clone isolated in the present study should provide a useful tool with which to study the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
