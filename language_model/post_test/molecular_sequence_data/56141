In order to identify a common region of deletion on zzso 17 potentially containing a zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso and 3 zzso tumors of low zzso potential zzso were examined for loss of zzso zzso at 6 p arm and 10 zzso arm zzso zzso percent of all tumors had deletions at one or more zzso On the p arm, there was a single zzso region of deletion on zzso zzso zzso zzso an intervening locus with a low zzso rate, and a more zzso locus on zzso zzso zzso zzso with a high zzso zzso In less aggressive tumors, zzso at zzso was not accompanied by zzso at zzso The zzso arm had a common region of deletion for zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso a locus tightly linked to the familial zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso was lost in all zzso zzso zzso and retained in all zzso zzso and tumors of zzso There may be at least 2 zzso zzso an zzso gene on the p arm and a gene on the zzso arm involved in tumor progression and zzso
