The human zzso growth factor II zzso gene constitutes a complex zzso unit that contains nine zzso and four zzso zzso of the zzso gene yields a family of zzso that all zzso zzso In addition, a stable zzso zzso zzso is formed that is derived from the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso Recently, we have shown that this zzso species arises by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and not by zzso from a separate zzso In the present study we establish that two widely separated sequence elements of approximately 300 zzso both located within zzso 9, are required for this zzso zzso The first element encompasses about 200 zzso upstream and 100 zzso downstream of the zzso site, while the second element is located within a region of 330 zzso about 2 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso also occurred when a zzso from zzso 9 of the zzso gene containing these two elements was inserted into the 3' untranslated part of the zzso zzso Apparently, the expressed hybrid zzso zzso contains all the regulatory elements to zzso zzso zzso zzso
