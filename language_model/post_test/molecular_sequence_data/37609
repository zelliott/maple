Gene identification studies, zzso on a region of overlapping loss of zzso in breast zzso within band zzso lead to the zzso of zzso a novel human zzso zzso The coding sequence of zzso extends over a 60 zzso region and comprises in excess of 28 zzso Alternative zzso occurs minimally at five positions, four of which are within the coding zzso The fifth region of alternative zzso occurs at the extreme zzso end of the zzso A clear tissue specific bias in alternative zzso selection is observed to some degree at all five positions, including the extreme zzso region, which raises the possibility of multiple and perhaps tissue specific zzso One such putative promoter region, which appears to be zzso predominantly in breast cancer cells, has been zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso with the simplest (19 zzso gene product being zzso identical between human and zzso zzso of the alternatively spliced zzso between three species, where data are available, has so far revealed zzso identity in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting conservation of a functional aspect of this zzso Gene expression has been observed in all zzso and cell lines tested, with the exception of zzso and multiple myeloma lines, where there appears to be only a very low level of zzso zzso also appears to be zzso in human bone zzso These data are consistent with a role for the gene products in zzso zzso Analysis of a panel of breast zzso cell lines revealed that a number apparently zzso the gene whilst others showed very low levels of zzso In one case, the zzso correlated with a low level increase in gene copy number in the zzso zzso In addition to differences in the overall levels of zzso zzso zzso were alternatively spliced to varying degrees with shifts in the major gene product to truncated or altered forms in some zzso No zzso zzso zzso were detected through sequence analysis of four primary breast zzso that showed loss of the adjacent zzso marker zzso
