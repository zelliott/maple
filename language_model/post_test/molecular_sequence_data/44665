T cells initiate many immune responses through the interaction of their zzso zzso receptors zzso with zzso peptides bound to major zzso complex zzso zzso This interaction sends a zzso signal into the T cell by a mechanism that is not clearly zzso We have used zzso light scattering zzso to show that, in the presence of zzso molecules bound to a full zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso in solution to form zzso structures at zzso near the zzso constant of the binding zzso The size of the zzso is concentration dependent and is calculated to contain two to six zzso complexes for the zzso tested zzso This effect is specific as neither zzso forms zzso by itself, nor were zzso observed unless the correct zzso was bound to the zzso These results provide direct evidence for models of zzso zzso based on the specific assembly of multiple zzso complexes in which the degree of assembly determines the extent and qualitative nature of the zzso zzso They may also explain how T cells maintain sensitivity to zzso present in only low abundance on the zzso zzso
