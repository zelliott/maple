The complete DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequences of adjacent upstream and downstream open reading frames zzso have been zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso region predicts a zzso of zzso zzso acids in length with zzso to the zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso lies upstream from a sequence that has zzso to the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso stop zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso the predicted start zzso for the zzso zzso Another zzso that lies upstream from the zzso zzso has sequence similarity to the genes that code for the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso region between the zzso and zzso coding zzso the presence of a zzso promoter sequence and an zzso zzso repeat suggests that the zzso zzso and the adjacent downstream sequences may be transcribed independently of the zzso coding zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso The proposed gene and transcript organization of the zzso coding regions in the zzso clone resembles that of zzso zzso which, like the zzso has a zzso zzso
