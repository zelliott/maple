Two zzso zzso and six zzso zzso were identified from a group of 15 zzso zzso zzso the most threatened zzso in the zzso Little sequence variation was detected at the zzso locus but extensive variation at the zzso zzso In combination with data at the zzso locus previously reported, three zzso zzso zzso 2 of the zzso all revealed striking similarity with those of the zzso zzso zzso some identical zzso shared by both species at the zzso and zzso zzso suggested the zzso evolution as a consequence of common zzso solutions to similar environmental pressures in the zzso zzso As for zzso zzso the identity zzso were shared not only by zzso and zzso zzso but by some other zzso species of the families zzso and zzso suggesting zzso evolution on this zzso
