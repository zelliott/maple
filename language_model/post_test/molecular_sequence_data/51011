zzso currents can be modulated by zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso We have determined whether the two forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate calcium current zzso Using identified zzso of the pond snail zzso we demonstrate that a zzso zzso calcium current is reduced by addition of the zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso is zzso by a zzso toxin zzso G protein zzso Using this calcium current as an zzso for G protein activity, we zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso of G proteins into zzso zzso We demonstrate that the calcium current is zzso regulated by the two forms of alpha zzso zzso of alpha zzso but not alpha zzso reduces calcium current zzso
