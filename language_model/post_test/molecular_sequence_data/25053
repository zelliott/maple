zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that occurs in the zzso of zzso oysters zzso zzso zzso in New zzso zzso it resembles other zzso in the possession of zzso zzso persistence of zzso zzso during zzso and of the nuclear envelope during zzso and occurrence of a zzso or zzso zzso zzso Another stage containing a large zzso derived from enlargement of 1 or more zzso has not previously been described from other zzso It most closely resembles zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1979, which zzso and is zzso in zzso of European flat oysters, zzso zzso However, zzso zzso is smaller and zzso and has fewer zzso bodies and zzso We have nearly completely zzso the small zzso gene of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso comparisons of these sequences with those of other zzso showed similarities to zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso was confirmed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular considerations it is proposed that this zzso be named zzso zzso zzso zzso
