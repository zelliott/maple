zzso pancreatic zzso A zzso zzso has been the object of much landmark work in biological zzso Yet the application of the techniques of protein engineering to zzso A has been limited by problems inherent in the isolation and zzso expression of its zzso A zzso library was prepared from cow zzso and from this library the zzso that codes for zzso A was zzso This zzso was inserted into expression plasmids that then directed the production of zzso A in zzso zzso zzso to a modified zzso leader zzso or zzso coli zzso to the zzso signal zzso zzso A zzso into the medium by zzso was an active but highly zzso zzso that was zzso at 1 zzso of zzso zzso A produced by zzso was in an zzso fraction of the cell zzso zzso of the reduced and zzso protein produced active zzso which was isolated at 50 zzso of zzso The bacterial expression system is ideal for the large-scale production of zzso of zzso zzso This system was used to substitute zzso zzso or zzso for zzso a zzso zzso that donates a hydrogen bond to the zzso zzso group of bound zzso Analysis of the binding and turnover of natural and synthetic zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso shows that the primary role of zzso is to prevent the zzso binding of zzso
