The chemical signaling pathways which orchestrate lung cell responses in zzso pulmonary vascular disease are poorly zzso The present study examined zzso zzso in lung basic zzso Growth Factor zzso in a well characterized rat model of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso By zzso analysis, there were progressive increases in zzso in zzso vascular and gas exchange regions of zzso rat zzso zzso in zzso preceded the onset of right zzso zzso at day 21 after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed as early as day 4 in focal areas of the zzso and by day 14 there was enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which persisted through day zzso In conducting zzso there was elevated zzso zzso in the smooth muscle cell zzso layer by days 4 and 7 and in the zzso zzso and its basement membrane at days 14 and zzso zzso zzso similar to Clara cells in the zzso surfaces of zzso stained intensely on days 14 and zzso In the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso within pulmonary zzso there was a progressive increase in zzso zzso starting at day zzso Lung zzso zzso was increased slightly at days 1, 4 and 7, while lung zzso zzso as judged by western zzso analysis, was increased at days 14 and 21 compared to zzso The present results, considered in zzso light of zzso documented roles of zzso in vascular cell migration, growth and synthesis of zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso may contribute to the structural zzso processes underlying the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension in zzso zzso
