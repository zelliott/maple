zzso zzso sequences zzso consist of tandem repeats of the zzso zzso repeat and are common in zzso They are localized at zzso sites, including those repeats located close to the zzso and those found at zzso sites, zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso might originate from ancestral zzso zzso zzso and zzso from differential zzso or from the repair of zzso break during zzso Three classes of zzso have been described in the human zzso zzso short zzso long zzso zzso and fusion zzso The fourth class of zzso zzso zzso has been found in other zzso The function of zzso can be zzso from the association of zzso diseases with ITS zzso zzso both in copy number and zzso This is one of the most attractive aspects of ITS studies because it leads to new and useful markers for genetic linkage studies, forensic applications, and detection of genetic instability in zzso Some zzso also might be hotspots of zzso zzso zzso and amplification sites, based on the type of zzso and the nature of zzso This study will contribute new knowledge with respect to zzso biology and zzso prevalence of diseases, risk evaluation and prevention of related diseases, thus zzso the design of early detection markers for diseases caused by zzso zzso
