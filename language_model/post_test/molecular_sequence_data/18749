A novel zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from Pacific Ocean zzso The strain was zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso and zzso and required zzso for zzso Its major zzso zzso was zzso zzso and its cellular fatty acid profile mainly consisted of zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis suggested that strain zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited close zzso affinity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso values between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 31, 26 and zzso zzso zzso to the significant differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso zzso data, the new isolate merits zzso as a representative of novel species, for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
