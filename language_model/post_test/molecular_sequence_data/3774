zzso zzso is a zzso zzso associated with increasing morbidity and mortality and is readily transmitted among infected zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex consists of five distinct subgroups, termed zzso A collection of 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from three national zzso referral zzso located in different geographical regions in Ireland, was zzso The aim of this study was to investigate these zzso using molecular zzso protocols for evidence of genetic relationships and for the presence of zzso zzso class 1 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were assigned to each isolate based on zzso zzso profiles of their zzso zzso zzso relationships among this collection were also assessed after restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso locus and DNA amplification zzso zzso The surface expression of the cable zzso gene zzso may facilitate an early step in the infection zzso All zzso were tested by amplification strategies for this zzso zzso zzso is known to be resistant to several zzso zzso Resistance typing showed that the majority were resistant to three or more common zzso zzso Five of the 17 zzso were resistant to zzso a characteristic linked with the presence of class 1 zzso Gene zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso chain reaction zzso 

Most of the zzso in this study were classified as zzso III and were indistinguishable based on their corresponding zzso zzso profiles, whilst zzso further zzso the zzso The zzso marker was identified in zzso of the zzso many of which clustered in the zzso III zzso Class 1 zzso with zzso gene zzso containing zzso and zzso genes were zzso 

This study demonstrates the application of molecular methods to investigate zzso zzso a zzso human zzso cultured from Irish zzso zzso zzso III was the most common zzso type zzso DNA zzso further zzso the latter zzso zzso a more detailed description of the molecular zzso Drug resistance in these organisms can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of class 1 zzso Development of targeted infection control strategies could be facilitated using these applied zzso
