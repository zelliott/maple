zzso is a recently described human zzso zzso cell line that makes a variety of steroid zzso We sought to determine if zzso in these cells employs the same zzso as those used in normal adrenal zzso and if the genes zzso those zzso exhibit characteristic responsiveness to zzso of the protein zzso and -C pathways of zzso second zzso Northern blots show that zzso cells contain abundant zzso for three key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso accumulated in a zzso and zzso fashion in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso of the protein zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso regulates the expression of all three genes primarily at the zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis with zzso did not prevent the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso but did inhibit zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is acting through a mechanism dependent on protein synthesis to promote zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso but zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso protection experiments, Northern zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction show that zzso cells express both the 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso increased the abundance of both of these zzso with similar zzso with zzso zzso of both after about 24 zzso zzso cells also contain the zzso for zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso increased the abundance of zzso zzso and decreased the abundance of zzso zzso These studies show that zzso cells express most of the zzso needed for human adrenal zzso and that the genes zzso these zzso respond to stimulation of second zzso pathways in a manner similar to that of human zzso zzso cells appear to be a good model for studying the molecular regulation of human adrenal zzso
