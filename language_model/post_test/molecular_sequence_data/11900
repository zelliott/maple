zzso of adult tolerance induced by injecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in Lewis rat experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso could be zzso against the major zzso zzso of guinea pig basic protein zzso zzso zzso using either zzso or crude spinal zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso responses that were not affected significantly, the proliferation responses of blood T cells were markedly inhibited at the peak of zzso and during the recovery period to both zzso and zzso but not to zzso protein zzso zzso demonstrating zzso zzso zzso induction reduced the number of zzso spinal zzso zzso cells, especially recruited zzso cells, as well as SC proliferation responses to zzso throughout the course of zzso In contrast, SC response to zzso was increased at onset of zzso but later during recovery the zzso response was also decreased compared with control zzso zzso induced by zzso in blood and SC T cells could be reversed by incubation in zzso in accordance with an zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso in zzso with zzso were rendered unresponsive to zzso or zzso compared with the same T cells zzso with zzso zzso that remained zzso zzso zzso with an zzso model, zzso with zzso partially prevented tolerance induction to zzso T cells zzso in zzso to zzso induced milder zzso with delayed onset compared with zzso T cells that produced lethal zzso These results demonstrate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso in preventing zzso by selective zzso of zzso T cells through a partially zzso zzso zzso
