Previous studies with zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, have shown that the activity of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is increased by agents that elevate zzso zzso zzso The present experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether an increase in zzso zzso message and/or protein accompanies the zzso of zzso activity and 2) whether the zzso changes the functional responses of zzso cells to zzso of zzso zzso To zzso zzso activity, zzso cells were treated for 4 h with a combination of 1 zzso zzso a zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso were washed extensively to remove drugs and used immediately in various experimental zzso zzso zzso chain reactions conducted with zzso specific for the four zzso zzso suggested that zzso with zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso analyses using two rabbit zzso zzso one directed against human zzso zzso and zzso and a second directed against human zzso zzso revealed bands of zzso corresponding to approximately 125 zzso zzso and approximately 70 zzso zzso respectively, that increased in intensity after cells were treated with zzso and zzso As demonstrated in both time course and zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso an agent that activates zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso was substantially decreased in cells in which zzso activity had been zzso The difference in zzso zzso zzso between control and zzso zzso cells was greatly reduced in the presence of zzso consistent with the notion that an increase in zzso activity was responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly decreased the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso A hypothetical implication of these results is that increasing zzso activity in zzso by administering zzso zzso could exacerbate inflammatory processes by decreasing the activity of zzso zzso agents such as zzso
