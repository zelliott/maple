The zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso zzso was disrupted through transformation with a zzso carrying a doubly truncated copy of the coding region and a zzso marker for resistance to zzso B zzso Analysis of 82 zzso for their ability to produce the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the identification of five zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso integrated at the zzso zzso The disrupted zzso gene was shown to be zzso zzso Analysis of nine zzso revealed either the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso or the loss of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of using gene disruption in zzso zzso and suggest a general method for obtaining zzso zzso in other zzso zzso
