The molecular mechanism of zzso persistence of zzso zzso has been previously described in a large Scottish family, consisting of a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso nuclear factor 1 zzso binding site of the zzso zzso gene zzso We report here the molecular mechanisms of zzso in 2 new unrelated zzso 

Family 1 was of Bengali origin, and family 2 was zzso Four of 5 subjects zzso 1) and 3 of 9 zzso 2) showed zzso The zzso gene promoter was studied in all available family zzso 

All subjects with high zzso levels had zzso promoter zzso Family 1 showed the reported zzso zzso Family 2 showed zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso putative zzso binding region of the zzso The zzso zzso increased the similarity of the zzso zzso binding region to a consensus binding zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed its increased affinity toward zzso and zzso experiments revealed an increased level of gene zzso The zzso substitution theoretically created a zzso zzso However, gel shift and zzso experiments failed to show any biological effect of this substitution that is associated with the zzso zzso 

Two different zzso localized in either zzso binding sites of the zzso gene promoter may result in zzso This highlights the importance of zzso in zzso gene zzso Unexplained persistent zzso should lead to family study and/or zzso gene promoter sequencing to avoid inappropriate explorations and treatment zzso
