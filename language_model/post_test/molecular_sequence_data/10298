zzso zzso factors have zzso DNA binding zzso that have a winged zzso zzso zzso the founding member of the family, is regulated by the Ras and zzso signaling pathways and is implicated in various zzso processes leading to cell growth, differentiation and zzso We have identified zzso interacting factors with a zzso zzso zzso The majority of the positive clones turned out to zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In two different zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several other zzso family members zzso with zzso Interestingly, in zzso cells, zzso of zzso resulted in a substantial increase in the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso protein level, and moreover, a point zzso at zzso an zzso acid known to be essential for zzso did not abolish the stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso activity by zzso results from processes other than zzso and zzso zzso
