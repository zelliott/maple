zzso the protein primer required for the zzso of muscle zzso has been isolated from rabbit liver zzso The protein comprised zzso of liver zzso by mass, zzso lower than the zzso content of muscle zzso zzso zzso including determination of the zzso acid sequence surrounding the zzso zzso showed identity with muscle zzso zzso active liver zzso was partially zzso and, like the skeletal muscle zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso reaction, forming a primer on which zzso zzso could zzso The results demonstrate that zzso and muscle zzso are almost certainly identical proteins and that liver and skeletal muscle share a common mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso The results also indicate that there is about one zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso
