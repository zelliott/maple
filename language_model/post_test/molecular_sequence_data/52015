A genetic linkage map of human zzso zzso spanning a zzso distance of 125 zzso has been developed by zzso 26 zzso in the Venezuelan zzso zzso The zzso include 12 anonymous zzso markers reported by zzso et zzso (1992), several classical systems previously assigned to zzso zzso and zzso for the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood group zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only a marginally significant sex difference is found along the entire length of the map and results from one zzso between zzso and zzso that displays an excess of female zzso A comparison of the genetic map to the existing physical data suggests that there is increased zzso in the zzso region with a zzso event occurring every zzso zzso This map should be useful in further characterizing the relationship between physical distance and genetic distance, as well as for genetic linkage studies of diseases that map to zzso zzso including multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sclerosis zzso
