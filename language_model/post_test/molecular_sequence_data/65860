zzso analysis of the zzso of a recently identified pathogen associated with respiratory infections, human zzso zzso allowed for identification of two virus zzso of the zzso In the current article a new method for a simple and fast differentiation of zzso zzso in clinical materials is zzso The test includes an amplification of a 309 zzso zzso of zzso gene of zzso from zzso zzso with a subsequent incubation of a zzso mix with the zzso zzso Upon such a zzso the DNA zzso derived from the zzso I zzso zzso forms two fragments of 150 and 159 zzso while that obtained from zzso 2 zzso remains zzso The developed technique may be used in zzso studies of zzso infection and analysis of the potential differences in biological characteristics of zzso zzso
