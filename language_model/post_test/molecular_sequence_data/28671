zzso and zzso are the products of zzso and zzso genes that are zzso in most cases of zzso dominant zzso kidney zzso Since the first two zzso were zzso three new members, zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso In this study, we describe a sixth member of the family, zzso zzso by zzso in zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso determined from human zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and 58 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has significant zzso with all known zzso but the longest stretches of zzso were found with zzso and zzso over the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to have two zzso zzso a zzso a zzso a zzso a zzso and 11 putative zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso signatures are also found in zzso zzso analysis and zzso revealed that human zzso is expressed in zzso and in fetal and adult zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that the most abundant and specific expression of zzso was found in zzso cells, a known source of testosterone production, in mouse zzso We have assigned zzso to the short arm of human zzso 7 in bands zzso and zzso to mouse zzso 11 in band zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We zzso a role for zzso in the heart and in the male zzso zzso
