zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that has a range of biological effects on various cells and zzso zzso activity has been detected in the spent media of zzso to zzso stage zzso zzso leading to the suggestion that zzso may be the embryonic signal that zzso zzso transport to the zzso in this zzso The present study was undertaken to examine whether the zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso zzso and to identify the cell types in which the gene is zzso DNA fragments complementary to the coding region of zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso identified by sequencing and used to prepare zzso specific zzso zzso The presence of zzso transcripts zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso was investigated by subjecting zzso zzso to zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso products verified the identity of the zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso with respect to the zzso of other species, having zzso sequence similarity to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is expressed in the zzso cells and occasionally in the zzso In conclusion, expression of zzso in the zzso zzso is compatible with the proposed zzso role of early zzso zzso
