Emerging infectious diseases represent a challenge for global economies and public zzso About one fourth of the last zzso have been originated by the spread of zzso zzso In this sense, the advent of modern molecular techniques has enhanced our capabilities to understand zzso interactions and disease zzso However, host identification protocols have poorly profited of international DNA zzso initiatives and/or have focused exclusively on a limited array of zzso zzso zzso zzso the potential afforded by DNA zzso tools in other zzso systems of human and veterinary importance would represent a major advance in tracking pathogen life cycles and zzso Here, we show the zzso of a novel and efficient molecular method for the identification of the zzso zzso DNA contained in the zzso of zzso zzso To this end, we designed a zzso forward primer and a zzso reverse primer to selectively amplify zzso base pairs zzso of the zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso zzso Our method was validated using both extensive sequence surveys from the public domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments carried out over specimens from different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The analysis of zzso zzso zzso sucking bugs, and tick zzso revealed up to 40 zzso zzso including 23 zzso 16 zzso and one zzso zzso zzso the inspection and analysis of direct sequencing zzso also assisted the resolving of mixed zzso We therefore provide a universal and zzso diagnostic tool for the study of the ecology of zzso zzso in relation to their zzso zzso Such information is crucial to support the efficient management of initiatives aimed at reducing zzso risks of zzso zzso zzso a priority for public zzso
