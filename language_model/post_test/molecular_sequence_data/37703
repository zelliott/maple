zzso zzso zzso are minimally comprised of a DNA binding domain and a zzso zzso zzso most zzso proteins also bear a zzso zzso We have replaced these protein zzso with synthetic counterparts to create artificial zzso zzso One of these, at zzso zzso mediates high levels of DNA zzso zzso zzso in zzso This zzso contains a zzso DNA binding zzso in place of the typical DNA binding region and a zzso zzso in place of the usual zzso zzso Thus our zzso region, a designed zzso functions outside of the zzso protein context, as long as it is zzso to zzso Because synthetic zzso can, in principle, be designed to recognize any specific zzso these results represent a key step toward the design of small molecules that can zzso any specified zzso
