The zzso complex, known as zzso constitutes the DNA end binding component of the zzso protein zzso zzso We have characterized the promoter region of the mouse and human zzso genes to delineate zzso elements necessary for zzso gene expression and zzso zzso Consensus zzso recognition elements were identified in both zzso and were determined to be essential for zzso zzso We further identified a near-perfect zzso of 21 base pairs located immediately zzso to one zzso zzso This sequence was present once within the mouse zzso promoter and seven times, in a zzso tandem zzso within the human zzso zzso This sequence possessed zzso with a zzso promoter element, zzso present in the zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso deletion studies and expression analysis of zzso zzso reporter gene zzso provided strong evidence that, in zzso this repeat sequence regulates zzso gene expression in zzso through a mechanism involving zzso zzso Evidence is also zzso suggesting that zzso is directly involved in this regulatory zzso
