A new human zzso zzso zzso was zzso from human zzso and its zzso was cloned from a zzso library, from zzso from a human zzso line zzso and from zzso from human zzso zzso zzso specific for the new protein detected three groups of proteins in partially zzso extracts of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso The three components are proposed to zzso to zzso active zzso and zzso modified active zzso After zzso there was a decrease in apparent molecular mass of all detected zzso zzso of the cloned zzso in a zzso zzso system yielded a zzso protein that could be converted to an active zzso by treatment with zzso zzso chain reaction analyses of zzso from a number of human zzso showed high expression of the new zzso in the skin and low expression in brain, zzso and zzso zzso searches yielded the highest score for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso High scores were also obtained for human and mouse zzso and for human stratum zzso zzso zzso The function of this new zzso tentatively named stratum zzso zzso zzso may be related to stratum zzso turnover and zzso in the zzso
