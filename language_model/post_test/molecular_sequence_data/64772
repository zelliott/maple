The zzso zzso causes zzso growth and defects in zzso zzso and distribution in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso at the two cell ends, with increased zzso at elevated zzso zzso which mediate zzso positioning in zzso zzso seem normal in zzso cells at zzso temperature and after several hours at the zzso temperature but display zzso organization after prolonged periods at 37 degrees zzso Additionally, cells harboring both zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of zzso display synthetic defects in growth and zzso zzso The zzso zzso maps to an open reading frame zzso a novel zzso zzso The zzso sequence features repeating zzso motifs and displays high conservation with zzso zzso found in a variety of zzso zzso zzso cells depleted for their zzso zzso show increased sensitivity to the zzso drug zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso zzso is the first identified component required for the alignment of zzso along zzso in zzso zzso
