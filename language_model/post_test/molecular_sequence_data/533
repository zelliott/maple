zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso reported to bind zzso but not zzso 

Gene deletion revealed that zzso is zzso In cells with zzso deleted, zzso expression of a zzso zzso created by fusion to a zzso zzso zzso allowed normal cell proliferation at 25 degrees zzso At 36 degrees C, cells arrested with zzso thick, misplaced or zzso zzso indicating a zzso late in zzso In addition to being zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso was observed at the zzso cell plane late in zzso New zzso created by zzso zzso were expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso were zzso zzso was zzso but bound zzso zzso did not bind zzso but was an active zzso zzso integration of these zzso in zzso zzso and zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso is essential in both cases while zzso is zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso while, zzso was innocuous, zzso was almost innocuous, and zzso produced partial zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression lethal zzso was suppressed in zzso Thus, zzso is essential for zzso activity and zzso 

zzso zzso activity is required for zzso The zzso zzso zzso is required for important zzso zzso possibly with zzso
