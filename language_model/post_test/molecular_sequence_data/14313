The zzso coli membrane protein zzso functions as an electron hub that dispatches electrons received from the zzso zzso system to zzso zzso involved in protein zzso zzso zzso c zzso and zzso acid zzso Here, we describe a new class of zzso zzso named zzso whose members are found in zzso and zzso zzso has a domain organization similar to that of zzso but its zzso domain differs zzso In zzso this domain directly interacts with zzso to reduce them, which suggests that zzso acts on a different array of zzso Using zzso zzso as a model zzso we searched for the zzso of zzso We discovered that zzso provides electrons to the first zzso reduction zzso identified in the bacterial cell zzso The reduction zzso comprises a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso that efficiently reduces both hydrogen zzso and organic zzso Moreover, we identified two additional proteins that depend on zzso for reduction, a zzso zzso zzso and a novel protein zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our results reveal that the array of proteins involved in reductive pathways in the zzso cell envelope is significantly broader than was previously zzso Moreover, the identification of a new zzso zzso indicates that in some bacteria, it is important to directly zzso zzso in the cell envelope even before they reach the zzso 

zzso are zzso oxygen species zzso that damage cellular components such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of protection mechanisms against zzso is essential for cell zzso zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso to directly zzso harmful zzso We report the identification of a zzso reduction zzso active in the zzso of zzso zzso which reveals that, in some bacteria, it is important to directly zzso zzso in the cell envelope even before they reach the zzso The electrons required for zzso reduction are delivered to this zzso by zzso a new type of membrane electron zzso We also identified two additional likely zzso zzso including a novel protein zzso zzso Our results reveal that the array of proteins involved in reductive pathways in the zzso environment of the cell envelope is significantly broader than was previously zzso
