The protein zzso is zzso related to the zzso zzso exchange factors zzso that activate zzso on zzso zzso However, unlike these zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso domain that zzso zzso exchange on zzso Here we report that zzso zzso shares extensive zzso with the zzso parts of both the BIG and zzso zzso A resistance factor zzso of zzso zzso and is located to the zzso Moreover, we find that zzso forms a complex with zzso a large zzso protein zzso in evolution from humans to zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso from the zzso and defects in cycling between zzso and the zzso However, unlike zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso A conditional zzso of zzso shows that loss of zzso activity not only affects zzso to zzso transport but also causes a severe zzso of the organization of the zzso zzso Thus, it appears that zzso plays a widespread role in membrane organization, and zzso acts as a scaffold to recruit the zzso pool of zzso
