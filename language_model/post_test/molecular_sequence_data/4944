zzso 11 zzso zzso is the second most common cause of zzso adrenal zzso the inherited inability to zzso zzso zzso affected patients carry zzso in the zzso gene that destroy zzso zzso Such patients have signs of zzso excess and usually have zzso zzso or zzso 11 zzso zzso has been reported previously but not studied zzso In this study we report analysis of the zzso genes of three patients thought to suffer from zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso genes of two zzso One was a compound zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the other carried a nonsense zzso zzso on one zzso and a zzso zzso zzso on the zzso All three zzso zzso affected zzso activity when expressed in zzso No zzso were detected in the coding regions or zzso boundaries of the zzso genes of the other putative zzso zzso In addition, we were unable to detect zzso zzso in two zzso women with mildly elevated levels of 11 zzso precursors who had previously been identified in a screening study of patients in a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso 11 zzso zzso is a rare zzso It is not a significant cause of zzso in women and relatively stringent criteria should be used to prevent its zzso
