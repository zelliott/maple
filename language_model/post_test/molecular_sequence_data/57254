The study of T cell zzso zzso genes has been hampered by their large zzso and elusive methods for gene zzso We have developed a new method for amplification of all human zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso of a universal zzso to the leader sequence of variable zzso regions, which permitted effective and zzso amplification of all four types of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in respectively 15, 13, 28, and 26 T cell clones from human peripheral blood T cells using a newly developed universal zzso and these zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma 9) was a major population, and zzso zzso gamma 2 and 3) and zzso zzso gamma 10) were next major populations among zzso zzso and confirmed the previous observations determined using zzso specific to zzso All five clones of zzso zzso and three of five clones of zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso In contrast, sequences from both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso regions that caused zzso zzso suggesting that most of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are not zzso V delta 2 was a major population and V delta 1 was a next zzso population among zzso zzso also confirming the previous observations determined using zzso to zzso With regards to zzso and zzso this new method randomly amplified zzso zzso In addition, the sequences of zzso portions of three zzso and one zzso beta were zzso Two new zzso zzso and one new zzso family were also zzso In zzso this new method will provide a scientific tool for understanding structures of the human zzso genes involved in specific immune zzso
