To assess the involvement of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso in in zzso zzso degradation in agricultural fields, changes in zzso community size and zzso in zzso abundance and in zzso zzso capacity were monitored in field soil plots either treated or not with a zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso community zzso due to the proliferation of a zzso unknown zzso zzso D, and increases in zzso numbers occurred zzso to increases in zzso zzso capacity in the plot treated with the zzso zzso The observations suggest that zzso and zzso proliferated as a response to zzso and hence their contribution to in zzso zzso zzso The involvement of zzso zzso D and zzso in zzso degradation in the examined soil was supported by laboratory soil microcosm zzso Attempts to enrich in suspended cultures and isolate the zzso corresponding to zzso D from the soil were unsuccessful as the enrichment resulted in replacement of zzso zzso D by other zzso zzso This illustrates that zzso strains isolated by liquid enrichment cultures are not always representatives of those responsive to zzso in the field, although the zzso specificity of zzso degradation was zzso
