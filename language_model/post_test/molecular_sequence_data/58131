The set of peptides that is bound by a given major zzso complex class I product can be described by one or two properly spaced anchor zzso and two properly spaced zzso zzso approximately 8-10 zzso zzso Using zzso zzso libraries, we examined whether zzso in those zzso in class I zzso molecules that do not seem critically involved in the interaction with the zzso anchor zzso do exert an effect on the set of preferred zzso We find that zzso in all the pockets found in the structure of zzso have a significant effect on the zzso preference of the zzso and their recognition by zzso T zzso zzso in zzso specificity are also observed for zzso involving zzso that interact with main chain atoms in both zzso zzso These findings challenge a zzso view of the interaction of zzso zzso with their respective pockets in the class I zzso and imply a role for the minor pockets in zzso zzso
