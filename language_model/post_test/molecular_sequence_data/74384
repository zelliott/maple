A simple method for the detection of specific zzso interactions using zzso mass zzso is zzso Instead of direct observation of the zzso complex, we attempted the indirect observation of the binding event by focusing on the disappearance of the free zzso signal upon interaction with zzso As a result, specific binding of the zzso element zzso zzso of the zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso N zzso was zzso We also show that specific zzso peptides can be identified from a mixture of peptides with varying zzso zzso showing that the method could be applied to zzso screening from simple zzso zzso The method described in this study provides a quick and simple method for detecting specific zzso interactions that avoids difficulties associated with direct observation of zzso and zzso complexes, which may find various applications in the analysis of zzso interactions and in the identification of novel zzso zzso
