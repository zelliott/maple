A diverse group of zzso regulatory proteins share a common structural domain which is zzso to the sequence of a highly zzso and abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso containing this zzso box regulate various cellular functions involving DNA zzso suggesting that the target DNA sequences share a common structural zzso Members of this protein family exhibit a dual zzso zzso each recognizes a unique sequence as well as a common DNA zzso The highly zzso zzso proteins may zzso the binding of other zzso box proteins to bent zzso We examine the structural and functional relationships between the zzso identify their signature and describe common features of their target DNA zzso
