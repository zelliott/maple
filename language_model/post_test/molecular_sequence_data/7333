zzso stimulates zzso transport in muscle and zzso tissue by triggering the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the cell zzso In the present study we have attempted to characterize the zzso zzso compartment using zzso zzso Silver zzso of this fraction indicates that this compartment contains numerous zzso that exhibit a marked change in mobility upon treatment with reducing zzso The zzso composition of zzso zzso isolated from a variety of zzso cell types, including heart, zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso is zzso In addition, the zzso composition of the zzso compartment isolated from zzso cells zzso with zzso resembles that observed in zzso zzso Two major proteins in this zzso fraction isolated from all cell types are the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso II zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso from zzso with zzso specific for zzso and the zzso also show conservation in their overall zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a major 80 zzso zzso enriched in the zzso compartment isolated from skeletal muscle revealed this protein to be rat zzso These data indicate that there is a close relationship between the zzso zzso compartment and the zzso zzso Future studies will be required to determine if it is possible to isolate zzso within this system to determine if zzso is targeted to a specialized zzso compartment in zzso cells or simply a zzso within recycling zzso
