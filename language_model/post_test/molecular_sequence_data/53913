zzso species particularly of zzso origin which are closely related to zzso zzso were analyzed for the presence of zzso to the major zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for their zzso zzso zzso contains both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was shown to produce zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso and zzso However, only the toxin zzso and not zzso could be detected in cultures of zzso zzso The zzso toxins found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso may play a role in zzso of these zzso zzso zzso which was included since it is zzso very closely related to zzso zzso was found to contain a full zzso zzso which however lacks the zzso and zzso boxes in the promoter zzso As expected from these results, no expression of zzso was detected in zzso zzso grown under standard culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso which is known to zzso zzso were all shown to be devoid of any of the zzso toxin genes and did not produce zzso zzso or zzso toxin zzso However, proteins of slightly lower molecular mass than zzso zzso and zzso which showed limited zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected on zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso toxins and proteins that zzso cross react with zzso toxins in zzso zzso species other than zzso zzso can be expected to interfere with zzso of zzso zzso
