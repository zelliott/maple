zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso of the zzso zzso complex, responsible for synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso Different laboratories have tried to purify zzso but have been unable to separate it from the zzso During the present study, active zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso complex as a free 59 zzso zzso A zzso zzso fold zzso was achieved with over zzso recovery of active zzso zzso sequence confirmed the 59 zzso protein to be zzso It was revealed to be a highly zzso protein by zzso acid analysis zzso zzso of zzso was identified to be governed by zzso of protein zzso zzso activity of the isolated zzso was highly unstable due to zzso of the protein from the zzso zzso of active molecules was also seen to enhance as well as stabilize zzso zzso This zzso was concentration dependent and activity was seen to be enhanced by increasing the number of active molecules and fell with zzso The association of the active complex was also found to be governed by zzso zzso
