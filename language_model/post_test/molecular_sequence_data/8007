zzso CD zzso zzso of a series of blocked zzso alternating zzso and zzso containing zzso dissolved in zzso and in zzso are zzso For the zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso I band is a positive zzso opposite in sense to that obtained for zzso zzso While this admits the possibility of their favoring a right-handed zzso chain zzso the zzso I zzso zzso for these DL zzso in zzso indicate a mixed, apparently zzso zzso zzso that prevents a simple zzso Their zzso in zzso evidence no narrowing and has a progressive loss in intensity zzso as delta zzso with an increase in chain zzso In zzso a similar pattern of positive zzso zzso decreasing in intensity with length was seen, but the zzso zzso are zzso Their electronic CD zzso in the zzso also indicates a loss in intensity with increasing zzso zzso with odd or even numbers of Pro zzso have different zzso patterns, indicating that those zzso are strongly influenced by local contributions arising in the zzso zzso The zzso arises from zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso All the zzso are consistent with the zzso end groups leading to formation of an excess of one zzso zzso With an increase in zzso the influence of this zzso is less and the overall CD measured zzso
