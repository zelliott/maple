Although essential hypertension has long been recognized to involve a strong genetic zzso the genes that increase zzso remain virtually zzso With recent advances in molecular biology and statistical methods, it has become feasible to study candidate genes which may contribute to the zzso of essential hypertension in zzso Recently, the zzso zzso locus was demonstrated to exhibit genetic linkage and association to essential hypertension and to zzso While the statistical evidence that zzso of the zzso gene or a neighboring gene contribute to the development of hypertension is strong, the exact zzso by which these zzso affect the regulation of blood pressure zzso is zzso zzso attention is now being focused on zzso this zzso
