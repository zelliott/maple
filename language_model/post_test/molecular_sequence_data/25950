zzso domain (65 zzso of zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso as shown by limited zzso consists of two zzso of molecular mass 30 and 33 zzso that zzso respectively, to conservative and variable regions of the zzso primary zzso Furthermore, zzso of these zzso leads to their conversion into at least two fragments of molecular mass 10 zzso stable to zzso zzso Such a pattern of molecular organization appears to be common for several structurally related zzso that belong to the zzso zzso zzso protein produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso which differs strongly from zzso and other zzso group zzso retains a similar type of molecular organization and consists of two zzso with molecular mass of approximately 35 zzso Apparently, the characteristic pattern of the zzso molecular structure reflects separation of functions zzso host recognition and toxicity per zzso between zzso and zzso of these zzso
