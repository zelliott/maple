A novel zzso zzso strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from zzso of zzso Lake in zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolate was characterized using a zzso zzso The isolate formed abundant aerial zzso with few branches and zzso zzso occasionally twisted and zzso zzso zzso containing one to several zzso spores developed at the ends of short zzso on aerial zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso The isolate contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid and zzso zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso zzso formed a distinct lineage within the family zzso and showed zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with members of the family zzso On the basis of the evidence from this zzso study, a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
