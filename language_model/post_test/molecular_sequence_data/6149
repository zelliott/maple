Patients with zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso most commonly carry an zzso transition at zzso 656 zzso 656 zzso causing abnormal zzso of zzso 2 and 3 in zzso the gene zzso active steroid zzso zzso infants are severely deficient in cortisol and zzso and usually come to medical attention during the zzso zzso We report on 2 affected boys, zzso for the zzso 656 zzso who thrived in early zzso but suffered zzso crises unusually late in zzso at zzso and zzso months, zzso Laboratory studies at presentation showed zzso zzso dehydration, and zzso serum zzso was low in spite of markedly elevated plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were only moderately zzso yet the zzso levels were more typical of zzso classic zzso due to zzso zzso zzso DNA from the patients was zzso Southern zzso showed no major deletions or zzso zzso amplification by zzso chain reaction, coupled with zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso at each of 9 sites for recognized zzso zzso revealed a single, zzso zzso in each zzso zzso 656 zzso These results were confirmed by sequence zzso We conclude that the common zzso 656 zzso zzso is sometimes associated with delayed zzso expression of zzso We speculate that variable zzso of the zzso zzso may modify the clinical manifestations of this zzso
