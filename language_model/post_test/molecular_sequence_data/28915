Most of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso are transported via the type II zzso zzso This machinery, which is widely zzso in zzso bacteria, consists of 12 zzso proteins organized as a zzso complex, also called the zzso We previously reported that the mutual stabilization of zzso and zzso plays an important role in the assembly of the zzso In this study, we engineered zzso zzso proteins by using zzso zzso zzso We identified three distinct regions of zzso required for both the stabilization of zzso and the functionality of the zzso Interestingly, we also demonstrated that another component of the machinery, zzso can zzso the stabilizing activity of zzso on zzso
