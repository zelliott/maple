The zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli consists of two structurally and functionally distinct zzso The F1 part is composed of five zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso and carries the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso complex functions as a zzso channel and consists of the three zzso zzso b and c zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso exhibits a zzso structure within the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso segment is absolutely required for zzso zzso through zzso whereas the zzso loop region is necessary for F1 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso together with zzso a and b of zzso coli did not produce an active zzso hybrid zzso zzso the construction of hybrid c zzso consisting of parts of the zzso from both organisms is in progress to determine those parts of zzso c that are essential for a functional interplay with zzso a and zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is also involved in zzso zzso is an extremely zzso protein with 5-8 zzso zzso Studies with alkaline zzso fusion proteins resulted in controversial conclusions about the zzso of the N and C zzso of the zzso A foreign zzso (13 zzso zzso has been inserted into the zzso or zzso region of zzso a without affecting the function of zzso zzso studies with a zzso zzso against this zzso are now under investigation to determine the orientation of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
