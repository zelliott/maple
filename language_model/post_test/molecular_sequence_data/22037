A zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from sea water and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 25 degrees C, in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso and at pH zzso It was characterized zzso as having zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty acids zzso % of total fatty zzso Major polar lipids were zzso unidentified zzso and zzso lipids that are zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso forms an independent line of descent within the family zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso exhibited similarity values of less than zzso % to the sequences of other members of the family zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from other zzso related zzso by differences in several zzso zzso zzso in view of the combined zzso and zzso data, it is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
