A DNA clone of zzso zzso was isolated from a Japanese patient with zzso and the gag and zzso genes were zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences were similar to those reported and showed high divergence in the zzso zzso particularly in the zzso domain of the zzso The genetic variation of zzso isolated from a Mongolian was within the range of those of zzso from whites and zzso The gag and zzso zzso were efficiently expressed in zzso coli as fusion proteins with zzso and the products were shown to be useful as diagnostic zzso
