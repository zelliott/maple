zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso including zzso and zzso zzso primary structure identifies this zzso as a member of a diverse group of zzso zzso known collectively as the zzso signature zzso At present, this zzso family's zzso mechanism remains poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso features of zzso through zzso affinity zzso and zzso kinetic zzso In particular, we focused on the respective roles of three zzso zzso that are zzso in all zzso signature zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of each of these zzso to zzso resulted in a zzso zzso bearing significant zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso showing zzso and zzso reductions in zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso exhibiting no zzso zzso zzso The double zzso zzso zzso displayed a 230 zzso decrease in zzso supporting independent zzso functions for these zzso zzso zzso labeling of zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as the zzso zzso zzso The pH dependence of zzso zzso and zzso implicated a base involved in zzso with a zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso of each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated active zzso indicating that zzso does not contain a zzso zzso zzso commonly found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso The unusual properties of zzso identified here suggest that this zzso and possibly the zzso signature family as a whole, may zzso zzso by a novel zzso zzso
