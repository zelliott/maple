Comparative zzso analysis was applied to identify the zzso zzso regulator, zzso in most zzso and to identify its recognition signal zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso The functional assignment is supported by three lines of zzso zzso zzso is zzso clustered with various bio zzso both for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in most cases, candidate zzso sites zzso zzso are observed upstream of the zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso the zzso distribution of the zzso boxes zzso exactly with the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso as the zzso lacking zzso boxes do not have zzso of zzso Thus, in zzso zzso seems to have assumed the role of the zzso regulator that in most other bacteria is fulfilled by the dual function zzso zzso zzso having the zzso zzso zzso
