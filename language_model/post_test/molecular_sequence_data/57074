In order to characterize the zzso processing event of zzso zzso B, the zzso was zzso from the rat liver zzso contents using a Con zzso column, a zzso column, and an zzso B zzso zzso The zzso zzso gave a single protein band of 39 zzso on zzso gel zzso The zzso showed no appreciable zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was incubated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared by treatment of the zzso contents with zzso B zzso zzso at pH zzso 30 degrees C, a remarkable increase of zzso activity was zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso was completely converted to the active intermediate form of 31 zzso after 1 h zzso These processing and zzso events were blocked in the presence of zzso When the zzso was incubated with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prepared by treatment of the zzso zzso zzso contents with zzso D zzso zzso the processing and zzso did not zzso These results indicate that zzso D is involved in the processing and zzso of zzso B in rat liver zzso In the zzso sequence analysis of the 31 zzso form, the terminal was assigned as zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso of the mature zzso form of zzso B (29 zzso ends at zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the 31 zzso form is 14 zzso acid zzso longer than that of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
