The three-dimensional backbone structure of the zzso domain of zzso from zzso was determined by solid-state zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso environments zzso that differed in their zzso zzso zzso labeled samples of zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso were incorporated into large zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso lipids zzso or zzso and zzso lipids zzso The zzso zzso are aligned in the zzso magnetic field of the zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso were observed in two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained on zzso samples with their zzso zzso aligned perpendicular or parallel to the direction of the magnetic zzso The zzso experiments were performed at a zzso resonance frequency of 900 zzso and this resulted in improved data compared to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso wheels and zzso waves demonstrates the presence of a zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso which is consistent with results obtained previously in zzso by solution zzso and mechanically aligned zzso zzso by solid-state zzso The three-dimensional backbone structures were obtained by structural fitting to the zzso zzso chemical shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso angles of 30 degrees and 21 degrees are observed in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which are consistent with the values previously determined for the same zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The difference in tilt angle in zzso and zzso zzso environments is also consistent with previous results indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso responds to zzso mismatch by changing its tilt zzso The zzso found in the middle of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso aligned on glass plates was not found in either of these zzso zzso or zzso zzso
