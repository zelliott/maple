zzso in the zzso region of two different zzso zzso genes were analyzed with regard to their significance in zzso zzso addition sites were localized precisely by zzso zzso mapping with zzso zzso isolated from zzso The gene zzso transcript zzso contains two zzso zzso respectively 119 zzso and 170 zzso downstream of the zzso stop zzso A single zzso site was mapped zzso zzso downstream of the first zzso Further, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso which has lost part of its zzso region by zzso is still zzso This zzso gene zzso 19 zzso upstream from the major zzso zzso zzso The deletion also removes the zzso signal preceding this zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene contains a minimum of four different zzso zzso The most prominent of these sites is identical to the minor zzso site of the zzso zzso and is preceded by a sequence zzso Three other sites are located within the adjacent plant DNA, giving rise to hybrid zzso DNA zzso The two most zzso sites are probably dependent on a motif zzso found 29 zzso away from the zzso DNA zzso
