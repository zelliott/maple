The zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been identified by Northern zzso and the ends of the molecules mapped onto the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The results show that both the zzso molecules are longer than originally reported, forcing a reassessment of the potential secondary structures that can form in the terminal zzso In particular, structures resembling the zzso and zzso zzso of the bacterial large zzso can now be zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso The new zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes lie within zzso zzso sequences that may be promoters but are more likely to be processing signals that cleave the mature zzso from larger precursor zzso The new end of the zzso gene zzso the zzso end of the zzso zzso
