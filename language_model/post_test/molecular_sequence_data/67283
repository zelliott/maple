The molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso of human and pig origin has been studied as a means to assess the potential of pigs as reservoirs for human zzso In this study, human zzso and pig zzso zzso zzso zzso from two Brazilian regions were zzso based on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results show six zzso of the zzso zzso with two zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso previously zzso in zzso Because zzso was found in humans in this study, it was designated as zzso Furthermore, five new zzso zzso zzso zzso from humans zzso and five from pigs zzso were observed, with one being highly frequent and present in both zzso here designated as zzso zzso and network analysis demonstrated that the molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso in Brazil is driven by the globally distributed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, in this study genetic zzso of zzso zzso showed that humans and pigs share common zzso that are also present in two widely separated geographical regions of zzso
