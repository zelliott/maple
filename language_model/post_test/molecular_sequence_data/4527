In the framework of the complete zzso sequencing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from the long arm of zzso IV has been zzso This paper presents a zzso approach, zzso computerized predictions, database zzso the sequencing of zzso zzso and a zzso detection of expression that allows the zzso of an important amount of information from an anonymous zzso This work revealed the organization of novel genes and the zzso of a zzso zzso The gene zzso encodes the first member of a new zzso of the plant DEAD box zzso zzso A zzso and complete search of zzso has been used to evaluate the number of different zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso On the 18 zzso members of the family, only a small number seems to be expressed at a relatively high zzso The putative gene zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the genes zzso and zzso zzso unknown zzso This study illustrates most of the situations that could be encountered during the analysis of an anonymous sequence from zzso zzso
