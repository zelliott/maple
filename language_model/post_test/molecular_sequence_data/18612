During a zzso survey, zzso spores were identified in the zzso zzso of marine zzso from Australian zzso This paper describes four novel species of zzso zzso 2003, three novel species of zzso zzso zzso and six novel species of zzso Auerbach, 1910 from zzso from Australian waters using a combination of zzso biological and molecular zzso zzso analyses showed a zzso relationship of all zzso zzso sequences with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso 2008 as sister species to the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso & zzso 2012 is zzso In zzso zzso the novel species of zzso fell within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, the novel species of zzso fell within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and formed a distinct zzso with all other sequences of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of marine fish and a sequence of a species of zzso zzso zzso also from the zzso zzso of a marine zzso This is the second distinct marine lineage to emerge within the freshwater zzso
