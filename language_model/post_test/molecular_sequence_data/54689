We report the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso block zzso zzso zzso were obtained for a series of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and stable zzso were zzso zzso films were prepared by transferring the zzso onto zzso zzso and were subsequently analyzed by atomic force zzso zzso zzso contact angle zzso were performed to characterize interactions across the interface zzso film, water, zzso and molecular modeling was used to predict zzso zzso of zzso zzso block zzso The influence of molecular architecture and volume fraction of the proteins on the zzso process was zzso At high surface pressure, zzso zzso block zzso with minimal zzso block zzso zzso zzso formed zzso structures, whereas block zzso with a zzso larger zzso domain zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso The varied zzso obtained with increased zzso offer new options for zzso for zzso and related zzso The design and use of zzso protein block zzso assembled at zzso zzso provides a promising approach to compare zzso zzso and molecular zzso of these zzso leading to more rationale designs for a range of zzso zzso needs as well as providing a basis of comparison to more traditional synthetic block zzso zzso
