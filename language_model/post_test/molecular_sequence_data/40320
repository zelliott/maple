zzso tuberculosis is a virulent zzso causing zzso a disease responsible for million deaths each year zzso In order to understand its mechanism of zzso in humans and to help control zzso functions of numerous zzso tuberculosis genes are being zzso In this study we report the dual functionality of zzso gene product of zzso tuberculosis zzso as zzso a 268 zzso acid long basic zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso protein was found to exhibit zzso activity in zzso It showed concentration and zzso zzso of rabbit and human zzso Multiple zzso forms zzso to zzso of this protein were seen on the zzso of the zzso zzso Like the zzso of zzso well-known, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso were found to be resistant to heat and zzso but were susceptible to reducing agents like zzso as it had abolished the zzso activity of zzso indicating the role of zzso zzso The zzso generated de zzso by in zzso zzso and translation also exhibited zzso zzso confirming the self assembly and zzso properties of this zzso Limited zzso zzso of this protein has revealed that the zzso zzso is susceptible while in solution but is protected in presence of zzso zzso feature of zzso is its presence on the cell wall of zzso coli as zzso by zzso zzso The surface expression is consistent with the contact dependent zzso ability of zzso coli expressing this zzso Also, immune serum specific to this protein zzso the contact dependent zzso Moreover, zzso protein binds to and forms stable zzso on the zzso zzso zzso In addition to all these properties, zzso coli expressing zzso was found to be susceptible to the zzso zzso as its growth was significantly slower than mock zzso transformed zzso zzso The zzso extract of zzso coli expressing the zzso had poor zzso activity in presence of zzso further confirming its zzso zzso Finally, incorporation of zzso group of zzso in isolated zzso also confirmed its zzso zzso 

The zzso has an unusual dual zzso It appears to contain two diverse functions such as zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is possible that the zzso activity might be relevant to zzso compartments such as zzso rather than cell zzso of zzso and the zzso trait may have a potential role after successful entry into zzso by zzso zzso
