The zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso gated zzso channel zzso is strongly involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso that is required for forming a functional zzso zzso The zzso domain forms a stable zzso of 48 zzso in solution that cannot be zzso into zzso In spite of the high molecular mass it was possible to completely assign the backbone and part of the side chain zzso by zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso enriched zzso The secondary structure analysis derived from the chemical shifts is in line with the expectations from X-ray structures of related zzso
