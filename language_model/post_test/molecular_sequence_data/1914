The zzso zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso is a major component of the zzso sheath in the central nervous system of higher zzso and a member of a larger family of proteins with a zzso of forms and zzso modifications zzso The zzso zzso protein is the zzso of the family, being most abundant in adult zzso and thus the zzso It is peripherally zzso but has generally been investigated in isolated zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein with a high proportion zzso zzso of random zzso but zzso to have core elements of zzso and zzso We review here the properties of the zzso family, especially of the zzso zzso zzso and discuss how its three-dimensional zzso structure may be resolved by direct techniques available to us, zzso X-ray and electron zzso and solution and solid-state zzso zzso In particular, we zzso that creating an appropriate environment in which the protein can adopt a zzso relevant fold is crucial to such zzso By solving the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso we will attain a better understanding of zzso architecture, and of the molecular mechanisms that transpire in zzso diseases such as multiple zzso
