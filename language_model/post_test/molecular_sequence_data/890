zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but its role in the regulation of cell zzso and cell zzso has not been zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in the zzso domain of human zzso The zzso was zzso upon binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to human zzso and recruited zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso stimulation with its zzso cell zzso was inhibited and cell zzso was zzso effects that were associated with the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and accompanied by zzso of focal zzso zzso and zzso These effects were abolished by introducing a zzso in zzso into the zzso of zzso and by zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in the regulation of cell zzso and cell zzso
