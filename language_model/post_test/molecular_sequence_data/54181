In zzso zzso therapy against zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso members of a zzso of zzso viruses are typically employed because of their extreme zzso and broad host zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso virus infecting zzso zzso has previously been characterized as a therapeutic zzso zzso In addition to the zzso itself, zzso zzso is also recognized as an effective zzso zzso In this study, a putative zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso and its activity was characterized using the zzso zzso First, zzso analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 zzso protein is zzso zzso Second, zzso and zzso activities of zzso against zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso decrease of zzso zzso decrease of the viable count, and zzso analysis of zzso zzso Third, zzso did not appear to require zzso zzso for its activity, contrary to the zzso prediction of a zzso zzso zzso Fourth, the zzso spectrum was from zzso zzso out of 35 zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains to zzso (6 out of 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was confirmed by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, functional analysis using zzso or zzso deleted zzso zzso suggested that a complete zzso zzso is essential for its zzso These results suggested that zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso and can be a therapeutic alternative to zzso
