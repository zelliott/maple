zzso zzso complexes are associated with many biological zzso In bacteria the formation of these zzso structures for DNA zzso zzso and zzso often requires not only the participation of specific zzso and zzso but also a class of zzso proteins collectively known as zzso or zzso zzso Examples of this class of proteins are zzso zzso Host zzso zzso and zzso zzso was originally identified as the factor for inversion stimulation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This small, zzso zzso protein has recently been shown to function in many other reactions including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso repression of its own zzso and zzso DNA zzso Cellular zzso of zzso vary tremendously under different growth conditions which may have important regulatory implications for the zzso role of zzso in these different zzso The X-ray crystal structure of zzso has been determined and insights into its mode of DNA binding and mechanisms of action in these disparate systems are being zzso
