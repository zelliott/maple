Two zzso strictly zzso zzso bacteria designated strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively isolated from a marine snail zzso zzso zzso and from surrounding sediments collected simultaneously from the shore of the Sea of zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were affiliated with the zzso lineage of the class zzso as a separate zzso line adjacent to the members of the zzso zzso These novel zzso shared zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and zzso zzso zzso The major zzso zzso of both strains was zzso and polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, strain zzso zzso contained two unknown zzso whereas strain zzso zzso contained zzso zzso acid analysis revealed zzso and zzso as major components and small amounts of zzso The DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on distinctive zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso distance, strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a second species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
