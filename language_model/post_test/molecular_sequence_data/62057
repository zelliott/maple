zzso zzso immediate early zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso factors containing three zzso finger DNA binding motifs close to the zzso So far, zzso and zzso have been identified in human and zzso We identified zzso a new member of the zzso protein family by screening a mouse zzso zzso zzso has almost all the known features of the zzso protein family: it shares a highly zzso zzso zinc finger DNA binding domain and is zzso identical to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso In addition, the three repression zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in all the zzso Similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso in response to zzso beta 1 treatment and can perform the zzso sites zzso repression of zzso A 4 zzso zzso long transcript of mouse zzso can be detected using zzso zzso The gene of mouse zzso contains four zzso Due to the zzso acid sequence zzso mouse zzso is regarded as an zzso of human zzso However, the mouse zzso gene is localized in a zzso segment on mouse zzso 12 corresponding to human zzso on zzso 2 with the same gene zzso An interesting explanation for this apparent contradiction might be a zzso zzso leading to zzso exchange between the mouse zzso and zzso
