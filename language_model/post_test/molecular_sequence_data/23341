zzso from three submerged sites zzso a core obtained in the methane zzso area; zzso a reference core obtained at a distance from the methane zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso in the southern zzso arc were analyzed to gain insight into the organisms present and the processes involved in this zzso methane zzso zzso zzso zzso gene analyses by quantitative real-time zzso and clone library sequencing revealed that the zzso core sediments contained abundant zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso including both zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso and zzso members of the zzso as well as members of the zzso suggesting that both zzso methane zzso and zzso occurred at this zzso In addition, several functional genes connected with methane metabolism were analyzed by quantitative zzso including the genes zzso particulate methane zzso zzso soluble methane zzso zzso methanol zzso zzso and zzso zzso M zzso zzso In the zzso core zzso the most abundant gene was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso gene of the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was most abundant at the surface of the zzso zzso These results indicate that there is a very complex environment in which methane production, zzso methane zzso and zzso methane zzso all occur in close zzso The HC zzso site was rich in zzso and had a high copy number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a much lower copy number of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was never zzso In contrast, the reference core contained familiar sequences of marine zzso zzso and bacterial groups but not groups specific to C1 zzso zzso characterization of the amounts and zzso composition of pore water methane and zzso strongly supported the notion that in this zone both zzso methane zzso and zzso methane zzso as well as zzso zzso
