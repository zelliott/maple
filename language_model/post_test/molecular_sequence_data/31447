Genome sequencing has provided us with gene lists but cannot tell us where and how their zzso products work together to support zzso Complex organisms rely on differential expression of zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso and, in concert, evolved to their present state as they function together to improve an zzso overall zzso zzso zzso studies of individual zzso help us understand their basic functions, but this zzso approach misses the larger context of the whole zzso This problem could be zzso if all the zzso in an zzso were zzso studied by the same methodology and analyzed zzso Using honey bees zzso zzso zzso as a model system, we report here an initial whole zzso of a complex zzso measuring 29 different zzso types among the three honey bee zzso queen, zzso and zzso The data reveal that, zzso workers have a heightened capacity to deal with environmental toxins and queens have a far more robust zzso detection system than their zzso The data also suggest that workers altruistically sacrifice not only their own zzso capacity but also their immune potential in favor of their zzso Finally, zzso resolution of protein expression offers a systematic insight into how zzso may have zzso
