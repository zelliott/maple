We isolated major zzso complex class II B zzso genes in the Barn zzso zzso zzso A zzso approach combined with primer walking on zzso and complementary DNA as well as Southern zzso analyses revealed the presence of two zzso zzso both being expressed in zzso liver, and zzso zzso structural features of zzso genes as well as their expression and high zzso substitution rates in the region involved in zzso binding suggest that both genes are zzso zzso organization in the Barn zzso is simple compared to zzso species that show multiple zzso and resembles the minimal essential zzso of zzso
