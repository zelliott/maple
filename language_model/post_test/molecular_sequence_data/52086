The structure of a zzso form of zzso zzso has been determined as part of a series of zzso structural investigations and development of zzso vapor diffusion experiments for zzso crystal zzso zzso were grown by the zzso method against sodium zzso The zzso is a zzso in the zzso adopting an extended zzso through zzso a nearly perpendicular bend at zzso and a reverse turn for the zzso zzso Principal backbone zzso angles are zzso 1 zzso degrees, omega 2 zzso degrees, zzso 2 zzso degrees, zzso 2 zzso degrees, omega 3 zzso degrees, zzso 3 zzso degrees, zzso 31 zzso degrees, zzso 32 zzso zzso The zzso side chain adopts an unusual orientation zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso The relationship of the zzso structure to zzso sequences in proteins is zzso particularly as regards its zzso zzso Crystal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso V zzso zzso Z zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso 199 K, R zzso zzso for zzso observations with I greater than or equal to 3 zzso
