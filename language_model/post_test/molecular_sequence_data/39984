zzso zzso has a highly variable zzso with ongoing diversification via zzso and zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso DNA repair genes modulating zzso and zzso rates that influence diversification have not been well characterized for zzso zzso To examine the role of putative base zzso repair zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso of each were constructed in strain zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso assessed by zzso resistance, were consistently higher zzso than that of the wild type, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso showed smaller zzso In trans zzso of the zzso zzso zzso restored spontaneous zzso zzso to zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso and vice zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso did not show higher zzso of zzso zzso or greater sensitivity to zzso DNA damage than the wild zzso The zzso zzso zzso open reading frame contains an zzso zzso zzso we provide evidence that this is subject to zzso zzso leading to zzso that eliminate gene zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso possesses zzso base zzso repair, consistent with a tension between repair and zzso
