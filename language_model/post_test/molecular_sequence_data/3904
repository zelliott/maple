We previously reported the identification of a novel zzso zzso that was expressed predominantly in the zzso rat brain and might possibly play a role in this zzso We describe here the characterization of a zzso protein in a developing and maturing rat zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso fusion protein recognized four protein species of 38, 39, 41, and 45 zzso on Western zzso of proteins from differently staged rat zzso The zzso form was revealed after birth, and the amount of this species peaked on zzso day zzso The zzso form became zzso after zzso week zzso The zzso form appeared late in zzso increased by zzso day 15, and disappeared at zzso week zzso The zzso form was abundant during the late embryonic period and slightly decreased after zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated that the zzso protein was distributed mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that in the zzso zzso protein is zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was induced during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, but not by zzso which causes zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso protein zzso may be a mechanism for zzso the zzso function and for the formation of a functioning nervous zzso
