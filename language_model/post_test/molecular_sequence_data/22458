zzso zzso are zzso zzso bacterial pathogens that alternate between two metabolically and zzso distinct zzso forms, and differentiation depends on zzso zzso Genome sequencing of zzso zzso revealed an ORF, zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequence contains a winged zzso motif similar to the zzso domain of response regulators in the zzso zzso zzso differs from many response regulators in that essential zzso in the receiver or zzso domain are zzso zzso functions as a zzso regulator because it activated zzso of zzso and zzso when expressed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso combined with zzso analysis also demonstrated that zzso activates its own expression by binding directly to sites upstream of zzso it also activates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I protection studies showed that zzso bound to sites in the zzso and zzso promoter zzso regions that overlap but were distinct from zzso binding zzso Both proteins could bind simultaneously to their zzso binding zzso This report identifies a zzso zzso regulator and some of its target genes in zzso
