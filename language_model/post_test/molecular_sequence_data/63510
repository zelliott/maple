It has recently been suggested that perhaps as many as zzso of all zzso proteins are regulated through zzso zzso while zzso has been implicated as an important zzso protein zzso It is therefore of crucial importance that the zzso zzso of potential protein zzso is zzso zzso Although mouse zzso was recently shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to be both nuclear and zzso and to relocate from the nucleus to the zzso upon cellular zzso In the present study we show, using various zzso expression zzso and a combination of zzso and careful zzso zzso that in contrast with earlier reports zzso is exclusively zzso We discuss possible experimental explanations for these zzso In addition we suggest, on the basis of the analysis of public zzso databases, that the full-length mouse zzso protein is a 37 zzso zzso precursor protein contrary to the previously suggested 29 zzso zzso
