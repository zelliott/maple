zzso is a zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso by vascular zzso zzso The human zzso is derived from a zzso acid zzso zzso A nearly full length clone containing DNA complementary to human zzso zzso was isolated, and its zzso sequence was zzso Using this zzso as a probe, the zzso organization of the human zzso gene was determined and the promoter region zzso The gene contains five zzso and four intervening zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso are contained within the second zzso and the third zzso specifies a portion of zzso that is zzso to zzso The second and third zzso may represent descendants of a common zzso zzso The zzso portion of the gene contains a zzso pair region that is highly zzso between human and zzso zzso and may have an important role in zzso zzso zzso On the basis of DNA isolated from zzso zzso hybrid cell lines, the zzso gene was assigned to human zzso zzso
