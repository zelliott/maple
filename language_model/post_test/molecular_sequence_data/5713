The major soluble protein component of avian and zzso eye lenses, delta zzso is highly zzso to the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso In duck zzso there are two highly zzso delta zzso termed delta I and delta II, that are zzso identical in zzso acid zzso While delta II zzso has been shown to exhibit zzso activity in zzso delta I zzso is zzso The X-ray structure of a His to zzso zzso of duck delta II zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution using the molecular replacement zzso The overall fold of the protein is similar to other members of the zzso to which this protein belongs, with the active site located in a zzso between three different zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso of the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso reveals that the zzso has zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso protein is identical to that of the zzso zzso but a zzso increase in the zzso constant is seen, suggesting that His 91 is involved in binding the zzso In an effort to determine the reasons for the loss of zzso activity in delta I zzso a structural comparison of the zzso zzso with the zzso inactive turkey delta I zzso has been zzso This study revealed a remarkable similarity in the overall structures of the two zzso Three regions of secondary structure do differ significantly between the two zzso these include the zzso tail, a loop containing zzso zzso and a zzso versus trans zzso linkage at zzso zzso zzso The zzso to trans zzso variation appears to be an zzso difference between turkey and duck and is therefore not directly involved in the loss of zzso zzso All the zzso implicated in the zzso mechanism are zzso in both the active and inactive zzso and given the zzso of the relationship between the zzso activity of duck delta zzso II zzso and their delta II content zzso & zzso zzso it is evident from the structure that only one of the three zzso that contributes to the active site is responsible for the loss of activity in the delta I zzso Given the structural differences found in domain 1 zzso tail and zzso zzso we zzso that these differences are responsible for the loss of zzso activity in the delta I zzso protein and that the delta I protein is inactive because it no longer binds the zzso
