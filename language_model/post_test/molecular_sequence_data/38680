Both regulated expression of the clock genes zzso zzso and zzso and interactions among the zzso proteins are proposed to be important for zzso function in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso sensory domain, which appears sufficient for interaction with zzso zzso of the zzso gene lowered zzso expression and dramatically reduced zzso of the zzso expression rhythms while zzso the zzso zzso zzso disruption attenuated zzso expression patterns of all tested zzso some of which became zzso Continuous zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso changed the phase of zzso expression zzso Thus, zzso is a close associate of the zzso clock that is necessary to sustain robust zzso zzso
