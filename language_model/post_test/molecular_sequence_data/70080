Since the regulation of zzso basic protein expression depends primarily on the initiation of transcription, we analyzed the zzso zzso region of the human zzso basic protein gene in transient zzso studies in primary cultures of developing zzso We demonstrated that 149 base pairs zzso of the initiation of zzso was sufficient to direct zzso expression of zzso basic zzso The zzso of the fusion transcript was identical with that of the zzso zzso basic protein transcript, and zzso zzso zzso reporter gene expression was restricted to zzso in these zzso Within this 149 base pair region, one zzso negative zzso segment, containing a consensus nuclear factor I site, and one zzso positive zzso segment were zzso The zzso segment behaved more zzso in zzso cells than in zzso reducing expression to background zzso Furthermore, these functionally important zzso segments bound zzso nuclear proteins in a pattern differing from other cells, including zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso segment increased zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso but had no effect on the zzso promoter in zzso zzso We conclude that the functionally negative zzso segment may mediate zzso expression of zzso by restricting its expression in other zzso These experiments strongly support using primary cultures of zzso for analyzing the zzso zzso
