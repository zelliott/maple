One of the most promising techniques to manipulate gene expression in zzso is the use of zzso interference zzso Various approaches were developed to use zzso in the zzso including zzso expression of short hairpin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We combined these two approaches to create a zzso system that allows the zzso and zzso control of two genes at the same zzso For this purpose two independent conditional zzso expression zzso are combined into a single zzso By the use of different, incompatible pairs of lox sites that flank zzso stop zzso zzso zzso can independently activate both short zzso Here, we show that zzso simultaneously activates both zzso in zzso and in zzso We applied this technique to silence the widely zzso gene pairs zzso and zzso in zzso embryonic stem cells and in the mouse zzso
