Several members of the zzso resistance protein zzso family are expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso and zzso zzso across the zzso zzso membrane is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso organic zzso zzso zzso We have cloned an additional zzso zzso zzso from human liver and localized it to the zzso membrane domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of 1,527 zzso acids and zzso by zzso base pairs of complementary zzso Northern zzso of various human zzso indicated an expression of zzso in the liver, zzso zzso and, at a lower level, in the zzso The zzso acid identity of zzso with zzso and zzso is zzso and zzso zzso These three zzso zzso by genes on different zzso have a similar predicted zzso of zzso segments and zzso zzso zzso raised against two zzso sequences of zzso that are not shared by other zzso family members detected zzso zzso expressed in polarized zzso zzso Both zzso served to zzso zzso to the zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was not zzso in the zzso membrane zzso A particularly strong expression of the zzso protein was observed in the zzso zzso membrane of two patients with zzso syndrome who are deficient in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso when the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is zzso
