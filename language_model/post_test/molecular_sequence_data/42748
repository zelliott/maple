zzso a human zzso gene with putative zzso potential, was originally discovered at the zzso 10 zzso in zzso acute zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso To provide insight into the possible roles of this gene in development, we isolated and characterized its zzso zzso zzso and examined its profile of zzso zzso transcripts are first detected at zzso in the surface zzso and central zzso of the first zzso zzso This expression subsequently extends to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso as these structures zzso Between zzso and zzso the profile of zzso expression becomes more complex; expression is observed in the developing zzso and zzso zzso as well as in several components of the nervous system, including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the spinal cord, and the zzso of the zzso In addition, expression is seen in the zzso and external auditory zzso of the outer ear, the tooth zzso and specific cell populations of the zzso and zzso These complex patterns of expression are consistent with multiple and varied roles for zzso in development and suggest that zzso zzso amongst other cell zzso structures derived from zzso neural crest cells and migratory zzso zzso that arise at corresponding levels along the zzso axis of the developing zzso
