zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been studied in various zzso but not in zzso The sequences zzso pig zzso and zzso were isolated from liver zzso by zzso and zzso The open reading frames of pig zzso showed a higher sequence zzso to bovine zzso zzso than to dog zzso zzso or to human zzso zzso On the other hand, the coding sequence of pig zzso showed a similar zzso zzso to zzso of these zzso From the zzso recognition sites zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso it was found that the zzso zzso unlike zzso completely shared the six zzso with the bovine zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso expression in ten zzso zzso revealed that zzso was principally expressed in adrenal zzso whereas zzso was predominantly expressed in small zzso These results further support the pig as an useful model for zzso
