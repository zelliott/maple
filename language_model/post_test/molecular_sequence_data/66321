To gain insight into the zzso gene pool diversity of European zzso we studied zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso subjects from western and eastern areas of zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso I and zzso II, in combination with screening of coding region zzso zzso revealed that the majority of Slovak zzso belong to the common West zzso zzso zzso zzso J, zzso zzso zzso W, and zzso However, a few sub-Saharan African zzso zzso were detected in a population from eastern part of zzso In addition, about zzso of zzso from eastern Slovakia zzso zzso zzso By means of complete zzso sequencing we demonstrate here that the zzso zzso observed in gene pools of different zzso populations zzso zzso and zzso belong to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we show that zzso J lineages found in gene pools of the Roma and some zzso populations zzso and zzso belong to new zzso zzso which is defined by coding region zzso at position zzso
