The interaction of the zzso zzso protein zzso with the zzso apparatus depends on motifs in its zzso part that are zzso in solution but are capable of folding into zzso zzso in zzso upon interaction with poorly packed zzso In previous studies a few zzso zzso that are critical for zzso binding and zzso zzso were identified, but the precise zzso of the zzso motifs has not been zzso Here we present a detailed analysis of the zzso targeting and in zzso folding features of the region encompassing the zzso motifs zzso zzso Point zzso analysis revealed that most zzso zzso within this region contribute to zzso zzso whereas analysis by zzso replacements and zzso insertions revealed that zzso interaction depends on folding into two zzso zzso with a short interrupting zzso Analysis of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso insertions within their first zzso motifs revealed that the zzso causes a zzso of the zzso zzso that does not extend beyond the zzso zzso Lastly, a zzso replacement zzso recently reported to bind to zzso charged zzso in a zzso manner showed normal cellular distribution, suggesting that zzso targeting of zzso may involve factors other than sensing zzso zzso
