Severe Hunter syndrome is a fatal zzso zzso storage disorder caused by zzso zzso zzso Patients with complete deletion of the zzso locus often have zzso zzso including zzso zzso sleep zzso and the occurrence of zzso We have used zzso DNA sequencing to identify several new genes in the zzso zzso DNA deletion patients with zzso symptoms have been zzso to determine whether these zzso symptoms could be due to involvement of these other zzso The occurrence of zzso in two individuals correlated with a deletion extending zzso of zzso up to and including part of the zzso zzso Other zzso symptoms were associated with zzso zzso In addition, a group of patients with no zzso symptoms, and a characteristic zzso involving a zzso between the zzso gene and an adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso showed normal expression of zzso zzso to zzso Together, these results identify zzso as a candidate gene for seizures, when zzso along with zzso
