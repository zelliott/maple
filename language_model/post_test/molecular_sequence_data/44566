zzso is an integral membrane protein specifically associated with tight zzso Previous studies suggest it is likely to function in forming the zzso zzso In the present study, we expressed zzso under an zzso zzso in zzso zzso to determine whether this protein zzso zzso zzso When human zzso is zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso and tight junctions but do have well developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to points of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso zzso target neither zzso nor zzso to sites of cell zzso zzso zzso was next zzso using a suspended cell zzso In zzso and zzso cells, zzso expression zzso zzso in the absence of zzso thus independent of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso are zzso in this zzso and show no increase in zzso after induction of zzso zzso zzso of an zzso to the first of the putative zzso zzso of zzso confirmed that this sequence was exposed on the cell surface, and synthetic peptides containing the zzso acid sequence of this loop inhibit zzso induced by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso surface of zzso is directly involved in zzso zzso and the ability to zzso zzso zzso with the ability to zzso with its zzso binding zzso zzso
