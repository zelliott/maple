Opening of the three tandem repeats of a zzso in the replication origin zzso of zzso coli is a prime event in the replication in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) Cell 54, zzso zzso the zzso zzso requires protein zzso or zzso along with a zzso level of zzso and negative zzso density in the zzso to open this zzso The extent of zzso as judged by zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated closely with replication of the zzso zzso In an initial complex, preceding opening of the zzso the footprint of zzso protein bound by zzso covered its four zzso recognition zzso The footprint of the zzso form of the zzso by contrast, was more extensive and thus, less zzso
