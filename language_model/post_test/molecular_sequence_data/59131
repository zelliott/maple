zzso zzso disease virus zzso has become a major problem in recent zzso Conventional vaccines make use of attenuated or zzso viral zzso but these are gradually losing their zzso We investigated the possibility of using zzso zzso a zzso of zzso structural protein expressed in insect cells, as a zzso The zzso gene was cloned into zzso The cloned gene was expressed in a zzso system, giving rise to a high quantity of zzso zzso zzso zzso The length of the zzso is 453 zzso zzso and it contains two additional zzso acids of the zzso at the zzso zzso The molecular mass of the protein is about 48 zzso The zzso protein reacted with zzso raised against viral zzso and had a similar molecular zzso This protein was tested in a controlled vaccination experiment and compared with an zzso commercial zzso High levels of zzso were raised by the vaccinated zzso The vaccinated birds were challenged with a zzso viral zzso zzso chickens exhibited high resistance to the zzso No mortality or weight changes in the zzso of zzso were observed in the vaccinated birds, whereas in the negative control birds, vaccinated with zzso zzso up to 50% mortality was zzso Higher levels of zzso were found by zzso zzso zzso in birds vaccinated with zzso compared with those vaccinated with the commercial zzso This study suggests the potential use of the isolated zzso as a zzso zzso
