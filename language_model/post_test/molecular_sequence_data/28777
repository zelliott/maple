Gene expression was investigated during zzso exposure in the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of a zzso library made from zzso of zzso zzso zzso yielded a 525 zzso clone coding for the novel gene zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein contained 99 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of 12 zzso and showed an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso samples over a time course of zzso exposure showed a maximum increase in transcript levels of zzso after 48 h relative to zzso animals, with a subsequent decrease in transcript levels during zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso confirmed the observed zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso culture experiments were performed to determine a possible zzso of zzso of zzso with data indicating a putative role for zzso in signal zzso zzso of zzso distribution in zzso versus zzso revealed a reduction in the zzso peak during zzso and a shift in the position of zzso transcripts to association with the lower density zzso density zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso transcript is both transcribed and translated during zzso indicating a possible significant role for the zzso protein in the survival of zzso by zzso zzso
