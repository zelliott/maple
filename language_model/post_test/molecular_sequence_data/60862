zzso plaques composed of the zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso and mechanisms underlying their formation and growth may be zzso as therapeutic zzso To examine the process of zzso plaque growth in human brain, we have zzso size exclusion zzso zzso zzso diffusion measured by zzso and in zzso models of zzso zzso growth to identify the zzso state of zzso that is competent to add onto an existing zzso zzso SEC of zzso and zzso zzso over a concentration range of zzso M demonstrated that the freshly dissolved zzso zzso as a single low molecular weight species, consistent with zzso or zzso This low molecular weight zzso species isolated by SEC was competent to deposit onto zzso zzso in preparations of zzso cortex, with zzso kinetic dependence on soluble zzso zzso establishing that zzso zzso is not rate zzso zzso diffusion zzso of the low molecular weight zzso fraction demonstrate that the form of the zzso active in plaque deposition is a zzso In deliberately aged zzso weeks) zzso solutions, a high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso species was zzso in the SEC column zzso In contrast to the active zzso assembled zzso isolated from the column showed little or no focal association with zzso zzso These studies establish that, at least in zzso zzso exists as a zzso at zzso zzso and that deposition of zzso rather than of zzso zzso zzso mediates the growth of existing zzso in human brain zzso
