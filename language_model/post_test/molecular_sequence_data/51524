zzso is a key zzso in zzso and the zzso gene is not transcribed during growth with zzso zzso analysis indicated a positive regulation of zzso expression after exhaustion of zzso By zzso analysis, two upstream zzso sites zzso and zzso were localized and the respective zzso factors zzso I and zzso II for zzso zzso zzso were identified by gel zzso zzso and zzso span about 30 zzso each, and are separated by approximately 30 zzso Both zzso sites act zzso Although zzso showed some similarities to the zzso consensus for the general zzso zzso zzso competition experiments and zzso proved that zzso I and zzso zzso to different zzso zzso zzso by zzso I depended on carbon sources and did not occur in cells growing zzso with zzso whereas a strong zzso signal was obtained with zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso I and zzso II are the final regulatory elements for zzso zzso
