Three strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso which were isolated in previous studies by enrichment in a mineral medium with zzso zzso as the sole carbon source, were zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The major zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strains zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and from each zzso zzso it is concluded that the strains zzso and zzso represent novel species within the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
