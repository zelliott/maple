The zzso zzso zzso encodes all but one of the structural genes for zzso in zzso zzso It is zzso controlled by two proteins expressed from two zzso genetic zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso in the dark, and zzso zzso this on zzso The zzso sequence revealed a zzso zzso motif of the type found in bacterial zzso zzso factors, whereas zzso contains no known zzso zzso Here, we examine the molecular interplay between zzso and zzso We demonstrate the zzso zzso Whereas zzso exhibits no DNA binding in zzso zzso binds specifically to a region encompassing zzso to form at least two distinct zzso zzso A zzso located between positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start point is essential but not sufficient for the formation of the two zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso abrogates the specific DNA binding of zzso zzso is therefore a zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso thus, the functional interaction between them is zzso by zzso zzso
