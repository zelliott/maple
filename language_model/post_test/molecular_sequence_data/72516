During the course of persistent infections by zzso zzso zzso in patients with chronic bronchitis, the major outer membrane protein zzso zzso varies in molecular zzso The nature of this zzso was determined by DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene from five different zzso zzso strains and their seven zzso zzso zzso which were isolated from patients with chronic infections of the lower respiratory zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence data from the different strains revealed four zzso zzso zzso These regions of variable sequence appeared to zzso to the regions of the gene zzso the putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso were shown to result from DNA point zzso and zzso zzso In addition, in three zzso derived zzso from one zzso zzso strain, a zzso zzso resulted in the formation of a stop zzso in the region zzso the signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso in the zzso zzso loop regions of zzso were zzso suggesting that zzso with zzso zzso acid compositions of the zzso parts of zzso zzso obtained a selective advantage during persistence of the infection by zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso zzso
