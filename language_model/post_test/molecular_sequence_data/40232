zzso zzso is important for plant development and is a critical factor in crop quality and zzso As a complex zzso pathway, the regulation of starch zzso is still poorly zzso We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch zzso by gene zzso analysis in rice zzso zzso zzso synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in zzso sink zzso and type II (in zzso zzso source zzso and 307 and zzso zzso genes are zzso involved in the regulation of starch zzso in rice seeds and zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso Rice zzso zzso zzso an zzso element binding protein family zzso factor, was found to zzso regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis zzso and zzso zzso results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in zzso zzso of the knockout zzso zzso consistently show the increased zzso content and altered fine structure of zzso and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso suppresses the expression of starch synthesis zzso resulting in altered zzso structure and increased zzso zzso Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in zzso results in abnormal starch zzso but reduced zzso temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in zzso plants leads to higher zzso temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the zzso properties of zzso These results demonstrate the potential of zzso analysis for studying rice starch zzso and the regulation of a complex zzso zzso and provide zzso zzso including the characterization of zzso to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and zzso
