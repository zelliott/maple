Eleven strains were isolated from root zzso of zzso endemic to the zzso Islands and they belonged to the zzso zzso a zzso never previously described as a zzso of zzso According to their zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso two zzso represented minority zzso that could belong to previously zzso zzso species, but most of the zzso were classified within the species zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more restrictive zzso However, effective nitrogen fixation only occurred with the endemic zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso max or zzso zzso but induced zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso symbiotic gene zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly zzso from strains of zzso zzso the usual zzso of zzso as well as from the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso so far described within zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso and zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso from zzso represented unique symbiotic zzso According to their symbiotic gene sequences and host range, the zzso zzso would represent a new zzso of zzso zzso for which zzso zzso is zzso
