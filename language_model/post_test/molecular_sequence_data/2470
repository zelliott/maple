zzso are the major zzso proteins of the zzso eye zzso These zzso proteins are zzso by several zzso families whose expression is zzso regulated during zzso Our previous studies showed that the mouse gamma zzso promoter is active on zzso into zzso cultures derived from zzso chick zzso but not on zzso into a variety of zzso zzso In this study, transient expression data show that a sequence of 226 zzso upstream from the zzso start site is sufficient for activity of this promoter in the chicken lens zzso This sequence can be further divided into two zzso A and B, both of which are required for promoter zzso zzso A zzso zzso to zzso contains the zzso box and sequence motifs that are zzso in all zzso zzso zzso B zzso to zzso consists of three zzso One of these regions contains an element with zzso symmetry and a sequence similar to the zzso zzso The second region contains an zzso core consensus zzso Two zzso activities have been zzso one in zzso B and a second in a more zzso region zzso to zzso that does not appear to be required for promoter activity in zzso zzso
