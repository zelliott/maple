zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso iron carrier proteins that play important roles in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At low iron conditions, zzso and zzso zzso protein maturation is correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of two zzso zzso is essential for zzso but little is known about the zzso expressed zzso zzso In the present study we identified a single zzso gene zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso which is probably an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso resulted in decreased binding between zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso and zzso zzso structures referred to as zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso cell lines also had increased zzso zzso activity and slightly decreased iron zzso In contrast, iron loading results in decreased zzso zzso but increased cellular iron content, in experimental zzso and control cell zzso Iron loading also increases zzso zzso activity in all cell lines, but with slightly higher activity observed in zzso zzso From this we concluded that zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso protein zzso as has been reported for zzso zzso Compared with control cell lines, zzso cells had higher zzso zzso 1 heavy chain zzso transcript and protein zzso zzso interference of the putative zzso zzso of human zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso protein zzso restored zzso transcript levels of zzso zzso cells to those of control cells grown in normal zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso cells causes an zzso of the cellular iron content, and that regulation of zzso transcript abundance probably depends on zzso zzso protein zzso
