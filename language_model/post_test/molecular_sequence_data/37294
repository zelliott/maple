zzso zzso is the cause of zzso zzso Little is known about the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso the respiratory zzso zzso are common zzso of bacterial adherence to zzso zzso and have been observed on the surface of zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification and zzso of the type 4 zzso structural gene zzso from zzso zzso In addition a number of open reading frames were identified in zzso zzso that have significant zzso to type 4 zzso zzso genes from other species, including a putative leader specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a predicted zzso of approximately zzso removal of the leader sequence at the predicted zzso site would yield a zzso zzso The first 30 zzso of the mature zzso are well zzso with other members of the group A type 4 zzso zzso The signal sequence of zzso is 13 zzso acids in length and, zzso the zzso that precedes the zzso site is zzso rather than zzso which is found in most other type 4 zzso The zzso of zzso possesses zzso zzso that are zzso in type 4 zzso of many zzso In other type 4 zzso the zzso zzso zzso form a zzso bond that produces a loop, which is important for the function of zzso and also comprises a major zzso zzso A motif within the predicted loop in zzso was found to be highly zzso in type 4 zzso of other zzso organisms zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso genes showed the strongest zzso to putative type 4 zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was shown to be present and highly zzso in different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced and used to raise zzso zzso
