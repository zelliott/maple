zzso of basic zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated in the zzso of benign zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been considered to be a promising therapy target for zzso zzso interference zzso based therapeutic approaches hold promise for the treatment of a variety of zzso However, zzso experiments have seldom been performed in human zzso zzso cells zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso type 5 zzso zzso small hairpin zzso zzso against human zzso zzso zzso to examine the proliferation and zzso effects on cultured human primary zzso The zzso effect of zzso was evaluated by western zzso Cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso Cell zzso was analyzed by flow zzso and detection of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso gene expression was also zzso zzso type 5 can efficiently delivered zzso against zzso into to zzso and the level of protein was depressed significantly in cells infected by zzso approximately 50% lower than those cells infected by zzso nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is able to induce zzso and inhibit proliferation of cultured human primary zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was markedly inhibited by zzso with zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that zzso delivered via an zzso zzso offers a prospect of improvement in treatment of zzso and zzso is a potential target worth exploiting in zzso
