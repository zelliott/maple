zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso membrane zzso In the zzso form zzso zzso interact with zzso proteins and each zzso complex is proposed to regulate a unique trafficking zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso At least six zzso zzso zzso of zzso interacting zzso zzso have been identified and shown to interact with zzso Based on the sequence zzso zzso are divided in class I and class II zzso Class I zzso have been hypothesized to regulate the recycling of plasma membrane zzso In contrast, class II zzso have been implicated in regulating membrane traffic during more specialized cellular functions, such as zzso This chapter reviews the background and methodology required for characterizing interactions between zzso and zzso as well as understanding their role in regulating zzso membrane zzso
