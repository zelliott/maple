zzso with zzso zzso as capture plant and comparative sequence analyses of zzso gene fragments of zzso populations in zzso formed were used to investigate the diversity of zzso in zzso over a broad geographic range, zzso from sites in five zzso zzso Europe, Asia, North America, and South zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene fragments of 100 zzso zzso from root zzso of zzso zzso and of 58 zzso strains resulted in a clear differentiation between zzso of the zzso and the zzso host infection groups, with sequences from each group found in all zzso and the assignment of all sequences to four and five clusters within these groups, zzso All clusters were formed or dominated by zzso obtained from one or two zzso with single sequences occasionally present from zzso of other zzso Variation within a cluster was generally low for sequences representing zzso in zzso induced by the same soil, but large between sequences of zzso originating from different zzso Three zzso one within the zzso and two within the zzso host infection groups, were represented entirely by zzso zzso with no sequences from cultured relatives zzso These results demonstrate large differences in zzso zzso in five zzso from a broad geographic range, but low diversity of zzso zzso populations within any of these zzso
