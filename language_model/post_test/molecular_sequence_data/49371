zzso is one of the most commonly found zzso of the volatile blends that are zzso from leaves in response to damage by zzso or mechanical zzso zzso is also a component of many floral zzso Airborne zzso zzso from plants can serve as a chemical cue for the attraction of zzso or predators of plant zzso and also as an zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, exposure of plants to zzso can activate defense gene zzso In this paper, we describe zzso cloning and functional characterization of a gene zzso a highly specialized zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a member of the large zzso gene family of putative zzso zzso A zzso for zzso was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso function identified in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces almost exclusively zzso zzso with minor amounts of the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso were zzso in leaves of zzso in response to mechanical wounding and treatment with zzso acid, concurrent with induced zzso of zzso zzso provides an important gene for probing zzso and possibly zzso interactions zzso by zzso zzso
