zzso are effective zzso alternative to zzso for the generation of zzso zzso in many plant species including those whose transformation is zzso The current strategies of zzso tagging are usually slow and zzso and yield low frequency of zzso zzso We have constructed a series of zzso tagging zzso based on three zzso zzso zzso controlled by zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso expression system; zzso deletion of zzso via zzso zzso zzso that was initially triggered by Ds zzso and zzso suppression of early zzso events in transformed rice callus through a zzso zzso resistance gene in a novel Ds element zzso We tested these zzso in transgenic rice and characterized the zzso zzso Our results showed that these zzso are useful resources for functional zzso of rice and other crop zzso The zzso are freely available for the zzso
