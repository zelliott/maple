In order to test the hypothesis that the most immature zzso zzso zzso zzso occur after the DJ joining of the zzso heavy chain genes zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso in precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso from 25 children younger than 3 years at disease onset and found that most of the zzso regions had N zzso zzso We then selected 14 of these zzso zzso for zzso zzso joining of the zzso zzso These joining regions showed zzso zzso and lack of N regions, indicating absence of terminal zzso zzso zzso activity during their zzso Most zzso with a zzso zzso without N region have no, or only one, zzso in the joining regions of their zzso zzso The N regions of the zzso delta zzso displayed zzso zzso in children younger than 3 years of age the N regions were shorter than in those older than 3 years, and the zzso frequently contained complete zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso in childhood zzso zzso is an early event following zzso zzso and that it occurs shortly before or after the first hit, leading to zzso zzso
