We recently reported the identification of zzso as an efficient and specific zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by screening a secondary random zzso library zzso Lou et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the primary structure of zzso we designed and zzso several zzso zzso zzso Some of these zzso zzso are highly potent and specific with zzso in the low zzso zzso Because both zzso and zzso are efficient and specific zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides based on these two sequences were zzso These zzso peptides inhibit zzso zzso with high zzso indicating that the zzso site of zzso zzso can accommodate more than a linear zzso This may explain why seemingly several peptides with very different linear structures can all be zzso by this zzso
