A zzso zzso gene from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso designated zzso was identified, zzso a predicted protein of 624 zzso acids and a molecular mass of zzso zzso The identity between the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso was localized on zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was constructed by sequential gene zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain the zzso zzso was unable to grow in zzso zzso The lack of growth of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso medium was compensated by transformation with zzso The zzso zzso strain showed no change in zzso compared with the zzso strain in the mouse model of systemic zzso
