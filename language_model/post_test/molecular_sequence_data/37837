The orphan nuclear zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso cells and for reporters driven by the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso by the direct zzso zzso element located in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exerts an enhancing effect on the zzso of zzso by zzso which is zzso by the zzso response element located in the zzso region of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is mapped to zzso acid zzso zzso in its zzso A zzso A direct molecular interaction occurs between zzso and zzso detected by zzso which is zzso by the zzso AB segment of zzso In gel mobility shift zzso zzso competes with zzso nuclear factor binding to the zzso promoter, and zzso and zzso bind simultaneously to this DNA zzso The role of zzso in the early events of zzso signaling process is zzso
