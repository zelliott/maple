The development of a zzso for the detection of seven zzso based on liquid zzso and zzso tandem mass zzso in multiple reaction mode is zzso It is based on extraction of the zzso proteins from a food zzso followed by zzso zzso with zzso The chosen marker peptides were implemented into one method that is capable of the simultaneous detection of milk, egg, zzso zzso zzso walnut and zzso This method has been used to detect all seven zzso commodities from incurred reference bread material, which was baked according to a standard recipe from the baking zzso zzso zzso ranged from 10 to 1000 zzso demonstrating that the mass zzso based method is a useful tool for zzso zzso
