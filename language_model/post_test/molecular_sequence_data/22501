The International Human Genome zzso zzso zzso recently completed a sequence of the human zzso As part of this project, we have focused on zzso zzso Although some zzso exhibit extreme characteristics in terms of zzso gene content, repeat content and fraction zzso zzso zzso 8 is distinctly typical in character, being very close to the zzso median in each of these zzso This work describes a finished sequence and gene zzso for the zzso which represents just over zzso of the zzso human zzso A unique feature of the zzso is a vast region of approximately 15 zzso on zzso zzso that appears to have a zzso high zzso rate, which has accelerated in the zzso relative to other zzso zzso This zzso region contains a number of genes related to innate immunity and the nervous system, including zzso that appear to be under positive zzso include the major zzso zzso gene cluster and zzso a gene that may have contributed to the evolution of expanded brain size in the great zzso The data from zzso 8 should allow a better understanding of both normal and disease biology and zzso zzso
