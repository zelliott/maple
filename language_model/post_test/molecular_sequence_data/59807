zzso zzso of plant secondary zzso is an important mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso groups and for the modification of their zzso A zzso clone zzso zzso the gene for the zzso of partially zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso designed from zzso regions of various zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows about zzso similarity to other plant zzso zzso The zzso protein expresses strict specificity for positions zzso zzso of partially zzso zzso but does not accept zzso or zzso acid for further zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso DNA zzso with an zzso sequence suggests the presence of a number of related genes in this species, consistent with the multiple zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso
