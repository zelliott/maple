A zzso was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arranged in zzso The zzso grows on sheep blood zzso as zzso gray colonies of zzso to 1 zzso in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient zzso Growth also occurs in 10 or zzso zzso and on zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso No enhancement of growth is observed in zzso zzso It is zzso with zzso groups A, B, C, D, zzso or G zzso and is resistant to zzso and zzso The zzso is zzso and is zzso at both 25 and 37 degrees zzso It is zzso test zzso It produces zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso It zzso zzso and zzso It zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that there were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences between the zzso zzso gene sequence of the zzso and those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of it zzso plus minus standard zzso was zzso plus minus zzso Based on zzso zzso it belongs to the zzso or zzso group of zzso For these reasons a new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, for which zzso is the type zzso Further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this zzso to become an emerging cause of zzso zzso
