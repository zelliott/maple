Singing by adult male zebra zzso is a learned behavior important for zzso kin recognition, and nest defense zzso zzso and is inhibited by both brief periods of limited food availability and systemic injection of zzso These similar effects on singing, combined with increasing evidence for zzso involvement in feeding behavior, led us to evaluate a possible shared zzso We found that limited food availability both reduces singing in a zzso zzso manner and increases levels of the zzso zzso zzso in various brain regions including the zzso zzso an area that contains auditory zzso including the zzso zzso of L zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Development and use of an zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso demonstrates zzso dense zzso zzso expression within song regions including Area X, zzso zzso zzso nucleus of anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus of zzso and zzso zzso receives zzso projections and is implicated in integration of auditory zzso zzso in this area, determined through expression of the zzso factor zzso is increased after exposure to unfamiliar zzso Because previous work has shown that these novel zzso increases in zzso activity are zzso by zzso exposure, we tested and found that similar effects on zzso expression are produced by limiting zzso Limited zzso reductions in the activity of zzso zzso were reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these experiments indicate a link between feeding state and gene expression related to auditory perception that is zzso by zzso zzso
