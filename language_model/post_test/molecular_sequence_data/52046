zzso peptides containing zzso acid sequence zzso of the core protein zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and progressively shorter sequences at its zzso were tested for their effect on zzso dependent in zzso responses of peripheral blood zzso zzso from normal human zzso A zzso as short as 7 zzso zzso corresponding to a highly zzso zzso was able to inhibit in a zzso manner the induction of a specific primary zzso response to the sheep red cell zzso zzso as well as the zzso response to recall microbial zzso The results of this study constitute additional evidence of the zzso effects of zzso components and may help to unravel some of the zzso mechanisms of zzso Moreover, they are of potential relevance for the development of zzso and therapeutic zzso
