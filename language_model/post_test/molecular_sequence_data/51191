In the zzso model for zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso especially zzso are assumed to play a significant zzso Taking advantage of a previous synthetic zzso analogue in which all eight zzso acids were replaced by zzso two new zzso were prepared in order to test the effects of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The zzso content of the three zzso in methanol solution remains zzso (between 63 and zzso zzso zzso experiments show that a high zzso dependence is zzso although the apparent mean number of zzso forming the channels is significantly reduced when the substitution occurs at position zzso This is confirmed in single-channel experiments which further reveal faster fluctuations for the modified zzso These results demonstrate that, although zzso especially zzso are favorable zzso for zzso events, they are not absolute zzso for the development of highly zzso multistate zzso
