zzso sequence data are proving to be a vast resource for the discovery of biological zzso Yet analysis of this data to identify functional zzso lags behind efforts to characterize protein zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the closest match for approximately zzso of marine zzso sequence zzso It is also small, contains little zzso DNA, and has zzso low zzso zzso 

To aid the discovery of zzso motifs within the marine zzso we exploited the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso by targeting our search to long zzso regions zzso with relatively high zzso zzso Analysis of known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that structured zzso are significantly enriched in such zzso To identify additional candidate structured zzso we examined other zzso with similar characteristics from zzso zzso zzso using comparative zzso approaches in conjunction with marine zzso zzso zzso this strategy, we discovered four candidate structured zzso including a new zzso class as well as three additional likely zzso elements that zzso genes zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the zzso protein component of the signal recognition zzso We also describe four additional potential zzso motifs with few or no examples occurring outside the zzso zzso 

This work begins the process of identifying functional zzso motifs present in the zzso data and illustrates how existing completed zzso may be used to aid in this zzso
