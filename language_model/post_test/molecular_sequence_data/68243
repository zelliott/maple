A full-length zzso clone zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso of sweet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, was isolated from a zzso library constructed in zzso zzso from zzso root zzso zzso sequence analysis of this zzso clone revealed that it comprises a complete open reading frame coding for 152 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed higher zzso zzso with the sequence of the zzso zzso than that of the zzso zzso from other plant zzso The zzso required for zzso copper and zinc are zzso as they are among all reported zzso zzso In addition, it lacks recognizable plastic or zzso targeting zzso These data suggest that the isolated sweet potato clone encodes a zzso zzso
