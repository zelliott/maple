The zzso zzso of zzso zzso viruses have the ability to form secondary and zzso structures that contribute to their stability and to their participation in zzso and zzso zzso Those structures that are functionally important are called zzso zzso elements because their functions cannot be zzso in zzso They can be involved not only in zzso interactions but also in binding of viral and cellular proteins during the complex processes of translation, zzso replication and zzso Most viral zzso zzso elements are located in the highly structured zzso and zzso regions of the zzso but sometimes they also extend into the adjacent coding zzso In addition, some zzso zzso elements are embedded within the coding sequences far away from the zzso zzso Although the functional importance of many of these structures has been confirmed by genetic and zzso zzso their precise roles are not yet fully zzso In this review we have summarized what is known about zzso zzso elements in nine families of human and animal zzso zzso viruses with an emphasis on the most thoroughly characterized virus families, the zzso and zzso
