zzso is a zzso hormone that binds to specific receptors in numerous zzso Depending on the size of their zzso domain, long and short zzso receptors zzso zzso have been zzso Up to now, zzso were found in zzso zzso We report here the cloning of full-length coding sequences for short and long zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso The only difference between zzso and zzso coding sequences was, respectively, the presence or absence of a 39 base pair insert at the beginning of the zzso domain, with two zzso zzso stop zzso at its 3' zzso zzso comparison revealed that the alternative zzso producing zzso and zzso was different from that of zzso although the resulting proteins were very zzso zzso experiments on zzso zzso DNA showed that the 39 base pair insert was directly linked to the downstream zzso and separated from the upstream zzso by an 800 base pair zzso Thus, the alternative zzso used a single zzso with one zzso and two 3' zzso The same organization was found in bovine and zzso zzso suggesting that this feature is general in zzso and different from zzso which use mutually exclusive zzso to produce zzso and zzso
