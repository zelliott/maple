Research over the last few years has demonstrated the increasing role of zzso zzso as major regulators of gene expression in diverse cellular processes and zzso Several zzso particularly zzso also use the zzso zzso of gene regulation by zzso their own zzso zzso disease zzso is a widespread zzso zzso disease of poultry caused by the highly contagious zzso disease virus type 1 zzso Recent studies using zzso chicken zzso zzso have identified at least eight zzso that map to the zzso region of the zzso zzso Since zzso is a zzso virus that zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso profile in zzso zzso would be more relevant for examining their role in zzso We determined the viral and host zzso expressed in zzso a zzso cell line established from an zzso zzso of the zzso In this paper, we report the identification of 13 zzso zzso (12 by direct cloning and 1 by Northern zzso from zzso zzso These zzso five of which are novel zzso zzso map to the zzso and zzso transcript regions of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso Several chicken zzso some of which are known to be associated with cancer, were also cloned from zzso zzso High levels of expression of zzso zzso and potentially zzso host zzso suggest that zzso may have major roles in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
