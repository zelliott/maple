zzso dynamics simulations were carried out to calculate the free energy change difference of two zzso zzso models for zzso zzso zzso zzso causing two different osteogenesis imperfecta zzso These simulations were performed to investigate the impact of local zzso acid sequence environment adjacent to a zzso site on the stability of the zzso The average free energy differences for a zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to a wild type are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for a zzso site and a lethal site, zzso The free energy change differences of zzso containing two zzso zzso relative to the wild type at the zzso and lethal zzso sites are zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso interactions stabilize zzso containing one or two zzso zzso at both zzso sites, van der zzso interactions are of sufficient magnitude to cause a net zzso The presence of zzso and zzso near the zzso site, which contain large and polar side zzso provide more zzso than zzso acids containing small and zzso side zzso
