The thermodynamics of binding of various zzso to zzso from zzso zzso seeds, a zzso zzso zzso 65, zzso with one binding site per zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso at 280 and zzso zzso The binding zzso zzso are the same at both temperatures, and the values range from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The affinities of zzso as obtained from zzso zzso zzso are in reasonable agreement with the results obtained by zzso zzso zzso essay, which is based on the minimum amount of zzso required to inhibit zzso zzso binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso essay zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interactions are mainly zzso driven and exhibit zzso zzso The order of binding affinity of zzso is as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso are similar and 20 zzso zzso lower than that of zzso This indicates that, while zzso and zzso interact with the zzso exclusively through their zzso end zzso with the zzso specific for the zzso and zzso arms, the zzso interacts with the zzso simultaneously through all three of its zzso zzso This study thus underscores the distinction in the recognition of this common zzso motif in comparison with that displayed by other zzso with related zzso
