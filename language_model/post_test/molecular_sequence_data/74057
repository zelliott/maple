The composition of zzso zzso and zzso strains that were isolated on two different media was assessed at four sampling points along a approximately 300 m stretch of a zzso water zzso Based on partial sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso members of 35 zzso were zzso however, only a few species dominated as their representatives were repeatedly isolated at different sampling zzso zzso of the zzso affiliation showed that the zzso included members of zzso (especially the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis and/or similarities of partial sequences of zzso strains resulted in the generation of almost complete zzso zzso gene sequences for 100 zzso about 60 of which may represent novel zzso The number as well as the zzso distribution of the zzso changed with distance from the discharge zzso While zzso restricted at the spring, diversity increased at downstream sampling zzso
