The DNA binding specificity of the chicken zzso protein zzso was zzso Using a zzso fusion zzso DNA fragments containing the binding site for this protein were zzso The sources of DNA were zzso with random sequence and chicken zzso zzso The DNA fragments isolated were zzso and tested in DNA binding zzso zzso revealed that most DNA fragments are AT rich which is a common feature of zzso binding zzso By zzso mobility shift zzso it was shown that the different target sequences isolated bind to the zzso protein with different zzso The specific sequences bound by the zzso protein in the zzso fragments isolated, were determined by zzso I zzso From the zzso zzso the zzso consensus binding site was zzso The zzso protein binds the consensus sequence A, zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso The zzso binding site in the zzso promoter is also included in this consensus zzso When tested, some of the zzso target sequences were capable of enhancing the zzso activity of reporter plasmids when introduced into zzso expressing zzso This study determined the DNA sequence specificity of the zzso protein and it also shows that this protein can further activate zzso in cells in zzso
