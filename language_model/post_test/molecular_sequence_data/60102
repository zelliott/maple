We determined that two mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso act in the negative limb of the clock feedback zzso In cell lines, zzso proteins zzso or in zzso have modest effects on their cellular location and ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso This suggested zzso involvement in the negative limb of the feedback zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso zzso levels are reduced in the central and peripheral clocks of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the zzso zzso zzso each zzso protein from zzso to nucleus, and are rhythmically expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso show that zzso or zzso alone abrogates zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins appear to inhibit the zzso complex zzso
