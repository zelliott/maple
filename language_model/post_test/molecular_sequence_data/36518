The presence of zzso repeats, each with a preferential potential to form an zzso zzso is a unique feature of the plasma zzso There are 27 such repeats in the three human zzso zzso zzso and zzso The extent of similarities and differences among these repeats have been estimated by computing correlation zzso zzso scores, secondary structure difference profiles, and discrete zzso zzso The results reveal that there is a high level of similarity among the repeats of zzso zzso and a low level of similarity in the repeats of zzso zzso Within each zzso similarity among some specified repeat pairs is zzso higher than the zzso A high order of similarity is also found among certain segments of each protein with those in the other zzso The repeats prefer a mostly zzso structure that is zzso in zzso Among the repeats of the three zzso those of zzso E show a high level of divergence among zzso A consensus alignment of the zzso of the 27 repeats into a zzso versus zzso pattern brings to focus the possible specific zzso factors, such as the zzso zzso and the salt zzso The recently reported crystal structures of the human zzso E and locust zzso support many of the predictions made in this zzso
