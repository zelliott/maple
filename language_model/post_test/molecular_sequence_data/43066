We isolated several zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso identity in zzso zzso These zzso were in three regions of zzso structure not previously associated with zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso backbone zzso of these zzso interact with the zzso in the previously determined X-ray crystal structure of the complex between zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that these zzso zzso backbone interactions contribute to zzso identity, and argue that the interactions help communicate zzso recognition of the zzso to the zzso end of the zzso and the zzso center of the zzso
