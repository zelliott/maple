We describe here the cloning and characterization of a rat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of rat zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso sharing 96 and zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso and human zzso zzso Among a large panel of zzso tested, only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cell zzso demonstrated specific abilities to induce an zzso calcium zzso response in human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso with rat zzso expression zzso zzso competition binding studies to the zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells demonstrated that human zzso and zzso T cell zzso are more potent zzso than human zzso zzso Following our previous observation for the induced expression of zzso in focal stroke, we demonstrate here the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso after permanent zzso of the middle cerebral zzso A significant increase in zzso binding to zzso cerebral cortical samples was obtained and paralleled the increase in zzso zzso zzso The changes in zzso expression and zzso binding correlate highly with known changes in zzso zzso and zzso occurred after focal zzso These data suggest that zzso may be a potential novel therapeutic target in focal zzso In addition, the cloning of rat zzso provides an important tool for the investigation of the zzso role of zzso in other zzso disease zzso
