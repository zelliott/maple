zzso zzso induce zzso of major zzso complex zzso class I genes through the zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso that contains an zzso response motif shared by many zzso zzso By screening mouse zzso zzso expression libraries with the zzso as a probe, we isolated a zzso clone zzso a protein that binds the zzso designated zzso zzso zzso analysis with labeled zzso zzso showed that zzso binds not only the zzso class I zzso but also zzso response motifs of many zzso zzso as well as a zzso element of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso acids and a long 3' untranslated zzso The zzso 115 zzso acids zzso to a putative zzso domain and show significant sequence similarity with other cloned zzso response factors zzso and zzso Because of the structural similarity and shared binding zzso we conclude that zzso is a third member of the zzso gene family, presumably playing a role in zzso and zzso regulation of many zzso Although zzso and zzso share some similarity in their zzso regions, zzso shows no similarity to zzso or zzso in this region, suggesting that it is more zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso zzso and is zzso zzso by zzso The induction by zzso appears to be zzso in zzso and zzso zzso that zzso plays a regulatory role in cells of the immune zzso The presence of multiple factors that bind common zzso response motifs may partly account for the complexity and diversity of zzso action as well as zzso gene zzso
