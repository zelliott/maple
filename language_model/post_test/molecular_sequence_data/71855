The zzso zzso zzso proteins of the zzso family interact with zzso stretches in duplex DNA, and are considered assistant factors in zzso zzso A zzso zzso an zzso protein of 190 zzso acid zzso was isolated from zzso and zzso Like other plant zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein contains four copies of the zzso zzso motif and an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a similarity to the zzso domain of zzso The zzso zzso gene that was isolated from a zzso DNA library contains a single zzso that is localized in the region of sequence similarity to zzso zzso Interestingly, the genes zzso plant zzso contain an zzso at exactly the same relative position, indicating an evolutionary relationship of the plant genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso
