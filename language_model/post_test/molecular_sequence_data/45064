zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity, which is essential for zzso zzso and zzso In the current study, we have characterized the human zzso promoter for zzso factors and DNA elements regulating zzso zzso Using a progressive deletion cloning approach, we have constructed zzso zzso zzso We have identified a positive regulatory region at the positions of zzso zzso to zzso responsible for approximately zzso of the zzso promoter zzso Three zzso were located within this region, and the zzso at position zzso zzso explains most of the regulatory zzso zzso zzso factors zzso were shown to bind on the zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso using specific short interference zzso resulted in a significant reduction in zzso promoter activity, and zzso zzso or zzso increased zzso promoter activity zzso Although transforming growth factor zzso increased the zzso binding and zzso promoter activity, this zzso effect can be largely prevented by zzso short interference zzso On the other hand, cigarette smoking zzso which have been shown to suppress zzso zzso inhibited the binding between the zzso and zzso resulting in a reduced zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, the zzso on the zzso promoter appeared to zzso bind with either zzso or zzso with a similar outcome on the promoter zzso In conclusion, our study shows that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso and both positive zzso growth factor zzso and negative zzso smoking zzso regulators appear to influence the zzso interaction and affect zzso zzso
