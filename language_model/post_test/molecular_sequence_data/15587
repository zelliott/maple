zzso strategies are key technologies for identifying proteins in zzso zzso Despite significant improvements in recent years efficient zzso processes of target zzso remain major bottlenecks in zzso protein zzso zzso sample zzso strategies have shown their potential for the enrichment of zzso peptides of interest, but only small numbers of zzso can be zzso in one zzso The lack of appropriate capture zzso limits the application of zzso approaches and only biased zzso discovery approaches are zzso This perspective discusses the current status of zzso zzso approaches and introduces a novel concept that uses group specific zzso zzso -- Triple X zzso zzso -- for the enrichment of signature zzso zzso of peptides with identical zzso can be zzso based on zzso zzso enrichment steps and can subsequently be identified using established tandem zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso minimal sets of zzso zzso can be zzso that cover a wide range of given zzso landscapes of one or even several different zzso This opens the possibility to use a minimal number of zzso zzso as a universal zzso for general zzso approaches in zzso zzso
