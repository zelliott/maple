A model zzso for the joining of zzso zzso and zzso elements has been constructed in a zzso zzso carrying a zzso marker whose expression is independent of the arrangement of the resident zzso gene zzso The zzso was introduced into zzso and zzso cells, and zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso elements was monitored by a direct zzso zzso Joining of the zzso gene segments was observed in cell lines representative of three distinct stages in early B cell zzso zzso was not observed in three cell lines derived from mature B cells, or in a zzso cell zzso The zzso and zzso elements were initially arranged so that the zzso junction and the zzso zzso sequences could be recovered after zzso By molecular cloning and zzso sequence determination, zzso junctions formed upon zzso of the zzso were found to resemble closely similar junctions in functional H chain zzso The joining of zzso and zzso elements was observed to be zzso loss of zzso occurred at the coding zzso but not at the junctions between zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso H and L chain gene segments are joined by a common mechanism that is more active in B cell precursors than in mature B zzso These observations provide further evidence that the zzso of zzso gene segments occurs by a zzso zzso zzso The model zzso described here is likely to be of use in defining the zzso sequences that mediate zzso and in examining the zzso specificity of this zzso
