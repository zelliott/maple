zzso T4 zzso has been zzso using the zzso affinity zzso technique from zzso zzso coli cells by fusion to an zzso zzso His zzso zzso of the zzso gene expression has been found to be critical during growth phase of the bacteria by comparing different zzso zzso Whereas a zzso fusion construct alone did not lead to efficient production of T4 zzso because of early cell zzso an improved zzso sequence and zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in high-level synthesis of the foreign protein after zzso zzso zzso of the fusion protein from zzso crude cell extracts is possible in a simple zzso zzso
