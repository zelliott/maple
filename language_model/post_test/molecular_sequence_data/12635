zzso zzso zzso cells which induce zzso belong to the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso cells recognizing similar zzso potentially represent specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso Since the differential stimulation of zzso zzso cells may be important in the regulation of zzso inflammatory disorders, we have examined the fine specificity of a zzso and a zzso zzso induced by zzso of zzso mice with native zzso protein zzso and specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the clones by synthetic peptides containing single zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent critical zzso Surprisingly, this pattern was identical for both zzso Competition studies indicated indirectly that zzso and zzso may be zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso contact the zzso zzso of the zzso expressed by both zzso subset clones demonstrated different V beta usage as well as variation in the zzso sequence and zzso Interestingly, realignment of the sequence of the zzso regions showed striking zzso This study demonstrates that zzso and zzso zzso can express very similar zzso zzso while utilizing very different zzso V beta zzso These results suggest that the therapeutic zzso based on either zzso zzso or zzso specific for zzso may have limited effectiveness in treating zzso disorders, since they may also target the beneficial arm of the immune zzso
