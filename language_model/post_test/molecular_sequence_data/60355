The mechanisms for the control of zzso protein synthesis have been characterized in detail in zzso and in zzso In zzso only the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been extensively zzso As in zzso regulation takes place at the level of zzso The regulator protein zzso binds zzso to its binding site on the zzso zzso and, when in zzso binds to the regulatory target site on its zzso and thus zzso translation of all three zzso of the zzso The regulatory binding site on the zzso a structural mimic of the respective binding site on the zzso zzso is located within the structural gene about 30 zzso downstream of the zzso start zzso zzso blocks a step before or at the formation of the first zzso bond of zzso Here we demonstrate that a similar regulatory mechanism exists in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso together with the zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso of the zzso branch of the zzso studied so zzso A potential regulatory zzso binding site located within the structural zzso as in zzso was found in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso a typical zzso binding site is located in the untranslated leader of the zzso gene as described for the zzso zzso In zzso a member of the zzso the zzso gene is part of a long transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A previously suggested regulatory zzso target site located within the zzso structural gene could not be confirmed as an zzso binding zzso
