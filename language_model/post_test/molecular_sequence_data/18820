The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso belongs to the paired zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso shares sequence similarity with zzso zzso although it specifically binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, which is unusual to zzso zzso Here, we report the solution structure of zzso zzso and molecular interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso structure shows that zzso zzso is composed of a flexible zzso region and three zzso with a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso Data from zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso interacts strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments identified zzso responsible for specific binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could play an important role in zzso function via DNA zzso
