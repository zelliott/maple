zzso zzso acid amplification techniques zzso and donor screening for zzso C virus zzso have reduced the diagnostic window period of zzso infection in the blood donor population from about 12 to 1 or 2 zzso During that time, zzso zzso is hardly zzso by pooled or individual donation zzso Here we describe a case of zzso zzso infection from an extremely zzso zzso After a repeat donor tested positive for zzso a zzso procedure was zzso A recipient of a red cell concentrate from the previous donation was identified and found to be infected with zzso as zzso We compared several commercial zzso systems for their ability to detect the zzso zzso 

zzso analyses of zzso in donor and recipient samples were zzso The zzso plasma was tested using different commercially available qualitative and quantitative zzso zzso 

zzso transmission was verified by molecular analyses and was assigned to zzso zzso zzso with various commercial zzso zzso detected the infection erratically in individual zzso However, the detection rate was not directly related to the claimed sensitivity of some zzso zzso 

zzso transmission can be caused by donations that escape zzso detection even when tested in an individual zzso zzso of different zzso led to results that did not necessarily reflect the expected zzso The need for standard materials representing further zzso zzso is zzso
