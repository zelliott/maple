The gene for the human zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso The gene structure consisted of four zzso and three intervening zzso spaced over zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the zzso gene was zzso and analysis of the region revealed the presence of several regulatory regions including a zzso element directly upstream from the zzso start site and consensus sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The absence of a zzso zzso motif suggests zzso gene expression is regulated by a zzso zzso
