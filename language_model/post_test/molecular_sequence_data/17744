We have previously identified a zzso variable number tandem repeat region of the zzso sequence zzso within zzso 40 of the von zzso factor zzso zzso By zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of this region, eight major zzso have been demonstrated in the South Wales population, with an overall zzso rate of zzso zzso sequencing has shown that the zzso zzso to lengths of between six and 14 zzso zzso In the present study we describe the use of this variable repeat sequence and previously reported restriction zzso length zzso zzso to study inheritance patterns in families with type I, zzso and severe type III von zzso disease zzso The results confirm that analysis of this precisely localized zzso locus provides a highly zzso marker for gene tracking studies in the major forms of zzso
