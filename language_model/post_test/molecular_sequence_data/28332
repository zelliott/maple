The nitrogen mustard derivatives of zzso acid and zzso called zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been incorporated into several zzso hormones, including zzso zzso hormone zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were prepared by linking zzso as an zzso zzso to the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso zzso These compounds, in particular the zzso zzso showed much lower potency than their zzso carrying other zzso zzso To obtain highly potent zzso zzso of zzso the D zzso of Mel was incorporated into position 6 of the native hormone and some of its zzso zzso Of the peptides prepared, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso where zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso possessed the expected high zzso and zzso activities, respectively, and also showed high affinities for the membrane receptors of rat zzso cells, human breast cancer cells, human prostate cancer cells, and rat zzso zzso prostate tumor zzso These two zzso exerted zzso effects on human and rat zzso cancer cells in zzso Thus these two zzso zzso seem to be particularly suitable for the study of how zzso zzso of zzso could interfere with zzso events in certain cancer zzso
