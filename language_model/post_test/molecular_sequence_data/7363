During batch growth of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso was the preferred zzso with zzso consumption being delayed until the rate of zzso consumption had zzso This effect was attributed to a zzso control of the synthesis of zzso zzso A zzso zzso an zzso necessary for the entry of zzso into the central zzso zzso rather than to a zzso zzso of the activity of this zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso transcript zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene confirmed this repression zzso In a zzso zzso culture, zzso was observed, with no increase in the level of expression following an zzso zzso zzso itself was not the signal triggering the repression of zzso zzso This role was played by zzso which zzso accumulated in the medium when high specific rates of zzso consumption were zzso The lack of rapid zzso of the functional zzso zzso after synthesis has been stopped enables zzso zzso to retain the capacity to metabolize zzso for prolonged periods while zzso minimal protein zzso
