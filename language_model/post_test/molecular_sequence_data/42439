zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso from zzso blood were analyzed for their zzso structures by two-dimensional zzso with zzso combined with extended zzso gel zzso or with affinity zzso with zzso A or zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso and/or zzso treatment, zzso was identified as alpha zzso zzso zzso as having zzso structures with alpha zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso arm, zzso as having alpha zzso zzso zzso of the Man alpha zzso arm, and zzso as zzso with alpha zzso zzso zzso of the Man alpha zzso antenna with the alpha zzso zzso zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso with the terminal zzso of the Man alpha zzso antenna with or without the zzso of the other arm also had a migration of zzso and other zzso zzso without the terminal zzso of the Man alpha zzso arm with and without the zzso of the other antenna had zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the present system of two-dimensional zzso affinity zzso would provide a model for the determination of the sugar chain structure of zzso
