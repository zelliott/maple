zzso are a family of proteins involved in the regulation of the zzso cell zzso The first zzso to be isolated were the A- and zzso zzso and we have been studying their zzso in human zzso zzso The levels of both zzso A and B1 are regulated zzso as well as zzso both are rapidly and specifically zzso in zzso zzso A synthesis zzso at the start of S phase and the protein is predominantly zzso whereas zzso B1 appears during S phase and is primarily zzso zzso B1 moves into the nucleus just at the start of zzso and associates with condensed zzso and the zzso zzso Both zzso A and zzso B1 bind to and activate a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso A associates with zzso and with zzso whereas zzso B1 seems to bind exclusively to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity appears much earlier in the cell cycle than that of zzso zzso which appears only at the zzso to M zzso Therefore zzso A may play a role in the events of S phase as well as zzso and M zzso zzso A forms a cell zzso complex with zzso and the zzso factor zzso although the function of this complex is not yet zzso We conclude that zzso A and B1 may zzso regulate the cell cycle in several zzso They form complexes with distinct protein zzso and these complexes are active at different times in the cell zzso they form distinct zzso complexes, such as with the zzso factor zzso and they are localized to different parts of the cell where different zzso will be available to zzso
