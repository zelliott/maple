Type I zzso zzso zzso is caused by the reduction in or absence of activity of zzso in zzso in skin, hair, and the eyes, the result of zzso of the zzso zzso To date, a total of 22 unique zzso in the coding region of zzso have been described in the zzso In this report we present 5 additional zzso of the zzso gene associated with type I-A zzso in four individuals, including 2 zzso 1 zzso and 2 nonsense zzso and review the relevant literature on all published zzso Analysis of the distribution of all identified zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) shows that most cluster in three areas of the gene and involve zzso acids zzso between humans and the zzso Two clusters involve the copper A and copper B binding sites and may disrupt the metal zzso interaction necessary for zzso zzso The third cluster in zzso I could represent a functional domain important in zzso function such as the zzso or the zzso zzso binding site of the zzso Small deletions or insertions resulting in zzso zzso and nonsense zzso are distributed throughout the coding region and do not appear to zzso
