Human zzso zzso zzso the first step in the alternative zzso of zzso acids zzso in zzso However the gene zzso this zzso zzso zzso is expressed in every tissue and some evidence suggests that this zzso plays a role in cholesterol zzso Although zzso of zzso expression has been reported, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of this gene in human zzso is still poorly zzso To zzso the mechanism governing zzso expression we cloned a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the human zzso gene and constructed deletion zzso which were zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso region from the translation start site zzso zzso devoid of zzso and zzso boxes, contains all the elements for zzso zzso zzso analysis of minimal promoter showed four protected regions zzso zzso A, B and D each contain one zzso binding site, and region C contains a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors bind these zzso zzso of any of these sites resulted in the loss of promoter zzso zzso of the minimal promoter with zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso cells, which lack zzso zzso zzso zzso of the minimal promoter was also observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the expression of the human zzso gene in zzso zzso
