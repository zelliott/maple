The human zzso zzso consist of a family of four zzso zzso Members of this zzso family are proposed to have important roles in health and disease through regulation of the composition of cellular zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso However, few reports have examined the zzso specificity of the zzso for zzso zzso We report here a series of 11 synthetic zzso that feature modifications of the zzso or the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso by zzso was monitored using an zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to obtain relative rates zzso We observed that zzso zzso activity was directly dependent upon the zzso of the zzso but had no apparent requirement for features of the zzso zzso We also observed that zzso with incorporated zzso groups in the zzso zzso at either zzso or the zzso position were zzso and in the case of the zzso zzso the activity was superior to that of zzso However, the incorporation of larger zzso groups was tolerated only at zzso but not at zzso We propose a zzso model for zzso recognition, requiring interaction at both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
