The metabolism of zzso in zzso coli K-12 is known to be zzso by the zzso zzso However, the nearby zzso genes were found by zzso sequencing and predicted to be responsible for transport and regulation for zzso based on their sequence similarities to other functionally related zzso Here, we investigated zzso organization and functions of the zzso zzso An analysis with random zzso insertions revealed that the zzso genes are organized into two major zzso units, zzso and zzso governed by the promoters PA and zzso zzso However, there is an additional weak promoter, zzso which is specific for zzso Sites of zzso initiation were determined by primer extension zzso When studied with zzso zzso to zzso the PA and zzso promoters were activated by zzso and zzso by zzso In contrast, the zzso promoter was not regulated by these zzso A zzso in zzso completely abolished expression from the PA and zzso zzso causing a zzso in both growth and zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso promoter was enhanced by the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso was positively regulated by zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso binds to at least two DNA regions, zzso and zzso each with a direct zzso It is very likely that zzso interacts with zzso and IF as a zzso The presumed binding sites are located just upstream of the promoter consensus sequences zzso while zzso is additionally flanked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso site on the other zzso The proposed structure of zzso promoters is consistent with the regulation of zzso gene expression and with zzso of zzso insertions obtained in the promoter zzso
