The toxicity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the viability of rat cortical zzso in primary culture was zzso We demonstrated that low zzso of A beta zzso in a zzso form, induced a zzso and zzso zzso cell death, including DNA zzso and zzso We compared the zzso of the A zzso zzso with those of several A zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of A beta zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso These peptides reproduced the effects of the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso A beta peptides and the central region of the A beta zzso zzso zzso acids zzso had no effect on cell zzso We further demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso A beta zzso paralleled a rapid and stable interaction between the A beta zzso and the plasma membrane of zzso preceding zzso and DNA zzso By contrast, the zzso in a zzso form induced a rapid and dramatic zzso death mainly through a zzso pathway, under our zzso Taken together, our results suggest that A beta zzso zzso cell death by either zzso and necrosis and that an interaction between the zzso zzso domain of the A beta zzso and the plasma membrane of cortical zzso might represent an early event in a cascade leading to zzso
