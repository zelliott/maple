The full-length zzso coding for a putative copper transporting zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso The putative zzso is a zzso acid zzso and highly zzso to the zzso and Wilson disease gene products zzso of which are responsible for human defects of copper zzso The zzso zzso zzso with a disrupted zzso gene zzso zzso disease gene zzso was rescued by the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso with an zzso (an zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso functions as a copper zzso in zzso The expressed zzso zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso expression system may facilitate further studies on copper transporting zzso zzso
