In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a pair of Holliday junctions are demonstrated zzso in the repair of zzso zzso breaks zzso zzso and physical evidence suggests that when joint molecules are resolved by the cutting of each of the two Holliday zzso crossover products result at least most of the zzso The zzso break repair zzso model is currently accepted as a paradigm for acts of zzso repair that lead to crossing zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to test predictions that the zzso model makes about the frequency and position of zzso in zzso generated by crossing zzso The zzso model predicts that zzso will frequently form on opposite sides of the zzso in the two zzso sequences undergoing zzso zzso conversion zzso zzso zzso zzso By examining the segregation patterns of poorly zzso small zzso genetic zzso we show that this zzso of zzso is zzso Instead, in a large number of zzso full conversion zzso events in the direction of the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso were observed on one side of the zzso A conspicuous fraction of the zzso zzso events was associated with normal zzso marker segregation on the other side of the zzso In addition, a large number of zzso displayed evidence of zzso zzso In zzso zzso was symmetrical on one side of the zzso suggesting that the two zzso regions undergoing zzso swapped single strands of the same zzso These data are considered within the context of modified versions of the zzso zzso
