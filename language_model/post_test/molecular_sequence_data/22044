Two novel species belonging to the zzso zzso are described on the basis of their zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences and levels of zzso zzso A total of 47 strains belonging to two novel zzso zzso zzso bacterial species were isolated from marine fish zzso and zzso caught from the Baltic Sea off zzso The zzso characteristics of strains belonging to group 1 zzso zzso indicated that these represented a zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso zzso of group 2 zzso zzso did not zzso the carbon zzso assimilated by zzso zzso except zzso zzso and zzso Their DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence data placed the two novel species within the zzso zzso Group 1 strains showed greatest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso gene sequence analysis showed these zzso to share only zzso % sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % with zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso experiments revealed DNA zzso levels of 38 % between the group 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 43 % with zzso zzso zzso zzso The group 2 strains shared less than 97 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with recognized zzso zzso Comparisons between the two novel species indicated zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of approximately 98 zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of approximately 89 % and zzso zzso values of zzso zzso Based on the evidence zzso two novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
