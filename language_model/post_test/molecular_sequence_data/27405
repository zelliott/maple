The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity and relationships among zzso zzso zzso zzso from different hosts and distinct geographical areas in Southeast zzso zzso diversity among zzso zzso zzso was estimated by sequencing four zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the outer membrane protein zzso gene zzso the zzso region zzso cluster zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions were identical among all zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were observed in both the zzso gene and the gene cluster zzso However, extended zzso DNA zzso sequences acquired by zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction provided the most sequence diversity among zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA zzso sequences revealed three clusters in the Southeast Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso All Indonesian zzso zzso zzso zzso clustered in one zzso The other clusters were not correlated with geographic zzso The differences in genetic sequences did not reflect differences in the original citrus host zzso or zzso These results suggest that the zzso DNA zzso region would be useful for molecular differentiation between different Southeast Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso
