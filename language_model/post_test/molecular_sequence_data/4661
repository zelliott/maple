zzso zzso T zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso expressed by zzso cells are important components of the immune response against zzso Recently, zzso zzso could be generated in zzso with responding zzso from the blood of healthy blood zzso In the present study, we confirm that zzso stimulation in zzso can induce zzso zzso capable of recognizing tumor cells expressing the appropriate tumor zzso These zzso zzso display a restricted usage of zzso and zzso gene segments but of diverse zzso regions, resulting in a distinct zzso for each zzso zzso This suggests that, similar to in zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of stimulating a zzso response in zzso expressing a limited zzso repertoire against zzso zzso The generated zzso can recognize their target structure with high zzso and this zzso in part with zzso zzso This methodology may be used to treat melanoma patients with infusion of ex zzso and zzso zzso
