A novel gene responsive to freezing exposure was identified among five zzso clones obtained through differential screening of a zzso library constructed from liver of frozen wood zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso cloned in the zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso to any genes available in the zzso zzso The zzso designated as zzso carried a zzso zzso zzso sequence and contained a single open reading frame that could potentially zzso a small protein of 90 zzso acids with a molecular weight of about 10 zzso named zzso The putative protein contained a highly zzso zzso region (21 zzso that carries a potential nuclear exporting signal zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso found in zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso A zzso A single zzso transcript with a size of 550 zzso was detected when the insert of the zzso was used as a probe against the Northern zzso containing total zzso isolated from wood zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis for gene expression in eight zzso showed that zzso of the gene was highly induced by 24 h of freezing exposure at zzso degrees C in liver and gut, moderately elevated in heart, zzso brain and zzso but showed no change in skeletal muscle and decreased in zzso A zzso analysis for freezing regulation of gene expression in liver showed that transcript levels were increased by zzso in 1 h of freezing exposure and the levels continued to increase up to zzso over the control after 24 h of freezing exposure, but had returned to control levels after 24 h zzso at 5 degrees zzso Gene expression in liver was also zzso by whole animal zzso at 5 degrees C but strongly zzso by zzso exposure, indicating that the gene may respond to cell volume regulatory signals in zzso during natural zzso
