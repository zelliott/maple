zzso zzso zzso isolated from fresh pork, exhibits potent activity against a number of zzso organisms, including numerous zzso zzso Three zzso were isolated from culture zzso and using zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso and zzso sequencing, two of these zzso were identified as zzso 126 and zzso zzso both of which have previously been zzso The remaining zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso could not be zzso by traditional methods, suggesting that the zzso was either zzso or zzso zzso This zzso showed remarkable stability over a wide temperature and pH range and was unaffected by a variety of zzso After zzso with zzso and zzso the zzso was de zzso zzso by tandem mass zzso and a linear sequence zzso consisting of 60 zzso zzso Based on this zzso the molecular mass was predicted to be zzso zzso 18 units higher than the observed molecular mass, which suggested that the zzso has a zzso zzso Identification of the genetic sequence revealed that this zzso is zzso formed by a zzso linkage between the N and C zzso following zzso of a zzso zzso leader zzso The results of structural studies suggest that the zzso is highly structured in zzso zzso This zzso named zzso A, is the first reported example of a circular zzso produced by zzso zzso
