A human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso was developed from a patient in the zzso phase of chronic zzso leukemia zzso We characterized its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Developed in the absence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cloning capacity actually decreased when zzso factors were zzso The cells had an zzso immature zzso zzso a doubling time of 22 h in suspension cultures and a high cloning efficiency in zzso system (24 zzso zzso Early passages contained one zzso zzso and one zzso stem zzso Gradually the zzso stem line became zzso reaching an average of 49 zzso per zzso zzso from passage 89 had two Philadelphia zzso zzso and lacked normal copies of zzso 9 and zzso zzso molecular characterization of the zzso in the zzso revealed that zzso had the zzso zzso II zzso zzso The cells had high protein zzso zzso activity and carried two identified zzso of an zzso zzso There was no evidence that normal zzso or zzso messages were zzso assessed with the zzso zzso chain zzso When zzso cells were zzso into nude mice without zzso zzso one of three mice injected with 1 zzso zzso cells and all mice injected with 1 zzso zzso cells developed slowly growing zzso zzso within zzso zzso These tumors were locally invasive but did not zzso We conclude that the zzso cell line will be of value for investigating molecular events underlying zzso transformation in zzso in particular for studying the effects of zzso and zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells in the absence of normal zzso and zzso zzso
