zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the mouse show a structural similarity and hence have been compared in terms of zzso location and zzso zzso of the zzso locus detected by analyses of Southern zzso and zzso chain reaction were used for typing 61 zzso mice that were obtained by mating zzso zzso zzso females to zzso zzso zzso patterns indicated that the zzso locus maps to the 60 zzso region of zzso 6, while that of zzso maps to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso was examined in 101 F1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso rates of zzso and zzso per zzso zzso Of the nine mice with a zzso zzso four carried a zzso zzso at the same zzso or zzso zzso The rate of zzso was zzso zzso higher than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso may result from a common zzso
