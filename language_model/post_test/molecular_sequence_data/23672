Similar to other segmented zzso zzso influenza viruses can exchange zzso segments and form a wide variety of zzso strains upon zzso within a host zzso zzso the mapping of zzso segments of influenza viruses is essential for understanding their zzso In this work, we have developed an zzso zzso zzso method for simultaneous zzso of all zzso segments of two highly zzso strains of influenza B zzso A few zzso zzso zzso matching each of the eight segments of the viral zzso of the zzso and zzso strains were zzso with zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso Even though there were a few zzso among the zzso of the studied virus zzso zzso zzso showed highly significant and zzso discrimination ability and allowed us to determine the origins of individual zzso segments in a series of zzso strains prepared as vaccine zzso Additionally, we were able to detect the presence of at least zzso of mixed zzso in virus stocks even when conventional sequencing methods failed, for example, for the zzso zzso Thus, the proposed zzso method can be used for zzso rapid and reliable zzso mapping of highly zzso influenza B viruses and zzso extensive monitoring of influenza B virus zzso and the mixed zzso The array can be expanded by adding new zzso and using more quantitative zzso to determine the origin of individual zzso segments in series of zzso strains prepared as vaccine candidates or in mixed virus zzso
