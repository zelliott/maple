zzso are zzso zzso zzso that play an important role in zzso regulation in zzso and zzso zzso Because of their low zzso these proteins are poorly characterized in zzso Furthermore, very poor yields have been obtained with the expression systems prepared so far, and in addition, the zzso products contain a zzso which can interfere with the zzso zzso In order to obtain more information about those important regulatory proteins in plants, a zzso coding for an extended zzso has been introduced into the expression zzso zzso and the resulting construction has been used to transform zzso coli strain zzso in the presence of zzso helper zzso or zzso zzso poor or ineffective protein expression has been improved by successively cloning a zzso truncated form of the zzso introducing silent zzso both at the zzso and at the 3' ends of the zzso zzso and finally altering the 3' end in order to change the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso The first modifications have allowed us to produce the protein in large amounts but essentially in an zzso form which could be zzso and zzso On the other hand, changing the zzso sequence resulted in protein preparations of high purity and in a soluble zzso The zzso proteins were zzso active and the yield varied between 6 and 14 zzso of homogeneous protein per liter of zzso
