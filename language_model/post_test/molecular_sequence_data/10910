zzso zzso zzso were isolated in yields of up to 4 zzso from the culture media of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso content was increasing continuously over the first ten days of zzso and then stayed constant until day zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso into two neutral and one zzso zzso Further zzso was achieved by zzso zzso zzso One neutral fraction was separated into two distinct zzso with average molecular weights of 160 and 70 zzso zzso The second neutral fraction was zzso in zzso with average molecular masses of zzso 32, and 8 zzso zzso of all neutral zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated these zzso to contain zzso besides minor amounts of highly zzso zzso zzso were, using zzso fragmented into zzso which were identified mainly as zzso and zzso The zzso fraction zzso as a single peak during zzso zzso with an average molecular weight of 56 zzso Analysis of zzso composition and linkage analysis indicated that this zzso is an zzso zzso zzso the typical zzso components of cardiac zzso in zzso zzso were not detected in zzso
