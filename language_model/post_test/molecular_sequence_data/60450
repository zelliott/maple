The structure of a stable zzso zzso of influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defined by zzso studies of the intact zzso zzso was determined to zzso resolution by using zzso zzso The structure reveals a domain composed of zzso and zzso zzso that form an N cap terminating both the zzso zzso and the central coiled zzso The N cap is formed by a zzso zzso and part of it is found in the neutral pH zzso of zzso The zzso 23 zzso of the zzso form a zzso long zzso structure ordered to within 7 zzso of the zzso zzso The structure implies that continuous alpha zzso are not required for membrane fusion at either the N or C zzso The difference in stability between zzso molecules with and without the N cap sequences suggests that additional free energy for membrane fusion may become available after the formation of the central zzso coiled zzso and zzso of the fusion zzso into the target zzso
