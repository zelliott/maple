Two distinct class 1 and class 2 rat liver zzso zzso contain different zzso leader zzso 1 and zzso zzso protection, primer extension, zzso zzso and zzso H mapping established the complete structure of the zzso end of class 1 and class 2 zzso zzso Two major zzso start sites in zzso 1 yield class 1 zzso zzso including 345 or 245 bases of zzso zzso zzso clustered zzso start sites in zzso 2 yield class 2 zzso zzso with zzso bases of zzso zzso zzso translation of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso suggests that class 1 and class 2 zzso zzso initiate translation at distinct zzso zzso to result in zzso precursors with either 48 zzso class 1 zzso or 32 zzso class 2 zzso Some translation initiation also occurs at a downstream zzso common to class 1 and 2 zzso to yield zzso precursors with a 22 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in translations suggests that the three different zzso each function as zzso zzso signal zzso However, treatment of processed precursors with zzso H indicates that zzso processing of precursors with 22 and 32 zzso zzso leads to zzso of downstream zzso precursor sequences whereas zzso processing of precursors with 48 zzso zzso is not associated with zzso
