Given the growing appreciation of serious health zzso from widespread zzso zzso infection, new tools are needed to study the zzso genetic zzso To this end we have identified and characterized a panel of 21 zzso and six zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso using seven laboratory strains of diverse zzso We have zzso adapted our zzso typing method to incorporate affordable fluorescent zzso zzso determined that the zzso zzso remain stable in zzso continuously cultured for up to 17 months, and zzso evaluated zzso marker coverage of the six zzso that comprise the zzso zzso zzso using fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso We have used the markers to show that zzso zzso is a genetically diverse zzso in a population of commonly used laboratory zzso In addition, we have used zzso methods to zzso evolutionary relationships from our markers in order to validate their utility in future population zzso Our panel is the first series of robust zzso genetic markers for zzso zzso that can be used to zzso and monitor lab zzso as well as provide a means to measure the genetic diversity and population structure of extant and future zzso zzso zzso
