zzso zzso are a class of zzso small zzso that act as negative regulators of gene expression through zzso interactions with the 3' untranslated regions zzso of target zzso and play various biological zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso that enhanced the proliferation of zzso during zzso zzso although its activity in zzso has not been fully zzso Here, we developed a novel zzso zzso system for monitoring zzso zzso in living cells by using a green fluorescent protein zzso that is connected to the target sequence of zzso via the zzso and a red fluorescent protein for zzso We demonstrated that the functional promotion of zzso during zzso is zzso by the reduction of zzso carrying the zzso target zzso suggesting that zzso specifically zzso its targets during zzso in accordance with its zzso Our zzso zzso functional zzso monitoring zzso activity should be a useful tool in zzso the role of zzso in various biological zzso
