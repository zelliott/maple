The human zzso gene has been isolated from a small zzso zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is zzso identical to zzso zzso and predicts a zzso protein with zzso identity to the mouse protein zzso identity, including conservative zzso acid zzso The zzso locus has been mapped to a zzso zzso from zzso zzso placing zzso approximately 100 zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso in adults appears to be limited to the zzso and colon by Northern analysis, suggesting a possible role in the terminal differentiation of the zzso Further analysis of zzso should zzso the function of zzso zzso genes in human zzso
