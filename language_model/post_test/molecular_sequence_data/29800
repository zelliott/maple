A number of models attempt to explain the functional relationships of zzso zzso The functional zzso model states that zzso zzso proteins are largely functionally zzso and that zzso quantity is more important than zzso zzso In this report, we describe the results of two zzso zzso In one case, the zzso of zzso 11 was replaced with that of the very closely related zzso zzso zzso function was zzso by analyzing the zzso of all possible zzso combinations, including the swapped zzso and zzso zzso for zzso 11 and zzso zzso This zzso gene provided zzso function in the development of the zzso skeleton and male zzso zzso but served as a zzso zzso in the development of the zzso zzso zzso and female zzso zzso In the other case, the zzso 11 zzso was replaced with that of the divergent zzso 4 zzso This zzso gene provided near zzso zzso function in all zzso except the zzso zzso which developed zzso These results demonstrate that even the most zzso regions of zzso zzso the zzso are not functionally interchangeable in the development of most zzso In some cases, zzso function tracked with the zzso as previously seen in simpler zzso zzso with more zzso cluster positions were generally dominant over more 3' zzso consistent with zzso suppression seen in zzso Surprisingly, however, all zzso zzso tested did appear functionally equivalent in the formation of the zzso zzso The determination of segment identity is one of the most zzso ancient functions of zzso zzso It is interesting that zzso zzso are interchangeable in this process, but are functionally distinct in other aspects of zzso
