The zzso family of protein zzso zzso zzso is important in the regulation of growth and differentiation of zzso zzso The activity of zzso in cells of different types is zzso controlled by zzso which specifically zzso a zzso regulatory zzso zzso at the zzso tail of the zzso zzso is mainly zzso and zzso are predominantly zzso This raises a question about the mechanism of interaction between these zzso Here we present zzso zzso zzso that is zzso expressed and binds specifically to the zzso domain of zzso zzso is involved in the membrane zzso of zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso In the plasma membrane zzso is exclusively localized in the zzso zzso zzso membrane domain, which is important in zzso zzso These findings reveal zzso as a new component of the regulatory mechanism controlling the activity of zzso zzso
