zzso DNA techniques offer the possibility of diagnosing genetic defects directly by zzso DNA zzso This is especially interesting for detecting carriers of zzso zzso In comparison with zzso screening with progeny testing or zzso tests, DNA screening is independent of the time of gene expression and is not influenced by zzso zzso If the zzso causing the zzso is known, zzso of DNA sequences can be identified directly as restriction zzso length zzso zzso or with the use of zzso specific zzso zzso DNA amplification with the zzso chain reaction makes screening tests faster and more zzso For most zzso the genetic basis is not zzso zzso analysis with linked zzso DNA markers can be used to establish zzso zzso zzso analysis can locate the zzso region of the gene responsible for the zzso Identification of the gene and the zzso in the zzso zzso finally will lead to direct DNA zzso A dense linkage map with highly zzso genetic markers covering the entire zzso will in future improve understanding of zzso zzso zzso knowledge of the molecular zzso of human defects will promote DNA diagnosis in other zzso
