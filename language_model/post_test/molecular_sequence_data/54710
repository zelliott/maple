Application of zzso and their zzso zzso to control zzso zzso is one potential approach to reduce the pathogen on poultry farms and in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso were isolated from zzso feces and broiler zzso contents and zzso a virulent zzso was classified in the family zzso The zzso virus had an zzso head and zzso of approximately zzso and zzso in diameter, respectively, with a structurally complex tail of zzso lengthwise and a zzso plate of zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso was zzso base pairs with a zzso composition of zzso Twenty-two open reading frames zzso coding for putative peptides containing 30 or more zzso acid zzso were identified and analyzed in the zzso zzso acid sequences of the predicted proteins from the zzso zzso zzso were compared with those from the zzso database and potential functions of 12 proteins were predicted by sequence zzso Three putative proteins were similar to hypothetical proteins with unknown functions, whereas seven proteins did not have similarity with any known zzso or bacterial zzso zzso zzso formed at least four zzso clusters that accounted for predicted proteins involved with replication of the viral DNA, its zzso production of structural components and zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso was predicted to share zzso with zzso zzso and a second structural zzso was predicted to be a zzso These zzso digest zzso of the bacterial cell wall and could be considered potential zzso to control zzso zzso
