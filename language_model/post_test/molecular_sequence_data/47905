zzso zzso coli zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso zzso that are required for full zzso zzso of the bacterial protein zzso into the host zzso cell membrane is facilitated by a type III zzso apparatus, and at least zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso An zzso outer membrane zzso zzso interacts with zzso on the host membrane to establish intimate attachment and formation of a zzso zzso In this study, we identified a zzso zzso zzso whose gene is located between zzso and zzso (which encodes zzso A zzso in zzso abolished zzso zzso into culture zzso and significantly decreased the amount of zzso in the bacterial zzso In contrast, this zzso did not affect the zzso of the zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso could not induce host zzso zzso and displayed the same zzso as the zzso zzso zzso overlay and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso specifically interacts with zzso but not with other zzso zzso Furthermore, by using a series of zzso deletion zzso we determined that the zzso binding domain is located within the first 100 zzso zzso of zzso and that the pool of zzso in the bacterial zzso was greatly reduced when this domain was zzso Interestingly, this domain was not sufficient for zzso zzso and at least the first 200 zzso of zzso were required for efficient zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso forms a large zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso that may act as an zzso factor by specifically binding to its zzso forming a zzso stabilized zzso
