zzso is an zzso zzso disease caused by the genetic zzso of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso The disease is associated with progressive impaired vision, zzso cherry-red spots and zzso zzso type I) or with skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mental zzso and zzso zzso type zzso We have analyzed the zzso DNA from nine zzso patients of multiple ethnic origin in order to find zzso responsible for the zzso zzso The activity of the identified zzso was studied by transgenic zzso One patient had a zzso zzso zzso zzso which introduced a stop zzso zzso 113 zzso zzso All others had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of zzso based on the atomic coordinates of the zzso bacterial zzso located the positions of zzso and estimated their potential zzso This analysis showed that five zzso are clustered in one region on the surface of the zzso zzso These zzso dramatically reduce the zzso activity and cause a rapid zzso degradation of the expressed zzso We zzso that this region may be involved in the interface of zzso binding with zzso zzso A and/or zzso in their zzso complex required for the expression of zzso activity in the zzso
