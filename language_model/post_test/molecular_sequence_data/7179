zzso control regions zzso are powerful zzso of zzso elements that organize the actions of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso gene first zzso which controls expression in zzso is composed of a zzso zzso domain and extended zzso sequences that facilitate zzso from within zzso Prior analyses have demonstrated that the zzso contains a zzso core region and local adjacent zzso zzso zzso We now show that the core contains a single critical zzso binding zzso In both zzso zzso human cells and stable zzso zzso cells, zzso strongly zzso reporter zzso that contained zzso core zzso zzso protein was strongly evident in T zzso in which the zzso was active and was localized within discrete nuclear zzso Fetal zzso zzso exhibited a striking zzso of zzso zzso expression with that of mouse zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso Point zzso of the zzso site within the intact zzso zzso severely attenuated zzso activity in zzso and zzso activity in transgenic zzso Within the context of a complex zzso and zzso zzso can act as an organizer of zzso gene expression via a single binding zzso
