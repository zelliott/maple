We have developed a series of zzso zzso zzso to a region of the 120 zzso envelope zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso This region has previously been implicated as a site for virus zzso by zzso raised to zzso proteins and by zzso made to full-length zzso zzso from zzso The zzso employed was a synthetic zzso containing 15 zzso zzso representing zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Five of the zzso zzso raised to this zzso have zzso with zzso from divergent strains of zzso in Western zzso zzso The two of these five which were tested with live cells infected with the divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were specifically zzso by zzso analyses with cells infected with the MN and zzso zzso Four of the five zzso zzso blocked the fusion of zzso cells with zzso zzso target zzso The zzso zzso most zzso with zzso cells by fluorescence, zzso blocked the fusion of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso Four of the five zzso zzso neutralized the zzso isolate of zzso in zzso but none neutralized the MN or zzso zzso at the levels of zzso tested (less than or equal to 50 zzso Taken together these data indicate that zzso zzso to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso display different levels of group zzso depending on the zzso system being zzso
