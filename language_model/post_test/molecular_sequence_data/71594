In zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso are detected in zzso of zzso Patients with chronic zzso or liver zzso develop zzso and when this occurs, some patients exhibit zzso of new zzso It has been suggested that these novel zzso responses may be immune system reactions to proteins involved in zzso cellular zzso One zzso serum shown to contain zzso to unidentified cellular zzso was used to zzso a zzso expression library, and a full length zzso clone was isolated with an open reading frame zzso 556 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 62 zzso The zzso protein contained two types of zzso zzso the consensus sequence zzso domain zzso and four zzso K zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso called zzso has close identity zzso to three other proteins at the zzso acid sequence level, and all four proteins may belong to a family having zzso in the zzso region and four zzso zzso in the zzso terminal zzso The zzso proteins are: zzso zzso protein zzso in cancer zzso zzso binding zzso a protein which binds to a zzso zzso element in chicken zzso zzso zzso and a protein which binds to a promoter zzso element in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso protein is zzso in location, and zzso were found in zzso of a cohort of zzso zzso Patients with chronic zzso and liver zzso conditions which are frequent precursors to zzso were negative for these zzso suggesting that the immune response might be related to cellular events leading to zzso However, the possible involvement of zzso zzso as a factor in the transformation process remains to be zzso
