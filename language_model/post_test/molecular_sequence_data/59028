zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the first zzso of the zzso acid cycle, catalyzing the zzso of zzso and zzso finally yielding zzso and zzso We report here the isolation of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences were compared with previously published sequences of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso as well as with the sequence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso between the various plant zzso zzso were in the range from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso level zzso regions zzso and in the range from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and potato zzso zzso zzso on the zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the pumpkin zzso zzso were below zzso on the zzso and zzso acid zzso In Northern zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso was detected in all zzso zzso However, levels of expression showed tissue dependency despite the fact that zzso zzso is usually considered a zzso zzso Whether these different levels of expression reflect zzso variations with respect to basic metabolism awaits further zzso
