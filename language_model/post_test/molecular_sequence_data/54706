Human zzso zzso are well recognized viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory tract illnesses zzso abundant zzso Although recent studies have zzso identified the new zzso species zzso data on molecular zzso genetic diversity, and clinical manifestation have been zzso 

To gain new insight into zzso genetic diversity, we determined the complete coding sequences of putative new members of zzso species C zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified from clinical specimens collected from pediatric patients diagnosed with a symptom of acute lower zzso Complete coding sequence and zzso analysis revealed that the zzso strain shared a recent common zzso with most closely related Chinese strain zzso Comparative analysis at the protein level showed that zzso might accumulate zzso zzso in structural zzso as well as zzso proteins zzso and 3 zzso Comparative analysis of all available zzso and zzso indicated that zzso contains a relatively high zzso content and is more closely related to zzso This might be correlated to their replication and capability to adapt to the high temperature environment of the human lower respiratory zzso We zzso report an infrequently occurring zzso zzso event in zzso species zzso with a crossing over having taken place at the boundary of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we observed zzso zzso in all zzso species and suggest that dynamic mechanisms for zzso evolution seem to be related to zzso zzso These findings indicated that the elementary units shaping the genetic diversity of zzso could be found in the zzso 2A and zzso zzso 

This study provides information for understanding zzso genetic diversity and insight into the role of selection pressure and zzso mechanisms influencing zzso zzso
