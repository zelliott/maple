We reported previously that zzso zzso cells expressing a human zzso zzso zzso lacking a signal zzso sequence zzso but fail to zzso human zzso and support viral replication at a reduced zzso These cells also had elevated levels of zzso gene zzso We show here that a similar response is seen in human cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of human zzso to induce gene expression in zzso cells is shown to be due to the zzso zzso rather than to zzso variation, induction of zzso zzso zzso or alternative zzso of zzso zzso We have used a zzso cell line, zzso which is resistant to both type I and II zzso but responsive to combined treatment with zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso zzso lacking a signal sequence support virus replication at the same level as control zzso However, unlike zzso containing only the zzso selection zzso clones expressing the zzso human zzso gene show strong protection against viral infection and elevated levels of zzso A zzso zzso and zzso class I protein after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso rules out the induction of zzso zzso zzso expression as a zzso of these zzso Thus, expression of zzso human zzso mimics treatment with zzso zzso zzso in permitting a synergistic response to zzso Given the inability of human zzso to bind to the zzso zzso zzso our results show that zzso zzso can activate certain responses independent of zzso zzso
