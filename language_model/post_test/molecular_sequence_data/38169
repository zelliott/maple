The zzso zzso various factors in zzso and zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso a novel protein with 124 zzso zzso which was named zzso specific protein zzso zzso is highly zzso to mouse zzso showing zzso and 59% similarity at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was first detected on Day 14 of pregnancy, peaked on Day 16, and remained elevated until zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso cells of Day 20 zzso but not in Day 12 zzso No expression was detected from the differentiated or zzso rat zzso zzso cell zzso Native zzso was detected as a zzso zzso by Western zzso in cell extracts prepared from the zzso zzso zzso was predicted to be a zzso zzso because 1) a zzso test revealed that zzso contained an zzso zzso region and 2) native zzso was also detected in the cultured media of zzso zone zzso To further investigate a potential signal zzso of this zzso sets of zzso zzso were generated using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso 17 zzso acids had been zzso to produce a zzso zzso Thus, we have identified and cloned a novel zzso zzso zzso which is specifically expressed by rat zzso cells during the latter half of zzso
