A zzso segment from zzso zzso with similarity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso A similar gene was cloned from zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso was fused to the zzso gene of zzso coli and was expressed in a zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso fusion protein was zzso and shown to have zzso zzso II activity as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was amplified by zzso chain reaction from zzso zzso DNA and was shown to contain six zzso zzso 4 is located in the region connecting the zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso domain of the putative zzso catalyzing the two reaction zzso By comparison with the bacterial zzso zzso the zzso gene contains an additional zzso element specifying about 120 zzso acid zzso This segment contains numerous zzso and zzso zzso and does not show similarity with other known zzso The zzso segment is not required for zzso activity and is likely to serve as signal sequence for import into zzso
