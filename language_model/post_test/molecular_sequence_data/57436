zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are integral to the body's management of iron, an element required for life but highly toxic when present in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso are regulated zzso by zzso the zzso zzso by zzso stability and zzso by zzso zzso zzso described here indicate that zzso like zzso is regulated by iron at the level of zzso zzso genes introduced into the mouse zzso were composed of the human zzso zzso regulatory region fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Iron administration to transgenic mice resulted in a significant decrease of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso protein in liver, but no significant decrease in human zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso iron regulatory elements by proteins in zzso extracts have been shown to regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar results have been obtained with zzso zzso A decreased binding of human zzso zzso region zzso by factors in zzso extracts of zzso from mice receiving iron was found when compared to extracts from control zzso A human zzso zzso complex migrated zzso with the same mobility as a zzso iron responsive element zzso responsive element binding protein zzso The zzso iron responsive element zzso also zzso with the human zzso zzso region zzso complexes formed and vice zzso zzso iron zzso of human zzso may share a factor common or similar to that observed in zzso and zzso zzso iron zzso
