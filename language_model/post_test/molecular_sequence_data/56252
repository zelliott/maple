A gene zzso a zzso zzso surface protein zzso of the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from a zzso expression library screened with an zzso specific for 3 major surface zzso zzso analysis of two overlapping zzso fragments identified a single open reading frame that contained no zzso and predicted a zzso zzso zzso with features common to other zzso surface zzso These include the presence of 27 copies of the zzso acid zzso zzso an zzso signal sequence and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso gene were detected as a single band on Northern blots using total zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that the zzso has a zzso untranslated region of only 5 zzso similar to the very short zzso zzso leader sequences reported for other zzso zzso A large portion of the promoter zzso segment of zzso has zzso with zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso surface zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
