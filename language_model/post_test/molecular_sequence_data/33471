The zzso zzso channel zzso rapid zzso that is zzso by zzso of the selectivity zzso thereby preventing zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that the zzso of zzso may be up to seven zzso longer than that predicted by zzso with channels with known crystal zzso In the present work, we determined structural features of a zzso from the pore loop region of zzso zzso zzso in both sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso A complete structure calculation was done for the zzso in zzso and the zzso of zzso inside the zzso were zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso was only zzso zzso longer at the zzso compared with the pore zzso seen in the crystal structures of other zzso channels, rather than the seven zzso suggested from previous zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso spanned the same zzso in both zzso environments despite a difference in the zzso inside the respective zzso To determine if the extension of the length of the zzso was affected by the zzso environment in the two types of zzso we compared zzso and X-ray zzso results from a zzso zzso from the zzso gated zzso channel, zzso
