zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is a member of zzso family of which the first member, zzso was shown to be zzso in zzso and zzso dominant lateral zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in brain and its function is zzso In this study, we examined the expression of mouse zzso zzso in adult and developing brain and analyzed the zzso zzso regulatory regions of zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in widespread areas with selective regional variation in adult zzso In developing brain, zzso zzso was expressed at low level during zzso stages and markedly increased in broad areas after zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso identified a single zzso start site and two alternative zzso zzso reporter analysis using zzso cells and zzso mobility shift zzso identified a zzso restrictive zzso element zzso zzso approximately zzso and a zzso zzso zzso element with zzso activity zzso approximately zzso among multiple positive and negative regulatory zzso Since zzso and zzso are implicated in zzso gene expression and zzso regulation of many genes in brain, respectively, these results suggested that zzso and zzso might play important roles in regulation of zzso expression in zzso
