We report the complete sequence of the human zzso gene that encodes the zzso chain of zzso type IX zzso a member of the zzso zzso with interrupted triple zzso family of zzso zzso zzso sequencing defined over 23,000 base pairs zzso of the gene and about zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The gene contains 32 zzso The domain and zzso organization of the gene is almost identical to a related zzso the human zzso zzso However, zzso 2 of the zzso gene codes for one zzso zzso less than zzso 2 of the zzso zzso The difference is compensated by an zzso of 9 zzso coding for an additional zzso in zzso 4 of the zzso zzso As a result, the number of zzso repeats in the third zzso domain remains the same in both genes and ensures the formation of an zzso triple zzso In the course of screening this gene for zzso zzso for separate zzso deletions within the zzso domain were identified in two zzso In both instances, the deletions did not zzso with any disease zzso suggesting that they were neutral zzso In contrast, similar deletions in triple zzso domain of type I collagen are zzso To study whether zzso chains with the deletion will participate in the formation of correctly folded zzso type IX zzso we expressed zzso zzso chains together with normal zzso and zzso chains in insect zzso We show here that despite the zzso zzso zzso chains were zzso as zzso triple zzso molecules consisting of three alpha chains in a zzso zzso The results suggest that the next zzso domain zzso is capable of correcting the alignment of the alpha zzso and this ensures the formation of an zzso triple zzso
