zzso contains one copy each of zzso zzso and zzso It has been hypothesized that a zzso bond might exist between zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids were expressed in the human zzso line zzso The zzso plasmids zzso zzso species with zzso exchanged to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells, although able to zzso zzso zzso zzso do not zzso zzso amounts of zzso After zzso of zzso zzso almost all zzso in the culture zzso was present in zzso particles as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The same analysis performed with zzso of cells zzso with plasmids zzso in zzso zzso revealed free zzso zzso without zzso amounts of zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest the existence of a zzso bridge between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, they indicate that zzso bridge formation is essential for assembly of the zzso complex produced by zzso cells and suggest a similar role of zzso during zzso assembly in zzso
