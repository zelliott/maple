We examined zzso gene zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso This species is common in Far Eastern zzso The zzso zzso includes zzso zzso and contains a zzso open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 162 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is an zzso zzso We examined the expression pattern of zzso in this zzso during embryonic development by zzso in zzso zzso zzso was detected in embryonic cells in the germ band at early zzso zzso The number of zzso embryonic cells increased in stage zzso Later, it was mainly expressed in lateral region zzso In zzso extensive expression of zzso was observed not only in the head and tail regions, but also in the zzso between the zzso and the zzso We conclude that zzso is expressed in the cellular subset that will become the zzso cells of the adult zzso zzso may play an essential role in spatial and zzso regulation during zzso embryonic zzso
