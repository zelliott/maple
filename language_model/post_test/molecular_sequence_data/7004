zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is sufficient to direct zzso zzso The zzso promoter is bound by the B zzso and zzso zzso factor, zzso and disruption of the zzso sites significantly reduces promoter zzso However, zzso alone cannot fully account for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso We identified a zzso expressed nuclear protein complex of extremely low zzso mobility that also binds to this region of the zzso zzso This binding complex is a zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso factor, and zzso zzso a zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso alpha competes with the lineage restricted factor, zzso for the same critical zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter is activated in zzso cells by zzso with both zzso alpha and zzso beta together, but not by either factor zzso zzso of zzso cells with the two zzso zzso together with zzso is sufficient to activate zzso zzso in otherwise zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso compete for the same binding sites but cooperate to activate zzso zzso
