To understand the clinical implications of zzso factors and their zzso roles during cellular differentiation in the zzso system, we examined the expression of zzso zzso and stem cell leukemia zzso gene in human leukemia cell lines and various leukemia patients using the reverse zzso chain zzso Cell lines exhibiting zzso or zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso while zzso cell lines had no zzso zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso In some zzso cell lines, zzso zzso but not zzso gene zzso was zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso during the process of zzso zzso We next examined zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in 110 leukemia samples obtained from 76 patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso 19 with acute zzso leukemia zzso and 15 with chronic zzso leukemia in blast crisis zzso zzso gene expression was usually accompanied by zzso expression and was zzso detected in patients with leukemia exhibiting zzso or zzso zzso while patients with zzso leukemia were clustered in the group with no zzso zzso zzso None of the patients with ALL or zzso expressed zzso De zzso zzso patients with zzso gene expression had a lower complete zzso zzso rate and had a significantly poorer zzso Among the patients with zzso not expressing zzso a high percentage of patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso had zzso zzso while patients with zzso zzso had the best zzso rate zzso Our results suggest that the expression pattern of zzso factors reflects the lineage potential of leukemia cells, and zzso and zzso gene expression may have zzso value for the outcome of patients with zzso
