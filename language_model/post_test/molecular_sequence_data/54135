Surface modification strategies that take advantage of the zzso effects of zzso are important in the development of zzso zzso In this study, linear peptides zzso zzso and a small chemical zzso zzso with zzso binding affinities were grafted onto zzso zzso silicon zzso zzso were characterized with contact angle and zzso zzso and zzso of immobilized zzso were assessed zzso zzso measured thickness correlated with the predicted molecular lengths of grafted zzso zzso angle analysis indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso surfaces were zzso compared to zzso zzso and control zzso zzso of zzso from human serum was evaluated and zzso via specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso The following trend was noted for surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, with zzso zzso surfaces having zzso zzso of bound zzso zzso zzso surfaces possessed the least number of zzso zzso with rounded zzso zzso when compared to control zzso
