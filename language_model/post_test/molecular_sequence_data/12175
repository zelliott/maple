The primary aim of these studies was to identify and zzso characterize zzso proteins in the zzso We found that an 80 zzso protein was responsible for the majority of the zzso activity detected in rabbit liver nuclear preparations as zzso by zzso labeling with zzso The zzso activity was partially extracted only after treatment of nuclear envelope preparations with zzso M zzso and zzso zzso 100, which suggested that this zzso protein was a component of the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso 80 zzso protein was zzso by a series of steps that included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of two peptides generated by zzso zzso of the 80 zzso protein indicates that it shares sequence similarity with the tissue zzso zzso preparations of the 80 zzso protein show a zzso zzso activity, as zzso by the incorporation of zzso into zzso which is strongly inhibited by zzso but not by zzso A 36 zzso zzso protein zzso with the 80 zzso zzso protein through all of the zzso steps and sequence analysis suggests that the 36 zzso protein represents a zzso zzso of the zzso half of the 80 zzso protein and thus serves to mark the zzso domain within the 80 zzso zzso The 36 zzso zzso has a significantly higher efficiency of zzso incorporation compared to the 80 zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso a negative constraint on zzso activity or on the subsequent incorporation of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
