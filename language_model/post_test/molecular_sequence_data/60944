The zzso for a novel member of the zzso family zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library prepared at the zzso stage using as a probe the product of zzso zzso performed with zzso based on zzso zzso This zzso was 1860 zzso long, and contained a single open reading frame that zzso 208 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained a motif characteristic of the zzso family and it was similar zzso overall zzso to zzso but differed from zzso in its zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed only zzso in zzso at and after the zzso stage, but it was also specifically expressed in the stomach and zzso of zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was expressed zzso in eggs and in many adult zzso When zzso zzso was zzso in early zzso zzso was abnormal and development of anterior structures was zzso In such zzso the expression of the zzso transcript was suppressed during zzso while the expression of the transcripts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was zzso These results suggest that correct expression of zzso during zzso is required for the formation of normal head structures in zzso zzso during zzso and that expression of the zzso gene mediates this zzso
