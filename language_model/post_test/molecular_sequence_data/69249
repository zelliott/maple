Liver factor B1 zzso also called zzso nuclear factor 1 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor that is present in the liver, zzso stomach and zzso The zzso protein contains an unusual zzso that is characterized by an zzso of 21 zzso acids zzso not found in any other zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized the zzso sequences zzso the zzso of zzso zzso By comparing the zzso sequences with the zzso zzso we could identify nine zzso In general, the position of the zzso is identical to the one previously found in the zzso However, the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso in each species, an zzso that is split in two in the other zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso at exactly the position where the 21 zzso typical for zzso are zzso This is in agreement with the structure found in the rat gene and supports the notion that the zzso zzso evolved separately from the other genes zzso zzso zzso
