A deletion zzso zzso delta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was constructed in which 70 zzso acids of the mature protein were deleted near the zzso zzso zzso delta zzso was still able to zzso and inserted properly into the outer membrane of an zzso coli zzso The protein was isolated and zzso by standard zzso The zzso protein zzso in contrast to zzso zzso a tight association with the zzso zzso experiments with artificial zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso delta zzso produced defined zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso Its single-channel zzso was reduced to about half of the value of zzso zzso The deletion had a relatively small influence on the stability zzso for zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso was efficiently taken up into whole zzso coli cells containing zzso delta zzso The sequence of the zzso of mature zzso was identified as starting with zzso zzso The possible structure of zzso and zzso delta zzso in the outer membrane is zzso
