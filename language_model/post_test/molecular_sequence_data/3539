We isolated and zzso the zzso coding for zzso of six zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that, together with recently described zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a number of putative proteins from extensive zzso and zzso zzso they belong to the zzso type of zzso zzso zzso first described by zzso and zzso zzso We determined the zzso structure of the gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the common zzso We provide evidence that the central zzso of this gene is zzso to the second zzso of the chicken zzso zzso belonging to the c zzso We propose that the origin of this domain can be traced back in evolution to the origin of zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso proteins form a zzso zzso
