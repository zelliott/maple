zzso acid zzso mediates seed maturation and zzso responses to environmental zzso In zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is required for proper zzso responsiveness both in seeds and in zzso zzso To determine whether the lack of zzso zzso at the corresponding locus could be explained by the existence of redundant zzso we initiated a search for zzso zzso One such zzso turned out to be the zzso zzso whose zzso zzso was previously known to decrease zzso zzso Whereas zzso is zzso zzso has been described as zzso and zzso controlled at the zzso zzso zzso the sequence of the zzso zzso showed that it converts zzso to zzso which is precisely the same zzso acid substitution found in zzso and at the coincidental position within the zzso zzso domain zzso to zzso In zzso zzso and functional zzso studies in zzso confirmed that the zzso protein is an active protein zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso reduced zzso activity as well as affinity to zzso Although a number of differences between the two zzso in zzso responses to stress have been reported, quantitative comparisons of other major zzso showed that the effects of both zzso and zzso on these processes are nearly zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to assume partially redundant functions in zzso zzso which may provide a mechanism to maintain informational zzso
