zzso is a zzso that is activated at the last known stage of zzso zzso Among its many zzso it zzso zzso II during zzso at the zzso of dividing zzso However, zzso II has several cellular roles including zzso zzso zzso cohesion and zzso It is not known whether zzso II zzso plays a role in any of these functions nor have the zzso involved in zzso been directly zzso We now report that zzso II from rat lung is zzso to a low zzso on a single major site, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso on zzso also occurred in zzso growing zzso cells and was greatly increased upon zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso zzso revealed only a single zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was abolished by zzso suggesting the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso full length zzso II and zzso zzso domain in zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso reduced zzso domain zzso by zzso supporting that there is only a single major zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso or bulk zzso using zzso zzso or zzso peptides or following zzso zzso zzso zzso II was enriched at the zzso zzso but this targeting was unaffected by the zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso displaced zzso zzso II, but not zzso from the zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II primarily occurs on a single site that regulates zzso downstream of zzso rather than regulating zzso or zzso zzso
