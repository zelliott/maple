The zzso zzso zzso gene was found by reverse zzso to represent the most abundantly expressed gene of the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso However, in addition to the zzso zzso of nine zzso transcripts that have skipped zzso 4 or 5, zzso 4, 5, and 6, or zzso 4, 5, 6, and 7 were also identified in this zzso zzso circular zzso transcripts zzso by the joining of the donor and zzso zzso sites of the same zzso were detected in human zzso for zzso 4 and zzso Moreover, molecules composed of zzso 4, 5, and 6 with the donor zzso site of zzso 6 joined to the zzso zzso site of zzso 4 or composed of zzso 4, 5, 6, and 7 with the donor zzso site of zzso 7 joined to the zzso zzso site of zzso 4 were also found to be present in this zzso In rat zzso a similar analysis allowed the detection of a circular zzso zzso composed of zzso 6 and 7 of the zzso binding protein zzso zzso with the donor zzso site of zzso 7 joined to the zzso zzso site of zzso 6, and of an zzso zzso which had skipped zzso 6 and zzso These results apparently substantiate the hypothesis that alternative zzso zzso has the potential to generate not only zzso that lack one or more zzso but also circular zzso molecules that are composed of the zzso that are zzso However, additional zzso circular species containing various combinations of zzso were also detected in human zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in rat zzso This observation is interpreted as indicative that at low frequency, numerous circular zzso formation and zzso skipping events may occur, allowing the joining of a variety of different combinations of zzso Moreover, the relative stability of these molecules is apparently the key factor that determines the relative ease of their zzso
