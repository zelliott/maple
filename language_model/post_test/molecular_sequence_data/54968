Development of the zzso zzso skeleton requires the concerted activity of several zzso zzso Among them, zzso genes belonging to the zzso group 10 are essential for the formation of the zzso region of the zzso column, zzso to their capacity to block rib zzso In this work, we explored the basis for the zzso activity of zzso zzso Because genetic experiments in mice demonstrated that zzso proteins are strongly redundant in this function, we first searched for common motifs among the group zzso We identified the presence of two small sequences zzso the zzso that are zzso zzso among zzso proteins and that seem to be specific for this zzso We show here that one of these motifs is required but not sufficient for the zzso activity of zzso zzso This motif includes two potential zzso sites, which are essential for protein activity as their zzso to zzso resulted in a total loss of zzso zzso Our data indicates that this motif has a significant regulatory function, modulating interactions with more zzso parts of the zzso zzso eventually triggering the zzso zzso In addition, this motif might also regulate protein activity by zzso of the zzso zzso affinity through changes in the zzso state of two zzso zzso zzso within the zzso
