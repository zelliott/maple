zzso diseases in fish throughout the world have been extensively zzso Here we report the complete zzso sequence of zzso disease virus isolated in China zzso an zzso isolated from cultured zzso zzso zzso with zzso disease in zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso with a base composition of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed 240 potential open reading frames zzso and 176 zzso putative viral zzso which zzso zzso ranging from 40 to zzso zzso zzso The percent coding density is zzso and the average length of each zzso is 702 zzso A search of the zzso database using the 176 individual putative genes revealed 103 zzso to the corresponding zzso of zzso and 73 potential genes that were not found in zzso and other zzso Among the 73 zzso there are 8 genes that contain zzso zzso of cellular genes and 65 novel genes that do not show any significant zzso with the sequences in public zzso Although a certain extent of similarity between putative gene products of zzso and corresponding proteins of zzso was revealed, no zzso was detected when their zzso arrangements and coding strategies were compared to each other, suggesting that a high degree of genetic zzso between them has zzso And a large number of tandem and overlapping repeated sequences were observed in the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the major zzso protein zzso presents the highest identity to those of zzso and other zzso among the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, a zzso tree was constructed based on the multiple alignments of nine zzso zzso acid zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso were clustered together, but their zzso acid identity is much less than that in other zzso The unexpected levels of divergence between their zzso in size, gene organization, and gene product identity suggest that zzso and zzso shouldn't belong to a same species and that zzso should be considered a species different from zzso
