We have isolated a zzso clone that contains zzso the human gene zzso zzso The zzso gene contains 12 zzso ranging from 85 to 376 zzso in zzso zzso 6 zzso to the zzso deletion in the shorter of two types of zzso reported earlier, supporting the hypothesis that this zzso arose by alternate zzso leading to zzso zzso The insert contains zzso zzso of sequence upstream from the first zzso and 6 zzso 3' of the last zzso The clone expresses human zzso in zzso transformed rat zzso zzso zzso of the human gene organization with that recently reported for the zzso zzso gene revealed that the zzso boundaries are zzso In the zzso zzso the most highly zzso regions are those identified as consensus zzso and these are at least as highly zzso as bases zzso the translated portion of the zzso
