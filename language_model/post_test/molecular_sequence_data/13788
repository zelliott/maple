Previous deletion studies using a series of zzso fusion genes have indicated that the 625 zzso region of the zzso upstream promoter between zzso and zzso zzso is required for high levels of expression in bone, tendon, and skin of transgenic zzso To further define the important sequences within this region, a new series of deletion zzso extending to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been analyzed in transgenic zzso zzso activity, determined by measuring zzso activity in tissue extracts of 6- to zzso transgenic mouse zzso remains high for all the new deletion zzso and drops to zzso levels in zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the 49 zzso region of the zzso promoter between zzso and zzso zzso is required for high zzso expression in zzso Although deletion of the same region caused a substantial reduction of promoter activity in tail tendon, the construct extending to zzso zzso is still expressed in this zzso However, further deletion of the promoter to zzso zzso abolished activity in zzso zzso mobility shift studies identified a protein in zzso nuclear extracts that is not found in zzso nuclear zzso which binds within this 49 zzso zzso Our study has delineated sequences in the zzso promoter required for expression of the zzso gene in high type I zzso zzso and suggests that different zzso elements control expression of the zzso gene in bone and zzso
