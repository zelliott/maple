Previous characterization of zzso a gene found to be amplified and expressed in a subset of human brain tumors, revealed the presence of five tandem zinc fingers related to those of zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene of the gap zzso We have used the zzso zzso as a molecular probe to isolate related sequences from the human zzso zzso characterization of six related zzso including sequence determination, expression studies, and zzso zzso revealed that each locus could zzso a separate finger zzso The predicted proteins all had similar zzso zzso zzso a zzso stretch of 9 zzso acids connecting the zzso zzso of one finger to the zzso zzso of the zzso On the basis of zzso acid sequence and zzso organization, the genes could be placed into one of two zzso the zzso zzso (with the consensus finger zzso acid sequence zzso or the zzso zzso (with the consensus finger zzso acid sequence zzso Unlike zzso or zzso most of the newly isolated genes were expressed in many adult zzso The predicted proteins probably control the expression of other genes and, by zzso with zzso and zzso may be important in human development, zzso zzso or zzso
