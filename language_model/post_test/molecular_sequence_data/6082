In humans, the zzso gene encodes two zzso of a zzso zzso zzso which differ in their zzso terminal zzso As compared to the short form, the long form has an additional stretch of 65 zzso acids containing three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Once expressed in zzso cells, only the long form is able to elicit both zzso growth in a soft zzso zzso and tumors in nude mice, and thus appears endowed with a potential zzso transforming zzso Replacement of zzso zzso by zzso abrogates the transforming capacity of the long zzso This zzso was identified as a potential zzso site, and a zzso site for a zzso important in the signal zzso specific of the long zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso signal zzso zzso interaction could be crucial to zzso transforming activity associated with the long zzso Finally, zzso for the two forms are detected in zzso positive for zzso gene zzso
