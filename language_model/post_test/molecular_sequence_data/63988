A novel zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso The zzso protein was zzso in a zzso procedure and showed an apparent molecular mass of zzso Da in zzso zzso zzso exclusion zzso analysis determined a molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso suggesting that the native zzso is a zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso zzso activity were zzso and 55 degrees C, respectively, with zzso as zzso zzso activity was strongly inhibited by zzso and zzso No effect on zzso activity was detected with any other zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that it is not a zzso zzso studies showed the preference of the zzso for zzso with short rather than long zzso side chains or zzso with aromatic zzso
