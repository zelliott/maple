The second zzso of zzso zzso genes encodes discrete areas of zzso zzso zzso which are used as the basis for lineage assignments to determine genetic and evolutionary zzso Comparisons of these regions have led to the zzso zzso which proposes that certain zzso zzso from one species are more closely related to those from other species than they are to each zzso zzso that zzso lineages are ancestral in zzso We evaluated this paradigm in an analysis of zzso and zzso zzso genes using zzso and sequencing of 87 new nonhuman zzso zzso zzso A remarkable conservation of sequence motifs in the zzso region zzso zzso was observed, detected both by zzso and by zzso some of these motifs were found in species such as zzso that have zzso from the human lineage 50 zzso However, these fixed zzso motif sequences nevertheless occur on a background of diverse lineages suggesting that it is the zzso zzso rather than the zzso per zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso within the first zzso region zzso zzso identified lineage assignments to several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although a large number of zzso zzso sequences did not zzso to a defined zzso zzso suggesting that many of the nonhuman sequences lack human zzso zzso and have accumulated additional zzso variation subsequent to zzso While there are certain zzso lineages in zzso that show zzso zzso other sequence motifs seem purely zzso These differences suggest that zzso and zzso regions have distinct mechanisms for maintenance of zzso sequence zzso with different evolutionary histories for zzso zzso zzso
