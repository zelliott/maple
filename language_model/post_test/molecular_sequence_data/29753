zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to be the major zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso was isolated and encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso brain, zzso and urinary zzso The mouse zzso gene was zzso and zzso knockout mice were generated by targeted gene deletion of zzso zzso The survival and growth of zzso knockout mice were not different from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso lower in zzso from knockout mice than from those in zzso zzso Daily urine output was zzso greater in zzso deficient mice zzso zzso zzso and urine zzso zzso was lower zzso zzso 71 versus zzso zzso 83 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso p zzso zzso After 24 h of water zzso zzso (in zzso zzso was zzso zzso 38 in zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso 98 in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso concentration zzso was zzso higher, and urine zzso concentration zzso was zzso lower in knockout mice than in zzso mice, resulting in a much lower zzso ratio zzso zzso 5 versus 124 zzso 9, p zzso zzso Thus, the capacity to concentrate zzso in the urine is more severely impaired than the capacity to concentrate other zzso Together with data showing a disproportionate reduction in the concentration of zzso compared with salt in zzso zzso inner zzso of zzso zzso mice, these data define a novel zzso urinary concentrating zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso mice generated for these studies should also be useful in establishing the role of facilitated zzso transport in zzso zzso expressing zzso
