The zzso gene encodes zzso the heavy chain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso inactive until the zzso stage of zzso and in mature zzso expression of zzso is further increased by zzso zzso and other inflammatory zzso The zzso promoter region contains several zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso We screened a zzso zzso expression library for proteins able to bind to one of these zzso zzso to zzso base zzso and identified zzso a protein with zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with nuclear proteins from a variety of cell lines demonstrated binding of a protein to the zzso promoter that was zzso with zzso DNA binding of this protein was increased by zzso treatment in the zzso cell line zzso but not in the zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells increased zzso zzso message zzso but did not lead to cellular zzso zzso of zzso in zzso leukemia cell lines increased reporter gene expression from artificial promoter zzso containing zzso promoter zzso These data suggested that zzso increased expression of zzso
