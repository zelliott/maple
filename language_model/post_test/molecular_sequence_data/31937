The long circulating zzso of serum zzso the most abundant protein in zzso zzso derives from zzso zzso salvage from degradation, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso display, we identified human serum zzso zzso zzso with increased affinity for human zzso at zzso zzso enabling us to solve the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso We find an extensive, primarily zzso interface stabilized by zzso networks involving zzso zzso internal to each zzso The interface features two key zzso zzso side chains inserting into deep zzso pockets on zzso that overlap zzso zzso binding zzso We find that fatty acids zzso compete with zzso revealing a clash between zzso binding and recycling, and that our zzso zzso zzso have significantly increased circulating zzso in mice and zzso These observations open the way for the creation of zzso with significantly improved zzso
