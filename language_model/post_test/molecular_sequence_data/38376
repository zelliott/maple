In zzso cells, it is generally agreed that zzso proteins zzso the release of zzso It is controversial, however, whether they also work functionally in the zzso of zzso cells because the expression of zzso proteins has not been confirmed and the zzso is not inhibited by zzso toxin which zzso one of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the expression and the zzso of zzso proteins including zzso which is insensitive to zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the existence of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso proteins revealed that zzso was localized only in zzso zzso whereas zzso was in both the plasma and zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso these proteins in zzso zzso moved to the cell surface due to the fusion of zzso with the plasma zzso The results suggest the involvement of zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso zzso
