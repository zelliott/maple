zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso of zzso calcium channels, providing negative zzso feedback in many zzso zzso binding to the main zzso channel zzso has been widely proposed to initiate such zzso zzso zzso Here, we find that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This result demonstrates that zzso is the actual zzso sensor for zzso and suggests that zzso is zzso zzso to the channel zzso zzso is likely to occur via zzso zzso interaction of zzso zzso with an zzso motif on the zzso tail of zzso zzso also binds to analogous zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso calcium channels, suggesting that zzso effects may be widespread in the calcium channel zzso
