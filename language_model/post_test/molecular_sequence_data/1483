zzso induction has been widely studied in zzso and is used as an indicator of exposure to persistent pollutants like zzso zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso zzso especially in zzso Little work on this zzso has been carried out in zzso and results have suggested zzso or gene differences with the zzso zzso To date, a zzso zzso has been characterized and zzso in the marine zzso zzso zzso but no zzso zzso sequence has been zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso and zzso transcripts in the freshwater zzso zzso zzso and to compare their expression with those of the rainbow trout, zzso zzso after treatment with the specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In spite of numerous amplification conditions and primer combinations tested, which had been successful in fish, no zzso sequence was amplified on zzso of the zzso zzso from either control and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso transcripts were amplified in zzso zzso from control and zzso zzso As opposed to fish, no induction of this zzso was obtained in zzso after zzso zzso
