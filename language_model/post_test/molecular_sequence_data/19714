zzso salt interactions with zzso zzso of fat zzso are known to regulate the actions of gastrointestinal zzso zzso in order to control the zzso of dietary zzso Specifically, on the zzso interface of fat zzso the zzso portions of zzso zzso zzso have been thought to interact with and activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso To explore this regulatory process, we have determined the crystal structures of the complexes of pancreatic zzso with the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The five zzso salt complexes each result in a partly zzso active site, and the resulting zzso binding displays specific hydrogen bonding interactions and extensive zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are bound to zzso with their polar zzso and zzso groups oriented away from the zzso zzso zzso The impaired zzso and interface binding functions implied by these structures provide a basis for the previous numerous observations of a zzso dependence of the rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The rising or zzso phase is consistent with enhanced binding and zzso of the bound zzso by the zzso salt induced zzso charge in a zzso zzso The falling or zzso phase can be explained by the formation of a zzso zzso zzso complex between zzso and any zzso zzso in which it forms a stable zzso The model provides new insight into the regulatory role that specific zzso salt interactions are likely to play in fat zzso
