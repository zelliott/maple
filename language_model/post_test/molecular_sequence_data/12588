zzso zzso cause rapid and coordinated zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso system zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso another member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso regulates a subset of fatty acid metabolism genes shared with zzso we examined the possibility of interplay between zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso in transgenic mice carrying a zzso zzso region of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene fused to the coding region of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells indicated that this zzso is zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso shift zzso revealed that zzso of zzso action by zzso occurs through zzso of limiting amounts of zzso X zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso partially reversed the zzso in a zzso manner; zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso further confirmed that interaction between zzso and zzso signaling systems is zzso These results suggest that a convergence of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways occurs through their common interaction with the zzso partner zzso
