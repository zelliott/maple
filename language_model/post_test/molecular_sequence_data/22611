Besides vaccine escape or immune escape zzso B virus zzso zzso naturally occurring and drug-induced zzso have been reported in the surface gene zzso of zzso 

To investigate the frequency and profile of naturally occurring zzso zzso and the influence of long-term zzso therapy in patients with chronic zzso B zzso 

57 patients with zzso proven zzso on zzso 100 zzso for more than 24 months, were zzso zzso DNA was extracted at baseline and from zzso serum zzso The region zzso the complete major zzso region zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso of major zzso that overlapped with the viral zzso was zzso amplified and zzso zzso response zzso was zzso 

Two zzso patients had naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso and zzso seen in the zzso zzso of the zzso Following zzso therapy, 14 of 57 zzso patients developed 16 types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thirteen zzso of these zzso emerged downstream to the zzso Nine of 16 types of zzso zzso observed with zzso therapy were also associated with the corresponding changes in the zzso zzso zzso viral DNA was significantly higher zzso zzso 336 zzso p zzso zzso among patients developing zzso zzso and the zzso in them was significantly lower zzso of 16 zzso zzso 17 of 41 zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso occurring zzso zzso are uncommon and are restricted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso develop in about a quarter of the patients on zzso therapy, mostly downstream to the zzso They may contribute to zzso to the zzso zzso
