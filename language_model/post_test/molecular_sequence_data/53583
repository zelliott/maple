zzso and Mad are basic zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that zzso with Max to bind DNA and thereby influence the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso complexes repress zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso binding domain and the centrally located zzso are required for zzso to function during a molecular switch from proliferation to zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso contains previously unidentified motifs necessary for the regulation of zzso zzso We show that removal of the last 18 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of the protein and the ability to reverse a zzso differentiation zzso Moreover, deletion of region V results in a protein that binds DNA zzso and no longer zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of the preceding 24 zzso acids zzso zzso together with region V restores DNA binding and zzso repression, suggesting a functional interplay between these two zzso Furthermore, zzso within region IV appears to mediate this zzso These findings indicate that novel regulatory elements are present in the zzso zzso
