Loss of zzso zzso at zzso zzso is one of the most prevalent genetic disturbances occurring at the earliest stage of tumor development for a wide variety of human zzso culminated in lung zzso The 19 genes residing at zzso have been vigorously characterized for tumor zzso activity and gene zzso mechanism because of their potentially significant merits of clinical zzso Many of these 19 genes have been shown to manifest various growth zzso properties, however none of them are zzso by coding zzso in their remaining zzso as in the zzso two- hits zzso Thus far the most zzso alternative gene zzso mechanism known for the zzso zzso is zzso zzso by promoter zzso Previously, we have focused our investigation on one of the 19 genes at zzso zzso and demonstrated its tumor zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso as well as its zzso expression loss from the remaining zzso in a majority of the primary lung tumors zzso The current study tested our hypothesis that the zzso zzso in primary lung tumors may, as seen in most of the other zzso zzso be due to zzso in its promoter zzso zzso zzso to this most plausible zzso however, we found no evidence of zzso gene zzso for the zzso zzso Here we suggest some of the possible, zzso alternative means of the zzso gene expression loss in zzso including defects in zzso and zzso modifications as well as mechanisms related to zzso
