zzso biomass from trees provides a renewable zzso for zzso lumber, zzso paper, and other zzso zzso the mechanism underlying natural variation of the complex traits controlling growth and zzso zzso in trees can enable zzso breeding to improve wood quality and zzso Here, we combined linkage zzso zzso association analysis with traditional linkage analysis to detect the genetic effect of a zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly expressed in developing zzso and zzso zzso diversity and zzso in zzso sampled from the zzso zzso natural distribution, revealed that zzso harbors high single zzso zzso zzso diversity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso demonstrating that the potential of a zzso zzso approach in understanding the molecular basis underlying quantitative variation in this zzso By combining single zzso zzso and zzso associations in an association population of 460 individuals with single zzso linkage analysis in a zzso linkage populations zzso zzso we identified three strong associations zzso discovery rate Q zzso zzso in both zzso These include two zzso markers zzso associated with zzso content and zzso associated with fiber zzso and a zzso marker zzso associated with zzso zzso Variation in zzso transcript abundance among zzso classes of zzso was confirmed in these two zzso zzso combining different methods allowed us to examine functional zzso zzso variation underlying natural variation in complex quantitative traits related to growth and zzso zzso
