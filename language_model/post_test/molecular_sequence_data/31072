The low density zzso zzso protein zzso is a cell surface zzso that binds and zzso plasma zzso enriched in zzso zzso It is zzso in the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso precursor that zzso with an apparent molecular mass of about 600 zzso on zzso zzso After it reaches the zzso complex, the protein is zzso to generate two zzso with apparent molecular masses of approximately 515 and 85 zzso zzso The larger zzso zzso lacks a zzso zzso It remains attached to the membrane through zzso association with the smaller zzso zzso zzso occurs at the sequence zzso which resembles the sequence zzso at the zzso site in the receptors for insulin and zzso growth zzso zzso the only other cell surface receptors known to undergo zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs zzso with the conversion of the zzso carbohydrates to the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is prevented by zzso A, which blocks transport to the zzso zzso These data raise the possibility that zzso and the receptors for insulin and IGF-1 are processed by a specific zzso that recognizes protein with extended basic sequences and resides in the zzso complex or in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
