Human zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso with in zzso functional effects are responsible for zzso of severe zzso zzso zzso that are able to counteract this in zzso molecular zzso is crucial to develop specific zzso drugs in these genetically associated zzso We analyzed the in zzso effect of two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso on typical zzso zzso chosen based on the nature of their functional zzso zzso zzso retention and/or reduced zzso activity and/or reduced zzso zzso We assessed the in zzso ability of zzso and zzso to bind and activate zzso zzso These zzso were found earlier in 11 obese French patients zzso age zzso was zzso years zzso and body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were responsible for a significant zzso of zzso zzso depending on the functional characteristics of the zzso Both zzso were able to activate zzso zzso with decreased zzso zzso associated with or without decreased zzso activity, to the same extent than zzso in zzso zzso This result suggests that those zzso would be the best targets for the zzso zzso among zzso zzso obese zzso No specific clinical zzso was associated with the differential response to pharmacological zzso We identified two novel zzso zzso that were able in zzso to efficiently activate zzso zzso with impaired zzso zzso functional zzso These results stimulate interest in the development of these drugs for zzso zzso zzso
