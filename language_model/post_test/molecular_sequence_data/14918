zzso and zzso are two major tumor zzso genes for zzso breast and zzso zzso In sporadic breast cancer, although zzso zzso of these genes are rare, loss of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso at zzso and zzso zzso were investigated in 202 Japanese invasive breast cancer zzso The relationships between zzso at these gene zzso and zzso characteristics were zzso 

Among 166 zzso cases for both zzso and zzso zzso 69 zzso and 52 zzso tumors revealed zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso or zzso locus was associated with higher nuclear grade zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso at zzso locus was associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso and significantly shorter zzso survival zzso zzso zzso distant zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and overall survival zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso at zzso locus had no associations with zzso zzso or zzso zzso status and zzso zzso at zzso locus was independently associated with poor prognosis in terms of zzso survival zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso distant zzso survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and overall survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso locus could be an independent zzso zzso useful in identifying a zzso of patients with poor zzso
