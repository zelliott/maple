The ubiquitous zzso and zzso are thought to be localized in the zzso zzso as is their zzso inhibitor zzso Previously, zzso was found to be enriched in zzso zzso isolated from rat cerebral zzso and zzso zzso cells, but the zzso zzso of zzso was not zzso In the present study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that both zzso 1 and zzso small zzso 1, which together form zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso 1 contains an zzso zzso domain, and is distinct from the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1, but not zzso 2, was imported into zzso zzso of the zzso 22 zzso acids of zzso 1 blocked the zzso zzso import, while addition of this zzso region to zzso 2 or green fluorescent protein enabled zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso 1 was not processed following zzso import, but was removed by zzso following zzso zzso zzso small zzso 1 was not directly imported into zzso but was imported in the presence of zzso zzso The presence of a zzso targeting sequence in the zzso region of zzso 1 is consistent with the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso space and provides new insight into the possible functions of this zzso zzso
