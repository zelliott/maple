The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex determined to a resolution of zzso A reveals an overall fold that consists of two similar zzso zzso one of which contains the characteristic zzso zzso motif zzso zzso found in the majority of zzso zzso The fold of the zzso backbone closely resembles that of the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso in its closed zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso uses the same zzso as zzso but forms instead zzso zzso The active site of zzso is significantly smaller than that observed in zzso reflecting the relative changes in shape that occur in the conversion of the common zzso zzso to the respective zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coordinate to the zzso zzso and three other potential zzso interactions to active site zzso side chains are zzso Additionally, it is noted that there is a buried zzso water zzso zzso A from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso is within zzso distance of the side chain zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in both zzso and zzso This potential hydrogen bond and the known geometry of iron zzso for the zzso allowed us to model zzso zzso in the active sites of both zzso and zzso These models suggest that the position of the zzso zzso differs between the two zzso In zzso zzso binds zzso to zzso while in zzso the zzso group of zzso acts as a zzso donor and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso It is suggested that this difference in the ring orientation of the zzso and the corresponding zzso influences the site of zzso
