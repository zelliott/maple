A circular zzso zzso zzso closed zzso DNA associated with coconut zzso zzso virus zzso was zzso amplified by the zzso chain reaction, and zzso and its sequence established by analysis of overlapping zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence comprised zzso zzso and contained open reading frames for six proteins of molecular weight larger than 5 zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso codes for a zzso protein with the zzso zzso motif zzso and may possibly participate in virus zzso The putative viral protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso is a positively charged zzso protein with zzso to the zzso protein of nuclear zzso virus, and may represent the zzso coat zzso zzso DNA can form a stable stem structure of 10 zzso base pairs zzso a loop sequence which in one orientation closely resembles the motif zzso zzso in a similar structural arrangement within the zzso zzso Otherwise no sequence zzso to zzso plant viruses of the zzso or zzso groups was zzso zzso therefore represents a new zzso group of plant zzso
