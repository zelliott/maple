zzso zzso zzso control strategies within the zzso zzso require an adequate understanding of the zzso zzso interaction at the molecular zzso The zzso zzso surface proteins are required for the transition from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso however, their respective molecular interactions in the zzso are largely zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso as zzso for identification of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso A 50 zzso protein zzso with zzso but not with zzso in zzso overlay zzso This protein was identified as zzso by zzso zzso and was detected in zzso but not in soluble zzso protein zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso was shown to interact with zzso zzso in overlay and zzso zzso confirming the interaction of the two zzso The zzso interaction in zzso could represent a potential target for developing transmission blocking strategies based on interfering the zzso zzso
