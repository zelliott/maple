zzso (also known as zzso is a recently identified zzso belonging to the zzso zzso It has putative roles in the regulation of stress responses, food zzso and reproduction by zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso It also binds and activates the zzso family zzso receptors zzso and zzso in zzso To obtain a zzso zzso as zzso for studying the interaction of these receptors with various zzso in the present work we propose a novel zzso labeling strategy for the zzso human zzso that has been previously prepared in our zzso First, the zzso 6 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso precursor was removed by zzso zzso and all of the primary zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso blocked by zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso of the blocked zzso was released by zzso zzso zzso that removed the zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso Third, an zzso zzso was introduced to the newly released zzso zzso by reaction with the highly active primary zzso zzso zzso Fourth, after removal of the zzso zzso under mild zzso condition, zzso zzso with an zzso zzso was introduced to the zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso through click zzso Using this zzso labeling strategy, homogeneous zzso human zzso could be obtained with good overall zzso In contrast, conventional random labeling resulted in a complex mixture that was poorly resolved because human zzso has four primary zzso zzso that all react with the modification zzso Both zzso and competition binding zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso retained high binding affinity for human zzso zzso and zzso and was therefore a suitable zzso and stable zzso to study the interaction of various natural or designed zzso with these zzso Using this zzso labeling strategy, other functional zzso such as fluorescent zzso zzso or zzso could also be introduced to the zzso zzso of the zzso human zzso Additionally, we improved the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the way for the use of zzso as a zzso zzso for protein and zzso labeling in future zzso
