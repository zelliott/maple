zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and are essential for de zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso contain genes coding for two zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso an zzso class I zzso are zzso with zzso which encodes an zzso regulatory zzso Likewise, the class II zzso zzso zzso gene forms an zzso with a likely regulatory zzso zzso which encodes a protein possessing an zzso domain like those present in the zzso activity site of many class zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso had no discernible effect on growth individually, but abolition of both zzso systems, using zzso to zzso the class zzso zzso zzso in the zzso deletion zzso was zzso establishing that zzso zzso possesses just two functional zzso zzso The class II zzso zzso may function to provide a pool of zzso precursors for DNA repair during oxygen limitation and/or for immediate growth after restoration of zzso as the zzso zzso was slower in growth recovery than the zzso zzso or the parent zzso The class zzso and class II zzso genes show complex zzso The zzso genes were transcribed some five- to zzso higher than the zzso genes in zzso growth, but when zzso was deleted, zzso zzso was zzso by zzso In a zzso experiment, deletion of zzso had little effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a dramatic increase in zzso of zzso and to a less extent zzso whereas disruption of zzso a gene required for synthesis of zzso B12 a zzso for the class II zzso caused similar zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso had no zzso effect on zzso of either set of zzso zzso These results establish the existence of control mechanisms that sense and regulate overall zzso gene zzso
