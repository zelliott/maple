Chicken zzso zzso is an zzso protein which is believed to have a fundamental role in vitamin zzso transport of zzso A mapping approach based on zzso plasma zzso mass zzso zzso zzso was used to screen the zzso sequence of zzso for sequence changes and zzso zzso In the zzso mapping experiment, zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and the resulting peptides were subjected to zzso mass zzso analysis either as a mixture or as zzso liquid zzso isolated zzso The zzso primary structure of zzso was confirmed by rapid zzso mass spectral identification of the zzso zzso fragments, and the nature of the zzso blocking group was readily determined to be an zzso zzso The relatively zzso nature of the zzso mass zzso analysis allowed the mapping of the zzso zzso through an additional in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
