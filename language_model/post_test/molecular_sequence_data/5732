zzso cells exit the cell cycle and enter a metabolically zzso stationary phase when starved for nutrients essential for normal zzso We have cloned a novel gene named zzso zzso for stationary phase zzso that is essential for zzso zzso cell viability in a stationary phase induced by zzso zzso zzso encodes a 47 zzso protein with two zinc finger motifs that are partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deleted for zzso are unable to survive zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso and induced by zzso zzso zzso with the zzso activated zzso zzso are known to lose viability when grown to zzso or when starved for zzso These cells are poor in zzso induction and their viability loss is largely suppressed by zzso expression of zzso Thus, poor induction of zzso is at least partially responsible for the viability zzso Analysis also showed that cells need to receive zzso signals before entry into the stationary phase in order to maintain viability in a zzso zzso
