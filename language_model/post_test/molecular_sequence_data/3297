zzso infections that result from an zzso in a patient's immune response at the surgical site are a major problem in procedures that incorporate zzso in trauma surgery and joint zzso Diagnosis of infection based on pathogen detection is difficult and exacerbated by increasing numbers of partially or totally resistant strains of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso profiling of a zzso cellular immune response could facilitate the identification of the pathways involved in pathogen recognition and zzso and could lead to more rational design of drugs and zzso To this end, we constructed and characterized ten individually zzso and zzso cloned zzso libraries from peripheral blood cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso from zzso zzso and challenged pigs as part of an zzso orthopedic model of deep zzso Three of these libraries were zzso at zzso values 5, 10, 20, and zzso The libraries comprise more than 20 million primary zzso with an average insert length zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed zzso clusters containing an average of zzso sequences and zzso zzso Gene discovery is estimated to be approximately zzso zzso of public databases resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso of which zzso had significant zzso to zzso from a variety of species, and zzso were without a significant match in any public zzso We also identified zzso zzso as involved in host cell and zzso defense and zzso related to cell signaling and zzso These zzso together with the zzso appearing as novel, are of specific interest to the infectious disease zzso
