The initial zzso steps in zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso zzso strain zzso a zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso via zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso strain T zzso the addition of zzso to zzso to form zzso In the presence of zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso was oxidized to zzso (or a closely related zzso and zzso zzso studies conducted with zzso cells and zzso suspensions of zzso zzso zzso strain T demonstrated that the specific rate of in zzso zzso formation accounts for at least zzso of the specific rate of in zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose that zzso zzso strain T zzso zzso zzso to zzso (or its zzso zzso via zzso and zzso (or its zzso zzso in a series of reactions that are analogous to those recently proposed for zzso zzso zzso to zzso A zzso kinetic isotope effect was observed in the zzso zzso reaction (and the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso step in this novel zzso addition reaction involves breaking a zzso zzso
