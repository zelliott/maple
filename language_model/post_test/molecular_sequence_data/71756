A protein identified as zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso is an inefficient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its sequence is zzso identical to that of an unidentified protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Both proteins efficiently catalyze the zzso zzso reaction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), suggesting that this is their zzso zzso zzso Their membership in the mechanistically diverse zzso zzso provides an explanation for the zzso zzso of the protein from zzso The zzso zzso may provide an example of a protein poised for evolution of a new zzso function in the zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the correct assignment of function to new proteins in functional and structural zzso may require an understanding of the metabolism of the zzso
