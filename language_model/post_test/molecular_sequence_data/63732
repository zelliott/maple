From the different zzso clustered on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso binding sites zzso Their sequence composition and zzso vary amongst promoters of diverse zzso zzso Occupancy of these sites by zzso was examined through zzso and zzso zzso modified to suit zzso zzso zzso For the genes zzso binding of zzso coincided with the respective stages of zzso zzso However, the factor was zzso on promoter sequences long after individual gene zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso zzso in developing zzso resulted in zzso of zzso gene zzso A zzso function of zzso according to which it may act as both an zzso and a zzso during zzso zzso is considered under the light of the presented zzso
