The molecular basis of familial zzso zzso I zzso a rare zzso zzso zzso was investigated in six unrelated individuals (five of Spanish descent and one of Northern European zzso DNA amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso followed by single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis allowed rapid identification of the underlying zzso Six different zzso zzso (three of which are previously zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso were discovered in the five zzso zzso These included an 11 zzso deletion in zzso 2, and five zzso zzso zzso 86 zzso zzso zzso His 136 zzso zzso zzso zzso 188 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 205 zzso zzso zzso The zzso 86 zzso zzso is the only known zzso zzso in zzso zzso The other zzso zzso lie in the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso in close proximity with the zzso site of zzso These and other previously reported zzso zzso provide insight into zzso relationships in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso point to the important role of particular highly zzso zzso and zzso in proper folding of the zzso zzso and of certain connecting zzso in the zzso zzso A nonsense zzso zzso 19 zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was found to zzso zzso in the sixth patient who had normal zzso but was zzso
