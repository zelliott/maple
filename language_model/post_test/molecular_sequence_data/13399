The zzso beta 2 zzso zzso mediate cell zzso in a variety of events essential for normal immune zzso Despite extensive research in this field, only three members of this zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso a fourth alpha chain, alpha zzso that associates with zzso The alpha d zzso is more closely related to zzso and zzso than to zzso This zzso is expressed at moderate levels on zzso cell lines and zzso of peripheral blood zzso and more strongly on zzso cells such as foam cells, specialized zzso found in zzso fatty streaks that may develop into zzso zzso The alpha zzso zzso exhibits preferential recognition of zzso over zzso
