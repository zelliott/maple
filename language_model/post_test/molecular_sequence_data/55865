Three different point zzso have been observed in some familial Alzheimer's disease zzso at a unique zzso zzso near the zzso end of the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of these zzso on the processing and cellular functions of beta zzso can best be determined in the absence of the normal zzso of the zzso We have used targeted zzso degradation by a zzso zzso zzso to cleave and zzso beta zzso expression in zzso The consensus zzso zzso site, zzso decreases zzso matches the zzso zzso sequence in beta zzso zzso Introduction of zzso point zzso which change zzso decrease the rate of zzso zzso by more than three orders of zzso Thus, zzso targeting of this site should allow the study of protein processing in zzso Furthermore, a zzso targeted to zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso faster than the normal zzso This suggests that zzso might lower zzso beta zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso
