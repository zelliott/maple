zzso zzso zzso and cellular fatty zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes were used to characterize the microbial community structure of zzso enhanced biological zzso zzso systems in response to altering sludge zzso zzso zzso All the data suggest that the microbial community structures of sludge samples with a P content between 8 and zzso zzso dry zzso zzso good zzso zzso were very similar, but differed from those with zzso P content zzso no zzso zzso For all samples zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the major zzso The dominance of zzso zzso and zzso suggested that large numbers of organisms belonging to the beta and alpha zzso of the zzso and the zzso from the high zzso zzso bacteria, respectively, were zzso zzso analysis revealed at least 7-9 zzso DNA bands and numerous other fragments in each zzso Five major zzso fragments from each of the zzso and zzso zzso sludge samples, respectively, were successfully isolated and zzso zzso analysis of the sequences indicated that both zzso and zzso zzso sludge samples shared three common zzso that were separately affiliated with a novel bacterial group from the gamma zzso of the zzso two zzso zzso previously isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in the alpha zzso of the zzso The zzso analysis also revealed zzso unique to both sludge zzso Changes in sludge P content therefore had an effect on the composition and abundance of the zzso microbial zzso though specific zzso could not be unequivocally associated with zzso
