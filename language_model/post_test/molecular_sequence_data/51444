zzso zzso zzso and zzso complementary zzso have been isolated, identified, and used to study zzso and zzso expression as markers for cell zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cell lines used were based on a zzso benign zzso line zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected for zzso but not zzso in the benign zzso The zzso zzso cells expressed zzso but showed a zzso reduction in the zzso message, which nuclear zzso zzso identified as being due to zzso zzso An identical pattern of zzso zzso was found in independent zzso zzso cell hybrids of the benign and zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso cells may play a role in the apparent loss of differentiation evident in tumor zzso
