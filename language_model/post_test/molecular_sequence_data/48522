zzso promoters are defined as those that regulate adjacent genes organized in a divergent fashion zzso to head zzso and separated by zzso zzso In order to dissect zzso promoter activity in a model plant, deletion analysis was performed for seven rice promoters using zzso gene zzso which identified three promoters to be zzso Regulatory elements located in or close to the zzso regions zzso of one of the genes zzso gene zzso were found to be responsible for their zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis identified unique protein binding sites in these zzso zzso of these motifs resulted in significant loss of expression of the reporter genes on either side of the zzso Changes in the motifs at both the positions resulted in a remarkable decrease in zzso activity of the reporter genes zzso the zzso Based on our results, we propose a novel mechanism for the zzso of rice zzso zzso
