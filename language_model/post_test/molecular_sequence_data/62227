The zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key factor of gene expression upon entry into stationary phase and in stressful zzso The selectivity of promoter recognition by zzso and the zzso zzso is as yet not clearly zzso We used a genetic approach to investigate the interaction of zzso with its target zzso Starting with zzso zzso of a zzso promoter target, zzso altered in the zzso or zzso zzso we isolated zzso forms of zzso suppressing the promoter zzso The activity of these zzso on zzso of zzso and zzso another target of zzso indicated that zzso is able to interact with the same key features within a promoter sequence as zzso Indeed, zzso zzso can recognize the zzso element of some but not all its target zzso through interactions with its zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids within the zzso region participate in the recognition of the zzso zzso More specifically, zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the strong preference of zzso for a C in position zzso and zzso zzso can interact with the zzso zzso in the zzso element of the target zzso
