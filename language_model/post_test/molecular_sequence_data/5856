We have identified the zzso from a zzso and zzso soil zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis of the zzso revealed an open reading frame that encodes a zzso of 360 zzso zzso This deduced zzso shares 57% zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso The previously identified zzso zzso family signature sequence is zzso in the sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso corresponding to zzso revealed that it is present as single copy on zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso present on the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso resistance marker via zzso zzso resulted in drastic changes in the growth zzso The zzso zzso zzso grown in liquid medium exhibited zzso that is characteristic of zzso zzso of other bacteria, suggesting that we have cloned the functional copy of the zzso of zzso zzso
