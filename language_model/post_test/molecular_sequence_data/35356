zzso with zzso zzso zzso are broadly distributed in bacteria and have been implicated in a variety of important zzso including cell division and zzso zzso Most zzso proteins that have been structurally and/or zzso characterized are zzso that cleave zzso in the zzso zzso cell wall zzso zzso exceptions are the zzso coli cell division proteins zzso and zzso These zzso factors are not zzso themselves, but instead serve as zzso that stimulate PG zzso by target zzso called zzso to promote cell zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso domain from zzso the first structure of a zzso factor implicated in the regulation of PG zzso As expected, the fold is highly similar to that of other zzso zzso However, consistent with its role as a regulator, the zzso region is zzso and lacks a zzso metal zzso zzso genetic analysis indicates that zzso in and around this zzso active site are critical for zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Thus, in the regulatory zzso factors, the apparent zzso binding pocket zzso in active zzso has been adapted to control PG zzso by another set of zzso
