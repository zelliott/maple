zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso that was identified as a key regulator of zzso zzso guidance in zzso and has subsequently been shown to play a similar role in the central nervous system and zzso Three zzso zzso with zzso involving zzso important zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso variation with viability of zzso adult flies ranging from 0 to zzso and zzso motor nerve defects ranging from 11 to 57% zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether zzso in zzso affecting zzso guidance and viability demonstrate losses of zzso activity and whether differences in zzso potential zzso zzso zzso we expressed full-length zzso and zzso zzso protein in Schneider 2 cells, and assessed zzso activity using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso including an examination of sensitivity to various zzso in zzso zzso efficiency, and the zzso profile of the zzso suggests a common zzso zzso reaction mechanism despite lack of sequence conservation in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins revealed that every zzso had less than zzso activity relative to the zzso zzso and these rates did not differ significantly from one zzso These results indicate that zzso in zzso resulting in zzso guidance defects and zzso significantly compromise zzso activity, yet the range of biological activity exhibited by zzso zzso cannot be explained by differences in zzso activity, as zzso by their ability to zzso the zzso zzso
