A zzso of the functional gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of particulate methane zzso zzso was zzso from DNA of the recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso and possesses a novel type III arrangement of zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso sequence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso B2 belongs to a novel zzso zzso This lineage was only zzso related to the zzso sequence cluster of type II zzso with identity values between zzso and zzso The identity values between the zzso of zzso zzso zzso B2 and zzso sequences of type I zzso ranged from zzso to zzso However, the zzso of this zzso zzso was more closely affiliated with the zzso zzso sequences of zzso clones retrieved from various zzso zzso zzso showing atmospheric methane zzso The zzso identity values with these clones were zzso Nonetheless, the apparent affinity for methane exhibited by zzso zzso zzso B2 was 1-2 zzso which is similar to values measured in other zzso zzso This finding suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso B2 is not a novel zzso specialized to have a high affinity for methane and that apparent zzso methane zzso is either the result of particular culture conditions or is performed by another zzso zzso
