All living organisms use zzso channels to regulate the transport of zzso across cellular zzso Certain zzso channels are zzso as zzso because they have a zzso structure that zzso their pores to open in response to changes in the cell membrane zzso Until recently, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels were regarded as a unique development of zzso cells, adapted to accomplish specialized electrical zzso as exemplified in zzso Here we present the functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso channel from a zzso zzso from an oceanic zzso zzso This channel possesses all the functional attributes of classical zzso zzso zzso The conservation of function reflects structural conservation in the zzso sensor as revealed by specific, zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso which evolved to inhibit zzso zzso zzso
