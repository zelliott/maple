A zzso is a zzso zzso that effectively zzso both alpha and beta zzso zzso that studied here was engineered from the genes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso has unique structural features and contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A partial zzso carrying zzso and zzso also effectively zzso zzso zzso We determined the zzso and crystal structures of zzso which significantly enhances the activity of the zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso and crystal zzso The overall structure of zzso which consists of two zzso zzso was composed of a typical zzso architecture and was similar to that of other zzso module 2 family zzso despite low sequence zzso The zzso surface identified by zzso was flat and contained a strip of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso flanked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso form a zzso charged patch and are a characteristic feature of zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso interaction was dominant for the recognition of zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso were responsible for a higher zzso specificity of zzso for zzso compared with that of zzso These results provide the first structure of a zzso zzso and yield new insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso This is important in the development of technology for the exploitation of zzso
