zzso tuberculosis harbors four zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso is preceded by a zzso regulator zzso zzso Here, we report the operator sites of the zzso and its zzso in other zzso zzso and zzso species zzso zzso All the identified DNA motifs illustrate the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso Moreover, these motifs from the upstream region share sequence zzso which is in agreement with the similarity of their DNA binding zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we demonstrate that the predicted DNA motifs specifically interact with the zzso zzso Our present study has implications in the understanding of zzso elements and the zzso nature of the zzso zzso of zzso
