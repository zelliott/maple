zzso zzso zzso has become a preferred host for DNA cloning in zzso species over its zzso the zzso strain 66 zzso number zzso from the John zzso Center zzso especially when stable DNA is crucial for in zzso zzso because DNA from strain 66 contains a novel modification that makes it sensitive to zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso revealed that it has several additional zzso traits associated with a zzso deletion of zzso 90 zzso which was cloned and mapped by using a zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of two clones containing the left and right deletion ends originating from strain 66 and one clone with the deletion and fused sequence cloned from strain zzso revealed a perfect zzso direct zzso which may have zzso deletion and fusion to yield strain zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of zzso linking clones in the deleted region in relation to the published zzso map of strain zzso yielded a complete zzso map for the zzso zzso 66 zzso on which the relative positions of a cloned zzso zzso resistance zzso gene and the zzso gene cluster were precisely zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso 66, as well as the zzso zzso of its close relative, zzso zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso deletion in strain zzso may have originated from an zzso from an unknown zzso
