A synthetic gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing an zzso signal zzso has been used to transform tobacco zzso zzso analysis showed that transformed plants accumulate high levels of zzso zzso accounting for up to zzso of the total soluble protein zzso which could be extracted by simple zzso and zzso of leaf zzso A substantial proportion of the zzso protein extracted in this way was found to possess zzso zzso zzso cell suspension cultures derived from transformed plants zzso functional zzso protein into the surrounding zzso Compared with the levels of zzso protein observed in plants expressing the native zzso zzso the incorporation of an zzso signal zzso to target the zzso to the zzso results in elevated zzso of the zzso
