zzso zzso is an alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso with a predicted zzso sequence inserted between the zzso binding zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso This paper presents the sequence of zzso zzso acids zzso the alternatively spliced portion of zzso zzso and provides evidence that much of the inserted sequence has the zzso of an extended random zzso zzso features of the inserted sequence include a zzso profile that contains few zzso regions, and 220 predicted sites for zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso 2, protein zzso C, and zzso protein zzso Secondary structure and folding of the inserted zzso acid zzso were deduced from properties of zzso zzso zzso ratios of zzso were calculated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the inserted zzso indicating a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso indicate a zzso structure with negligible zzso or beta sheet zzso These results suggest a zzso model for zzso zzso with a zzso zzso head domain and an extended zzso tail domain zzso by the inserted zzso zzso and zzso studies of developing zzso rat zzso nerve indicate that zzso zzso is selectively targeted to zzso zzso and that zzso zzso disappears from these zzso zzso with zzso zzso nerve tracts of the zzso zzso mice exhibit elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso thus is a specific component of zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso may be zzso as a consequence of zzso
