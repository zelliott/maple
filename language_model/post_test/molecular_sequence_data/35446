The role played by seed transmission in the evolution and epidemiology of viral crop pathogens remains zzso We determined the seed infection and vertical transmission rates of zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso in addition to zzso zzso sequencing of nine vertically transmitted zzso zzso We previously determined the zzso transmission rate of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso (a wild zzso to be zzso and zzso observed a similar rate zzso in the subsequent zzso We also observed that the seed infection rate is substantially higher zzso than the zzso transmission rate, suggesting that a major population bottleneck occurs during seed zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, that two thirds of the zzso present in the zzso transmitted zzso population were also present in the vertically transmitted populations implies that the bottleneck at vertical transmission may not be particularly zzso zzso all of the vertically infected plants were zzso in contrast to those infected zzso suggesting that vertical infection may be zzso Although no known zzso determining zzso were observed in the vertically infected samples, the zzso untranslated region was highly zzso with at least 26 different major zzso in this region compared to the two major zzso observed in the zzso transmitted zzso That the regions necessary for zzso transmission are retained in the vertically infected zzso combined with the cryptic nature of vertical infection, suggests that seed transmission may be a significant contributor to the spread of zzso
