In spite of being separated by more than 20 million years of evolution, the zzso and human immune systems share extensive zzso Thus, experimental results obtained with the zzso model may have zzso value for human zzso zzso Challenge of the zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso yields different zzso The zzso animals die approximately 12 days zzso while zzso mice survive zzso A zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso recognized by the zzso strain, is present in cultured zzso and blood zzso We describe here its zzso from zzso The presence of zzso was monitored and a single band was zzso Since the molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso are similar, it was important to determine if these molecules are zzso A complete lack of zzso was observed when the sequence of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were compared with the preliminary sequence of zzso
