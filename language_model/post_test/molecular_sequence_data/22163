zzso tips in scanning zzso zzso can directly detect zzso electron zzso between sample and tip molecules and reveal the zzso zzso through chemical interactions that provide overlap of respective electronic wave functions, that is, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecular tips were prepared by chemical modification of underlying metal tips with zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso to or from a sample zzso zzso We found that the electron zzso between a sample zzso and its complementary zzso molecular tip was much facilitated compared with its zzso zzso The complementary zzso tip was thereby capable of zzso zzso each zzso zzso selective imaging using molecular tips may be coined zzso zzso zzso as its principle goes and is of general significance for novel molecular imaging of chemical identities at the membrane and solid zzso
