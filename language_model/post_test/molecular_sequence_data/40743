In this study, zzso analysis zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene regions was evaluated for the identification of zzso species isolated from Malaysian zzso Overall, the zzso zzso identified zzso of 90 zzso compared to zzso by the zzso zzso With 47 rapidly growing species, the zzso zzso identified fewer zzso species than the zzso zzso zzso but with 23 zzso species the reverse was true zzso identification by the zzso zzso but only zzso by the zzso zzso There were 16 zzso with zzso zzso results, which were resolved by zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence zzso The findings in this study suggest that the zzso zzso is more useful than the zzso zzso for the identification of zzso species, particularly with the zzso members of the zzso In addition, this study reports 5 and 12 novel restriction patterns for inclusion in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
