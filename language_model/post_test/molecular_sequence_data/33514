The zzso orphan nuclear zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso events during zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with enhanced zzso syndrome and related retinal zzso that reveal characteristic excess of zzso zzso This study was undertaken to determine zzso as well as functional consequences of reported sequence zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

Twenty-five different zzso in the zzso zzso expression construct were generated by zzso zzso and performed nuclear zzso zzso zzso promoter activity zzso and zzso in cultured zzso zzso 

Of the 25 zzso zzso 15 zzso at least partially to the zzso Eight of the nine changes in the zzso domain zzso and 12 of the 14 zzso in the zzso domain zzso of zzso exhibited reduced zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso dramatically altered the interaction of zzso with zzso as well as with zzso Two zzso zzso between zzso and zzso showed no effect on any zzso or functional zzso zzso 

These data provide a better understanding of sequence zzso validate zzso zzso and demonstrate the significance of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso These studies contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying retinal zzso caused by zzso zzso
