zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso controls energy balance and food intake through the zzso zzso in the zzso of the brain, which suggests that some zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso might contribute to obesity or zzso zzso In an effort to identify genetic zzso in a potential candidate gene for obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in the Korean population, we have zzso the zzso zzso Thirty-five sequence zzso were identified (including 9 novel zzso 1 single zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region, 1 zzso in the zzso zzso 8 zzso in zzso (3 zzso zzso 23 zzso in zzso 1 zzso in the 3' zzso and 1 zzso in the 3' downstream zzso To investigate possible association of zzso zzso with body mass index zzso and the risk of zzso we zzso for 11 zzso in the Korean population zzso zzso zzso Using statistical zzso no significant associations between the genetic zzso in the zzso gene and the risk of zzso were zzso However, one zzso zzso in zzso 3, zzso zzso A zzso showed marginal association with zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso genetic effects were zzso The present study provides information about additional genetic zzso in zzso and positive associations of those zzso with zzso in the Korean zzso
