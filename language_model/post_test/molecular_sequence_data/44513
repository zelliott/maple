zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 434 zzso protein were assigned using standard zzso zzso methods, and its solution structure determined using zzso distance constraints in distance geometry zzso calculations ultimately refined by restrained molecular dynamics zzso In the 20 best zzso structures, the average zzso backbone and heavy atom zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A, respectively, for the structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-3 and zzso at the zzso and zzso are structurally zzso The region zzso includes five zzso and tight turns which define the zzso core of the zzso The backbone and heavy atom zzso for zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A, respectively, for the zzso versus the crystal structures, but there are significant differences in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for some core zzso zzso zzso experiments confirm that 434 zzso is zzso even at the high zzso zzso 434 zzso folding under zzso solution conditions is two-state as indicated by zzso zzso zzso zzso from circular zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso They yield values for 434 zzso stability which show good correspondence to the free energy for global unfolding determined by zzso hydrogen exchange zzso for the zzso exchanging zzso zzso
