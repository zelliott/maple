zzso proteins in human zzso cancer zzso were analyzed by the zzso with the zzso zzso against zzso zzso followed with zzso In these zzso zzso a zzso protein was abundant in the tumor regions but almost absent in the adjacent normal regions in zzso patients, thus we attempted to purify zzso Using zzso zzso with the zzso zzso followed by gel zzso and zzso approximately 10 zzso of this protein was separated from 34 g of the pooled zzso tissue and transferred onto a zzso zzso The zzso protein was further zzso with zzso zzso I, resulting in several zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of these peptides showed complete sequence identity to those derived from either zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso protein is zzso zzso zzso whose calculated mass is zzso zzso Western zzso using an zzso against zzso zzso revealed the presence of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso derived from the tumor regions, but not from normal zzso In addition, part of zzso zzso zzso (29 zzso was also found in the zzso zzso whose levels were higher in the tumor regions than in the adjacent normal zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso as well as formation of a zzso complex containing zzso and zzso zzso increases in zzso cancer and novel modification of zzso zzso might have a zzso zzso
