zzso are a group of small, zzso zzso proteins found in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of a variety of zzso zzso One such zzso zzso isolated from rabbit zzso has been shown to consist of 33 zzso acids rich in zzso and zzso zzso We have zzso zzso on an zzso zzso Model zzso zzso zzso using zzso chemistry involving zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The linear zzso was folded by air zzso to the biologically active form containing three zzso bonds and zzso by reverse phase zzso The zzso acid sequence of the synthetic zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso weight determination by plasma zzso mass zzso zzso gave a value of zzso in agreement with the expected molecular weight of zzso The biological activity of the synthetic zzso as measured by its zzso activity against several zzso zzso was indistinguishable from that of the natural zzso Also, the CD spectrum was equivalent to that of natural zzso indicating zzso identity of the two zzso
