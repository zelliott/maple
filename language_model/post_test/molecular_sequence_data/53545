The zzso position of five zzso strains isolated from dust, an animal shed, the air inside a museum and soil was investigated using a zzso zzso The growth characteristics were unusual for zzso zzso growth was at temperatures ranging from 2 to 10 degrees zzso After zzso adaptation (5 degrees C zzso to higher temperatures, the strains were also able to grow at 20 degrees zzso Cell wall analyses revealed that the organisms showed a zzso zzso new group zzso zzso zzso zzso according to zzso & zzso (1972), but with zzso instead of zzso All strains contained zzso zzso zzso acids were not zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso were detected in the polar zzso zzso The main fatty acids were zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso as well as an unusual compound identified as zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of DNA was approximately 71 zzso The results of zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that the strains represent a new lineage in the zzso zzso and the family zzso of the order zzso On the basis of these results the new zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, zzso the new species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
