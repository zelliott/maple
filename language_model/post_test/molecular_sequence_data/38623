A zzso zzso whose predicted product is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso was recently discovered during studies of zzso zzso degradation by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso to zzso These compounds are proposed zzso of a series of three reactions that are shared by the pathways of zzso and zzso degradation used by zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso no activity was detected with zzso as a zzso The zzso activity was not sensitive to zzso The zzso has apparent zzso values of 10 and 200 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso raised against zzso zzso identified a zzso protein that was present in zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The active form of the zzso is a zzso zzso was determined to be the first gene in an zzso termed the zzso degradation zzso containing genes required for both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to grow on zzso or zzso but had zzso growth rates on zzso zzso blocked in expression of the entire zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso into the growth medium when given zzso This confirms that zzso is an intermediate of zzso zzso degradation by zzso zzso This compound had previously been shown not to be formed by zzso zzso a zzso zzso that degrades zzso by a zzso that is slightly different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not participate in zzso zzso degradation by zzso zzso and thus may serve as a useful indicator of an zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso
