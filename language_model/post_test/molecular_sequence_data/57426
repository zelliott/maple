zzso zzso is a potent zzso that causes the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso varies considerably among different zzso mouse zzso In particular, the zzso strain is highly zzso whereas the zzso strain is highly resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso mice were established to investigate the genetic basis for the differential zzso of these zzso zzso A strong association between zzso zzso development and coat color was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso progeny such that zzso mice developed a higher tumor zzso than zzso zzso These data suggest that a locus on zzso 7 influences tumor zzso Analysis of four additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 7 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice revealed a significant linkage between high tumor zzso and zzso inheritance of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, inheritance of at least one zzso zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso was associated with protection against zzso zzso zzso There was no association between tumor zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, the data suggest that whereas zzso mice contain a dominant tumor zzso gene on zzso 7, in the zzso strain both zzso at this locus are defective resulting in enhanced zzso to zzso zzso
