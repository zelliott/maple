A zzso clone which contains the near-complete open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by screening a muscle zzso library of zzso zzso zzso a true zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso DNA probe from an internal region of the zzso The zzso zzso clone consists of a zzso zzso which zzso for 309 zzso about zzso of the original zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso region of 167 zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso was achieved by sequencing the zzso region of the zzso protein completing the missing part in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso sequences exhibit a high degree of zzso to other zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene was studied in skeletal muscle and liver of zzso and zzso zzso both on the zzso level by Northern zzso zzso using the zzso clone as a probe and on the protein level by Western zzso zzso using an zzso raised against muscle zzso A clear decrease (about zzso in the amount of zzso zzso a single zzso transcript, was observed in muscle of zzso zzso when compared with the same tissue from the zzso zzso This zzso level decrease directly zzso with a reduction in both protein amount and specific activity in crude protein zzso In contrast, both zzso protein and zzso zzso levels remained unchanged in liver from zzso and zzso zzso although the zzso activity was also about zzso lower in the zzso zzso These result, together with previous data obtained from protein studies zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso is regulated by different mechanisms during hibernation in these zzso that is, at zzso level in muscle and at zzso level in zzso The reduced zzso activity should result in both cases in a decrease of the zzso flux that would eventually contribute to the dramatic zzso depression of this dormant zzso
