An zzso coli zzso DNA zzso cloned on a zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso acid, and a number of other toxic zzso The sequence of the cloned zzso locus located at minute zzso of the zzso revealed two open reading zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a highly zzso zzso zzso with 14 potential zzso to span the inner zzso The zzso is zzso to zzso a zzso pump from zzso zzso and belongs to a gene family that includes zzso pumps of zzso bacteria and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso containing a single zzso domain and a large zzso zzso zzso An active zzso to the C domain suggested that zzso is a membrane zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased sensitivity of cells to zzso The cellular content of zzso increased in the order: zzso zzso cells greater than wild type greater than zzso
