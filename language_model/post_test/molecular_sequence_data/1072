zzso zzso zzso zzso currents play important roles in both zzso and cardiac zzso zzso channels form the basis of these currents in many zzso and cardiac zzso and their mechanism of zzso appears to differ significantly from that reported for Shaker and zzso zzso In most channel gating models, zzso is coupled to the zzso of zzso zzso there is a need for a rigorous model based on comprehensive experimental data on zzso channel zzso To develop a gating model of zzso channel zzso we studied the properties of zzso channels in zzso zzso without zzso zzso ancillary zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp and zzso zzso clamp zzso We obtained zzso resolution zzso of the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and well described by a fourth power exponential zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso time zzso was best described by a zzso function corresponding to at least two different equivalent charges for zzso zzso zzso are zzso dependent and zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso channels such as zzso and zzso we found that elevated zzso zzso modulated the zzso process by slowing zzso and stabilizing the open zzso Using these data we developed a model with five closed states and zzso transitions between the first four closed states coupled to a zzso transition between the final closed zzso zzso state and the open zzso Our model closely simulates zzso and kinetic zzso and zzso zzso
