Recent studies provide evidence that zzso is involved in regulating zzso as well as zzso of various human zzso however, its role in the zzso machinery is not fully zzso Here we describe that the central domain containing zzso region in zzso named CD, is a pivotal zzso domain to induce zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso domain or zzso domain in zzso did not significantly affect zzso activity, whereas transient zzso of the high mobility group box or the zzso region zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the CD construct zzso zzso revealed the zzso activity comparable to that of zzso zzso approximately zzso of cell zzso Our data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso can be zzso from its zzso zzso and is zzso through its zzso
