Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso activity was specifically induced in media containing zzso or zzso zzso cell walls as sole carbon zzso zzso analysis showed that the three genes were zzso zzso The expression of the zzso and zzso genes was triggered by zzso zzso cell walls and zzso whereas zzso zzso their zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso was not triggered by zzso zzso cell walls and zzso suggesting a different role for this zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes showed to be zzso to zzso 42 and 37 zzso zzso genes from other zzso zzso while no zzso gene for the zzso gene was zzso Three genetically modified zzso of zzso zzso were made by disruption of the zzso genes via zzso transformation and their zzso activity was zzso While in zzso zzso showed no significant difference in zzso efficacy between the zzso and the zzso the real time zzso analysis showed that disruption of each zzso gene affected the activity of zzso zzso during interaction with zzso zzso in liquid zzso
