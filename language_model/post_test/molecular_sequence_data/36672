Experimental zzso zzso is an zzso inflammation of the zzso and zzso zzso Such inflammation can be induced in eyes of experimental animals by zzso them with retinal zzso This animal model of zzso closely resembles idiopathic zzso in humans and lends itself zzso for the study of mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso and for the evaluation of methods used to control or prevent zzso zzso zzso In this study we used the retinal proteins zzso zzso zzso binding protein and some synthetic peptides of zzso to zzso the immune response of Lewis zzso Following zzso these animals did not develop zzso when challenged with the retinal zzso The discovery of small, zzso peptides of retinal zzso that zzso the immune response has relevance in developing strategies for immune intervention in human zzso
