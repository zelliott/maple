To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of zzso editing, we have characterized the low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which displays a high zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso is reflected in reduced levels of zzso II zzso zzso In zzso protein labeling showed that synthesis rates of the zzso reaction center protein zzso were lower, and turnover rates of zzso core proteins higher, than in zzso zzso The assembly of newly zzso proteins into zzso occurs in the zzso zzso but with reduced efficiency compared with the wild zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of the zzso repeat zzso In zzso zzso editing of zzso that converts zzso to zzso is specifically zzso Thus, zzso is specifically required for editing the zzso transcripts in zzso and the zzso acid zzso due to lack of editing strongly affects the efficiency of the assembly of zzso zzso
