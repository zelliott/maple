zzso prediction methods have been used to establish a domain structure for the zzso calcium channel beta zzso zzso One domain was identified from zzso searches as an zzso domain, whilst another was zzso using zzso zzso to be similar to zzso zzso zzso This domain structure suggested zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein family, and that the zzso domain of the beta zzso might be similar to a zzso zzso zzso model structures have been constructed for these three zzso The zzso of the zzso are consistent with functional properties and zzso zzso of the zzso and provide a basis for understanding its zzso zzso
