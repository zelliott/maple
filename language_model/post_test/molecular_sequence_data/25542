Using synthetic zzso we have identified two distinct regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Rich in zzso zzso that inhibit cell zzso One of these sites also contributes to the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso recognizing an zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when peptides were added to newly zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso and a zzso corresponding to the zzso terminal zzso domain zzso zzso inhibited cell spreading in a zzso zzso These peptides exhibited zzso activity at zzso from zzso to 1 zzso The ability of peptides zzso and zzso to zzso cell shape was zzso by an inhibitor of protein synthesis and was blocked by specific zzso zzso In addition to blocking cell zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso and exhibited differential affinity for zzso zzso molecules in zzso binding zzso The binding of zzso zzso to zzso components was zzso and displayed zzso similar to those of native zzso These studies demonstrate that both zzso activity and affinity for zzso are functions of unique regions within the zzso zzso acid zzso The finding that two separate regions of the zzso protein contribute to its zzso activity lead us to propose that multiple regions of the protein act in concert to regulate the interactions of cells with their zzso zzso
