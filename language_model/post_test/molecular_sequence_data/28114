The temperate zzso zzso like its relative zzso zzso its zzso into a specific site in the bacterial zzso during zzso and zzso it after zzso However, we find that the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso they use different bacterial sites, and neither promotes efficient zzso or zzso of the other zzso zzso In order to determine the basis for this difference in zzso we zzso the zzso elements that are involved in zzso and zzso and compared them to the corresponding zzso zzso The location, orientation, size and overall arrangement of the zzso and zzso genes and the zzso attachment sites are nearly identical in the two zzso as is common for other functionally related elements in zzso zzso The zzso proteins of the two zzso are functionally zzso and their predicted zzso acid sequences differ by but one zzso In contrast, the two zzso proteins are not functionally zzso and their zzso although similar, differ at many zzso These sequence differences are not zzso zzso the zzso 55 zzso are completely zzso but the remaining zzso show a pattern of differences zzso with identities and conservative zzso These findings imply that the specificity difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a consequence of the inability of the respective zzso proteins to recognize pairs of zzso attachment zzso The two zzso attachment sites are remarkably similar, especially the two zzso zzso which in zzso contain binding sites for zzso zzso and integration host zzso They are less similar in the segment between the two arms, which in zzso contains the points of zzso strand exchange and a second class of binding site for zzso protein (the zzso zzso The two bacterial attachment sites are quite different, although both have a short stretch of perfect zzso with their respective zzso partners at the points of strand zzso We propose that the two zzso proteins recognize similar or identical sites in the arms of their zzso attachment sites, and that differences in binding or action at the zzso sites is responsible for the divergent zzso zzso experiments and sequence comparisons suggest that both proteins recognize different but overlapping families of zzso sites, and that divergence in specificity has been achieved by an alternating succession of small, mutually compatible changes in protein and zzso
