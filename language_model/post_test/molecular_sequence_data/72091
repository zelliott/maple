We present a systematic structure comparison of three major classes of zzso snake zzso which include short and long chain zzso zzso plus one zzso toxin of black zzso snake zzso Two novel zzso zzso isolated from Taiwan zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing distinct primary sequences and different zzso zzso were taken as zzso for short and long chain zzso and compared with the major lethal zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso based on the derived three-dimensional structure of this toxin in solution by zzso zzso A structure comparison among these two zzso and zzso toxin zzso as zzso was carried out by the zzso prediction together with computer zzso based on multiple sequence alignment of their primary sequences and established zzso structures of zzso and zzso It is of interest to find that upon zzso zzso of these modeled three-dimensional zzso zzso distinct differences in the overall zzso flexibility and interior zzso between these toxins can be detected along the three zzso zzso zzso which may reflect some intrinsic differences in the surface zzso of several zzso zzso segments present on the surface zzso of these toxin molecules as revealed by zzso zzso Construction of a zzso tree for these structurally related and functionally distinct toxins corroborates that all long and short toxins present in diverse snake families are zzso related to each other, supposedly derived from an ancestral zzso by gene zzso and subsequent zzso zzso leading to divergence of multiple zzso toxin zzso
