zzso zzso activity is required in maintaining late zzso membrane zzso zzso is a dual specificity zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso and unidentified zzso protein zzso To determine which of these activities zzso versus protein zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso we analyzed a double zzso zzso These zzso in the putative zzso zzso loop nearly completely zzso the zzso zzso activity without any significant effect on the protein zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced a dramatic zzso effect in the form of zzso swelling and zzso In addition, the zzso specificity of zzso was modified by introducing single zzso in zzso or zzso This yielded proteins with zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of which only the zzso zzso induced the characteristic zzso defects upon cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso into cells demonstrated a selective ability of zzso zzso to correct the zzso defects induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso production by zzso is crucial for zzso integrity, and zzso most likely directs the zzso interactions with the zzso group in zzso zzso
