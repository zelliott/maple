We report the identification and characterization of the gene zzso the eighth and final human zzso zzso of the highly diversified zzso A zzso The zzso 8 gene is linked to seven other zzso A zzso genes on zzso zzso It is expressed prominently in the zzso but is not detected in any other zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso 7 is the closest relative of zzso 8 and that the pair likely resulted from a recent gene zzso event in zzso Further analysis reveals that the zzso 8 gene has incorporated zzso zzso at an elevated rate zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso 8 genes from 6 of 10 zzso species examined have been zzso by zzso deletions or point zzso at crucial structural or zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso human zzso 8 is among the lowest of members of this zzso and it exhibits neither zzso nor zzso activities characteristic of some other zzso A zzso The rapid evolution, zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso 8 suggest a unique zzso function and reiterates the evolutionary plasticity of the zzso A zzso
