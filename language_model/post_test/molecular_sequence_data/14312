zzso zzso causes enormous economic losses to zzso production worldwide by colonizing the zzso zzso in the zzso respiratory zzso resulting in widespread damage to the zzso zzso prolonged zzso reduced weight gain, and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso and while the zzso 400 zzso display significant sequence identity to the archetype zzso zzso zzso the remainder of the zzso is novel and displays unusual zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso is zzso zzso into three major fragments identified here as zzso zzso and zzso that reside on the cell zzso zzso zzso with tandem mass zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso that delineated a major zzso site in zzso zzso occurred at the zzso zzso within sequence zzso consistent with a zzso motif resembling zzso recently identified in zzso and other zzso family zzso zzso surface proteins recovered by zzso zzso and separated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso that mimic zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and shown to bind zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso relevant zzso zzso versions of zzso generated from zzso zzso strain J and 232 sequences strongly bind zzso zzso and the removal of their respective zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduces this zzso These data reveal that zzso is an extensively zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with variable zzso efficiency provides a mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates protein zzso 

zzso used to control zzso zzso infection provide only partial zzso zzso of the zzso families are highly zzso functionally redundant molecules that are zzso of zzso that generate zzso zzso fragments on the cell zzso We show that zzso displays a zzso structure consisting of an N zzso which shares sequence identity with zzso and novel central and zzso zzso zzso is zzso processed at multiple sites, generating at least nine fragments on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso events occurred at zzso sites generating zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins designed to mimic the major zzso fragments bind zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso processing events at multiple sites and with differential processing efficiency, generating zzso diversity on the surface of zzso zzso
