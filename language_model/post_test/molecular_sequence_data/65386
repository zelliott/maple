zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso is a zzso protein recently shown to zzso with the C zzso of zzso and be required for zzso cell zzso zzso is not zzso to any known signaling zzso and how it mediates zzso signals is not zzso To provide a molecular basis for understanding zzso function, we have determined and report here the zzso crystal structure of human zzso and show it be zzso to class III zzso zzso zzso a structural class that now includes a zzso protein of unknown zzso No metal binding or zzso activity can be detected for zzso but zzso does bind directly to a specific zzso zzso encompassing zzso using its vestigial zzso active zzso zzso thus represents a new class of zzso zzso
