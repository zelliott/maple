We have demonstrated that targeted zzso can be accomplished in zzso plants by zzso zzso and subsequent elimination of an zzso in the progeny of genetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso system was used to zzso and zzso activate the previously integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and/or developing zzso An artificial zzso recognition sequence integrated into zzso DNA was analyzed for zzso to indicate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso site occurred in about zzso of analyzed F1 zzso Short deletions centered on the zzso zzso break were the zzso genetic zzso observed in the F1 zzso The zzso expression cassette was not detected in the zzso F1 plants and their zzso However, the original zzso were faithfully transmitted to the next generation indicating that the zzso occurred early during the F1 plant zzso The procedure offers simultaneous production of zzso breaks and delivery of DNA template combined with a large number of progeny plants for future gene targeting zzso
