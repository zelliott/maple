zzso zzso is an important oral zzso pathogen involved in zzso and systemic zzso Studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso and zzso have been limited by lack of systems for efficient genetic zzso zzso were isolated from eight strains of zzso zzso The smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized and used to create new zzso for zzso genetic zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso zzso a putative autonomous rolling circle replication protein zzso an zzso predicted to zzso a protein zzso to members of the zzso cell zzso segregation protein family, and an zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso addiction system zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso replication region in a zzso zzso The zzso rep gene is not present in this fragment, suggesting that zzso can replicate in zzso independently of the zzso zzso A zzso compact zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso was constructed and found to be compatible with a previously described zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso of the zzso putative addiction system zzso reduced zzso stability in zzso indicating its addiction properties and suggesting it to be the first zzso addiction system described for zzso zzso its genetic zzso and its shuttle zzso derivatives can serve as useful tools for investigating zzso properties important in zzso ecology and zzso
