zzso markers for zzso zzso an important medicinal zzso were developed and characterized to promote genetic and molecular zzso 

A zzso zzso library was constructed from an zzso from zzso Roughly zzso of the 768 clones of the enriched library contained zzso Eighty sequences containing zzso were obtained from 96 positive zzso zzso zzso were designed for 20 zzso and 17 of them displayed zzso when screened across 17 zzso zzso zzso with an average of zzso zzso per zzso The observed and expected zzso values averaged zzso and zzso zzso 

This is the first report constructing an enriched zzso library and identifying zzso markers from zzso zzso These 17 zzso zzso markers are a useful resource for this plant, zzso for diversity studies, pedigree zzso and genetic zzso
