During annual medical monitoring, some firefighters are found to have rates of decline in forced zzso volume in one second zzso far exceeding their zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso and single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene may zzso variable zzso to more rapid decline in lung zzso In zzso firefighters with at least six annual zzso zzso increased age and greater initial zzso were associated with more rapid decline in lung zzso DNA collected from zzso of these firefighters was screened for zzso zzso at zzso zzso 919, zzso and zzso A statistically significant difference in decline in lung function was found based on zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso regulating lung inflammation may help to explain some of the variation in rate of decline in lung function in zzso
