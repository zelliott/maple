A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated and the three zzso were zzso to zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was determined by automatic zzso zzso The pet genes of zzso zzso coding for the three zzso of the zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso using zzso specific for zzso regions of the zzso from other organisms and a zzso probe derived from the genes for the complex of zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is described which includes the pet genes and three additional unidentified open reading zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the isolated zzso was used for the identification of the three zzso The genes zzso the zzso are organized as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein sequences with the protein sequences deduced from the zzso sequence showed that only zzso zzso is processed during transport and assembly of the three zzso of the zzso Only the zzso zzso of the zzso protein is zzso zzso The similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the three zzso to the corresponding zzso of other organisms is described and implications for structural features of the zzso are zzso
