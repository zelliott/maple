zzso zzso is member of the zzso zzso of zzso genes that has a zzso 60 zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso is an important determining factor in the binding of the protein to specific DNA zzso zzso specificity for the zzso protein has not been determined zzso zzso We have employed a rapid affinity zzso method to determine optimal DNA binding sequences for the 109 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the entire zzso terminal region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have zzso weak zzso activity that has been attributed to the zzso zzso at positions 2 and 3 in the zzso arm of the zzso The presence of the zzso zzso terminal region negated the influence of the zzso zzso and facilitated zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences bound to the zzso zzso column were separated from a random pool of zzso sequences by zzso zzso and enriched by zzso chain zzso zzso sequences were identified on zzso and 3' of a zzso core, extending the binding site to zzso zzso zzso and specificity of optimal zzso sequence for zzso zzso were determined by equilibrium and kinetic zzso zzso zzso constant zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso M and the zzso zzso complex has a half life zzso of zzso zzso zzso A molecular model of zzso zzso interaction based on the X-ray coordinates of zzso zzso complex has revealed novel interactions of key zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
