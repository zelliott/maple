Despite their relatively zzso zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of structural zzso Indeed, the primary structure of these zzso zzso zzso nuclear basic proteins zzso is not random and is the depository of important zzso zzso This appears to be the result of their fast rate of evolution driven by positive zzso The way by which the protein zzso zzso in the transitions that lead to the final highly condensed zzso organization of zzso at the end of zzso is not clearly zzso In this paper we focus on the transient zzso patterning that occurs in either a zzso step or an inversion step during early and zzso This takes place in a small subset of zzso in internally zzso species of zzso zzso and zzso It involves zzso zzso that are zzso zzso or undergo side chain modification (such as zzso or zzso bond zzso during the zzso zzso zzso features of such zzso as observed in zzso zzso include: constancy of the dominant pattern repeat distance zzso despite dynamic changes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso orientation either perpendicular or parallel to the nuclear zzso This supports the hypothesis that liquid - liquid phase separation by the mechanism of zzso decomposition may be occurring during zzso in these zzso zzso decomposition involves long wave fluctuations of the local concentration with a low energy barrier and thus differs from the mechanism of nucleation and growth that is known to occur during zzso in internally zzso zzso
