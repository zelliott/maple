We have developed a duplex real-time zzso for the rapid diagnosis of zzso zzso infection from zzso clinical samples with the simultaneous determination of zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso gene target and a zzso binding protein zzso zzso gene target in zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be sensitive zzso zzso zzso per zzso and specific for the detection of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was validated by comparing zzso zzso results with zzso data for 27 zzso zzso zzso All 5 zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso real-time zzso negative, as were 9 of the 10 zzso with zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso One isolate with a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso gave an zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso Twelve zzso were zzso susceptible zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso real-time zzso zzso These data were used to establish an zzso for the interpretation of zzso zzso from the duplex zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso results were also compared to an established zzso zzso length zzso zzso method previously applied to these 27 zzso and 46 zzso clinical samples zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso results were seen for four zzso and six zzso clinical samples, as zzso could not reliably detect zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso We report prospective application of the duplex zzso zzso to the diagnosis of zzso zzso infection from 200 zzso clinical specimens sent to the laboratory for diagnostic zzso zzso zzso gene zzso One hundred six were negative in the duplex zzso zzso were zzso zzso positive, and 70 of these were also zzso zzso positive and interpreted as zzso zzso Fourteen were zzso zzso negative and interpreted as having reduced zzso to zzso For the remaining 10 samples, zzso to zzso was not zzso
