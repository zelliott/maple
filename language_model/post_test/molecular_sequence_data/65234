zzso DNA zzso zzso are an important cause of human zzso Most zzso zzso are found in zzso in which the proportion of zzso zzso zzso species is believed to explain some of the observed high zzso zzso However, zzso zzso also observe zzso zzso which may be in part due to zzso low levels of zzso In the present report, we have developed two zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for reliably and accurately detecting low-level zzso zzso Using these zzso we have identified a zzso family segregating two zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso and a new zzso zzso in the zzso b gene zzso Both zzso zzso zzso are transmitted through generations in a random manner, thus showing differences in zzso load between siblings within the zzso In addition, the developed zzso were also used to screen a group of deaf subjects of unknown zzso for the presence of zzso for both zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso samples, previously considered as zzso and two deaf subjects carrying zzso zzso were identified, thus confirming the high specificity and reliability of the zzso The development of zzso for reliably detecting low-level zzso together with the study of zzso zzso transmission, are essential steps for a better knowledge and clinical management of zzso zzso
