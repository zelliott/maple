A new gene of zzso zzso designated zzso was characterized and shown to regulate the expression of several genes which zzso zzso required for the zzso of zzso Unlike the wild type, a zzso zzso created by zzso point zzso cannot zzso zzso as a nitrogen zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso cluster motif near its zzso followed by a putative zzso zzso A chemical zzso experiment demonstrated that zzso forms zzso zzso binds to zzso elements located in the upstream promoter region of four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that a functional zzso protein is required for induction of zzso which encodes zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was required for induction of three different zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso occur in the zzso region of zzso and at least one of the zzso regions is required for zzso function, suggesting that they might play a role in zzso zzso The zzso protein does not interact with the zzso zzso protein or the zzso zzso protein that functions in nitrogen zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene and synthesis of zzso zzso is completely dependent upon zzso but does not require the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it is controlled by a novel regulatory zzso
