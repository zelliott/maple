A zzso bank of zzso zzso DNA was obtained in zzso coli after zzso of partially zzso zzso zzso DNA in the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso The bank was used to perform zzso experiments with zzso coli zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso shared three adjacent zzso fragments of zzso zzso and 14 zzso Two of these zzso also zzso zzso and carried an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso regions were more precisely localized using zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso fragment, cloned into zzso in both zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso This zzso was zzso and an open reading frame zzso of 852 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence was compared with that of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from nine zzso species and to the zzso part of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso varied from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the region upstream from zzso zzso zzso was determined and revealed the presence of an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a 409 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was similar to the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from six zzso species and to the zzso part of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This high conservation supports the hypothesis of a common zzso for the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are transcribed in the same direction, are separated by a 37 zzso zzso zzso Immediately upstream from zzso the 3' end of an zzso zzso to zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso was zzso As the zzso region was located upstream from the zzso zzso region, the organization of zzso genes in the zzso might thus be zzso Such an organization resembles that of enteric zzso in which the zzso genes are grouped in a single zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not zzso in contrast with what is found in most zzso
