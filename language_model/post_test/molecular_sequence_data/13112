zzso networks are intimately involved in several zzso processes which zzso the harmonious development of the zzso zzso Recent genetic evidence has demonstrated that the minor types V and zzso collagen are key regulators of types I and II zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso A comprehensive understanding of the expression and regulation of the genes coding for the chains of the minor collagen types is therefore relevant to animal zzso and zzso The present study was undertaken to zzso the embryonic pattern of expression of the gene coding for the mouse alpha 1 chain of type zzso zzso zzso using the technique of in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene were detected as early as 11 days of zzso The alpha zzso transcripts were found to accumulate mostly in zzso zzso such as the zzso and the developing zzso Like the major zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso expression was also noted in the zzso of the zzso However, alpha zzso transcripts accumulated in several other zzso zzso They include zzso zzso bones, zzso valve of the heart, the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso Altogether, the data confirm that zzso has a broader spectrum of expression than previously zzso This finding raises the possibility that the alpha zzso chain may participate in the formation of zzso and zzso zzso with distinct functional zzso
