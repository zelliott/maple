zzso zzso zzso zzso play important, highly dynamic roles in zzso Currently about 90 different zzso genes have been zzso The zzso are highly regulated at all levels of zzso and it is becoming increasingly clear that zzso specificity of the zzso zzso zzso proper contributes considerably to zzso zzso To investigate zzso zzso zzso we have set up a procedure to generate zzso libraries that presents randomized, zzso zzso zzso that expressed suitable zzso were selected by zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso After multiple rounds of selection, positive clones were confirmed by zzso analysis, zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified distinct consensus zzso motifs for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results confirm zzso specificity for individual zzso at the zzso zzso Such consensus sequences may be useful both for identifying potential zzso zzso and for the development of zzso zzso
