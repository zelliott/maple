zzso zzso is an obligatory zzso zzso zzso A gene from this zzso designated zzso has been cloned in zzso coli as part of a zzso zzso gene zzso This gene produces a zzso zzso that shows both zzso and zzso activities on test zzso and is able to degrade zzso cellulose to zzso The sequence of zzso has zzso with both zzso and zzso described by zzso It appears to have a central domain without zzso activity which is joined to the zzso zzso by runs of zzso acids rich in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso activity is located in the zzso domain of the zzso and that zzso activity is located in the zzso zzso There are internal zzso and zzso start sites within the zzso The intact gene has been cloned into a zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that zzso produced a protein with a molecular weight of zzso to zzso A number of smaller proteins with activity against zzso cellulose and zzso zzso were also zzso These are believed to be the result of alternative zzso start sites and/or zzso degradation products of the translated gene zzso
