Plant family 1 zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of a plethora of zzso natural zzso In zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso genes have been zzso The zzso zzso structures of four plant zzso have recently been zzso Despite low sequence zzso the zzso show a highly zzso secondary and zzso zzso The sugar zzso and sugar donor zzso of zzso are zzso in the zzso formed between the zzso and zzso zzso Several regions of the primary sequence contribute to the formation of the zzso binding pocket including structurally zzso zzso as well as loop regions differing both with respect to their zzso acid sequence and sequence zzso In this review we provide a detailed analysis of the available plant zzso crystal structures to reveal structural features determining zzso zzso The high zzso structural conservation of the plant zzso render zzso modeling an attractive tool for structure zzso The accuracy and utility of zzso structures obtained by zzso modeling are discussed and quantitative assessments of model quality are performed by modeling of a plant zzso for which the zzso crystal structure is zzso We conclude that zzso modeling offers a high degree of zzso zzso in zzso modeling are also apparent with modeling of loop regions remaining as a particularly difficult zzso
