A transformation system utilizing zzso zzso was developed for targeted gene disruption in zzso zzso a zzso pathogen that causes brown rot disease of stone zzso Transformation with a zzso containing the zzso zzso II zzso cassette flanked with 4 zzso zzso gene zzso zzso sequences resulted in an average of 13 zzso per zzso zzso When zzso by zzso and DNA zzso zzso more than 50% of the zzso recovered had integrated in the targeted zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso carried direct zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso zzso revealed that 26 zzso of the zzso right border were missing at the junctions between direct repeats in all zzso The zzso event during zzso zzso integration in this fungus was unlike that reported in zzso transformation in zzso
