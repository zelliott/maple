The zzso receptors zzso and zzso (formerly zzso and zzso form a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso and bind similar DNA zzso however, they are unable to activate gene zzso in response to zzso We have used zzso zzso analysis to map the zzso zzso locus to zzso 19 and zzso to mouse zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we have mapped the human zzso gene to zzso zzso and the human zzso gene to zzso zzso In addition, we report the isolation of a processed human zzso zzso mapping to zzso zzso To our knowledge, this represents the first report of a zzso associated with a member of the nuclear zzso zzso
