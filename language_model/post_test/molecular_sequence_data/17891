zzso of transformed zzso actively involved in zzso zzso degradation have been examined for initial zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso virus transformed chick zzso zzso zzso in contrast to transformed zzso cells, produce active, two chain zzso zzso zzso zzso Active zzso is found in zzso zzso zzso medium from zzso cultures as determined by two independent methods, zzso and differential zzso zzso zzso cultures zzso and zzso zzso single chain zzso zzso which is converted to zzso in a time dependent manner by a zzso mechanism that appears to involve a functioning zzso zzso on the surface of intact zzso The zzso activity responsible for this conversion may represent the initiating zzso event in the zzso zzso zzso cascade zzso A 70 zzso zzso capable of degrading zzso collagen following its zzso also is significantly elevated in zzso cultures over that of normal zzso Trace amounts of the active 62 zzso form of the zzso zzso is found in the transformed zzso cultures indicating that these cultures produce a natural zzso of the zzso zzso and/or PA do not appear to be the zzso of this zzso as determined by indirect zzso zzso and direct zzso employing zzso zzso The possible central position of pro PA and the 70 zzso zzso in an zzso complex zzso cascade system involved in zzso zzso degradation is zzso
