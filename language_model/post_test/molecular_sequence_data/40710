The zzso zzso communities in the zzso zzso zzso album and in its zzso zzso zzso were compared to reveal the zzso distribution patterns in their zzso The ITS zzso of 208 zzso zzso strains was zzso and a newly designed process was applied for assigning zzso names to the obtained zzso Furthermore, the zzso were grouped as zzso by subjecting a sequence similarity zzso to various cluster zzso the results of which were compared and verified by data from zzso zzso In contrast to a previously reported dominance of zzso among zzso inhabiting zzso the zzso communities of the two host plant species studied here were dominated by zzso zzso This is in accordance with the finding that host selectivity was only a minor factor in explaining the distribution patterns of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and, probably, tissue selectivity had a more pronounced zzso The composition and condition of the woods in the zzso however, are concluded to be the major zzso due to the following circumstantial zzso The highest similarities in zzso community compositions were found for the leaves of the two host plant species, especially when considering only the older zzso The finding that the inhabitants of matured or zzso zzso are less zzso is in accordance with decreasing zzso capabilities of zzso host plant tissue and an increased zzso supply for zzso zzso zzso the composition of the zzso communities in zzso leaves seems to be predominantly ascribed to contagious spread and to depend on the spectrum of nearby zzso zzso zzso We suggest that because a broad range of suitable zzso for zzso was present in immediate vicinity of the study sites, these zzso also dominated among the recorded zzso zzso
