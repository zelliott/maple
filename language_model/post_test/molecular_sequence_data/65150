In zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso with different zzso functions and gene regulation, catalyze identical reactions in zzso zzso It is still not understood why there are multiple forms of zzso zzso in the same cell type and when the evolutionary zzso of the zzso gene zzso Here we report the structure of two genes zzso for zzso zzso in the coral zzso zzso the first zzso zzso from which a zzso was zzso Both genes are about 20 zzso in size and consist of nine zzso zzso boundaries are well zzso between coral and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso trade mark zzso number zzso and the novel zzso share zzso sequence identity in the coding regions and less than zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both zzso genes are zzso in coral cells, although the zzso level of zzso is 2 orders of magnitude higher than zzso zzso of both coral genes in zzso cells gave functional proteins with similar zzso zzso By data base analyses we also detected and constructed different pairs of zzso genes from the primitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two gene pairs zzso proteins with 50% zzso and only zzso zzso sequence zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso gene pairs do not zzso to zzso zzso and zzso and are consistent with zzso of the zzso gene having occurred independently in zzso zzso and zzso It is evident that due to the importance and complexity of its regulatory role, zzso has multiple zzso in all organisms known to express it, and the genes zzso for the zzso may to be regulated zzso
