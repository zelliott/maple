zzso heat is detected by several classes of zzso sensory zzso that differ in their zzso response zzso The cloned zzso zzso also known as the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso channel that has been proposed to mediate responses of zzso sensory zzso to moderate zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso is also activated by zzso indicating that it may participate in the detection of noxious zzso and chemical stimuli in zzso Here we identify a structurally related zzso zzso that does not respond to zzso acid or moderate zzso Instead, zzso is activated by high temperatures, with a threshold of approximately 52 degrees zzso Within sensory zzso zzso is most prominently expressed by a subset of zzso to zzso zzso making it a candidate zzso for zzso zzso heat responses in this class of zzso zzso transcripts are not restricted to the sensory nervous system, indicating that this channel may be activated by stimuli other than zzso We propose that responses to noxious heat involve these zzso but zzso zzso zzso that together detect a range of stimulus zzso
