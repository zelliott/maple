The zzso collecting zzso are responsible for zzso of zzso into the urine and play a major regulatory role in zzso zzso of zzso There are several factors which affect zzso zzso including zzso K zzso and zzso zzso We have cloned a complementary DNA zzso a zzso channel of the rabbit zzso cortical collecting zzso cells zzso zzso is a zzso pH sensitive zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso and zzso having two zzso zzso This channel is located not only in the zzso membrane of the collecting duct but also in the vascular smooth muscles of the several zzso The expression of zzso is regulated by external pH but neither by zzso nor by zzso concentration in cultured zzso Thus zzso seems to be a unique and distinct from zzso channels in that it is regulated specifically by changes in ambient zzso contributing to the pH dependent urinary zzso zzso
