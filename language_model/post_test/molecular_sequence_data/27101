zzso zzso zzso zzso species such as zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso are used as zzso or zzso and can also be zzso by soil zzso or algae through As zzso The mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso remains zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is taken up by rice zzso zzso roots through two silicon zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso Here we investigated whether these two zzso also mediate the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was partly reduced to zzso zzso in rice roots, but only zzso was zzso to zzso zzso was stable in zzso The rice zzso zzso lost about zzso and 50% of the zzso capacity for zzso and zzso respectively, compared with the zzso rice, whereas zzso zzso had little zzso The short-term zzso zzso of zzso can be described by a zzso plus linear model, with the wild type having zzso higher zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were linear with the slope being zzso higher in the wild type than the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso but not zzso possibly because of a very limited zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso rice was increased as the pH of the medium zzso consistent with an increasing proportion of the zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso As in rice zzso
