zzso zzso zzso are often flanked by zzso or zzso because they keep their zzso parts in the zzso and their charged groups in the polar zzso Here we examine the relevance of this so-called zzso of a zzso zzso acid, which is zzso in the outer zzso of small viral zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is not mandatory for zzso because zzso can be replaced by most of the natural zzso acids without any corruption of zzso Two similar channels, zzso and zzso lack a zzso zzso and zzso of their equivalent zzso zzso acids zzso their zzso To understand the variable importance of the zzso zzso zzso we zzso molecular dynamics simulations of zzso and zzso truncated zzso the truncated zzso mimic zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed with respect to membrane positioning in relation to the orientation of zzso The results indicate that the architecture of the protein (including the selectivity zzso is only zzso dependent on zzso length and zzso of zzso The penetration depth of zzso in a given zzso state is independent of the zzso architecture, which leads to a distortion of shorter zzso The data imply that zzso can be important for zzso zzso however, its significance depends on the architecture of the entire zzso The observation that the most severe zzso zzso causes the outer zzso to move toward the zzso side suggests that zzso becomes more relevant if zzso are not stabilized in the membrane by other zzso
