Human cells express cell surface complement regulatory molecules that inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or inhibit the membrane attack complex zzso A single zzso that zzso both the zzso activity and formation of the membrane attack complex has never been zzso To this end, we have developed two zzso zzso complement zzso zzso zzso and DC, zzso that contain the functional zzso of zzso accelerating factor zzso zzso and zzso Cell surface expression of the CD and DC zzso proteins was detected with zzso and zzso zzso Cell surface zzso deposition was inhibited on cells expressing the zzso zzso thereby indicating that the zzso zzso was functional in both zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that only the DC zzso retained zzso zzso zzso the DC zzso represents a novel potent zzso zzso complement inhibitor that retains the functional zzso of two distinct complement regulatory zzso
