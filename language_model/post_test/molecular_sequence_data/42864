zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso zzso a potent dominant zzso product, forms a specific complex with the human zzso protein zzso a cellular growth zzso We have used a zzso zzso fusion protein zzso in combination with extracts from a line of zzso human lung cells zzso zzso to develop a simple, zzso zzso to rapidly screen for competitive zzso of zzso zzso We illustrate the use of the zzso by demonstrating that several short peptides containing the signature zzso zzso can inhibit zzso complex zzso In contrast, peptides containing the related zzso zzso including two peptides derived from the zzso factor zzso are inactive in this zzso These results show that zzso cannot substitute for zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso will facilitate the identification of agents that are zzso of zzso complex formation and that might exert effects on cellular growth zzso
