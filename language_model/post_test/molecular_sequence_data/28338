zzso The availability of short zzso acid sequences of the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso has made it possible to separate the zzso characteristics of the parent zzso from its zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments are zzso zzso an analog of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments that do not evoke zzso zzso yet clearly affect both the development and zzso of peripheral zzso zzso Early zzso administration of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso development of the immature zzso increasing the zzso strength of the zzso muscle and inducing more rapid muscle zzso zzso strength and motor activity are zzso these are all changes indicative of more rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment elicits a more complex pattern of response since administration early in gestation zzso zzso zzso zzso development whereas later administration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides have a similar accelerating effect on the zzso of the developing zzso zzso At two weeks of age, nerve zzso is conspicuously increased by zzso administration of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso as is nerve terminal branching within the zzso zzso However, this is preceded by an initial depression of nerve branching in the zzso rat zzso We conclude that while the developing zzso system is sensitive to zzso zzso this zzso is zzso The crucial role of these peptides may be limited to very brief, defined periods during which the peptides may interact with zzso or zzso zzso each of which may have its own zzso circumscribed time frame of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso peptides affects zzso zzso One measurable indication of this is an acceleration of eye zzso Early exposure to zzso peptides has long-lasting effects on behavior, apparent when these animals are tested as zzso Increased spontaneous motor activity, heightened states of zzso and zzso and changes in social behavior have been zzso Certain avoidance responses and tests of visual discrimination in male rats are improved by zzso treatment with zzso zzso motor activity is increased and the normal period of zzso is initiated zzso Male sexual behavior is decreased and sexually zzso behaviors in males are zzso zzso may alter the development of its own zzso feedback zzso while zzso affects zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
