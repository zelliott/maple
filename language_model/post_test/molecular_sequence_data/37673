zzso is one of the smallest members of a family of 31 outer membrane proteins in zzso zzso and has been shown to function as a zzso In this study it was cloned into zzso coli where it was expressed in the outer zzso as confirmed by indirect zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso that were the same size as those formed by zzso zzso from zzso zzso A model of the membrane zzso of zzso was constructed and indicated that this protein formed a zzso with 16 zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of this model was tested by zzso zzso zzso assuming that, like other zzso zzso acid insertions were not tolerated in the zzso zzso but were tolerated in the adjoining loop zzso Generally, the results obtained with a series of 12 insertions of the sequence zzso and two zzso were consistent with the zzso zzso The preponderance of zzso acids that were zzso in the extended family of zzso zzso were predicted to be within the membrane and comprised zzso of all zzso in the zzso
