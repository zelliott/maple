The potential development of resistance to zzso zzso zzso cotton and surging of zzso insects is a major risk in the durability of zzso plant zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be used to control a wide range of insects and delay zzso resistance zzso zzso action to examine zzso zzso for synergistic interaction with zzso toxin and cloning of zzso zzso for zzso is necessary to make transgenic cotton more versatile and zzso 

A zzso dose (15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, and resulted in reductions in zzso and zzso length and mass of zzso zzso The combination of zzso inhibitor and zzso suppressed zzso more zzso body mass and zzso more zzso activities than the inhibitor only or zzso zzso To facilitate zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso were zzso Most predicted zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso three zzso center zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso or zzso and zzso for zzso zzso These putative zzso were separated into three distinct groups, indicating the diverse zzso evolved in this zzso zzso 

zzso zzso has evolved diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have potential zzso activity, and the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso is desirable for enhancing zzso toxicity and delaying resistance zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso will facilitate future functional examinations of individual roles in zzso toxicity and resistance development and facilitate targeted control using zzso and/or zzso zzso
