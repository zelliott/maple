Despite the extensive efforts towards development of an effective zzso zzso major challenges surrounding vaccine design still zzso We have previously developed a unique zzso zzso candidate vaccine representing zzso zzso and zzso zzso This candidate vaccine was able to induce a broad zzso immune response in zzso mice and zzso primates against zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of each zzso zzso mixture within our candidate zzso vaccine was further characterized to zzso the final vaccine zzso for the future clinical zzso The binding of each zzso region to zzso from zzso individuals demonstrated a strong zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, 15 groups of mice were zzso with zzso alone or each individual zzso mixture zzso or zzso to evaluate the ability of each variable region to induce zzso and cellular immune responses against zzso A zzso zzso specific immune response was detected among the zzso zzso however, mice receiving the zzso zzso regions demonstrated the highest frequency of zzso immune zzso
