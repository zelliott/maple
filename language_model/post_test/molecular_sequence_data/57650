In zzso culture of mouse zzso during the period coinciding with zzso has revealed that primary zzso cells can adhere and migrate in zzso medium when provided with certain zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso is the zzso zzso that may play an important role in basement membrane assembly and cell zzso Mouse zzso were studied using this in zzso model to determine whether zzso was capable of zzso zzso invasive zzso Although zzso has never been shown to promote cell migration, we report here that zzso zzso supported zzso outgrowth in a zzso manner, with a zzso effect at zzso zzso The ability of zzso cells to adhere and migrate on zzso was specifically inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso raised against zzso The synthetic zzso zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso recognition site, zzso inhibited zzso zzso outgrowth in a zzso manner, but had no effect on zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso that comprises the actual zzso sequence within zzso promoted zzso outgrowth when immobilized on the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso altered to contain a zzso in place of zzso at the zzso site, provided no zzso cell adhesive zzso We conclude that zzso promotes zzso outgrowth through a mechanism zzso by the zzso recognition site, and that it may play an important role during invasion of the zzso basement membrane at zzso
