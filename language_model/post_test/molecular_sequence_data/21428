zzso of therapeutic proteins and peptides by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known approach to improve the pharmacological properties of zzso Several chemical procedures of zzso zzso are already in use but an alternative method based on microbial zzso zzso was recently zzso The zzso zzso the link of zzso to zzso zzso of a zzso zzso In this case the advantage resides in the fact that usually only few zzso in a protein are zzso of zzso In order to further restrict the selectivity of the zzso we investigated a new approach leading to the formation of a single zzso zzso as well as for those proteins containing two or more zzso as zzso zzso It was found that the addition of zzso in the reaction mixture influenced both the secondary structure of the targeted protein and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso under these conditions yielded only zzso and selectively modified zzso The method was investigated with salmon zzso zzso and human growth hormone zzso In the case of zzso we also demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso for the preservation of in zzso zzso
