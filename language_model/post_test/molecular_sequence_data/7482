zzso are zzso zzso that comprise the inner and outer arms of zzso and zzso It previously has been shown that salt extraction of zzso lung zzso selectively removes zzso zzso of the outer arm zzso zzso and that the beat frequency of zzso zzso cannot be activated as compared to controls zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the activated state appears to require the presence of outer zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to ascertain basic information on the structure and molecular composition of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were extracted with zzso M zzso Each lung released approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso during isolation, yielding approximately 120 zzso of salt zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso stained samples revealed that zzso zzso consisted of two zzso heads joined together by a zzso zzso similar to sea zzso and trout zzso zzso Each head appeared to be roughly zzso in shape, measuring approximately 17 zzso in zzso zzso analysis of whole zzso revealed more than six zzso heavy chains when resolved in silver stained zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso either crude in high salt or zzso by zzso was composed of two heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site, performed in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso produced four new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 189 zzso zzso was supported by zzso and zzso but did not occur in the presence of zzso The apparent zzso of the zzso heavy chains was determined to lie between zzso zzso Eight discrete zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso chains by zzso Based on its extraction zzso zzso composition in zzso and crude samples, and structure, we conclude that this zzso particle represents the entire zzso respiratory outer arm zzso
