The zzso C virus zzso zzso encodes a 63 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which is located between the structural and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and is composed of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso While its exact role is unknown, zzso is crucial for assembly and/or release of infectious virus production in cell culture, as well as zzso in zzso The contribution of zzso to the zzso life cycle may result from at least two distinct zzso zzso several studies have shown that zzso acts as an zzso channel, the functionality of which is critical for zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a manner that may regulate the targeting of other structural proteins during the assembly zzso In this study, we observed that zzso in zzso and the zzso loop of zzso decreased infectious virus production in a zzso virus production zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso virus zzso indicated that zzso functions at a stage prior to generation of infectious zzso These effects were not due to altered zzso replication since no effects on levels of zzso or zzso protein were observed, and were not a consequence of altered recruitment of core protein to zzso zzso Similarly, these zzso seemingly did not prevent zzso zzso zzso we found that an zzso zzso substitution including the two basic zzso of the zzso loop, which is integral to zzso zzso channel function, significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso A time course experiment tracking zzso levels indicated that zzso was zzso over time, as opposed to being zzso in reduced zzso The results of this study provide strong evidence that one of the functions of zzso is to protect zzso zzso from premature degradation during zzso zzso
