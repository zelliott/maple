zzso induction in zzso zzso is controlled by a highly zzso signaling zzso similar to the zzso cascade in zzso By screening for zzso of the zzso zzso caused by an activated zzso zzso zzso we isolated zzso in a zzso zzso that acts as a positive modifier of zzso induction and is required for at least two other zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso do not zzso zzso induction in an otherwise zzso background, they have very strong effects on zzso induction in genetic backgrounds where Ras zzso activity is zzso activated or compromised, suggesting that zzso activity is required for zzso stimulation of zzso fates by the Ras zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso acts downstream of or in parallel to zzso zzso We cloned zzso and have shown that it encodes a novel putative protein zzso related to the zzso family of zzso zzso
