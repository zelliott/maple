The intravenous zzso zzso acts as a positive zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid type A zzso zzso Although the role of zzso zzso is zzso little is known about the involvement of other regions in the zzso effects of zzso zzso the influence of the large zzso loop in zzso sensitivity of both receptors was zzso 

The large zzso loop of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was screened using zzso zzso zzso to zzso was studied using zzso recording in zzso cells zzso zzso with wild type or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso large zzso loop significantly reduced zzso enhancement in both zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso 75 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and zzso (361 zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors retained their sensitivity to other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso At the single-channel level, the ability of zzso to increase open probability was significantly reduced in both zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso 22 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, it is demonstrated that the large zzso loop of both zzso and zzso has a zzso single zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that influences its sensitivity to zzso zzso suggest a new role of the large zzso loop in the zzso zzso of two members of the zzso zzso Thus, these data provide new insights into the molecular framework behind the zzso of zzso zzso channels by zzso
