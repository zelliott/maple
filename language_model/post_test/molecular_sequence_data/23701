The zzso zzso is a structurally zzso sequence for binding to the active site of zzso By zzso this zzso or some zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso we were able to generate a series of new zzso zzso of zzso containing only genetically zzso natural zzso zzso We found that synergistic binding to both the active site and an zzso of zzso can be enhanced through zzso of zzso acid zzso at the zzso and zzso sites of the zzso directed zzso zzso zzso to rational design, a zzso library was constructed to explore further the zzso requirements at the zzso zzso and zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Very significantly, panning of the zzso library has led to zzso peptides possessing strong zzso activities in the low zzso range and yet interfering only partially the zzso active site of zzso zzso of action of the newly discovered zzso zzso are rationalized in light of the zzso properties of zzso especially the interplay between the zzso action and regulatory binding occurring at zzso surfaces remote from the zzso active zzso
