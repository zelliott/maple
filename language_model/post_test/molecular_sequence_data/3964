zzso is a zzso zzso regulator of zzso zzso that positively regulates the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Positive control of the zzso genes occurs in response to zzso a zzso released from plant zzso zzso causes zzso zzso to undergo a zzso change from an inactive to an active state; this change is marked by a decrease in footprint length from 55 to 45 zzso as well as a relaxation of a high angle DNA zzso In this study, we first used gel zzso zzso to show that zzso is zzso in solution, and we used gel shift zzso to show that zzso is zzso when bound to zzso We then created a series of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Some zzso were designed to lock zzso complexes into a zzso resembling the inactive zzso whereas other zzso were designed to lock complexes into the active zzso These zzso altered the zzso of zzso complexes and their responses to zzso in ways that we had zzso As expected, operator zzso that locked complexes into a zzso having a long footprint and a high angle DNA bend blocked zzso by zzso in zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso that lock zzso into a short footprint and low angle DNA bend failed to cause the protein to function zzso Furthermore, some of the latter zzso zzso with zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso zzso into a zzso having a short footprint is not sufficient to cause zzso zzso and zzso must cause at least one additional zzso change in the zzso
