zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso and zzso A broad spectrum of zzso in the zzso gene has been identified as causing the zzso In the present paper, we report on a patient affected by zzso with a novel complex zzso characterized by a small 9 zzso deletion followed by an inversion of 151 zzso and a gross deletion of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The small deletion and the zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso The large deletion zzso downstream of zzso 11 of the zzso zzso including zzso 12, and a zzso region upstream of the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso of the patient's sample showed the presence of two zzso transcripts that code for a protein of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that these two transcripts differ in the 3' zzso region, and result from the use of two alternative zzso zzso The severe zzso of the patient zzso with the presence of an zzso zzso
