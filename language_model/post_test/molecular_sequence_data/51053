T zzso responses to the zzso of an zzso distant species are known to be weak compared with responses against zzso zzso products within a zzso This fact was used to examine the regions of human zzso class II molecules required for the stimulation of strong primary immune responses against zzso zzso A panel of mouse zzso zzso expressing the products of zzso and zzso zzso zzso class II genes paired to either DR alpha or zzso alpha genes was generated, and tested as zzso cells for zzso human T zzso A strong zzso response to zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso molecules was zzso In contrast, weak or absent responses were recorded against zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso beta chain with zzso beta k led to a dramatic loss of zzso alpha chain substitution had a less marked zzso Furthermore, replacement of the beta 2 domain of zzso with zzso sequence caused zzso zzso whereas introduction of the beta 2 domain of zzso into zzso led to a zzso increase in T cell zzso These results are most readily explained if the beta 2 domain contributes to the interaction site for the zzso zzso zzso of either half of the beta 1 domain led to a marked loss of zzso This was more impressive following substitution of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
