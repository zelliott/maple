The integrity of zzso of zzso is essential for zzso and consequently for protein zzso The zzso are generated and, if truncated by zzso activity, restored by zzso zzso However, further zzso at the zzso can occur by zzso activity or during processing of overlapping zzso primary transcripts in zzso zzso In the latter case, the upstream zzso is released in a zzso form zzso up to six zzso and subsequently zzso In human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is completed by a zzso adding activity followed by zzso zzso Since in zzso a high percentage of further zzso zzso human zzso could be observed, it was tested in an in zzso system whether this repair mechanism for zzso zzso acts also on these further zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso versions of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results show that these transcripts can be repaired during zzso A similar base incorporating activity was observed in mouse zzso indicating that a repair mechanism for the zzso of several zzso exists in zzso of humans and possibly other zzso which goes beyond the zzso zzso
