The zzso using a zzso approach, of genes from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of both genes have a high similarity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were expressed in zzso coli, each of the zzso zzso was able to zzso the zzso zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso as well as the short zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso spectral data confirmed that the oxidized product of zzso is zzso which is the expected product at the zzso zzso step in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso unable to grow on solid minimal medium containing zzso zzso or zzso as sole carbon zzso Feeding studies with zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant decrease in the incorporation of label into the zzso positions of zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast the zzso did not affect incorporation into the zzso positions of zzso These results are consistent with the zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso with a broad zzso specificity that has a role in the zzso of zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
