Here we describe the association of the zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso from pig zzso with zzso membrane zzso zzso The zzso was localized exclusively in zzso prepared by zzso in zzso density zzso of zzso zzso 96 zzso This was zzso by its zzso with the raft markers cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso The remaining zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso with the majority of the membrane zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso in the density zzso with a lower activity for zzso and greater stimulation by zzso than for the other zzso By providing an ordered membrane zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the interaction of zzso with proteins involved in zzso signaling at discrete functional positions on the synaptic nerve zzso
