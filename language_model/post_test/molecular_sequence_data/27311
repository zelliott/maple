Human zzso leukemia virus type 2 zzso Rex is a zzso regulatory protein required for efficient zzso expression of the zzso and incompletely spliced viral zzso transcripts zzso the structural and zzso zzso Previously, it was demonstrated that zzso of zzso predominantly on zzso zzso is correlated with an altered zzso as observed by a gel mobility shift and the detection of two related protein species zzso and zzso zzso zzso is required for specific binding to its zzso target sequence and zzso of zzso zzso and may be linked to zzso zzso Thus, the zzso structural state of Rex in the infected cell may be a switch that determines whether zzso exists in a zzso or productive zzso We conducted a zzso and functional mapping of both structural forms of zzso Rex 2 using affinity zzso liquid zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified two zzso sites in zzso at zzso and zzso We also identified six zzso sites in zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We evaluated the functional significance of these zzso events and found that zzso on zzso zzso and zzso is critical for zzso function in zzso and that zzso of zzso is correlated with zzso zzso zzso Overall, this work is the first to completely map the zzso sites in zzso and provides important insight into the zzso zzso that tightly regulates zzso structure, cellular zzso and zzso
