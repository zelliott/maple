Members of the zzso protein family have been linked through a combination of genetic and zzso studies to zzso interference zzso and related zzso Here, we describe the characterization of the first zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso the earliest divergent zzso where zzso has been described so zzso zzso is predominantly zzso and is found in a zzso particle with small interfering zzso zzso and this particle is present in a soluble form, as well as associated with zzso A genetic knockout of zzso leads to a loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso derived from transgenic zzso zzso are reduced to almost zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso leads to an increase in zzso transcript abundance via mechanisms operating at the zzso level and at the zzso stability zzso Our results suggest that zzso function is required for production and/or stabilization of zzso and provide the first evidence for an zzso protein being involved in the regulation of zzso transcript zzso
