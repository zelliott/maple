zzso primary sequence zzso between the zzso family of zzso zzso and the complement components zzso zzso and zzso implies that these proteins arose from a common zzso zzso from the ancient zzso zzso zzso contains both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this report, we present evidence that zzso zzso zzso not only possesses zzso zzso activity, but it also zzso in the zzso system of the zzso zzso The protein is a zzso zzso of zzso of molecular mass 185 zzso Upon reaction with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent a major zzso change and no zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso inhibitor of a number of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso follows the general zzso mechanism shared by most zzso however, no zzso linking of zzso to the inhibitor was detected despite the presence of a functional zzso Moreover, the inhibitor demonstrated zzso binding to sheep zzso a property also observed with complement components such as zzso zzso of functional protein by treatment of zzso with zzso destroyed the zzso zzso capacity and the zzso activity of the zzso Both activities were restored by adding zzso protein to depleted zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso incorporates zzso as well as zzso a property shared by human zzso The data support the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso is both a zzso inhibitor and part of a zzso system, providing a link between the two distinct sides of the zzso zzso Because both properties are contained in one zzso we propose the name zzso to describe this zzso zzso zzso zzso
