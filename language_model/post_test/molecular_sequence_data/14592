zzso are functionally diverse zzso that are wholly dependent on import of zzso zzso The signals that direct proteins into these zzso are either found at the zzso zzso 1 zzso targeting zzso zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso targeting zzso zzso of the zzso Based on a limited number of tests in zzso systems, zzso signals appear to be zzso across zzso To further test the zzso of this conclusion and to establish the extent to which the zzso signals can be relied on for zzso purposes across species, we tested two zzso signals for their ability to target fluorescent proteins in diverse plant zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso showed that the six zzso acid zzso sequence zzso from spinach zzso zzso effectively targets green fluorescent fusion protein to the leaf zzso in all 20 crops tested, including four zzso zzso zzso corn and zzso and 16 zzso zzso cucumber, broccoli, tomato, lettuce, zzso radish, cauliflower, cabbage, zzso celery, zzso zzso zzso eggplant and zzso Similarly, results indicated that the 10 zzso acid zzso sequence zzso from pumpkin zzso zzso effectively targets red fluorescent fusion protein to the leaf zzso in all four crops tested including zzso zzso and zzso zzso celery and zzso zzso These signal sequences should be useful zzso engineering tools to direct zzso proteins to the leaf zzso in diverse plant species of zzso zzso
