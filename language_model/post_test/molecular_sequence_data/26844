zzso in the zzso located zzso zzso zzso lead to type I zzso syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disorder, yet the mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso zzso proteins in zzso cells have not been zzso Here, we identified a zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that was required for zzso zzso zzso exit and surface expression of the zzso Indeed, microscopic zzso imaging showed that a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso of its zzso zzso region results in the absence of cell surface zzso zzso zzso revealed that lack of cell surface expression was associated with abolition of mature zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the absence of mature protein was not caused by reduced synthesis or increased rates of degradation of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that these zzso zzso with the zzso marker zzso zzso demonstrating that they are retained in the zzso Cell treatment with zzso or zzso zzso failed to restore the loss of zzso zzso further eliminating the possibility that zzso zzso were processed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso identified zzso zzso zzso as an zzso exit signal necessary for maturation of zzso zzso of zzso to AAA within the context of the full-length protein prevented zzso zzso exit independently of the expression zzso This zzso motif is highly zzso in the zzso tails of all members of the zzso zzso family, and thus may function as a common motif zzso their transport from the zzso to the cell zzso Taken together, these data are consistent with a model zzso naturally occurring premature zzso that interfere with the zzso motif compromise zzso surface delivery through defective zzso
