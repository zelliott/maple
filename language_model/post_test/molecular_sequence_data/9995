The zzso zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene consists of an extensive repeat zzso Two zzso repeats (I and zzso were found in the core promoter (the zzso zzso zzso each containing two zzso binding zzso An additional six repeats were found, five of which zzso were upstream and one zzso downstream of the core zzso Using transient zzso zzso with a human growth hormone reporter zzso we found that the upstream repeating units zzso (in a zzso zzso zzso zzso core promoter activity to 13 zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso in a cervical zzso cell line zzso zzso The zzso core promoter activity was taken as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence to this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso still showed decreased promoter activity (10 zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and 8 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, the upstream sequence zzso promoter activity with or without the zzso zzso When the zzso sequence was added to the core promoter zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity decreases significantly in both zzso zzso (55 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that although the zzso sequence is present in the human zzso A promoter, it acts as a negative zzso element instead of a zzso zzso
