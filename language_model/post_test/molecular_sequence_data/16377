zzso zzso is a potent blocker of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso Because its blocking affinity on both channels is similar, although the pore region of these channels show only few zzso zzso zzso we aimed to characterize the binding sites of zzso in these zzso zzso the zzso dependence of zzso block on current through zzso channels, we concluded that the block is less zzso - sensitive than for zzso zzso Using zzso cycle analysis and computer zzso we tried to identify the zzso acids through which zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso We report that zzso interacts with zzso mainly through six strong zzso zzso from zzso zzso into the channel pore interacting with the zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso and zzso stabilizing the toxin onto the channel zzso Because only zzso zzso and the zzso motif are zzso in zzso channels, and the replacement of zzso from zzso channels with a zzso makes this channel zzso we concluded that zzso binds to all three channels through the same zzso zzso zzso although important, is not essential in zzso zzso A zzso charged zzso acid in this position could better stabilize the zzso interaction and could explain the zzso sensitivity of zzso block on current through zzso versus zzso zzso
