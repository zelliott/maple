zzso zzso 1 zzso is an attractive target for the development of zzso agents due to its importance in regulating zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been detected in a variety of zzso and expression levels often correlate with poor zzso Despite high interest in zzso zzso there is currently no structure publicly available to guide zzso drug design of specific zzso We determined the crystal structures of the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso with the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso zzso adopts the typical zzso domain fold and zzso in a zzso resembling the active state of other zzso zzso of the kinetic parameters determined for the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso shows that the zzso primarily affect the zzso of the reaction, with little change in the apparent zzso for the protein or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structure highlights features of the active site that can be exploited to obtain zzso zzso with selectivity over other zzso and zzso zzso These include the presence of a zzso at the bottom of the zzso pocket, combined with a zzso (as opposed to the more commonly found zzso in the roof of the binding site, a pocket created by zzso in the hinge region, and a cluster of positively charged zzso in the zzso area outside of the zzso pocket adjacent to the hinge zzso
