We here describe the isolation and characterization of a zzso from a newly isolated soil zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso most probably belongs to the species zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso % zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity was induced in the presence of zzso and zzso The crude zzso was first zzso by zzso followed by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso After removal of a brown zzso probably zzso a zzso zzso was obtained by further separation of the crude protein mixture using size exclusion zzso Some zzso zzso of pure zzso zzso was isolated with a molecular mass of 30 910 zzso based on zzso mass zzso Together with the observed zzso activity, zzso chemical sequence analysis confirmed that the isolated zzso is zzso to other zzso The kinetic parameters for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso , zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of the zzso zzso were found to occur at pH zzso
