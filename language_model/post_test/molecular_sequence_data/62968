zzso T cells predominate in early zzso in the zzso in the inflammatory disease human zzso T cell virus type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso of the disease remains unclear and the zzso zzso T cell response has been little zzso We zzso the zzso zzso zzso T cells, in patients with zzso and in zzso carriers with high zzso load, to test two zzso that zzso patients and zzso zzso carriers with a similar zzso load differ in the zzso hierarchy or the total frequency of specific zzso T cells, and that zzso zzso T cells are zzso infected with zzso The strongest zzso T cell response in both zzso patients and zzso carriers was specific to zzso This contrasts with the zzso of Tax in the zzso zzso T cell zzso The median frequency of zzso zzso zzso T cells was zzso greater in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso carriers with a similar zzso zzso Furthermore, the frequency of zzso T cells infected with zzso zzso Tax zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso cells than zzso zzso These data were confirmed by quantitative zzso for zzso zzso We conclude that the high frequency of specific zzso T cells was associated with the disease zzso and did not simply reflect the higher zzso load that is usually found in zzso zzso Finally, we conclude that zzso zzso T cells are zzso infected with zzso
