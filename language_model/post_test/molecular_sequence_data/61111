We describe the characterization of the zzso zzso of the human gene zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso zzso This gene was cloned using a zzso construct inserted in the zzso first zzso The zzso zzso with a viable zzso called zzso zzso which leads to formation of zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso and zzso have both been mapped to zzso 12, in a segment which is zzso with region zzso to zzso of human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso however, appears to be due to two point zzso in the zzso zzso domain rather than to the zzso zzso zzso The results of this study are discussed in the light of the possible function of the zzso zzso zzso
