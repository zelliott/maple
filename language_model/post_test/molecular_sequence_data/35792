Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso field gel zzso showed that the zzso zzso has a very efficient DNA zzso zzso repair system, which properly restores the three zzso after they are zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso is deficient in this repair zzso but is capable of zzso arrest in zzso following DNA zzso We cloned the zzso gene by zzso the radiation sensitivity of the zzso zzso The zzso gene completely zzso the DNA zzso repair zzso The zzso gene was localized to zzso III by zzso The transcript is zzso zzso long and expressed at a moderate zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a 628 zzso acid, very zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso gene shows no significant zzso to other known zzso or zzso zzso The inability of the zzso to perform efficient DNA repair is caused by a single base zzso which changes zzso zzso into zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene showed that it is essential for zzso growth of zzso
