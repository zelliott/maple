zzso are zzso zzso proteins of synaptic zzso that might function as zzso receptors for neurotransmitter release via their first C2 zzso zzso Here we describe the effect of zzso on zzso binding to the zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso and demonstrate that only zzso III can bind zzso charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso interaction with zzso was found to have an zzso of zzso 30 zzso zzso which is comparable to that of zzso and zzso zzso values of zzso 10 zzso This binding property of the zzso domain is specific to zzso III, because none of the zzso zzso of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso showed zzso binding activity in the presence of 1 zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso III is involved in zzso functions different from those of zzso I and zzso
