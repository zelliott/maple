In the course of evolution, the zzso organ zzso first appeared in zzso To understand the relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso we isolated and analyzed the expression of the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso We identified genes of the zzso zzso zzso family, which are predominantly expressed throughout the sensory zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso was also extensively expressed throughout the zzso sensory zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso and Go are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of the zzso zzso families and the zzso of the zzso and Go imply that zzso play important roles in the sensory zzso of zzso zzso We found that these receptors were expressed not only in the zzso but also in the zzso zzso area of the principal cavity zzso zzso microscopic study revealed that the zzso of the zzso is more like that of the zzso than that of the principal and the middle zzso These results suggest that in adult zzso the zzso analyzed so far are predominantly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of zzso expression in zzso larvae demonstrates that zzso are predominantly expressed in the zzso even before zzso
