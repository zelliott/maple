As compared to normal people, the zzso of patients with schizophrenia were found to have an impairment of zzso protein zzso zzso More importantly, the impaired protein zzso zzso in the zzso of schizophrenic patients could be consistently and completely restored to normal by zzso pure protein zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso (the zzso factor of zzso protein zzso indicating that the molecular mechanism for the impaired protein zzso zzso in schizophrenic patients may be due to a functional loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity analysis in an zzso zzso alpha zzso further demonstrate that both cellular activities and protein levels of zzso zzso alpha in the zzso of schizophrenic patients were greatly zzso as compared to normal zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso isolated from 37 normal people contain zzso zzso alpha activity in the high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso whereas the zzso of 48 patients with schizophrenic disorder contain zzso zzso alpha activity in the low levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the different levels of zzso zzso alpha activity between schizophrenic patients and normal people are statistically zzso Taken together, the results provide initial evidence that patients with schizophrenic disorder may have a common impairment in the protein levels and cellular activities of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso in their zzso
