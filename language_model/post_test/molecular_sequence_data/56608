Two DNA segments exhibiting zzso zzso replicating zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from its zzso on an zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso on the hybrid plasmids high transformation efficiency and enabled zzso transmission of the plasmids in 1 or 2 copies per zzso cell under selective zzso zzso analysis showed that at least zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were required for full zzso Both of these regions contained two zzso matches to an zzso core consensus in zzso zzso whereas neither was similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso elements contained at, or close to, their boundaries a 13 zzso zzso zzso which resembles the zzso site for zzso II in zzso A central zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso contained four stretches of a 17 zzso direct repeat zzso zzso and exhibited the zzso behavior typical of bent zzso
