The prevalent forms of adult and childhood zzso zzso are chronic zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso zzso and are typified by a nearly zzso zzso of cells expressing a single heavy zzso and light zzso chain variable zzso zzso V gene selection could be random, or quite biased if the disease or the zzso status of the transformed cell somehow influenced DNA zzso We have cloned and zzso three zzso zzso gene segments that constitute a new human zzso family zzso zzso linked within 160 zzso pairs of the zzso zzso One zzso member is rearranged in about zzso of patients with zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso lines from peripheral zzso In some zzso we detect a truncated zzso zzso devoid of constant regions that originates from zzso zzso zzso In other zzso and in resting zzso we detect large amounts of normally sized zzso zzso although stimulation by zzso of zzso B cells results in loss of zzso zzso These features suggest that biased zzso of zzso V may be under zzso zzso
