A zzso marine zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso tolerant zzso and exhibited high tolerance to various types of toxic zzso organic zzso including zzso at relatively high zzso (up to zzso zzso under the growing zzso Investigation of its tolerance mechanisms illustrated that it does not rely on zzso zzso processes or modification of cell surface zzso but rather, increase of the cell size lowers zzso zzso into cells and the zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso A test using zzso pump zzso suggested that secondary zzso zzso resistance zzso cell division zzso and the zzso and toxic compound zzso zzso family, are involved in zzso tolerance in this zzso In addition, its zzso tolerance ability could be zzso and significantly enhanced by repetitive growth in the presence of toxic zzso The marked zzso tolerance of zzso zzso zzso indicates its potential use as a host for zzso zzso processes as well as zzso
