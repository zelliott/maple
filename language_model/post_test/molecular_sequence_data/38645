zzso structured and zzso zzso zzso are adaptable and potent zzso zzso They interact with zzso proteins zzso the great majority of which contain a sequence called the zzso motif zzso This approximately zzso sequence motif forms a zzso structure that interacts with zzso with partially zzso zzso and, in some cases, with zzso hybrids, generally without obvious zzso sequence zzso At least nine families of functionally diverse proteins contain one or more zzso The motif also zzso in complex formation through zzso zzso
