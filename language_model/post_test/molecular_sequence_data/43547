The zzso genes zzso factors which are proposed to function as zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso sequencing, and initial characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso Similar to the previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso display decreases in zzso from various zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with the other zzso in the zzso complex as demonstrated by partial zzso of the complex and zzso zzso We estimate that the complex has a molecular mass of approximately 2 zzso Previously, it had been demonstrated that zzso zzso displayed more severe zzso defects than the other zzso zzso zzso zzso Marcus, zzso zzso zzso Silverman, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Roberts and zzso Winston, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display defects similar to those of zzso zzso and different from those of the other zzso with respect to promoters affected, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso can be separated into two classes, suggesting that the zzso complex may have two separate zzso We present a speculative model on the possible roles of the zzso zzso
