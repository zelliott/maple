zzso zzso chains contain zzso constant zzso of the zzso zzso that are relatively zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, recent studies in the zzso zzso have demonstrated surprising zzso zzso in the zzso alpha ( zzso and zzso beta ( zzso zzso zzso domain zzso This report extends these initial observations beyond zzso to two other orders of zzso zzso Studies in both the Atlantic cod and zzso show high levels of zzso in the zzso constant zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso were found within cod and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso usage suggests that positive selection maintains the high number of zzso zzso in these fish zzso Additionally, investigation of a zzso constant gene from the zzso zzso a sister species of the zzso zzso shows no evidence of zzso maintenance of constant region zzso These data argue that the zzso zzso constant domain is being employed by many zzso in a manner inconsistent with our current understanding, and may indicate unheralded complexity in signal zzso through the zzso zzso
