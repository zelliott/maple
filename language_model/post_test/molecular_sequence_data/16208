zzso elements of the mouse zzso basic protein zzso gene were analyzed by in zzso zzso using zzso cell zzso We demonstrated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core and zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was indispensable for the promoter zzso The zzso was suggested to function zzso with far upstream sequences including the zzso The zzso was crucial to direct zzso transcription, and also functioned with a zzso promoter irrespective of its zzso We identified a ubiquitous binding factor which zzso specifically with the zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso had a zzso zzso The zzso was considered to be one of the strongest zzso motif among known cellular zzso Interestingly, similar strong zzso motifs were suggested to be present in the zzso of zzso virus whose gene is expressed like the zzso zzso in the nervous zzso
