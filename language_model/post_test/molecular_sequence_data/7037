The molecular basis for male zzso produced by the 5 zzso zzso is becoming increasingly zzso 

We have performed zzso and molecular analyses of the 5 zzso type 2 gene in a Turkish family with a 5 zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso Turkish patient with female zzso showing zzso zzso high plasma testosterone and zzso and normally differentiated and developed zzso internal zzso 

5 zzso activity, measured by the conversion of zzso into 5 zzso compounds, was determined from cultured zzso skin zzso by both intact zzso zzso and zzso extracts at various pH zzso The five zzso of the 5 zzso type 2 gene were zzso after zzso amplification zzso of the patient's zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso parents' DNA was submitted to zzso on a sequencing zzso 

A marked decrease in the transformation of T into 5 zzso compounds by intact cells and a diminished 5 zzso activity at zzso pH by zzso cell extracts strongly suggested a 5 zzso type 2 zzso zzso analysis of the 5 zzso zzso gene showed a zzso deletion zzso zzso 156 and zzso responsible for a zzso zzso deletion at position 157 of the zzso The parents' DNA contained both normal and deleted zzso 

This is the third deletion described in the 5 zzso type 2 zzso The deleted zzso 157 is zzso in both types 1 and 2 of human and rat 5 zzso which suggests its crucial role in the functioning of the zzso This gene zzso was thus clearly responsible for the reduced 5 zzso activity and abnormal zzso development in this zzso
