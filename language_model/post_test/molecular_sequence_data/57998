We have identified a simple tandem repeat DNA zzso in the human zzso zzso gene of the form zzso This DNA zzso has 10 zzso and a zzso of zzso and can be easily typed using the zzso chain zzso It has been localized within the framework genetic map of zzso 19 and is located in the region of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso This DNA zzso will facilitate genetic studies of the role of the zzso zzso gene in the development of insulin resistance and zzso
