The utility of a nuclear zzso gene for reconstructing zzso relationships within the family zzso was zzso zzso among 13 species representing three zzso and nine zzso of zzso were analyzed using a zzso zzso of coding sequence from the eye color zzso zzso zzso for the study were two species from the sister group zzso zzso were determined from clone zzso products amplified from zzso DNA, and aligned following conceptual zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Third zzso positions were characterized by high levels of divergence and biased zzso zzso the intensity and direction of which varied among zzso Equal weighting of all characters resulted in zzso and zzso trees at odds with the generally accepted zzso hypothesis based on zzso and zzso zzso The application of differential weighting schemes recovered the traditional hypothesis, in which the zzso zzso formed the zzso zzso The zzso zzso occupied an intermediate position, and was a sister group to the zzso zzso Within zzso the zzso zzso and zzso formed an ancestral zzso while the zzso and zzso zzso occupied increasingly derived positions in the molecular zzso An zzso present in the zzso lineage and one zzso zzso was absent in the zzso zzso lineage and the second zzso zzso suggesting that zzso insertions or deletions may not always be reliable systematic zzso
