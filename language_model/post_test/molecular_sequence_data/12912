zzso zzso in the entire coding regions zzso 1 to zzso of the zzso zzso gene in primary human prostate zzso were investigated, using zzso chain reaction and single strand zzso zzso analysis of zzso Of 25 samples obtained from patients, four zzso were found to have RB zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso products revealed point zzso resulting in single zzso zzso of zzso 6 and 19 in two cases, and base deletions of zzso 8 and 17 in two zzso Two of four cases with RB zzso were moderately differentiated localized tumors and other two with RB zzso were poorly differentiated tumors with zzso Our results suggest that RB gene zzso is involved in progression steps of prostate zzso
