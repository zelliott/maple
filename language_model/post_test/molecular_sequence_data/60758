zzso to the aromatic acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso is zzso by zzso a zzso protein that also functions as a zzso zzso zzso belongs to the major zzso zzso zzso of transport zzso none of which have so far been implicated in zzso Work with two well-studied MFS zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso has revealed two stretches of zzso acids located between the second and third zzso zzso and the eighth and ninth zzso zzso zzso regions that are required for zzso zzso These sequences are zzso among most MFS zzso including zzso To determine if zzso has functional requirements similar to those of other MFS transport proteins and to analyze the relationship between the transport and zzso functions of zzso we generated strains with zzso in zzso acid zzso located in the 2-3 and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso proteins were analyzed in zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso proteins had a range of zzso Some transported at zzso levels, while others were partially or completely defective in zzso zzso An zzso zzso in the zzso loop that has no counterpart in zzso and zzso but is zzso among members of the aromatic zzso zzso family of the zzso was found to be critical for zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso acids in the 2-3 and zzso zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso acid changes that decreased zzso transport also caused a decrease in zzso zzso but the effect on zzso was sometimes slightly more zzso The requirement of zzso for both zzso transport and zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso has a zzso that differs from the classical zzso described for zzso coli and zzso zzso
