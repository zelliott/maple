zzso virus strains vary considerably in the amounts of zzso enveloped virus zzso that they release from infected zzso The zzso strain produces up to 40 times more zzso than does the related WR strain and consequently generates zzso zzso virus plaques instead of sharply defined round ones in susceptible zzso cells under liquid zzso The difference in zzso formation is due to the retention of enveloped WR zzso on the cell surface zzso zzso and zzso Moss, zzso zzso zzso zzso By using WR and zzso DNA fragments for marker transfer and analyzing the progeny virus by the comet formation zzso we determined that gene zzso and at least one other gene regulate the release of zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso gene of WR with the corresponding gene from zzso increased the amount of zzso produced by zzso and zzso the ability to form distinctive zzso zzso Gene zzso encodes an zzso zzso with zzso to zzso animal zzso zzso Duncan and zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso genes of WR and zzso strains differed in six positions, of which four were zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso which is located in the putative zzso recognition domain, was sufficient to transfer a zzso zzso to WR zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso is involved, through its zzso zzso domain, in the retention of progeny virus on the surface of parental cells and raise the possibility that the protein also has a role in virus attachment to zzso zzso
