Using zzso zzso gene sequencing technique, three different species of zzso bacteria of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and identified from infected insect zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso post zzso zzso similarity analysis revealed that the strains zzso zzso and zzso belong to zzso zzso zzso larvae and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso larvae were found to be associated with zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were fairly related to symbiotic zzso bacteria zzso and zzso zzso The strains zzso and zzso were zzso similar to several zzso and contaminated zzso bacteria isolated in Germany zzso and China zzso while the strain zzso was identical to the zzso of zzso larvae zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso in zzso The result was further confirmed by zzso secondary structure and minimum energy calculations of aligned zzso This study suggested that the zzso of these zzso are zzso zzso in some extent due to phase zzso zzso these strains are not zzso but zzso zzso
