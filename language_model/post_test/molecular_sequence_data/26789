The human blood fluke zzso zzso is the primary cause of zzso a debilitating disease that affects 200 million individuals in over 70 zzso The zzso zzso zzso is essential for the survival of the zzso and zzso proteins are potential novel drug targets for treating zzso Here we characterize two novel zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso from zzso Southern zzso analysis shows that the two zzso are the products of different zzso of a single zzso gene zzso The two zzso forms differ in three zzso acid positions near the zzso of the zzso Both zzso are expressed in the adult form and in the zzso form zzso snails) of the zzso but are absent from all other stages of the zzso complex life zzso zzso expression of the two zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso zzso transport activity with an apparent affinity for zzso comparable to that of the human zzso zzso Although the two zzso are zzso indistinguishable from each other, zzso experiments reveal notably higher zzso selectivity for zzso compared with their zzso zzso Several well-established zzso for human zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not transported by zzso zzso the higher selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso recordings of zzso zzso currents confirm the zzso selectivity observed in zzso experiments and suggest that it may be possible to exploit the zzso nature of zzso to screen for compounds that target the zzso in zzso
