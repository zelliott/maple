zzso of the bacterial community structure in sediments is essential to better design restoration strategies for zzso zzso In this regard, the aim of this study was to zzso the abundance and activity of bacteria involved in zzso and iron cycling in sediments from four zzso lakes with distinct zzso states zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from quantitative zzso bacteria performing zzso zzso zzso were the most abundant in the zzso lakes zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso bacteria zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso and zzso organisms zzso In contrast, zzso dominated sediments from the zzso lake zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that bacteria performing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate reduction, iron reduction and biological zzso zzso were present and active in all zzso lake zzso The present work also suggested that the activity of zzso might contribute to the release of zzso from zzso
