zzso employ zzso systems to sense the onset of appropriate cell density for expression of zzso zzso In many zzso bacteria, zzso involves the production of and response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and is zzso by members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that appears to zzso its zzso zzso produces compounds that promote expression of several zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso liquid zzso of highly concentrated zzso zzso extracts revealed that culture zzso of strain zzso contained two compounds with retention times similar to zzso and zzso To investigate the role of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso that were deficient for inducing an zzso reporter in zzso zzso were zzso Three zzso involved in normal zzso production were identified, one of which was shown to contain the zzso transcribed zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso enabled all of the zzso zzso of the locus zzso and a naturally zzso strain of zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso of zzso abolished production of all zzso zzso but affected neither the expression of zzso genes in culture nor the ability to zzso tomato zzso zzso has a functional zzso system, because zzso expression of zzso required zzso and zzso and zzso expression of a gene linked to zzso and zzso designated zzso was zzso zzso Because zzso has no zzso in the protein databases, its discovery provided no clues as to the role of zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso However, expression of zzso and zzso required the global zzso zzso regulator zzso and both zzso and zzso exhibited a cell zzso pattern of expression similar to other zzso zzso The zzso zzso system in zzso zzso is part of a more complex zzso zzso since the zzso activity of zzso is itself controlled by a novel zzso system that responds to zzso acid zzso zzso
