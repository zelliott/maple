We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a 44 zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso XIV of zzso zzso The sequence data revealed 23 open reading frames zzso larger than 300 zzso covering zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to previously zzso zzso zzso genes coding respectively for the zzso import protein zzso the zzso protein zzso the outer zzso membrane zzso zzso the zzso c zzso zzso VA precursor zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso products of three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit similarity to previously known zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso the protein zzso involved in the zzso expression of zzso 6 and 8 of the zzso zzso and zzso in addition zzso presents strong similarity to an zzso of zzso zzso The predicted protein products of zzso zzso and zzso present similarities with zzso from proteins of other zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso factor zzso The 12 remaining zzso show no significant similarity to known zzso In addition, we have detected a DNA region very similar to the zzso zzso Ty zzso of which zzso has disrupted a zzso zzso
