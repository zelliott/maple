zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae are usually the largest zzso zzso and as such often constitute a major part of the freshwater zzso zzso However, use of this zzso in zzso environmental and zzso studies is hampered by the fact that zzso larvae are difficult to identify to species because the larvae of many species are zzso zzso We used a combination of zzso zzso and genetic techniques to distinguish zzso larvae collected from 31 water bodies located in eastern Canada, producing 17 distinguishable zzso These groups of larvae were ultimately identified as belonging to 14 known species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and three other species that remain unidentified zzso zzso zzso No single approach served to zzso and identify larvae of all 17 zzso species that we zzso Although we expected that zzso criteria alone would be insufficient, our results suggest that DNA zzso using either the zzso zzso or the nuclear zzso zzso was also inadequate for separating some zzso zzso Thus we suggest that multiple approaches will often be needed to correctly identify zzso larvae to zzso
