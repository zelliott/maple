We treated transformed human zzso with diphtheria toxin zzso and isolated 40 single cells that were toxin resistant but unable to zzso In 13 of them toxin resistance was associated with the presence of one or more zzso transcripts of the structural gene for zzso factor 2 zzso zzso obtained from these transcripts had zzso zzso zzso Each of these deletions was associated with zzso base zzso repeats at its zzso Only 10 out of 16 zzso deletions were associated with presumed zzso zzso A role is suggested for errors in zzso in producing the zzso transcripts which gave rise to the zzso zzso zzso
