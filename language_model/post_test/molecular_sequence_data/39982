O zzso at carbon positions 7 or 9 of the zzso acid zzso in the zzso acid capsule of zzso coli zzso is zzso by a zzso contingency zzso zzso carried by the zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a novel method for analyzing zzso zzso acid O zzso that involves the release of surface zzso acids by zzso zzso followed by fluorescent labeling and detection of zzso derivatives by zzso The results indicated that zzso is responsible for the majority of capsule modification that takes place in zzso However, a minor zzso O zzso zzso was detected that is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso by zzso This zzso involves O zzso of zzso zzso acid and is regulated by another zzso zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso was also shown to be an zzso suggesting that it functions in the zzso of zzso environmental zzso zzso Our combined results indicate a previously unexpected complexity in the synthesis and zzso of microbial zzso and zzso zzso These findings are key to understanding the biological functions of modified zzso acids in zzso coli zzso and other species and may provide new targets for drug or vaccine zzso
