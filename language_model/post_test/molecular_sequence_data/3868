zzso zzso was used to isolate clones from zzso zzso zzso that were modified in their abilities to tolerate zzso zzso During this process, two zzso clones zzso and zzso were found to display abnormal cell zzso and distorted chain zzso and were further zzso zzso characterization of both zzso and zzso zzso indicated that they were disrupted in open reading frames zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Both genes zzso proteins in zzso coli that were described as being implicated in zzso synthesis during the process of cell zzso and to function in determining the rod shape of the zzso This work reports a possible connection between zzso zzso and zzso stress defense in zzso zzso zzso
