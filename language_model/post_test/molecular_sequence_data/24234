zzso zzso of zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso forming fusion zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso zzso in particular, zzso syndromes zzso In this respect, the zzso that results in the zzso fusion gene in chronic zzso leukemia is one of the zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso gene at zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso and is similarly activated by zzso zzso in which three alternative zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso fused to the zzso zzso domain of zzso These zzso are associated with characteristic zzso and clinical features, referred to as zzso zzso In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel fusion gene in a zzso zzso with a zzso and features suggestive of zzso zzso We show that the zzso in the zzso occur within zzso 4 and 8 of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the zzso level, the zzso results in the fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain of zzso as well as in the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso with data obtained from previously characterized fusion genes involving zzso and zzso it is likely that the zzso domain contributed by zzso is critical and that its zzso properties lead to zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso
