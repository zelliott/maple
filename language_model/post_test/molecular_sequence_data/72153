zzso protein zzso is thought to play an important regulatory role in synaptic zzso We recently have shown in cultured rat cortical zzso that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the frequency, but not the zzso of zzso zzso zzso implicating a zzso site of action for zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso for zzso are unknown, however, zzso has been implicated in the control of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso To determine whether zzso effects on synaptic transmission are direct or are zzso by changes in zzso 1 and/or 2A activities, we used zzso zzso clamp to record spontaneous and miniature zzso zzso currents in the presence of zzso A (1 zzso in bath zzso a membrane zzso inhibitor of zzso 1 and 2A which has no effect on zzso zzso increased zzso current zzso without changing current zzso In these same zzso subsequent zzso of zzso with zzso A or zzso had no further effect on current zzso but increased current zzso The increased current zzso seen with zzso involved a zzso zzso since the effect was reproduced by zzso (10 zzso in zzso zzso which is a zzso inhibitor of zzso 1 and zzso Thus, in rat cortical zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso through a zzso mechanism by zzso and zzso through a zzso mechanism by zzso 1 and zzso
