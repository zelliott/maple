The role of zzso zzso in the zzso of outer membrane proteins have been investigated in several zzso Some of these analyses showed that zzso is required for correct and efficient folding of outer membrane zzso other studies support the idea of independence of outer membrane proteins zzso from zzso zzso In this article, we investigated the involvement of zzso structure in the anomalous zzso of outer membrane proteins in a zzso coli zzso strain zzso To achieve this aim, the zzso structure of the zzso strain was carefully determined and compared with the zzso coli K-12 zzso It turned out that zzso of these two strains differs in the inner core for the absence of a zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that this difference is due to a zzso in zzso a gene zzso the zzso for the branch zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to find out if the restoration of zzso structure influenced the observed outer membrane proteins zzso Data reported in this work demonstrated that, in zzso coli zzso there is no influence of zzso structure on the outer membrane proteins inclusion bodies zzso
