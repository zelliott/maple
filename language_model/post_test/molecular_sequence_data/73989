A strain of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was isolated from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park and New zzso The zzso cells occurred zzso or in pairs as straight to slightly curved zzso zzso to zzso by zzso to zzso zzso with rounded ends and exhibited a tumbling zzso zzso were not zzso The temperature range for growth was 50 to 74 degrees C with an optimum at 65 degrees zzso The pH range for growth at 65 degrees C was from zzso to zzso with an optimum at zzso to zzso The zzso coupled the zzso of zzso to reduction of zzso zzso oxide or zzso zzso as an electron zzso In the presence as well as in the absence of zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso was zzso by incomplete zzso to zzso as the only organic zzso zzso no zzso was produced during zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract as zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso molecular zzso The zzso reduced zzso acid, zzso (to zzso and zzso (to zzso zzso but did not reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The G + C content of the DNA was 41 zzso (as determined by zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis placed the isolated strain as a member of a new zzso within the zzso zzso zzso
