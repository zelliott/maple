Fruit flavor is a result of a complex mixture of numerous zzso The formation of these compounds is closely correlated with the zzso changes occurring during fruit zzso Here, we describe the use of DNA zzso and appropriate statistical analyses to dissect a complex zzso zzso In doing so, we have identified a novel zzso alcohol zzso zzso gene that plays a crucial role in flavor zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso the most important compounds providing fruity zzso zzso evidence for involvement of the zzso gene in formation of fruity zzso is provided by characterizing the zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed maximum activity with zzso zzso zzso whose corresponding zzso are major components of zzso zzso The zzso was capable of utilizing zzso and zzso zzso and aromatic zzso molecules as zzso The results suggest that the formation of volatile zzso in fruit is subject to the availability of zzso molecules and alcohol zzso and is dictated by the zzso expression pattern of the zzso zzso and zzso specificity of the zzso zzso
