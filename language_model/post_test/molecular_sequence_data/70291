In a previous study, we showed that binding of zzso by cultured rat zzso cells significantly inhibited zzso levels of zzso zzso Similar zzso was observed when zzso enriched with bovine calf zzso zzso hormone zzso receptors were zzso with zzso In the present study, we screened a series of overlapping synthetic zzso zzso representing the entire primary structure of the zzso of zzso for their effects on zzso calcium zzso (as zzso by zzso cultures of zzso cells from immature zzso zzso previously identified as a zzso binding region of zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso contained within this zzso was observed to be equally as active as zzso at 200 zzso suggesting that the regulatory effect of zzso on zzso zzso influx was due to zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso calcium influx, although to a lesser extent than zzso or zzso zzso zzso entry into zzso cells was enhanced in a zzso manner when zzso sodium was replaced by zzso zzso (up to 135 zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso but was without effect in buffer containing 135 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
