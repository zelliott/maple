Major vault protein zzso is the main constituent of zzso large zzso particles implicated in resistance to cancer therapy and correlated with poor survival zzso Here, we report the structure of the main repeat element in human zzso The approximately 55 zzso acid zzso zzso domain has a unique, novel fold that consists of a zzso zzso zzso The solution zzso structure of a zzso zzso reveals the zzso contacts and relative zzso of the two zzso zzso We use these results to model the assembly of zzso zzso zzso from 96 zzso molecules into the ribs of the zzso vault zzso The unique features include a thin, zzso structure with polar zzso on both the zzso and internal surface, and a zzso arrangement of zzso zzso These studies provide a starting point for understanding the zzso of zzso into vaults and their interactions with other zzso Chemical shift zzso studies identified the binding site of vault zzso zzso another component of vault zzso indicating that zzso zzso form a new class of zzso zzso
