The heavy and light chain V region sequences of an zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse have been determined by zzso zzso The V zzso gene segment belongs to the V zzso zzso gene zzso and is found in several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in other zzso of unrelated zzso The zzso gene segment appears to represent a unique gene or a zzso of the large zzso zzso gene family of the zzso and is highly related to a zzso sequence of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso segment has not been found, so far, to be expressed in zzso with zzso for external or synthetic zzso therefore, expression of such zzso may be regulated by powerful mechanisms of self tolerance in the healthy zzso In addition, both the heavy and light chain of the zzso zzso zzso were found to contain zzso point zzso with a high ratio of replacement to silent zzso in zzso determining zzso This zzso to zzso sequence relationship suggests an affinity maturation process, which is driven by the zzso
