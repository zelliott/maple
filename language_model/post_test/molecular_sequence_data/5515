In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso combine to form disks in which the zzso zzso of zzso zzso bind to the edge of a zzso zzso core, shielding the zzso zzso tails from the zzso zzso We have employed experimental data, sequence analysis, and molecular modeling to construct an atomic model of such a zzso zzso zzso disk consisting of two zzso zzso proteins and 160 zzso zzso The initial zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso was excluded from the model, which was hydrated with an zzso shell of water zzso zzso dynamics and simulated zzso were used to test the stability of the zzso Both zzso and head-to-head forms of a zzso zzso zzso were zzso In our simulations the protein contained and zzso to the zzso zzso while providing good coverage of the zzso zzso
