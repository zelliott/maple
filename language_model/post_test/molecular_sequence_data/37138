A novel zzso zzso zzso which we have named zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso snake zzso zzso was zzso by a single zzso step on a Resource S zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso zzso indicates that zzso comprises about zzso of the crude zzso It is a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 78 zzso zzso of zzso after zzso by zzso showed zzso patterns similar to those generated by group A zzso zzso which convert zzso into zzso independent of the zzso zzso zzso agents, such as zzso and o zzso rapidly inhibited the zzso activity of zzso like a typical zzso Human zzso A zzso was slowly zzso only after longer incubation with zzso and no effect on the zzso or zzso was zzso zzso was also capable of triggering zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso von zzso factor was released, and the surface expression of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso in cultured human zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence possesses zzso zzso and encodes a zzso with significant sequence similarity to many other mature zzso reported from snake zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not elicit any zzso zzso These results show that, although the primary structure of zzso is related to that of zzso zzso zzso and functionally similar to group A zzso zzso it is a zzso zzso devoid of zzso zzso This is a feature not observed for most of the snake zzso zzso including the group A zzso zzso
