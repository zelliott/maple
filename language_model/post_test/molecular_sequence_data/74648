zzso zzso have high affinity for zzso (such as free zzso in zzso We describe here the use of this property to develop a zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso technique for the identification of zzso zzso in zzso A zzso zzso species, zzso acid zzso zzso with a zzso mass zzso and mass zzso distinct from the normal 20 zzso zzso was used to selectively label zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences shifted away from the more abundant normal fragments that would otherwise overlap with the zzso of zzso Along with the internal and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso served as zzso signatures for identification of the binding sites and for assessment of the relative zzso of individual zzso zzso in a zzso Using this method, we have identified two highly zzso binding sites in rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was bound to zzso zzso in the zzso of rats fed with zzso and this binding was responsible for zzso zzso in rat blood, while zzso was found to bind to zzso in rat zzso This study revealed the relative zzso of the zzso in rat zzso in the following decreasing order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is easy and fast for identification of active binding sites without zzso zzso and acid zzso and useful for characterization and identification of metal binding sites in other zzso
