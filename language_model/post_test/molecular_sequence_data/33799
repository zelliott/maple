zzso structure prediction methods such as zzso search for the lowest energy zzso of the zzso zzso However, the zzso observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy, rather than the zzso The neglect of the missing zzso zzso contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the zzso of alternative folded states, while very much less than unfolded states, are not too different from one another, and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy zzso The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this zzso Particularly problematic are proteins with significant zzso regions which do not populate single low energy zzso even in the native zzso We describe two approaches within the zzso structure modeling methodology for treating such zzso The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be zzso instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition zzso In this model, zzso can be either completely ordered or completely zzso they are considered zzso if the gain in zzso outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein zzso The second approach requires identification in advance of the zzso regions either from sequence alone using for example the zzso server or from experimental data such as zzso chemical zzso During zzso structure prediction calculations the zzso regions make only zzso repulsive contributions to the total zzso We find that the second approach has greater practical utility and illustrate this with examples from de zzso structure zzso zzso structure zzso and comparative zzso
