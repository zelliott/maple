Most zzso zzso zzso patients produce a zzso form zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso which is not properly processed in normal cells but is active as a zzso channel in several experimental zzso We used a double zzso zzso zzso and zzso procedure to generate a mouse model for the delta zzso zzso zzso embryonic stem zzso cells zzso zzso were zzso of these either 80 or zzso of the clones had lost the delta zzso zzso depending on the distance between the zzso site in the targeting construct and the delta zzso zzso zzso targeted clones underwent a second selection step resulting in zzso cell clones zzso zzso zzso for the delta zzso zzso with an efficiency of zzso zzso mice were generated and offspring zzso for the delta zzso zzso showed zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso gallbladder and in the zzso and zzso abnormalities in the zzso typical of zzso Our data suggest that the delta zzso mice have residual delta zzso zzso activity which would explain the mild pathology of the delta zzso zzso The delta zzso mouse may provide a useful model for the study of the processing zzso of delta zzso zzso and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on zzso of the processing zzso
