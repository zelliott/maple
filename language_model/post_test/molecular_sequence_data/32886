To gain knowledge about the zzso origin of zzso precursors and the regulatory zzso of zzso differentiation in zzso we determined the zzso expression profile of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in developing and adult zzso We show that it is an early, specific marker of zzso zzso zzso but not of other zzso zzso We then use zzso expression together with tracing techniques to demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1-2 largely originate from a zzso pool at the zzso zzso Furthermore, by combining expression analyses of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity zzso we show that anterior and zzso zzso clusters of zzso precursors are separated by zzso rather than zzso as in other zzso Our findings establish the origin of zzso zzso zzso and strengthen the evidence for zzso zzso and zzso zzso among the zzso brain zzso cell zzso
