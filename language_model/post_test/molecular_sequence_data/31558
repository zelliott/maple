In zzso zzso male zzso stem cells zzso are originated from primordial germ cells and developed into zzso and zzso In our previous studies, we had isolated a zzso zzso from goat zzso and tested their zzso and differentiation potential zzso and in zzso which revealed that the isolated and cultured dairy goat zzso maintained the characteristics of zzso However, zzso a marker of zzso was not examined in zzso In this study, the dairy goat zzso were zzso by differential zzso followed by zzso cell sorting zzso using zzso zzso The quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso analyses revealed that the zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher in zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso The detection results of zzso dairy goat zzso indicated that the zzso cells maintained the characteristics of zzso grew relatively faster than zzso cells, and the percentage of alkaline zzso cells and colonies were significantly higher in zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso is a marker of zzso zzso in goat zzso the technique of zzso cell sorting using zzso zzso could be an efficient method to enrich zzso in zzso
