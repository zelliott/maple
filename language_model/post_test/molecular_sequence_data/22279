zzso are zzso plant proteins with potent zzso zzso Here we systematically zzso the importance of zzso charged zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using a strategy involving chemical zzso We show that the single zzso acid plays a key role for the zzso zzso of this zzso produced a zzso decrease in zzso Virtually no change in potency was observed when masking the single zzso zzso using zzso while zzso of the two zzso zzso reduced the potency zzso The zzso with modifications at both zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso loss of zzso In addition, we show that the activity is dependent on an intact zzso network and that the short sequences between the six zzso zzso that is, the backbone zzso are devoid of zzso zzso
