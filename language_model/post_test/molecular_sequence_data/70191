We have identified and characterized zzso zzso a novel zzso that is a member of a distinct class of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso mediates zzso stimulation of zzso zzso levels in response to zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso and to the related zzso skin zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso zzso expression in the brain, zzso zzso and other zzso zzso precisely to that predicted for the classic zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso serves to mediate the known biological effects of zzso on behavior, stress, and zzso Alternative zzso events generate a second, relatively abundant gene product expressed in a distinct zzso zzso These findings serve to identify the zzso for an important zzso
