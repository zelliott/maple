The zzso zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to both zzso and zzso radiation and exhibits a growth zzso at 35 degrees zzso In addition, the zzso displays defects in cell zzso and nuclear division at 26 degrees C which are exaggerated at 35 degrees zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and have shown that it is not essential for zzso although cells containing a disrupted zzso gene grow zzso The zzso zzso has similar cell and nuclear zzso to the original zzso and displays an extremely high frequency of loss of zzso zzso is not required for either the zzso or zzso checkpoint, however double zzso analysis indicates that zzso acts in a process which is defective in the checkpoint zzso zzso and which involves zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso encodes a protein which is related to zzso zzso proteins and more particularly to an zzso in zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso zzso which we have named zzso ( zzso in zzso zzso since we show that it can complement the slow growth zzso and radiation sensitivity of zzso zzso
