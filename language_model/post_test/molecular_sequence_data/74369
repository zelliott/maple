zzso snake zzso contain a variety of zzso zzso some of which are zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso to purify zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso named as zzso a basic zzso zzso has a molecular masses of zzso The zzso acid sequence and molecular mass of zzso was identical to those of an zzso basic zzso zzso previously isolated from this zzso zzso activities were tested by zzso and zzso zzso zzso exerted a potent zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso ranged between 85 and zzso and was most effective against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso This zzso rapidly killed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The effect of the zzso on bacterial zzso was evaluated by scanning and transmission electron zzso zzso caused zzso zzso apparent on their cellular surfaces, suggesting a killing mechanism based on membrane zzso and zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells zzso The zzso did not affect cell viability up to zzso zzso but cell death was evident at zzso concentration after 24 and zzso Furthermore, the repeated exposure of zzso zzso treated mice showed different tissue zzso mainly at the brain and zzso the zzso potential of zzso remains to be zzso The zzso exhibits no zzso action even at high doses zzso in human zzso However, the zzso is believed to exert its zzso effect by zzso the bacterial membrane by forming zzso In addition, the basic zzso zzso displays a zzso effect, which may be either dependent or independent of zzso
