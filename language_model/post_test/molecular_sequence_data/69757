In this study, we tried to purify the zzso fragments of guinea-pig major basic protein zzso using zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was not affected by the zzso suggesting that the zzso bonds were not necessary for the zzso zzso When zzso was zzso with zzso the four potent zzso fragments zzso V zzso zzso IX zzso zzso X zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutralized the zzso activity of zzso and fragments IX, X and zzso but not the activity of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso the common zzso sequence of fragments IX, X and zzso might be involved in the zzso activity of zzso In fact, the synthetic zzso zzso exerted the zzso activity, and the activity was neutralized with zzso The zzso activity of zzso was lost by the modification with zzso zzso which converted zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may be important for the zzso zzso
