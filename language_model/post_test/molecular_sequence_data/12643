Both X-ray and zzso structural studies have defined the zzso nature of zzso generated through mutual stacking of zzso zzso by zzso rich zzso zzso Recently, the fragile X syndrome zzso zzso zzso repeat has been shown to form a stable zzso of undefined structure in zzso zzso zzso We have undertaken a structural characterization of the zzso zzso to zzso the structural alignments associated with zzso formation by this zzso which contains sequence elements associated with the fragile X syndrome zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso solution forms a zzso through zzso of two symmetry related zzso with the lateral connecting zzso zzso positioned at opposite ends of the zzso This novel zzso dynamics based solution structure contains internal zzso zzso sandwiched between terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within individual zzso zzso through their major groove edges using zzso hydrogen bonds to form internal zzso zzso zzso strands are zzso to each other around the zzso zzso which contains two distinct narrow and two zzso wide zzso By contrast, the terminal zzso adopt zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso with its zzso arrangement of zzso and zzso zzso greatly expands on our current knowledge of zzso folding zzso Our results establish the pairing alignments that can be potentially zzso by the fragile X syndrome zzso repeat to form zzso structures through zzso of hairpin zzso The formation of novel zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso is directly relevant to the potential pairing alignments of zzso stems in genetic zzso
