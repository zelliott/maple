A grand challenge in the zzso era is a complete computer representation of the cell and the zzso which will enable zzso prediction of zzso complexity of cellular processes and zzso behavior from zzso zzso Toward this end we have been developing a zzso approach for network zzso which is to zzso given a complete set of genes in the zzso the protein interaction networks that are responsible for various cellular zzso zzso at zzso is the reference knowledge base that zzso current knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes zzso zzso information about genes and proteins generated by zzso projects zzso zzso and information about zzso compounds and reactions zzso zzso These three types of database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and the chemical zzso New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge, both zzso and zzso about zzso clusters in the zzso zzso zzso database, and to collect and analyze zzso structures in the zzso zzso
