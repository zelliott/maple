The zzso zzso zzso zzso are important downstream signaling components of zzso receptors zzso To date, four zzso zzso have been found, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show a detailed analysis of the zzso region encompassing the zzso zzso gene and the molecular cloning of four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated by alternative zzso at the zzso of the zzso This alternative zzso has direct effects on the expression of the zzso death domain and/or zzso No evidence of similar alternative zzso was found for the human zzso zzso When zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The promoter for zzso differed from that of the other zzso zzso in that it contained putative zzso binding zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso indicating a possible negative feedback effect on the signaling zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso gene in mice will therefore generate zzso or zzso zzso zzso which is likely to have consequences for the regulation of zzso zzso These observations identify another distinguishing feature between mice and humans in the zzso system that is likely to be due to differences in the selective pressure imposed by pathogens on each species during zzso
