The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is an aggressive zzso caused by the fusion of various partner genes to zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso Various zzso zzso are associated with subtly distinct disease zzso Here, we report a new zzso at the zzso locus in a patient who carried zzso and presented with zzso zzso zzso The patient was characterized by zzso zzso of bone zzso markedly elevated numbers of zzso and normal to mildly elevated zzso zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso in this patient was zzso zzso analysis led to the identification of a novel zzso in which zzso 23 of the zzso promoter region zzso gene at zzso band zzso was fused to zzso 13 of zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion of the fusion protein contains putative functional motifs including an zzso zzso domain, nuclear pore complexes zzso domain, and multiple zzso zzso It is likely that one or more of the motifs from zzso contribute to zzso resulting in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results further support a critical role of zzso in the zzso of zzso and may lead to more accurate diagnosis and potential targeted zzso
