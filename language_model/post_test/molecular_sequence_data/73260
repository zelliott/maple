We have isolated human and rat clones of the zzso zzso protein zzso termed zzso zzso is related to the zzso expressed zzso whose zzso deletion appears to result in cognitive impairment in patients with Williams zzso The hallmark of this protein family is the presence of 1 or zzso zzso motifs and an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by Northern zzso analysis in human zzso most abundantly in zzso zzso liver, and zzso and also in a variety of cell lines including zzso glioblastoma, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript was also induced upon zzso differentiation of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso A 65 zzso zzso zzso protein was identified in zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso expression zzso An in zzso zzso zzso demonstrates zzso is zzso and exhibits zzso zzso activity towards the zzso zzso zzso The zzso 65 zzso zzso protein was detected in a variety of cell lines, and zzso with a 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not itself zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso is localized in both the nucleus and in a zzso zzso soluble zzso
