The zzso interaction domain zzso is a zzso module found in many zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have determined the first ever three-dimensional structure of an zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by Dead zzso from zzso zzso zzso recognize DNA through a novel mechanism involving major groove zzso of a large loop that connects the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and through a zzso structural zzso that produces stabilizing contacts from a zzso Dead zzso preference for zzso DNA originates from three positions within the zzso fold that form energetically significant contacts to an zzso base zzso zzso acids that dictate binding specificity are not highly zzso suggesting that zzso will bind to a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso found in several zzso zzso factors, are distinguished by the presence of a zzso zzso that may increase their intrinsic affinity for zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso acids at all specificity determining positions suggests that zzso within zzso complexes will interact with DNA zzso zzso
