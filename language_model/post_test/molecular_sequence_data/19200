zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) channels mediate a number of zzso events in developing and mature cells, and are implicated in neurological and cardiovascular zzso In zzso there are three distinct zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso that differ in their zzso as well as in zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso The zzso is a large gene that contains 38 zzso and is localized in zzso zzso Only basic characteristics of the zzso gene promoter region have been investigated zzso it as a zzso sequence containing several potential zzso zzso zzso Here, we cloned and characterized a zzso promoter region and initiated the analysis of zzso factors that control zzso zzso channel expression using the zzso zzso gene as a zzso We isolated a zzso zzso region of zzso and verified its zzso activity in the mouse zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso analysis revealed that this region possesses a zzso minimal promoter that includes two potential zzso start sites and four binding sites for the zzso factor zzso The ability of one of these sites to interact with the zzso factor was confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso enhanced promoter activity while zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the level of zzso zzso protein and reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso currents expressed in the zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control zzso zzso channel zzso
