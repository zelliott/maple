The zzso gene of zzso zzso is a member of a set of genes that displays increased zzso in response to treatments that produce DNA zzso or to zzso zzso Other members of this group include the zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene demonstrates the presence of two overlapping open reading zzso each of which has the capacity to zzso a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45 zzso zzso of the zzso coding sequences to zzso demonstrates that only one of these frames is expressed in zzso zzso The protein predicted from this sequence is extremely zzso and contains multiple repeats of the zzso sequence zzso where X is either zzso or zzso Additionally, closely related sequences are found throughout the primary zzso zzso extension data indicate that, after zzso and zzso treatments, there are three major and two minor zzso start sites which are zzso The function of the zzso gene was investigated by zzso this gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells containing the zzso gene disruption were isolated after zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso showed a slightly altered sensitivity to killing by zzso and to heat shock compared with the zzso zzso the spontaneous zzso rate of zzso of a zzso zzso was reduced 6- to zzso in the zzso zzso These results zzso the zzso gene in the production or recovery of zzso in zzso zzso
