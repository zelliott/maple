zzso zzso zzso exert potent zzso and zzso zzso In addition, they have been shown to be zzso but the mechanisms of these actions are still poorly zzso To isolate proteins that may control zzso zzso function or trafficking, we performed a zzso screen using the zzso fourth zzso tail of the zzso zzso as zzso This screen identified the zzso precursor like protein 1 zzso a zzso of the zzso precursor protein involved in Alzheimer's disease, as zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso revealed that zzso specifically interacts with all three human zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso analysis confined the zzso domain involved in binding to zzso receptors to the 13 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso receptors confirmed the zzso zzso treatment tended to increase the amount of zzso zzso associated with zzso while zzso were not affected by the state of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso laser zzso showed that zzso causes a considerable shift of the zzso zzso zzso from plasma membrane to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso into zzso cells significantly increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a possible role of zzso in regulation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we speculate that this interaction may present one mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso exert their zzso zzso
