A number of studies have suggested that zzso peptides can be used in the design of a new generation of prosthetic implants to promote the successful zzso of the implant zzso In the current study, the in zzso zzso of several peptides representing zzso zzso sequences of bone zzso zzso toward an zzso cell line zzso were examined to provide insight into the molecular basis of zzso interaction with bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were coated on polystyrene surfaces in zzso zzso zzso culture plates, and their zzso adhesive properties compared to intact zzso and zzso as positive zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso were found to be the most potent in their adhesive activity, increasing the number of adherent cells to zzso of control levels at an added concentration of 1 zzso Since these two peptides were equivalent in zzso it is suggested that the region zzso beyond the zzso domain is not necessary for cell zzso In comparison, peptides zzso and zzso were only active at zzso greater than 200 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso of cell suspensions with solution phase zzso suggesting that a portion of the zzso adhesive effects was specific and zzso although other zzso zzso regions were probably also involved in the mechanism of zzso zzso a modified zzso zzso in which an zzso acid zzso at position 288 of the zzso sequence was replaced by a zzso acid zzso to form zzso was completely inactive as a cell zzso stimulus at zzso up to 200 zzso Thus, despite the potential role of zzso zzso regions, an intact zzso zzso was essential for all of the adhesive activity of the zzso zzso
