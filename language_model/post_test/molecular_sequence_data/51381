We present a comprehensive strategy for detailed characterization of the solution zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our experimental strategy generates a number of zzso spatial constraints that is sufficiently large to allow us to determine zzso linkage zzso with a precision zzso zzso In addition to the commonly used zzso zzso contacts between zzso zzso our constraints are: zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso to other zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isotope effects of zzso zzso groups on zzso chemical shifts, and zzso long-range zzso zzso zzso across zzso zzso We have used this approach to study the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso determined geometrical constraints were compared to results obtained from zzso calculations based on zzso zzso Carlo zzso The zzso was found to exist in 2 families of zzso The preferred zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso are best described by an equilibrium of 2 zzso with zzso angles at zzso degrees or 180 degrees and of the 3 staggered zzso of the omega angle with a zzso zzso zzso Three zzso hydrogen bonds, involving the zzso zzso on zzso and zzso of the zzso acid zzso and on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contribute significantly to the zzso stability of the zzso in zzso zzso
