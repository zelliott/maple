zzso is a zzso protein ubiquitous in bacteria and zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein is involved in the folding of a wide variety of other proteins in the zzso being essential to the zzso The folding activity proceeds through strong zzso changes zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso alternative to folding have been previously described for zzso in different bacterial groups, supporting enormous functional and structural plasticity for this zzso and the existence of a hidden zzso code in the protein sequence enabling such zzso Describing this plasticity can shed light on the functional diversity of zzso We zzso that different overlapping sets of zzso acids zzso within zzso zzso and between both these zzso Shifts in these zzso relationships may inevitably lead to evolution of alternative zzso 

We conducted the first zzso analyses in an extensive bacterial zzso revealing complex networks of evolutionary zzso between zzso in zzso These networks differed among bacterial groups and involved zzso acid sites with functional importance and others with previously zzso functional zzso zzso networks formed statistically independent units among bacterial groups and map to structurally continuous regions in the zzso suggesting their functional zzso Sites involved in zzso fell within narrow structural regions, supporting dynamic zzso functional links involving similar protein zzso Moreover, zzso sites within a bacterial group mapped to regions previously identified as involved in zzso functions, and thus, zzso may mediate alternative zzso 

Our results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of zzso across the entire bacterial zzso Evidence on the functional importance of zzso sites illuminates the as yet unappreciated functional diversity of zzso
