In a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso an zzso precursor called zzso The polarization of this cell zzso its zzso zzso in addition to inducing zzso fate in one daughter zzso zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso including a newly identified zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas only a subset of these genes is required for proper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes thought to act downstream of zzso appear not to be required for zzso orientation, suggesting that zzso represents a branch point in the control of zzso induction and zzso zzso Orientation of the zzso zzso does not require gene zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso signaling may directly target the zzso in a responding zzso
