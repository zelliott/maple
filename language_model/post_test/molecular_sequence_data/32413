zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso to form zzso zzso Whether the zzso reaction uses the same reaction intermediate as the zzso reaction or the zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso has been investigated by zzso analysis of the reaction products in a zzso zzso No zzso of zzso was observed for the newly formed zzso This result strongly suggests that the zzso reaction uses the same reaction intermediate as the zzso zzso In contrast with an earlier zzso the zzso reaction is zzso which also supports a zzso zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso The binding and zzso properties of zzso from both zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso were determined by equilibrium binding and transient kinetic zzso A complete set of kinetic zzso for both the zzso and zzso reactions according to a unified kinetic mechanism was determined for both zzso and zzso The results show that the two zzso have significantly different binding and zzso properties, in accordance with the significant sequence differences between zzso
