The coat protein zzso gene of rice stripe virus was introduced into two zzso varieties of rice by zzso of zzso The zzso transgenic plants expressed the zzso at high levels (up to zzso of total soluble zzso and exhibited a significant level of resistance to virus zzso Plants derived from zzso progeny of the primary zzso also expressed the zzso and showed viral resistance, indicating stable transmission of the zzso gene and the trait of resistance to the next zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso strip zzso protein was not detected in transgenic plants expressing zzso 8 weeks after zzso indicating protection before viral zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso resistance to virus infection can be extended to zzso and to the viruses transmitted by an insect zzso zzso
