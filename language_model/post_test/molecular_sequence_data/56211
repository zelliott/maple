zzso zzso transition of a zzso sequence to a novel DNA zzso called zzso In this paper, the structural characteristics of this altered DNA zzso are zzso zzso of zzso is induced at zinc zzso higher than 70 zzso zzso zzso 2) and it is zzso by negative zzso and low zzso zzso Two different structural zzso of the zzso sequence are observed upon increasing the zinc zzso At low zinc concentration zzso zzso zzso half of the zzso strand falls back upon itself giving rise to the formation of an zzso zzso triplex zzso At higher zinc zzso the complete zzso strand is zzso and an zzso hairpin is formed zzso Protection towards zzso modification suggests that zinc binds to the zzso group of zzso zzso in the zzso with a higher affinity than in zzso The zzso constant of the zzso complex is estimated to be in the range of zzso M to zzso zzso
