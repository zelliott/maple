We studied zzso plasmids zzso high-level zzso zzso These plasmids were found in zzso zzso zzso from two geographic locations in the United zzso Transfer genes on three zzso resistance plasmids with different restriction zzso profiles were indistinguishable by DNA zzso from those on zzso a zzso zzso resistance zzso representative of similar plasmids that are prevalent in the United zzso One zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso was smaller than zzso zzso zzso because of the absence from zzso of DNA, found on zzso that contained genes zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso ammonium compounds flanked by directly repeated copies of the zzso sequence zzso element zzso The plasmids zzso and zzso were otherwise indistinguishable except for the presence in zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The added zzso resistance gene was flanked by two directly repeated copies of zzso The zzso sequence of DNA zzso to the outside of the IS zzso as well as those of the elements themselves, was identical in both zzso and zzso and there were no target site zzso zzso either copy of the zzso We conclude that the zzso resistance gene was added to an existing zzso zzso in conjunction with the deletion of other resistance genes by zzso at IS zzso The construction of zzso plasmids carrying a zzso resistance gene may be a model for the mobility of other resistance genes newly acquired by zzso
