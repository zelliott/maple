zzso peripheral zzso T cells zzso 1 T zzso are resistant to zzso zzso After prolonged zzso treatment, these T cells become zzso zzso zzso 6 T zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso resistance, day 1 and day 6 T cells were tested for formation of the zzso zzso signaling complex zzso zzso active zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also referred to as zzso 8 was only found in zzso day 6 T zzso zzso of zzso and protein expression levels of zzso molecules zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso cell protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso showed that only the expression level of zzso correlated with T cell resistance to zzso zzso zzso 1 T zzso zzso day 6 T zzso zzso In T cells activated in zzso zzso of zzso has previously been correlated with general zzso zzso However, the experiments presented suggest that resistance to zzso zzso in T cells can also be regulated at the level of recruitment of zzso to the zzso
