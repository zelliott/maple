A zzso clone was isolated for a fourth zzso gene zzso a putative plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso The sequence of the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with those of other known plant zzso revealing a higher identity with the zzso zzso proteins zzso than with the other three zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso This supports the view that there are two zzso zzso which probably arose from a gene zzso predating the separation of the zzso and zzso plant zzso Measured zzso transcript levels indicate that zzso is similarly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and flower zzso contrary to the zzso zzso whose members displayed differential expression according to the zzso
