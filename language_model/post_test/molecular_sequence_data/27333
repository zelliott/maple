zzso protein synthesis enables the rapid production and engineering of zzso zzso zzso zzso systems differ substantially from each other with respect to efficiency, zzso and the ability to produce functional zzso zzso Here we describe zzso zzso sequences zzso that mediate efficient zzso protein synthesis in multiple zzso and zzso systems, presumably through bypassing the early translation initiation zzso We use these leaders in combination with targeted suppression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to create a zzso system based on this zzso The system can be directly programmed with zzso zzso products, enabling rapid generation of large protein libraries and protein zzso zzso zzso extract can produce up to 300 zzso of zzso protein in 2 zzso We further demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso interactions can be zzso analyzed directly in the translation zzso using fluorescent zzso correlation zzso
