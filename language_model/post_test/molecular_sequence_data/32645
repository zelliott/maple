The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against prostate stem cell zzso zzso prevents prostate tumor establishment, growth, and zzso in zzso zzso To further delineate in zzso targeting properties, zzso was zzso with zzso and evaluated in nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso activity ranged from zzso to zzso injected dose per gram zzso at 24 to 96 hours zzso To extend the clinical zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was produced that exhibited specific binding to zzso and significant zzso effect over zzso in established zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso However, low expression yields and instability prompted us to zzso zzso by zzso the complementary determining regions onto the stable, human zzso framework of zzso zzso zzso Two humanized zzso zzso versions (A and zzso that differed in the number of zzso zzso present in the zzso half of zzso were zzso zzso binding studies demonstrated affinities of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso representing a zzso zzso zzso targeting of version B zzso with I was evaluated by serial zzso zzso zzso tumor targeting of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 94 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of tumor growth by zzso was demonstrated in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this model, the zzso was zzso whereas the zzso exhibited approximately 50% zzso zzso These data support further development of zzso zzso zzso for targeted imaging and therapy for tumors of zzso zzso
