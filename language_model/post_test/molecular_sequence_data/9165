zzso hormone zzso a key zzso regulating reproduction in zzso has now been characterized in a number of zzso zzso Despite the demonstration of its ancestral origin, the structure and the function of this family of peptides remain poorly known in species as distant as zzso In this study, two zzso peptides zzso and zzso were characterized by mass zzso from extracts of the visceral zzso of the Pacific oyster zzso zzso These peptides showed a high degree of sequence identity with zzso of other zzso and zzso and to a lesser extent with those of zzso or with zzso and zzso of zzso Both the mature peptides and the transcript zzso the precursor protein were exclusively expressed in the visceral zzso zzso differences in zzso activity of zzso zzso gene were recorded in the zzso along the zzso cycle and according to zzso conditions with a higher level in fed animals compared to starved zzso This suggests the involvement of zzso as zzso of nutritional status with energy requirements during reproduction in zzso Evidence for a role of zzso as zzso and as neuroendocrine factors in zzso is zzso
