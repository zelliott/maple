zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso determines the specificity of promoter zzso by making zzso contacts with zzso We examined the effects of two single zzso zzso zzso in zzso E on the zzso of zzso derivatives of three different promoters in zzso zzso zzso We found zzso suppression of zzso in all three promoters by each zzso substitution in zzso zzso These results provide strong evidence that zzso E interacts with each of these promoters in zzso Moreover, the specificity of suppression of the zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso E lead us to speculate that the zzso of zzso E closely contacts two adjacent zzso in the zzso region of the zzso
