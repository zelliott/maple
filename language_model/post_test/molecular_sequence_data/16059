The zzso gene zzso produces an zzso that has a long zzso zzso region containing four small open reading frames zzso preceding the protein coding zzso This zzso suppresses the rate by which zzso protein is zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurs when zzso cells are grown under conditions of zzso acid zzso Such zzso zzso requires the zzso protein zzso and the presence of the zzso most zzso zzso In this study we show that a functional zzso between the translation of the first zzso and the amount of the zzso protein is responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our evidence suggests that this zzso involves an increase in the ability of zzso zzso zzso that have translated the first frame to resume scanning and zzso translation at a downstream zzso independently of the base sequence in the intervening zzso
