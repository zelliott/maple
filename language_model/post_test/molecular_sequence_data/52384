The serum acute phase zzso zzso protein zzso is selectively deposited at sites of tissue damage and zzso by zzso into biologically active zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso present in each of the five identical zzso of zzso zzso cell attachment activity in zzso Although the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso sequence at its zzso the zzso zzso itself, as well as several synthetic peptides of zzso failed to inhibit the zzso activity to the zzso zzso zzso containing the sequences responsible for the cell attachment activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to inhibit the zzso zzso cell attachment zzso However, the addition of the zzso and zzso zzso peptides of zzso to cells enhanced attachment to the active zzso from zzso In the converse experiment, the zzso zzso of zzso did not influence cell attachment to zzso or zzso A zzso corresponding to the same stretch of zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso displayed nearly identical zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso neutralized its zzso zzso These zzso reacted with intact zzso and neutralized the zzso activity of zzso zzso The findings suggest that a zzso with zzso activity could be generated from the breakdown of zzso and then contribute directly to cellular events leading to tissue zzso
