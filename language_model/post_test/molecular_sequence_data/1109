The systemic zzso are a zzso group of zzso zzso protein deposition diseases that should be zzso chemically by zzso zzso zzso methods sometimes are required to confirm or identify the zzso type in zzso or zzso tissue zzso We report the results of zzso acid extraction and zzso and zzso characterization of deposits zzso tissue samples from 10 cases of zzso and 3 from zzso zzso zzso light chain deposition zzso The results in 11 of 13 cases demonstrated zzso with the previous zzso and/or zzso data obtained in zzso tissue samples from the same zzso and in 2 of 13, the protein deposits that previously could not be classified by standard zzso methods were identified by zzso acid zzso An additional new finding of zzso rather than zzso fragments as the major constituent protein in 1 case of zzso light chain zzso demonstrated the value of the method and its importance for future zzso
