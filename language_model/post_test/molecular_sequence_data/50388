A zzso X zzso zzso response element was located within the functionally defined zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso A short segment of the zzso that contains this region has been shown with genetic analysis to play a key role in the regulation of zzso function and to represent a major zzso of zzso zzso Both the full-length protein and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso alpha bound to the putative zzso acid response element in the zzso zzso In zzso an zzso zzso gene construct responds to induction with zzso acid when zzso with an zzso alpha expression zzso A zzso transition zzso in the zzso zzso acid response element leads to a dramatic reduction both in the in zzso binding activity of zzso alpha and the in zzso activity of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso acid and the zzso alpha are implicated as being significant zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso gene expression and the zzso disease zzso
