zzso are large, zzso particles that act as the zzso machinery for most of the regulated zzso protein breakdown in zzso zzso zzso are present in both the nucleus and zzso When we analyzed the molecular composition of protein constituents of the nuclear zzso preparation of goldfish zzso by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso followed by sequence analysis, we found a 26 zzso spot identical in zzso acid sequence to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso No spot of other zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Here we describe the zzso sequencing and expression analysis of zzso zzso zzso which encodes one of the zzso beta zzso from goldfish zzso From the screening of an zzso zzso library, two types of zzso were zzso one zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences comprise 239 and zzso zzso zzso These deduced zzso acid sequences are highly zzso to those of zzso zzso of other zzso zzso analysis of nuclear zzso using zzso zzso showed only a spot of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of the goldfish zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in the zzso
