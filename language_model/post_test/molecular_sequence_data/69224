zzso modeling zzso zzso and molecular mechanics calculations zzso V zzso using the X-ray coordinates for zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicate zzso stabilization by the active site, zzso of the developing positive charge on the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso in the zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is indispensable as a general acid catalyst of zzso bond breaking in the zzso reaction and that of bond breaking to the zzso zzso in zzso This demand for zzso seems to be satisfied for the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso but not from the zzso zzso
