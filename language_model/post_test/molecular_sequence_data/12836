The instability of short repetitive sequences in tumor DNA can result from defective repair of replication errors due to zzso in any of several genes required for mismatch zzso zzso this repair zzso and how defects lead to cancer is being facilitated by genetic and zzso studies of tumor cell zzso In the present study, we describe the mismatch repair status of extracts of 22 tumor cell lines derived from several tissue zzso Ten were found to be defective in zzso mismatch repair, including cell lines from tumors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The repair defects were independent of whether the signal for strand zzso a zzso was zzso or 3' to the zzso All 10 defective cell lines exhibited zzso zzso zzso activity was restored to 9 of these 10 extracts by adding a second defective extract made from cell lines having known zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso in zzso (4 zzso and zzso (5 zzso that could explain the observed zzso instability and repair zzso Overall, this study strengthens the correlation between zzso instability and defective mismatch repair and the suggestion that zzso in mismatch repair activity is a step in zzso common to several types of zzso It also provides an extensive panel of zzso and zzso cell lines for future studies of mismatch zzso
