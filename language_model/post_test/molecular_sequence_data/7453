The zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso replication in zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso replication may involve zzso competition with zzso for attachment sites on the plasma membrane of targeted zzso Here we find that the zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso in affinity zzso We also find that zzso to zzso zzso cell attachment to zzso Further zzso zzso cells attach to zzso while their parental cells which do not express zzso do not attach to zzso These data demonstrate that zzso binds to the zzso zzso and supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso replication by binding to the cell surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso
