The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a global regulator that controls zzso initiation from more than 100 promoters by binding to a specific DNA sequence within zzso zzso Many genes in the zzso zzso have been predicted simply based on the presence of zzso sites within gene zzso In this study, we have exploited a newly developed technique, zzso zzso analysis zzso to define zzso zzso Using zzso we identified 176 zzso that were activated by zzso in zzso and 16 zzso that were zzso Using positive control zzso in different regions of zzso we were able to zzso the different promoters into class I or class zzso A total of 104 zzso were predicted to contain Class II zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso that were zzso by zzso revealed different mechanisms for zzso zzso In contrast, the in zzso zzso profiles failed to identify most zzso regulation because of the complexity of the regulatory zzso Analysis of these zzso supports the hypothesis that zzso is not only a regulator of genes required for zzso of zzso other than zzso but also regulates the expression of a large number of other genes in zzso zzso has revealed 152 zzso unknown zzso zzso
