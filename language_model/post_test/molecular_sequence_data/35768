zzso chain reaction zzso protocols were established for specific detection of the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso marker genes of zzso zzso zzso two related zzso The zzso and zzso genes are known to have sequence divergence of up to zzso and zzso zzso Attempts were made to find suitable primer pairs and zzso temperatures to detect each gene without zzso zzso extracted from 36 representative strains of zzso zzso were used in the initial screening with various combinations of primer pairs and zzso zzso The combinations of primer pairs and zzso temperatures selected were then tested with zzso extracted from 227 more strains of zzso zzso and from 133 bacterial strains belonging to 40 species other than zzso zzso zzso protocols zzso pairs and zzso zzso were established that gave identical results to those obtained with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso These protocols established for the zzso and zzso genes could detect 400 zzso zzso zzso of cellular DNA carrying the respective zzso Spike experiments demonstrated that the sensitivities of the established zzso were reduced by a factor of zzso by an zzso present in a normal zzso sample, indicating the need for either DNA extraction or enrichment of the zzso sample in alkaline zzso water for 4 h before the zzso of zzso zzso
