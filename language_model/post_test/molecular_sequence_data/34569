The major aluminum (Al) tolerance gene in wheat zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso from root zzso We determined the zzso structure of the zzso gene and found it consists of 6 zzso interrupted by 5 zzso zzso a range of wheat zzso identified 3 zzso for zzso 1 of which was identical to the zzso gene from an zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso using zzso zzso deletion lines, and loss of zzso coincided with the loss of both Al tolerance and zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance in each of 5 different zzso populations was found to be zzso by a single major zzso When zzso was zzso between the parental lines, zzso and linkage analyses indicated that zzso mapped to zzso zzso and zzso with Al zzso In 2 populations zzso Al tolerance also zzso with a greater capacity for zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance was not associated with a particular coding zzso for zzso but was significantly correlated with the relative level of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the Al tolerance in a diverse range of wheat zzso is primarily zzso by zzso
