The zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes an approximate 40 zzso zzso zzso that is present on the surface of human zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso the variable regions of zzso zzso and constructed plasmids for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli in inclusion bodies that were zzso and zzso to active zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was compared by radioactive binding and competition zzso and by surface zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso binds to cells expressing zzso with a similar affinity as zzso derived zzso from zzso and with a zzso to zzso reduced affinity compared with zzso zzso The cloned zzso can be used to make higher affinity zzso and zzso that could be useful for various types of zzso
