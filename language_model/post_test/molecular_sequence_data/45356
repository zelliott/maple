In order to develop a detection method for the rice pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of six zzso zzso species was zzso using the combined zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed tight zzso branches supported by high zzso zzso The high sequence similarity revealed a close zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were divided into three zzso zzso rice zzso whereas the single zzso strain occupied a unique position in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso sequences of all zzso zzso strains examined were highly zzso In contrast, zzso zzso strains demonstrated a far greater sequence diversity, but this diversity did not correlate with zzso host plant or geographical origin of the zzso A zzso protocol using specific zzso from the zzso sequences was designed that allowed the specific detection and identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rice seeds infected with these zzso zzso
