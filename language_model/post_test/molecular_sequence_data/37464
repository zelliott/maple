zzso zzso acid sequences for the two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined by zzso degradation, providing the first sequence information for a zzso from an zzso In addition, zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity in the presence of sodium zzso zzso Although a natural zzso has not yet been identified, a preliminary study of the zzso indicated a zzso of zzso for zzso and an initial rate of zzso zzso per zzso per zzso zzso values consistent with a significant role for this zzso in the innate immune system of zzso zzso Moreover, after separation of zzso by alkaline zzso gel zzso the only zzso zzso activity coincided with the two zzso zzso The zzso of this primitive zzso may fulfill dual functions, both as oxygen carrier and as the zzso crucial for host zzso
