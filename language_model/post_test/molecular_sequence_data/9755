zzso is a key regulatory protein that defines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso can zzso zzso and zzso zzso currents and zzso An zzso in zzso expression is a possible zzso by which these zzso zzso cardiac zzso To test this hypothesis, primary cultures of zzso rat zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso or both, and the level of zzso transcripts was examined by Northern zzso zzso zzso transcript levels were decreased approximately equal to 50% zzso zzso zzso in cells exposed to 2 zzso zzso beta (20 hours), whereas zzso had no zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso beta also reduced zzso protein levels zzso of control, P zzso zzso The effects on transcript levels were gene zzso zzso beta induced transcripts for zzso NO zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso beta showed no zzso in zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso of contraction and relaxation and zzso zzso of zzso but were unresponsive to zzso zzso Studies performed in the presence of zzso zzso showed that the effect of zzso beta on zzso transcript levels was blocked by zzso was insensitive to zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso but was enhanced by the addition of the protein zzso inhibitor zzso These data demonstrate that zzso beta alters the expression of zzso a key regulator of cardiac zzso at both the transcript and protein zzso The results suggest novel mechanisms by which zzso beta may modify cardiac zzso
