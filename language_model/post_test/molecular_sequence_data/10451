zzso is a small zzso and zzso protein in zzso coli that is involved in several different biological zzso including stimulation of specialized DNA zzso events and regulation of gene zzso zzso protein and zzso levels rapidly increase during early zzso growth phase in response to a nutritional zzso but become virtually zzso during late zzso and stationary zzso We present evidence that the growth zzso zzso expression pattern is not determined by changes in zzso stability, arguing in favor of regulation at the level of zzso DNA deletion analysis of the zzso promoter zzso P) region indicated that DNA sequences from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site are required for maximum zzso A DNA sequence resembling the integration host factor zzso binding site centered approximately at zzso showed zzso I zzso protection by zzso In zzso cells, maximum cellular levels of zzso zzso were decreased more than zzso and zzso from zzso P on a zzso was decreased about zzso compared to those in cells expressing zzso zzso In addition, a zzso in the zzso binding site resulted in a 76 and zzso reduction in zzso from zzso P on a zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso of 5 or 10 zzso between this zzso site and zzso P suggest that zzso functions in a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso plays a role in stimulating zzso from zzso P by interacting with a site centered approximately at zzso relative to the start of zzso We also showed that although the zzso P region contains six zzso binding sites, zzso site II zzso at zzso played a zzso role in zzso zzso sites I and III zzso at zzso and zzso zzso seemingly played smaller roles, and no role in negative zzso could be attributed to zzso sites IV, zzso and VI zzso upstream of site zzso The zzso P region from zzso to zzso which is not directly regulated by either zzso or zzso retained the characteristic zzso regulation pattern in response to a nutritional zzso
