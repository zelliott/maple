The zzso proteins bind to zzso family zzso with high zzso thus controlling the interaction of zzso with their zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso enriched in zzso cells and forms a complex with zzso 3, a zzso localized to the zzso plasma zzso We generated here a set of zzso point zzso with zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso displayed a spectrum of different zzso binding zzso The in zzso and in zzso binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the zzso zzso with zzso 3 correlated well with their ability to zzso zzso from zzso 3 complexes when zzso in zzso zzso Even the zzso zzso that do not zzso bind zzso 3 were membrane associated in zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso interaction is not the sole zzso of zzso protein membrane zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was shown to inhibit the zzso delivery of influenza virus zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso unable to bind zzso 3 behaved differently in the zzso transport zzso While one of the zzso tested had no effect, one inhibited and one enhanced the zzso transport of zzso This implies that zzso function in zzso membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the zzso 3 zzso
