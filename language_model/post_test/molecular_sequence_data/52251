The relationship of structural and functional zzso on zzso is important in all venues of cell zzso In this study, we investigate the effect of zzso modification on zzso zzso zzso zzso containing different zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to modify zzso zzso at three different positions in a zzso zzso The short zzso zzso (where zzso represents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the longer zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, 75, and zzso The modification of these different zzso is shown to be zzso At zzso zzso levels of zzso only zzso is zzso suggesting that modification of this zzso is directed by both the binding of calcium to zzso zzso III and IV and the zzso pocket exposed between these two zzso as a result of calcium zzso At higher calcium zzso zzso 200 zzso where sites I and II become zzso modification of zzso or zzso also was zzso All the modified zzso were able to stimulate zzso zzso fully although the zzso for the zzso and zzso derivatives increased zzso and zzso zzso None of the modifications affected the zzso of zzso plasma membrane zzso Only the zzso zzso zzso showed efficient zzso zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso derivatives did not show efficient zzso zzso to this zzso
