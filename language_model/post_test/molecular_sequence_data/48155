The zzso sex of many zzso zzso including zzso can be zzso altered by treating zzso or larvae with varied temperatures or zzso zzso To zzso the sex determination zzso especially the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso sex differentiation in the Japanese flounder, we generated two populations of larvae, both having zzso zzso zzso but each growing up to display all zzso females or zzso by rearing the larvae at normal (18 degrees zzso or high (27 degrees zzso water temperatures from days 30 to 100 after zzso zzso The larvae zzso were produced artificially by mating normal females zzso with zzso zzso males zzso which had been zzso to zzso males by zzso To study the role of zzso in sex determination in the flounder, we first isolated a zzso zzso containing the complete open reading frame from the zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso and zzso but zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso in zzso during sex differentiation showed that there was no difference in the levels of zzso zzso between the female and male groups when the zzso was sexually indifferent zzso 50 after zzso However, after the initiation of sex differentiation zzso zzso the zzso levels increased rapidly in the female group, whereas they decreased slightly in the male zzso Similarly, zzso levels rose remarkably in the female group, yet remained constant in the male zzso These results suggest that induction of sex reversal of genetically female larvae to zzso males by rearing them at a high water temperature caused a suppression of zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we suggest that the maintenance of zzso zzso at very low levels is a prerequisite for zzso zzso while the increased levels are indispensable for zzso zzso
