The zzso influenza virus zzso zzso and its bovine zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate factors that influence zzso of influenza virus for zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso at zzso 165 of the zzso zzso zzso was found to replicate to a much higher zzso in mouse lung than the parent zzso and had acquired zzso for zzso Further adaptation of zzso by sequential lung passage in mice yielded a strain of greater zzso zzso 10, in which a change at zzso 246 of zzso resulted in loss of a second potential zzso zzso zzso is highly sensitive to zzso in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso viruses indicated that resistance to zzso zzso can account for the enhanced zzso of zzso but not for the further increase in zzso of zzso Evidence is presented that zzso 246 is not in fact zzso in zzso zzso nor presumably in the parent zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso displayed functional differences from zzso including a change in the optimum pH of fusion and a minor change in zzso zzso which may allow improved efficiency of replication in the mouse zzso
