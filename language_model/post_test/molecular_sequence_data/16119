The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene region for nitrogen fixation zzso is zzso zzso regions corresponding to the 19 known zzso genes (including zzso and zzso could be zzso An additional open reading frame of 216 zzso called zzso was detected between zzso and zzso Search for zzso signal structures revealed some unusual features: zzso several possible zzso motifs are present in the zzso regions between zzso and zzso as well as between zzso and zzso zzso a perfect zzso zzso preceding the zzso promoter, is located within an zzso repeat zzso zzso structures resembling the consensus zzso promoter are found within the coding regions of zzso and zzso and, together with a zzso zzso in zzso Typical zzso termination structures were detected only downstream from the zzso and the zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed the presence of two zzso clusters in the zzso zzso zzso This arrangement of zzso zzso is normally present only in zzso A high degree of zzso between the two gene products zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso component I structural proteins zzso and zzso was zzso All four proteins are characterized by the zzso motif zzso which may play a role in binding the zzso zzso
