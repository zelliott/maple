zzso sequence factor 1 zzso is a nuclear zzso activity that is found in zzso and zzso It interacts with several zzso elements that have been characterized from viral and zzso zzso the prototypes of which are the zzso element of the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso element from the zzso zzso zzso This class of zzso elements can respond to zzso and salicylic acid zzso zzso with these zzso we have shown that zzso can interact with promoter elements of an zzso tobacco gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the nuclear factors that make up zzso activity in zzso will be an important step toward understanding this induction zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso proteins are good candidates for the zzso nuclear zzso However, there may be as many as seven distinct zzso genes in zzso five of which have now been zzso In this study, we expressed the zzso that zzso four of these five zzso zzso factors in zzso and compared their zzso behavior using two types of zzso zzso With specific zzso prepared against three of the five known zzso zzso factors, we also investigated the relative abundance of these three proteins within the zzso activities of root and leaf nuclear zzso Our results indicate that these zzso factors bind to DNA with different degrees of zzso and their relative affinity toward zzso also can differ zzso The results of a zzso zzso suggested that only one of the three zzso factors represented a significant component of nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises approximately 33 and 50% of the zzso activity detected in root and leaf nuclear extracts zzso These results suggest that each member of the zzso factor family may be zzso regulated and that they may play different roles by virtue of their distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, since transcripts for each of these factors can be detected in various plant zzso zzso regulation may play an important part in determining their contribution to nuclear zzso in a given cell zzso
