Roots of zzso zzso zzso were sampled from a zzso in zzso UK and spores of an zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso were obtained from the surrounding zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were amplified from both roots and spores using either the universal forward primer zzso or the zzso primer zzso with the reverse zzso primer zzso zzso products were cloned and zzso Both spores and roots yielded sequences related to those known from zzso within the zzso with up to four distinct zzso sequences obtained from individual zzso The zzso zzso site varied considerably in sequence and only a subset of zzso sequences were amplified when the zzso primer was zzso In addition to zzso zzso a number of different zzso apparently from zzso were obtained from both root and spore zzso
