The growth factor zzso bone zzso proteins zzso and related factors regulate cell zzso differentiation and zzso controlling the development and maintenance of most zzso Their signals are transmitted through the zzso of the zzso zzso proteins by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso leading to the nuclear zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso Here we report that zzso which mediates zzso signals, is also a target of zzso zzso zzso through zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs at specific zzso within the region linking the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso by the zzso family of zzso protein zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso of zzso which affects zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, zzso receives opposing regulatory zzso through zzso and zzso and it is this balance that determines the level of zzso activity in the nucleus, and so possibly the role of zzso in the control of cell zzso
