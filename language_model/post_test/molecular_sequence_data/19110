In the current model of translation initiation by the scanning zzso zzso promotes an open zzso of the zzso zzso competent for rapidly loading the zzso zzso complex zzso in a zzso zzso zzso capable of sampling triplets entering the P site while blocking accommodation of zzso in the zzso state and preventing completion of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso All of these functions should be reversed by zzso zzso from the zzso complex zzso on zzso zzso We tested this model by selecting zzso zzso zzso that suppress the elevated zzso initiation and reduced rate of zzso loading in zzso zzso by an zzso zzso substitution that eliminates a direct contact of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso increase zzso affinity for zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso predicted to eliminate zzso zzso with zzso zzso both reduces the rate of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso state of zzso binding in zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso of zzso or zzso These findings establish that zzso zzso from the zzso zzso is required for the zzso mode of zzso binding and zzso recognition and that increasing zzso affinity for the zzso zzso increases initiation accuracy in zzso Our results further demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso promote accuracy by controlling zzso zzso and the stability of zzso binding to the zzso beyond their roles in regulating zzso zzso by zzso
