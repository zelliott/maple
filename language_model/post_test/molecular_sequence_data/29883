We present a map describing the binding of cellular proteins to a zzso pair zzso region of the human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso long terminal zzso The map accounts for nearly all of the zzso I protection reported in a previous study using crude nuclear zzso zzso features include a complex arrangement of overlapping binding sites encompassing the zzso repeat elements (see accompanying zzso as well as binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso that significantly zzso from the previously defined consensus recognition zzso Based on the binding results, we constructed simple zzso promoters containing zzso repeat zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso sites upstream of a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that these promoters are expressed in zzso and are regulated by the viral zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso and nuclear factor I sites zzso zzso suggesting that one or both of these proteins play a role in zzso the zzso zzso by the zzso repeat zzso
