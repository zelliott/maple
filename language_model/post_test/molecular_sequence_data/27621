The effect of the protein environment on the reaction sequence and the relative rates of two zzso reactions involved in the zzso of complex zzso in zzso has been explored by comparing the processing of zzso zzso either free or bound to zzso By use of zzso and zzso zzso the display of the zzso in a zzso and zzso association with the zzso surface could also be zzso zzso II removes two Man zzso from the zzso zzso to yield zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and product showed that the first Man is removed from the zzso of the zzso The rate zzso for the first and second step zzso by direct analysis of the zzso by zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso were determined to be about zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the free zzso In the zzso complex zzso was reduced zzso and the zzso step could not be observed under the same zzso In the zzso complex both zzso and zzso were reduced about zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso to yield the product zzso with the zzso linked either 2-3 or 2-6 to the Gal zzso The zzso zzso showed that the first step involved the Gal on the zzso of the zzso and that both zzso zzso were added zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
