zzso zzso such as zzso defense can reinforce zzso and zzso divergence within zzso zzso Two zzso species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are distributed in both Japan and North America; however, these populations have a longer history in Japan than in North America due to the differing impact of the last zzso on these two zzso We tested the hypothesis that this longer coexistence in Japan would lead to extensive genetic zzso in nuclear and zzso DNA whilst the distinct zzso traits and zzso patterns would be zzso 

The high level of correspondence among zzso traits, distribution, and zzso and nuclear DNA types for the specimens with zzso zzso zzso indicated that the species distinction has been zzso However, a zzso between zzso and nuclear zzso types was observed for most specimens that had zzso zzso zzso consistent with the pattern seen between the two species in North zzso This observation suggests nuclear zzso from zzso zzso into zzso zzso without zzso zzso 

The separation of zzso traits and distribution ranges of the two zzso species in Japan, as well as in North America, has been zzso despite large differences in zzso and geographical histories of these two zzso Variations in environmental factors, such as zzso pressure, might affect maintenance of the distribution, although the further studies are needed to confirm zzso
