zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is strongly implicated in bone zzso The human zzso K gene is highly expressed in zzso and gene zzso cause zzso an zzso zzso skeletal zzso To investigate the evolutionary zzso of zzso K across species, the mouse zzso K gene was zzso A mouse heart zzso zzso zzso contained the 3' untranslated region, mature zzso coding zzso and most of the zzso The remainder of the gene was amplified from mouse zzso zzso using zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso The gene contained a zzso open reading frame, predicting a zzso zzso The structure of the protein included a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso mature zzso Two potential zzso sites were identified, one in the zzso and one in the mature zzso The zzso untranslated region was 135 zzso The 3' untranslated region was 470 zzso including a zzso zzso tract and contained two zzso zzso The mouse zzso K zzso and zzso acid sequences were highly zzso with the human, zzso and chicken zzso across the zzso and mature zzso The mouse zzso K gene was isolated from an zzso zzso library, and characterization of its zzso structure and zzso sizes revealed zzso with the initiation zzso in zzso 2 and termination zzso in zzso 8, a zzso organization that was highly zzso with its human zzso The availability of the mouse zzso K zzso and zzso sequences will facilitate generation of a mouse model of zzso K zzso by gene zzso
