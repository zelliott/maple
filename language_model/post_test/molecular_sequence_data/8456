Among the known colonization factors of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso (the common zzso in the zzso family of zzso zzso are two of the most prevalent zzso zzso found in clinical zzso but are never expressed by the same zzso zzso We manipulated the genetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso so that these two important colonization factors are expressed simultaneously in attenuated zzso zzso live oral vaccine strain zzso zzso including after growth in liquid medium zzso is poorly expressed by zzso zzso in broth zzso The zzso zzso structures produced by zzso zzso are zzso indistinguishable from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso and are recognized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso construct may prove useful in investigating the live zzso approach to zzso of zzso zzso zzso
