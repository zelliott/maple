zzso is an zzso peripheral membrane protein involved in the zzso of zzso proteins across the zzso zzso The direct interaction of zzso with zzso proteins was demonstrated by means of chemical zzso with zzso zzso a model zzso zzso carries either an zzso or zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso proteins derived from zzso zzso were used as zzso zzso The interaction was zzso None of the control zzso which are as zzso as zzso was zzso with zzso zzso The interaction was signal zzso The interaction was increasingly enhanced as the number of positively charged zzso acid zzso at the zzso region of the signal zzso was increased, irrespective of the species of zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso Finally, zzso was observed between the efficiency of interaction and that of zzso among zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that precursors of zzso proteins interact with zzso to initiate the zzso zzso
