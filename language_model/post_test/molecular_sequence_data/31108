A random primed zzso zzso library was constructed from donors plasma presumably infected by zzso zzso non-B zzso zzso zzso agent and zzso with serum pooled from patients with acute or chronic zzso Twelve zzso zzso clones zzso zzso associated with HC infection in Japan as well as in the USA were zzso Of these one clone consisting of 114 zzso and showing a discrete band on an zzso analysis, was extensively zzso The clone is not derived from the host DNA zzso one zzso specific and highly sensitive for serum from patients with HC and has no zzso to the zzso sequences of known human viruses including zzso zzso and D zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso virus type 1 or Japanese encephalitis zzso These results suggest that this clone is derived from the zzso of HC zzso
