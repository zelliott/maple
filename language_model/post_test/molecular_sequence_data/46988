zzso of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso during zzso Here, we isolate the zzso gene promoter and define the functional promoter region, which is inactive in normal cells but active in tumor zzso zzso directly interacts with the zzso promoter and activates its zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso or repression of zzso can alter zzso promoter activities in normal or tumor zzso Furthermore, we detect high levels of zzso protein in tumor cells compared with normal zzso The ability of zzso to zzso the activity of the zzso promoter and, zzso the zzso zzso may contribute to its ability to promote tumor zzso
