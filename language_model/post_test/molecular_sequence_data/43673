Nuclear magnetic resonance and circular zzso experiments were used to investigate the stability and dynamic aspects of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso in zzso This unusually shaped zzso with its two widely spaced zzso zzso linked by a connecting zzso has been hypothesized to serve as a zzso zzso most likely playing a role in zzso assembly and/or maintaining the zzso active zzso of zzso zzso Protection factors for zzso zzso exchange were zzso measured in an extensive series of zzso experiments, providing zzso of the stability and dynamics of localized regions of the zzso zzso show that each of the two zzso zzso contains a highly stable zzso The exposed central zzso that connects the two zzso is zzso in solution, albeit not zzso a result that is supported by zzso zzso protection factors, circular zzso zzso and zzso and zzso chemical shift index zzso A zzso zzso and zzso loop in the zzso domain is ordered and quite stable, a surprising result, since this loop had been presumed to be zzso in the original zzso zzso Interestingly, the most dynamic parts of the protein are the regions that contain the likely zzso zzso in each of the two zzso The present results add further support to the notion that the zzso protein plays an architectural role within the zzso with the central zzso serving as a molecular strut, or perhaps a spring, linking the two widely spaced zzso zzso
