To identify physical and genetic anchor zzso on bovine zzso 13 zzso obtained after the screening of partial bovine zzso libraries with the zzso zzso zzso were mapped by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso zzso yielded a specific signal on one of the bovine zzso and identified the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso produced zzso signals on many zzso The zzso regions were zzso and zzso The sequence information revealed that the two zzso zzso were derived from bovine satellites zzso and zzso zzso A zzso located in the zzso region of zzso zzso 17 zzso had features of a zzso zzso zzso were designed for eight of the zzso zzso and seven of these zzso were zzso with between three and eight zzso on a set of zzso reference zzso The zzso and zzso mapped zzso can now be used to physically anchor other bovine zzso markers by linkage zzso The zzso zzso were also applied to DNA samples of a previously characterized panel of zzso hybrid cell lines, allowing the assignment of seven zzso zzso to defined zzso zzso These assignments confirmed earlier mapping results, revealed a probable case of false zzso and placed two formerly zzso zzso groups on specific zzso
