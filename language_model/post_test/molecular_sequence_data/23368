Analysis of sequence variation among members of a single species offers a potential approach to identify functional DNA elements responsible for biological features unique to that zzso Due to its high rate of zzso zzso and ease of genetic zzso we chose the sea zzso zzso zzso to explore zzso sequence comparisons for zzso zzso A large number of zzso zzso specimens were collected from four continents, and a set of zzso intervals were zzso zzso and analyzed to determine the zzso rates at each zzso in the zzso We found that regions with low zzso rates efficiently demarcated functionally constrained zzso these include a set of zzso zzso which we showed in zzso zzso transgenic zzso to act as zzso zzso as well as the location of coding zzso This illustrates that comparisons of multiple members of a species can be used for zzso zzso suggesting a path for the zzso of the zzso zzso of organisms occupying zzso zzso branches of the animal zzso It also raises the possibility that the zzso of a large number of Homo sapiens individuals might be used to zzso the human zzso and identify sequences defining traits unique to our zzso
