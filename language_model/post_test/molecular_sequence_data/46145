zzso of the zzso of zzso signaling zzso family function as zzso feedback zzso of zzso signaling via the zzso zzso Although several zzso zzso have been identified in zzso their zzso functions remain largely zzso In this study, we identified in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso (named zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 205 zzso and shares extensive overall identities zzso with those of known fish zzso In zzso analyses revealed that, like typical zzso zzso possesses a zzso inhibitor region zzso a zzso zzso 2 zzso domain, and a zzso box zzso Under zzso conditions zzso expression was zzso in increasing order, in blood, brain, heart, zzso liver, zzso muscle, and zzso Experimental infection of zzso with a bacterial pathogen induced significant zzso expression in zzso zzso liver, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in head kidney zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso as well as zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso respiratory burst activity, zzso oxide production, and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso and that regulated expression of zzso is required for optimal innate immune response against bacterial zzso
