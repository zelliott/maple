The sequences and structures of zzso P zzso of some zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso are very different than those of other zzso In order to expand our understanding of the structure and evolution of zzso P zzso in zzso bacteria, gene sequences zzso zzso P zzso from 10 additional species from this evolutionary group have been determined, doubling the number of sequences available for comparative zzso The enlarged data set allows refinement of the secondary structure model of these unusual zzso P zzso and the identification of potential zzso interactions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso The zzso sequences suggest that zzso P zzso underwent an abrupt, dramatic restructuring in the ancestry of the zzso zzso bacteria after the divergence of the branches leading to the zzso and zzso and the remaining zzso zzso zzso The unusual structures of the zzso P zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are apparently derived from zzso with zzso structure rather than from zzso partially restructured ancestral zzso The structure of the zzso P zzso from the zzso zzso zzso supports the relationship of this zzso with zzso and zzso rather than the zzso and zzso as suggested by the sequences of their zzso zzso zzso
