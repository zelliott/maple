zzso zzso is a threatening agricultural insect in tropical and zzso areas and accounts for tremendous annual crop zzso As seen in virtually all insect species, zzso zzso zzso are crucial to zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso was studied through expressed sequence tags zzso zzso One of SP zzso was chosen for detailed study, because the expression of the gene was zzso and larvae zzso zzso was conducted as a model of its evolution, structure, and potential binding activity with corresponding zzso zzso is composed of 255 zzso acids including a signal zzso at zzso followed by a putative zzso zzso and the mature protein along with five putative zzso sites, three zzso bridges, and two zzso zzso At least nine zzso motifs were obtained in multiple sequence zzso Some zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as six zzso at position 66, 82, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso After zzso modeling and molecular dynamics zzso the zzso three-dimensional zzso structure of zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso surface area analysis was applied to anticipate optimal binding mode and crucial active sites of this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are crucial for the zzso binding and zzso zzso This information can be used in logical design of zzso zzso New zzso may be a basis for development of a new zzso control zzso
