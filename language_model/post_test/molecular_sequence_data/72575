We report the characterization of two zzso zzso of zzso mothers against zzso zzso isolated from the mouse and the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, together with a summary of their expression patterns in the zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso and we demonstrate that the zzso domain is necessary and sufficient to zzso this biological zzso This domain also has the potential for zzso zzso as shown in zzso zzso in zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso are zzso proteins by showing a zzso effect of the zzso domain on the zzso by the zzso domain and that the zzso middle domain zzso the activity of the zzso zzso We also mapped the zzso gene to a region on mouse zzso 13 that zzso to a region on human zzso zzso that contains zzso zzso
