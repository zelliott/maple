zzso of human zzso C zzso precursor to a zzso in the liver requires zzso zzso after a basic zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso connecting the light and heavy zzso zzso human zzso C zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso and its zzso processing was zzso We found that about zzso of zzso zzso from the milk still retained the zzso and zzso was in the zzso form, indicating inefficient zzso zzso This demonstrates that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells do not process fully the precursor of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso exchange zzso and zzso with novel zzso at positions zzso and 157 were detected in addition to the known zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso was found to be stable both in milk and after zzso it is possible that these new zzso on the zzso side of zzso at zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso could have occurred in the zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that a portion of zzso precursor was zzso processed in zzso zzso zzso differently than those in other expression zzso
