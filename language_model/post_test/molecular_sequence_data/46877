zzso is a component of the zzso zzso system and zzso the zzso zzso Our previous work on zzso coli zzso zzso showed that the lack of the zzso 16 zzso caused a loss of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To define the role of the zzso region of zzso a series of deletion zzso were constructed by zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 4, 7 and 11 zzso led to reduction in the activity to 42, 9 and zzso respectively, relative to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso with zzso deletion zzso was zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a marked increase in zzso zzso for zzso coli zzso zzso accompanied by a zzso decrease in zzso compared with zzso indicating the importance of the zzso region in the interaction with zzso The role of this region in the zzso interaction was investigated by zzso of zzso or zzso complex with zzso a zzso zzso in the presence of folate zzso The resulting zzso zzso products were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso After zzso by zzso zzso the zzso peptides were subjected to zzso zzso An zzso zzso between zzso and zzso of zzso which was not observed in zzso alone and an zzso zzso between zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso In contrast, no such zzso was detected from the zzso product of zzso These results suggest that zzso when it interacts with zzso causes a change in zzso of zzso and that the zzso region of zzso is essential for the zzso change leading to the proper interaction with zzso
