Rex protein of human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso spliced zzso zzso and thus is essential for replication of the zzso This regulation requires a zzso zzso element zzso located in the 3' region of the viral zzso By external zzso we have identified zzso composed of 205 zzso The secondary structure of zzso was confirmed by studies on its zzso to zzso zzso to consist of four zzso and a long stretch of stem zzso zzso and deletion zzso revealed that two regions of the zzso and their secondary structures are essential for zzso zzso Similar secondary structures were found in the corresponding regions of zzso bovine leukemia virus and human zzso zzso Furthermore, a sequence of 11 zzso in the zzso was found to be zzso in the secondary structures of zzso zzso and bovine leukemia zzso These observations suggest that the secondary structure as well as the zzso sequence may be important in expression of zzso zzso even with zzso sequences as observed in these zzso
