Several groups have applied and zzso tested zzso quantitative methods to protein design with the goal of developing general design zzso We have sought to expand the range of zzso protein design by developing quantitative design methods for zzso of all parts of a zzso the buried core, the zzso exposed surface, and the boundary between core and zzso Our goal is an objective, quantitative design zzso that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or zzso We chose the zzso motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design zzso Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and zzso approach and the zzso zzso zzso to search for the optimal zzso we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test zzso The resulting sequence has less than zzso zzso to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso is highly soluble and zzso and circular zzso zzso showed it to be folded with a zzso cooperative zzso unfolding zzso The zzso solution structure of zzso was solved and shows that it is zzso with a backbone ensemble zzso zzso of zzso 55 zzso zzso folds into the desired zzso motif with zzso elements of secondary structure and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic zzso zzso of zzso zzso
