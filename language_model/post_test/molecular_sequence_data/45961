zzso is a zzso protein that is zzso modified by a zzso Gal zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso An zzso activity that zzso formation of the Gal zzso linkage by transfer of Gal from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or the corresponding zzso of zzso was described previously in zzso extracts of zzso A protein zzso associated with this activity has been zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso geometry instrument with zzso tandem mass zzso acquisition yielded a number of zzso fragmentation zzso nine of which were manually de zzso zzso and found to map onto a predicted zzso gene of unknown function on zzso zzso zzso is predicted to comprise zzso zzso acids with an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso toward a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of the truncated zzso region confirmed the predicted zzso activity of this zzso zzso of the zzso gene led to a loss of zzso activity in extracts and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso therefore represents the zzso zzso and its mechanism zzso to the sequential model of zzso zzso in the zzso shown for earlier zzso in the zzso zzso studies suggest that related zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso or zzso of plants, other zzso and zzso
