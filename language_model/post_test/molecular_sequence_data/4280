Using a deletion approach on the alpha zzso of DNA zzso III from zzso coli, we show that there is an zzso zzso domain which is distinct from a more zzso zzso and beta binding zzso Although deletion of 60 zzso from the alpha N zzso zzso zzso activity, deletions of 48, zzso and zzso zzso acids from the C zzso progressively impair its zzso efficiency but preserve an active zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso increases the zzso for gapped DNA zzso and increases the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein with zzso activity displays typical zzso behavior, catalyzing a zzso reaction that is zzso with zzso and linear with zzso With the aid of newly acquired sequences of the zzso III alpha zzso from a variety of organisms, candidates for two key zzso zzso in the active site are identified at zzso acids 401 and zzso of the zzso coli sequence by inspection of zzso zzso zzso zzso The motif zzso where X is a zzso zzso acid, is shown to be zzso among all known zzso zzso including those from zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso coli zzso deletion protein with only the zzso zzso zzso acids does not have zzso activity, consistent with the proposed position of the zzso zzso
