River capture is a zzso process through which stream sections are displaced from one zzso to another, and it may represent a dominant zzso of zzso transfer and zzso in zzso zzso However, few studies have been conducted in a manner to explicitly test the biological significance of river zzso Here we present a zzso zzso analysis to test whether the zzso fish zzso of the Von River (South Island, New zzso is the product of a zzso Late zzso capture of a section of the zzso River zzso zzso Specifically, we predict that zzso zzso of the Von River will exhibit closer genetic affinities with those of zzso rather than those of the zzso system, into which the Von River presently zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso region and zzso b sequence zzso and analysis of nuclear zzso of zzso sequences indicate that zzso of the Von River zzso zzso 31, three zzso have greatest genetic affinities with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso rather than with those of the zzso River zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 73, 32 zzso Likewise, Von River zzso zzso zzso 52, four zzso have greatest genetic affinities with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 58 zzso rather than with those of the zzso River zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 68, 32 zzso These findings are consistent with our predictions that genetic affinities of the zzso fish zzso in the Von River would reflect past, rather than present, drainage zzso zzso river capture is responsible for the zzso fish zzso of the Von zzso In a broader context, river capture has frequently influenced the distribution of genetic lineages among zzso in New Zealand zzso fish, and its zzso significance may have been underestimated in other zzso
