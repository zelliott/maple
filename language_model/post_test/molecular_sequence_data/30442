zzso activity of the zzso factor 1, zzso isolated from spinach zzso was enhanced by reduction with zzso zzso zzso from spinach zzso zzso coli and human zzso replaced zzso as zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso must be in an oxidized activated state to be further activated by reduced zzso This state was obtained either by heating zzso or removing the zzso intrinsic zzso zzso from zzso Efficiency and primary structure of the different zzso were zzso The progressive addition of zzso during zzso zzso by reduced zzso increases then decreases this zzso We proposed that three basic zzso acids corresponding to zzso 73 and zzso 82 and 96 in zzso coli zzso play an important role in the zzso of the zzso to the zzso charged surface of the zzso and are involved in the dual effect of zzso The variations in the screening effect of the negative charges of the zzso surface by zzso zzso can indeed explain the changes in the zzso of these 3 basic zzso acids with zzso variation in zzso zzso Human zzso must be 10 times more concentrated than zzso coli or spinach zzso zzso to exhibit the same zzso effect on the zzso This fact was related to the properties of a sequence equivalent to the part from zzso acid 59 to 72 in zzso coli zzso This part which joins the two zzso of the zzso is more zzso and more zzso charged in human zzso than in zzso coli or spinach zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was obtained at a very low concentration of the reduced spinach zzso zzso the zzso formed only a loose complex with zzso
