zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from rabbit liver zzso were chemically modified with zzso zzso of two zzso zzso of both zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso by about zzso For identification of the modified zzso zzso the zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and the labeled peptides were separated by zzso zzso of the zzso peptides from zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso at positions 235 and 380 were nearly fully zzso while zzso zzso and zzso were only partially labeled (about zzso In the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is partially protected against zzso and the extent of zzso is diminished as zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso presents a zzso essential zzso acid zzso at its active zzso zzso analyses of the zzso peptides from zzso zzso zzso revealed that mainly zzso and zzso were labeled, whereas zzso zzso and zzso are modified to a lower extent (about zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are suggested to be functionally involved in the interaction with zzso zzso
