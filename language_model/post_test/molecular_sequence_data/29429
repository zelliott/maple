The zzso sequence of the zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso a group II zzso was determined and zzso The zzso DNA zzso consists of zzso zzso and has an overall zzso content of zzso zzso analysis predicted 169 open reading frames zzso of 150 zzso or greater that showed minimal zzso zzso searches and comparisons with completely zzso zzso indicated that there were 66 zzso zzso among the nine zzso compared and an additional 17 zzso were zzso among the zzso The gene content and gene arrangement in zzso were most similar to those of zzso including two putative zzso and zzso gene zzso However, in contrast to zzso 8 zzso with zzso to zzso repeat zzso zzso and single copies of zzso and zzso protein zzso were found in zzso The zzso zzso contained four zzso regions, each with 10 to 17 repeated zzso Each repeat was 60 to 86 zzso in length and contained an approximately zzso imperfect zzso There were 13 zzso unique to zzso ranging from a small zzso of 196 zzso to larger zzso of up to zzso zzso and many of these contained typical early and late zzso consensus zzso
