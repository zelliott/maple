The zzso factor zzso binds to specific zzso sequences in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene promoter and zzso its zzso In this study, by the use of zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso the gene expression of several other growth factors and receptors and causes growth zzso of cancer zzso The zzso of zzso expression zzso into gastric zzso cell lines zzso and zzso decreased the zzso levels of transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor II, and zzso The reduction of zzso expression was confirmed at the protein level by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso with the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso induced by zzso growth factor in gastric zzso cell zzso The zzso cells zzso with zzso expression zzso did not grow in a zzso zzso whereas the control cells did grow under zzso zzso When the growth of the gastric zzso cell lines was studied in nude mice, zzso zzso cells showed a significantly slower growth compared to the control zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso the promoter activity of zzso in addition to zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso regulates gene expression of not only the zzso but also several other growth factor and zzso genes and can inhibit the growth of gastric zzso in zzso zzso
