zzso zzso peptides zzso serve as the first line of defense of the innate immune system against invading microbial zzso zzso bacteria can resist zzso by zzso their zzso zzso acids zzso with zzso but the exact mechanism of resistance is not fully zzso Here, we zzso various functional and zzso approaches to investigate the interactions of the human pathogen Group B zzso zzso with a series of zzso having different zzso The data reveal that: zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso enhance zzso resistance only to a subset of zzso and there is a direct correlation between resistance and zzso length and charge zzso zzso resistance due to reduced zzso charge of zzso is not attributed to decreased amounts of bound peptides to the zzso and zzso zzso most probably alters the zzso of zzso which results in increasing the cell wall density, as seen by zzso zzso zzso and reduces the penetration of zzso through the cell zzso Furthermore, Atomic Force zzso reveals increased surface rigidity of the cell wall of the zzso zzso strain to more than zzso that of the zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zzso protection against linear zzso mainly by decreasing the flexibility and zzso of the cell wall, rather than by reducing the zzso interactions of the zzso with the cell zzso Overall, our findings uncover an important protective role of the cell wall against zzso and extend our understanding of mechanisms of bacterial zzso
