zzso is an intermediate zzso protein which functions to zzso zzso intermediate filaments in the stratum zzso of zzso zzso It is zzso as a large precursor zzso zzso that consists of multiple zzso units and is localized in zzso zzso In this report, we describe the characterization of zzso zzso clones containing the human zzso gene coding for 11 complete zzso repeats of 324 zzso acids zzso At the zzso and zzso ends of human zzso are leader and tail zzso sequences of zzso and 157 zzso zzso respectively, which differ from zzso The leader zzso is composed of two distinct zzso an zzso segment which shows significant zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso second domain of 212 zzso The gene is divided into three zzso with one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region and a second one of zzso base pairs between the zzso zzso The position of zzso 2 is identical to that of other members of the zzso zzso The presence of an zzso domain suggests that zzso binds calcium and that the calcium binding domain is functionally significant in the formation of zzso and/or the subsequent processing of zzso to zzso both of which may be zzso zzso
