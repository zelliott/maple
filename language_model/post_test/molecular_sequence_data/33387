Whereas numerous zzso have been developed to ensure detection of the entire spectrum of zzso displayed by the human zzso zzso zzso zzso significant variation has been demonstrated in how these zzso are recognized by the zzso in different zzso The aim of this study was to establish a method using the dual selectivity of the zzso and the mass zzso detection for the differentiation between various zzso zzso in clinically relevant zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso plate, followed by zzso zzso zzso and SIM monitoring of the selected signature zzso resulted in the qualitative differentiation between several zzso zzso in serum or zzso We conclude that the zzso selectivity zzso by the combination of zzso extraction and zzso analysis offers valuable complementary information to the conventional zzso
