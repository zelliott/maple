African zzso fever virus zzso produces a fatal acute zzso fever in zzso pigs that potentially is a worldwide economic zzso Using an expressed sequence tag zzso zzso zzso method of random gene zzso and a zzso screen for limitation of zzso replication in cultured human cells, we identified six host genes whose cellular functions are required by zzso These included three zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso of outer zzso membrane zzso for which zzso expression from a zzso promoter resulted in zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso The effects of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and also of expression in the sense orientation of this zzso which encodes zzso acid zzso 450 to 518 of the mature zzso zzso were investigated more zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso which appears to zzso interfere with zzso function by a dominant negative zzso resulted in decreased synthesis of viral DNA and proteins early after zzso infection, altered zzso of zzso genes as determined by zzso zzso analysis, and increased cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso production without affecting abundance of the virus zzso we zzso Our results, which demonstrate the utility of zzso functional screens for the detection of host genes exploited by zzso zzso reveal a novel collection of cellular genes previously not known to be required for zzso zzso
