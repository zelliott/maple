We report the isolation of a zzso zzso the third putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments of mouse zzso were obtained using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso clones facilitated the isolation of zzso and zzso clones representing the mouse zzso open reading zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso acids predicted a protein of zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso and several consensus zzso binding zzso zzso comparisons indicated that mouse zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and also related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation of a zzso zzso of human zzso indicated high conservation between mouse and human zzso similar to those observed for zzso and zzso zzso of the mouse zzso open reading frame in zzso zzso cells led to high levels of zzso zzso as determined through a classical particle exclusion zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that there are three putative zzso zzso zzso zzso by three separate but related genes which comprise a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
