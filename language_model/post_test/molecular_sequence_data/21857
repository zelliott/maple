The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of resistance genes and the zzso relationship amongst zzso zzso zzso zzso from ten hospitals in Western China as well as to compare the molecular zzso data with those of zzso from two hospitals in zzso and zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso outer membrane protein zzso were screened using zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso mapping was performed to determine whether zzso sequence zzso elements preceded zzso zzso and zzso zzso International zzso lineages were identified by sequence type multiplex zzso zzso sequence typing zzso was performed to determine the sequence types zzso and then zzso zzso was applied to assign zzso complexes zzso In this study, dissemination of acquired zzso preceding the zzso gene was the zzso zzso resistance mechanism amongst 272 zzso zzso Five zzso zzso the zzso gene disrupted by zzso of zzso and three zzso lacked zzso All of the 36 representative zzso belonged to European clone zzso Ten zzso including three novel types, were zzso These zzso were clustered into zzso and two distinct zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso of European clone II, which carries acquired zzso preceding the zzso gene and belongs to zzso has spread within Western zzso
