Two derivatives of zzso zzso which arose spontaneously in zzso continuous cultures of zzso coli zzso have been zzso The smaller zzso zzso resulted from a deletion of zzso base pairs of DNA covering the translation start and zzso sequence of the zzso resistance zzso The other zzso zzso differed from zzso only by an zzso to zzso transition in the transcribed but untranslated leader region of the zzso gene which decreased zzso zzso by zzso possibly due to the formation of a more stable zzso structure in the zzso
