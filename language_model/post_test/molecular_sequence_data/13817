zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes play important roles in modulating the cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibit the zzso activities of these complexes and block the cell zzso The zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso is frequently deleted in a variety of human zzso Recently another zzso zzso zzso was cloned and localized to within 20 zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, a third zzso zzso named zzso and having a high degree of protein zzso to zzso has now been zzso To zzso the importance of these zzso genes in zzso cell lung zzso zzso we examined zzso from 34 zzso samples for zzso in these genes by Southern zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control normal zzso from the same individuals were also zzso zzso deletions of the zzso gene were found in three zzso Furthermore, comparative zzso analysis confirmed these deletions and suggested that one additional case had an zzso of the zzso zzso Neither zzso nor deletions of the zzso gene were zzso By zzso and direct sequencing of the zzso zzso bands, we detected only zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the frequency of deletions of the zzso gene was zzso (four of 34 zzso and no point zzso in the zzso gene were detected in the zzso For the zzso zzso no abnormalities were zzso A previous analysis of these zzso samples for zzso gene zzso revealed that the three cases with zzso deletions of the zzso gene also have zzso deletions of the zzso zzso
