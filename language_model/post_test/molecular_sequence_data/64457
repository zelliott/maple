zzso of proteins is an essential, highly zzso modification reaction that occurs in all zzso and some zzso This process is zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso Complete loss of zzso is lethal in all zzso In zzso zzso OT is composed of nine zzso membrane zzso Here, we report the atomic structure of an OT zzso from zzso zzso zzso This unusually small membrane protein containing only 36 zzso folds into a well formed, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso system used in this zzso The zzso critical for the OT activity and the stability of zzso zzso are located in zzso zzso the larger zzso half of this zzso zzso The zzso known to disrupt zzso complex form a well defined zzso in the zzso zzso Taking together prior zzso studies and the zzso structure of zzso we propose that in the OT complex zzso is packed against the alpha zzso of zzso by using a zzso model, with zzso zzso and zzso as the packing interface on one face, whereas zzso is involved in interactions with zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the other zzso
