We report the cloning and sequencing of group III zzso from zzso zzso zzso Indian black zzso The zzso sequence codes for the mature portion of the group zzso of 103 zzso zzso The sequence has zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso red zzso zzso and a zzso identity with bee zzso zzso and human group III zzso Most of the essential features of group III zzso like zzso binding loop and zzso zzso are zzso zzso modeling was done with the known structure of group III bee zzso zzso All the secondary structural motifs and the zzso bridges are as zzso The variation like the replacement of zzso acid zzso with zzso acid in the well known zzso acid zzso is a rare zzso This is the first structural model report of an Indian black scorpion zzso
