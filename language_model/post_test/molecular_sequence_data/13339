Arc and zzso are zzso zzso which recognize operator sequences that differ at 8-10 important zzso Nevertheless, single zzso changes in an zzso hybrid protein can switch zzso specificity between the two operators and even allow one particular hybrid to bind strongly to both zzso The ability of single zzso changes to radically alter binding specificity zzso zzso zzso that mediate some base contacts directly and some base contacts indirectly through zzso hydrogen zzso identical zzso which can make alternative sets of DNA contacts in the two zzso and amplification of the effect of each zzso because the proteins bind operator DNA as zzso
