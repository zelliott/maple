Total zzso isolated from bovine zzso was used as a template to zzso zzso zzso with reverse zzso and zzso coli DNA zzso zzso was performed using zzso as the cloning zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then introduced into zzso coli to construct the zzso library of bovine zzso zzso The zzso synthetic bovine zzso zzso gene zzso was used as zzso probe to screen the positive zzso which were then subjected to zzso mapping and DNA sequence zzso The results demonstrate that the positive clones contain a full length zzso zzso zzso The clones obtained were subsequently zzso linked to a zzso promoter, introduced into zzso coli zzso and expressed under the induction of zzso The zzso indicates the existence of expression product, and the result of zzso shows that the product has the same immune activity as native zzso
