zzso group I zzso use zzso as a zzso to cleave the zzso zzso zzso The zzso site has been localized to the zzso base pair of the zzso zzso on the basis of analysis of zzso that change the specificity of the zzso from G zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Michel et zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso We studied the effect of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso replacing zzso in the zzso zzso version of the zzso zzso In this zzso system zzso monitors the zzso zzso This kinetic zzso decreased by at least 5 zzso zzso when the zzso base pair was zzso to an zzso pair, while zzso increased at least zzso This amounted to an overall switch in specificity of at least 2 zzso zzso The zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso pairs, zzso zzso G for the zzso and zzso zzso was consistent with the proposed hydrogen bond between the zzso at position 264 and zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso showed a decrease of an order of magnitude in the rate of zzso zzso of zzso in which zzso or zzso replaces G as the zzso whereas the zzso zzso showed a decrease of only zzso The low zzso rates were not restored by raising the zzso concentration or lowering the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibited a pattern of zzso by zzso indistinguishable from that of the wild type, and the zzso for folding of the zzso zzso zzso was the same as that of the wild zzso Therefore the zzso site zzso do not appear to have a major effect on zzso folding or zzso Because changing zzso affects the zzso reaction without zzso the global folding of the zzso we conclude that the zzso role of this zzso zzso is not limited to zzso zzso
