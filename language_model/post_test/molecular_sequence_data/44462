The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein was zzso to zzso and shown to be functional in a zzso from zzso zzso exhibiting both zzso and zzso zzso However, kinetic studies indicated that the zzso possessed low zzso activity, suggesting that the reaction was biased towards zzso zzso The optimum temperature for both activities was 60 degrees C, which was lower than the optimal growth temperature of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited different optimum zzso depending on the reaction employed zzso zzso for the zzso reaction and pH zzso for the zzso zzso Of the various zzso zzso tested, zzso as well as zzso was involved in the zzso zzso
