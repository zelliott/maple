The definition of zzso for the diagnosis of human and bovine tuberculosis is a research zzso If diagnosis is to be used alongside zzso zzso zzso vaccination regimens, it will be necessary to have zzso that allow the discrimination of infected and vaccinated zzso A list of 42 potential zzso zzso zzso was prepared by comparative analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Potential zzso were tested by applying them in a zzso zzso screening system to zzso zzso and zzso cattle and to cattle without prior exposure to zzso zzso A response hierarchy of zzso was established by comparing responses in infected zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected for further study, as they were strongly recognized in zzso infected animals but with low or no frequency in zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, all three zzso were recognized in animals vaccinated against zzso disease, suggesting the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight peptides from the three zzso studied in detail were identified as zzso and were characterized in terms of major zzso complex class II restriction element usage and shown to be restricted through both DR and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and refinement of the in zzso strategy to predict such zzso from the primary protein sequence will be zzso zzso of the peptides identified from the three dominant zzso by use of larger field studies is now a zzso
