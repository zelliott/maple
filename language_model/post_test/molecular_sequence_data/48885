zzso zzso assembly in animal cells is orchestrated by a zzso zzso that directs zzso zzso zzso generated at zzso releases zzso assembly factors from zzso complexes with zzso the nuclear transport factors that facilitate protein import into the nucleus during zzso In addition, the nuclear export factor zzso has been proposed to act as a zzso zzso of zzso through the localized assembly of protein complexes on the zzso zzso notably at zzso and zzso It has been zzso however, how the functions of nuclear transport factors are controlled during zzso Here, we report that human zzso is zzso at zzso 391 in zzso by zzso zzso the zzso and zzso B zzso zzso of zzso with zzso 391 zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso indicates that zzso directs the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization and zzso zzso We find that zzso of zzso at zzso 391 enhances its zzso interaction with zzso and promotes their recruitment to the zzso zzso These results show that zzso of zzso controls its molecular zzso zzso and function during zzso uncovering a new mechanism for the control of zzso zzso assembly by zzso We propose that nuclear transport factors are controlled during zzso through the selection of specific molecular interactions by protein zzso
