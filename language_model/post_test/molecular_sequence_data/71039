zzso zzso zzso zzso has a unique structure consisting of two zzso bound zzso zzso and zzso To improve this zzso properties by protein engineering, we have developed a new expression system for the production of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso For the present study, we developed a more efficient expression system using the strain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We zzso two types of zzso zzso each to a single peak by zzso zzso although they were found to be zzso by zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and sugar content showed that the difference between the two types of zzso was due mainly to their sugar content zzso or low zzso zzso Moreover, there were two species within each type of zzso One kind was processed to the zzso and zzso as in the native zzso while the other remained zzso Although these zzso zzso contained several zzso modifications and different zzso their secondary structures were the same as those of the native zzso as measured by circular zzso zzso and determination of zzso zzso This suggests that protein folding of the zzso zzso occurred correctly in zzso
