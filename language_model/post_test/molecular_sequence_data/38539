zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso associated with tumor zzso and zzso zzso of zzso may have potential as drugs for zzso breast and other zzso zzso useful zzso must be selective for zzso and not appreciably inhibit the zzso and structurally and functionally similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the vital zzso zzso 

We produced zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso and determined the crystal structure of its complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To probe the structural zzso of the affinity and selectivity of this inhibitor for zzso we also determined the structures of its zzso and zzso complexes, of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso zzso and zzso bound by compounds that are less effective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso values of each inhibitor toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and factor zzso were determined and zzso One selectivity zzso of the zzso for zzso involves a hydrogen bond at the zzso site to zzso that is absent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and factor zzso Other subtle differences in the architecture of the zzso site also influence inhibitor affinity and zzso zzso 

zzso structural differences in the zzso site of zzso compared with that of related zzso which result in part from the presence of a zzso zzso at position 190, account for the selectivity of small zzso for zzso and afford a framework for zzso design of small, zzso selective zzso zzso
