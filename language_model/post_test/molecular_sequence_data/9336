Human zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen especially for zzso subjects that might develop pharmacological resistance in patients undergoing prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso is the drug used as first choice therapy in affected children and a zzso zzso is mainly linked to zzso of the viral protein zzso zzso 

Here a new quantitative zzso zzso method is presented that allows detection and zzso of the viral species carrying the more frequent zzso zzso responsible for zzso resistance in clinical samples zzso of known zzso 

The system has been validated using two independent approaches zzso and sequencing of zzso gene fragments and real-time zzso and clinical samples derived from 3 pediatric zzso 

The zzso zzso analysis has indicated a significant increase of zzso viruses carrying the zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso viral zzso known to increase zzso resistance zzso increased around 5 times during zzso In addition, zzso zzso to have zzso also increased 3 zzso 

zzso is a zzso cheap, high zzso and sensitive analysis method to detect zzso resistance zzso useful to follow zzso therapy in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso
