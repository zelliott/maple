The zzso of the African zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to harbor several thousand major zzso complex zzso class I genes instead of the zzso genes found in conventional laboratory mice, which are mostly of zzso zzso zzso zzso Other genes of zzso zzso either functionally or physically linked to class I zzso are not zzso zzso genes derive from as few as three ancestors and amplification has likely occurred after the divergence of the two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which took place about three million years zzso zzso genes are mostly zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso leads us to propose that zzso of the genes has occurred through the repeat induced zzso process, a possible zzso in the evolution of the zzso
