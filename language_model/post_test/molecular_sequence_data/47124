The linear precursors of zzso 1 and zzso 3, natural zzso zzso were obtained by using the zzso and zzso of solid phase zzso zzso The methods of directed and spontaneous formation of two zzso bonds in the molecules of these precursors were compared and shown to give comparable zzso The conditions were found that provided the selective zzso closure in the zzso zzso 1 by means of hydrogen zzso without the zzso conversion of the Met zzso into the corresponding zzso
