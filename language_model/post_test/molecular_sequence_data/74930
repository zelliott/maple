We have cloned and expressed in zzso coli a gene zzso a zzso zzso outer membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 153 zzso with a predicted mature protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid composition and sequence of the predicted mature protein agree with the chemically determined composition and partial zzso acid sequence of PAL zzso from zzso zzso outer zzso We have also identified a second gene from zzso zzso that encodes a second zzso protein which is recognized by zzso against zzso This protein has been shown to be a zzso The zzso sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 154 zzso with a predicted mature protein of 136 zzso acids and has limited sequence zzso with that of the gene zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that both genes exist as single copies in zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes zzso zzso which have zzso sequences similar to those of reported membrane signal peptides and are associated primarily with the outer membrane when expressed in zzso zzso
