The zzso gene of the nuclear zzso virus of the gypsy zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso A zzso open reading frame of 735 zzso zzso was identified which can code for a protein of 245 zzso acids that demonstrates a high degree of similarity to other zzso The protein predicted from the zzso sequence shows differences in several regions to that previously zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The consensus sequence zzso found at the zzso start site of zzso zzso genes was located 55 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso
