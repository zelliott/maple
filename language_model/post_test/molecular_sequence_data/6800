The zzso B virus zzso X gene shares sequences with both the zzso and zzso zzso carries several regulatory signals critical to the zzso cycle, and its product has a zzso zzso In this study, the X gene sequences of 29 zzso strains from 14 different countries were characterized and compared to all corresponding zzso sequences where the origin of the strain was zzso The X gene and its product are relatively well zzso However, several rare or unique point zzso in the predicted X protein are described which further define regions on the primary sequence which may be of structural and/or functional zzso zzso analysis of the 29 X genes and their predicted proteins in this study using zzso trees indicates that a common ancestral sequence gave rise to two main groups of X zzso represented by zzso strains found predominantly either in the Western or Eastern zzso In turn, each of these two main groups of sequences appear to have zzso into two main zzso Introduction of 33 additional DNA sequences from the zzso has further verified these zzso and confirmed the groupings as previously described zzso A to zzso zzso the split of X gene lineages into zzso A and D seems feasible on zzso zzso the corresponding split of Eastern Hemisphere lineages into B and C may require an alternative zzso Additionally, there was a correlation between the zzso status of our patients and zzso identity at two positions in the core promoter, 52 and 50 bases upstream from the zzso start zzso This finding, also shown recently by others, suggests that control of zzso zzso may involve zzso affecting zzso and not only zzso zzso
