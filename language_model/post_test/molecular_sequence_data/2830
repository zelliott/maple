The zzso sequence of the small zzso zzso segment of the zzso virus zzso has been zzso The S zzso is 961 bases in length and, in common with other zzso encodes two zzso N and zzso in overlapping reading zzso A zzso alignment of the zzso acid sequences of the N and zzso proteins of viruses representing three zzso within the zzso zzso indicates regions which are strongly zzso and provides targets for future analysis of protein zzso
