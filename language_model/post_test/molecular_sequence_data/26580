In the zzso industry, zzso define molecular zzso of patients and diseases and serve as surrogate zzso in zzso drug zzso zzso zzso can be much more sensitive than traditional lab zzso zzso disease zzso by traditional method such as DNA zzso has proved zzso Alternative zzso zzso represents a new class of diagnostic zzso Recent scientific evidence is demonstrating that the differentiation and zzso of individual alternative zzso zzso could improve insights into disease diagnosis and zzso zzso and characterizing alternative zzso zzso are essential to the study of molecular mechanisms and early detection of complex diseases such as breast zzso However, there are limitations with traditional methods used for alternative zzso zzso determination such as zzso low level of coverage and poor focus on alternative zzso 

zzso we presented a zzso approach to searching novel alternative zzso zzso in clinical zzso Our results showed that the approach has significant potential in enabling discovery of new types of high-quality alternative zzso zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso approach for the zzso community to analyze, zzso and characterize alternative zzso zzso from zzso zzso experiments with more coverage and exclusive focus on alternative zzso The approach can help generate novel hypotheses on molecular risk factors and molecular mechanisms of cancer in early stage, leading to identification of potentially highly specific alternative zzso zzso zzso for early detection of zzso
