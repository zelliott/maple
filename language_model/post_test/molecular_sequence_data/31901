zzso sequence contamination in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso analyses can be particularly problematic when sampling microbial communities in plants and zzso zzso We previously encountered high levels of zzso contamination in zzso insect samples when we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso described in the zzso zzso a primer previously found to exclude zzso zzso was modified to enhance its zzso and we describe, in detail, our methodology throughout zzso zzso Thirteen versions of zzso were assessed for the exclusion of zzso sequences from our zzso We found that a shift in the mismatch between zzso and zzso zzso resulted in significant reduction of zzso zzso Our results also indicate that amplifying sequences from environmental samples in a zzso zzso process, with the addition of the multiplex identifiers and zzso adapters in a second round of zzso further improved primer zzso zzso that included 3' zzso bonds, which were designed to block primer degradation, did not amplify consistently across zzso The different forward zzso do not appear to bias the bacterial communities zzso We provide a zzso framework for reducing zzso reads in zzso sequencing data sets that can be applied to a number of environmental samples and sequencing zzso
