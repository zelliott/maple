zzso are a group of zzso zzso promoter elements which have been exploited by two distinct groups of plant zzso zzso and certain viruses to express genes in zzso The genes for two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that bind to zzso have been isolated and zzso The zzso called zzso and zzso were isolated by screening an zzso zzso library with zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso of other plant zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins show zzso zzso acid identity but low DNA zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that each of the zzso genes is a member of a small zzso zzso is more similar to the tobacco zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso is more similar to the zzso zzso wheat zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso and zzso were similar although zzso was able to bind simultaneously to both halves of the zzso more efficiently than zzso This difference in binding to the zzso between two closely related proteins from the same species is potentially significant since binding to both halves of the zzso is a zzso for in zzso zzso zzso
