DNA zzso zzso were constructed with zzso rainbow trout promoters to take the place of the zzso immediate early promoter in DNA vaccines for zzso DNA fragments containing the promoter regions upstream of the rainbow trout zzso and zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso genes were obtained and their zzso sequences were zzso zzso containing the G gene of zzso linked to the trout promoters were found to be very effective as vaccines in rainbow zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the zzso promoter is zzso active in mouse cells zzso suggesting that this fish promoter might be used for zzso DNA vaccine development as zzso
