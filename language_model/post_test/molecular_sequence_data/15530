zzso activates multiple signaling pathways in cells, including the zzso zzso pathway, indicating a degree of zzso with insulin zzso The exact mechanisms by which zzso alters this signaling zzso and how it relates to functional zzso are unclear at zzso A previous study has established that zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10), an important tumor zzso and modifier of zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso zzso multiple sites on the zzso tail of zzso in zzso and pancreatic zzso an action not zzso by zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal the critical role these sites play in transmission of the zzso signal to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also prevent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso activity is inhibited by insulin but not zzso in zzso zzso Both hormones increase zzso zzso zzso zzso but in zzso cells this action of zzso is zzso zzso not insulin, increases zzso zzso zzso in both cell zzso These results demonstrate a significant role for zzso in zzso signal transmission and identify zzso as a potential important signaling zzso contributing to divergent zzso for these zzso
