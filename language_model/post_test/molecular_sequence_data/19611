The bacterial diversity inherent to the zzso community structure of a modified rotating biological zzso wastewater treatment process, referred to as the Rotating zzso zzso zzso zzso process, was characterized in this study, via both zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso methods, zzso zzso were found to exist in large numbers on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the microbial composition of the zzso was quite zzso Only three zzso were zzso the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso partial zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a considerably more diverse microbial composition within the zzso A total of eight zzso were recovered in this case, three of which were major groups: the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The remaining five zzso were minor groups: the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The two most abundant zzso detected were the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso both of which are members of the zzso zzso This finding indicates that these zzso bacteria successfully zzso and dominated the zzso process zzso Many of the colonies or clones recovered from the zzso evidenced significantly high zzso in the zzso zzso sequences of bacteria stored in databases associated with advanced wastewater treatment capabilities, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso the removal of volatile zzso and the removal of zzso or heavy zzso The microbial community structures observed in the zzso were found to correlate nicely with the enhanced performance of advanced wastewater treatment zzso
