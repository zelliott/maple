A novel approach based on zzso zzso zzso was developed to control expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso To engineer a specific zzso site in zzso the zzso zzso of zzso were derived from zzso complementary to sequences corresponding to zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso significantly inhibited expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells at the level of zzso and protein zzso They also specifically decreased the cell surface expression of corresponding zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells, as measured by flow zzso In functional tests, zzso and zzso markedly reduced zzso of cells to zzso and zzso zzso We designed zzso to zzso and zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso domain that was flanked by two zzso recognition segments of 8 and 10 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso in the presence of zzso specifically zzso their zzso synthetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso were partially modified with zzso and with zzso groups at both the zzso and 3' ends indicated similar kinetic zzso they were significantly more potent than the unmodified zzso because of their much higher resistance to zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso cell zzso tube formation in zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso to zzso and zzso zzso with zzso modifications are potentially useful as zzso agents and may ultimately provide a therapeutic means to inhibit zzso in zzso
