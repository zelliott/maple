To facilitate cloning procedures in zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso we have constructed zzso that both carry a zzso with multiple restriction sites and express resistance to either zzso or zzso zzso Our zzso are zzso zzso that suppress zzso between zzso enhancers and internal promoters and avoid zzso stimulation of host cell zzso They can also be used as expression zzso in direct zzso zzso since no translation initiation zzso lies between the zzso zzso and the cloning zzso
