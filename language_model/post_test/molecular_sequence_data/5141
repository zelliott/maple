The regulation of zzso D cloned from rat brain zzso was examined in zzso and in zzso The zzso was a shorter zzso zzso of human zzso D 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rose, zzso zzso zzso zzso Morris, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its expression in zzso cells led to increased zzso D zzso activity that was further zzso by zzso active zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso of the zzso cells, but zzso active zzso increased its zzso In contrast, zzso did not activate zzso expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso markedly increased the zzso zzso activity of zzso cells, and there was a further increase in the cells expressing zzso In zzso from zzso cells expressing zzso addition of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso was greater than that of zzso although the zzso for zzso stimulation zzso zzso were zzso zzso isolated from cells expressing zzso plus zzso and/or zzso also showed higher zzso activity but no zzso between the two G zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso C alpha zzso also zzso zzso activity in zzso from zzso cells expressing zzso but it had no effect on the activity in control zzso zzso and did not enhance the effects of zzso active zzso or zzso The stimulation by zzso did not require zzso and was not increased by addition of this zzso No zzso between zzso and zzso and between these and zzso on zzso activity was observed when these were added to zzso from cells expressing zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso from both control and zzso zzso In zzso these results indicate that in zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited by zzso However, in intact zzso cells, zzso activates zzso zzso but not zzso whereas the reverse is true for zzso In addition, the effects of zzso zzso are much greater in the intact zzso It is concluded that the regulation of zzso in intact zzso cells differs significantly from that seen in zzso possible reasons for this are zzso
