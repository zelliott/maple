The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso for an unknown zzso and is zzso with the zzso zzso locus zzso zzso at the W locus affect various aspects of zzso the proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells and zzso during zzso The original W zzso and zzso are severe lethal zzso when zzso In the zzso state the W zzso has a weak zzso while zzso has dominant zzso zzso and zzso are weak W zzso with dominant zzso We have characterized the molecular basis of these four W zzso and determined their effects on mast cell differentiation by using a zzso cell zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso are the result of zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso coding sequence zzso zzso at position zzso zzso zzso position zzso and zzso zzso position zzso which affect the zzso associated zzso zzso to varying zzso The zzso protein products in zzso zzso mast cells are expressed zzso although the 160 zzso cell membrane form of the zzso protein displays accelerated turnover zzso The W zzso is the result of a 78 zzso acid deletion which includes the zzso domain of the zzso zzso A 125 zzso zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso mast cells which lacks zzso activity and is not expressed on the cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
