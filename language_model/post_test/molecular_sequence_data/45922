zzso pathogens that normally inhabit our environment can adapt to thrive inside zzso zzso There are six zzso zzso that cause disease worldwide, which switch from zzso zzso in soil to zzso zzso after spores are zzso and exposed to elevated zzso zzso that regulate this switch remain zzso We show that a hybrid zzso zzso senses host signals and triggers the transition from mold to zzso The zzso also regulates zzso integrity, zzso and expression of zzso genes in zzso This global regulator shapes how zzso zzso pathogens adapt to the zzso host, which has broad implications for treating and preventing systemic zzso zzso
