In order to investigate the repetitive sequences located on human zzso 21, we have isolated DNA fragments containing zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso was chosen for further study, because it contained repetitive sequences different from the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso indicates that zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, when the zzso sequence was used as a probe, a discrete band of 5 zzso was seen in zzso DNA from zzso cell hybrids containing human zzso 21 as the sole human zzso The zzso sequence was rearranged and was interrupted by zzso zzso which was flanked by 6 zzso target site zzso Since all three repetitive sequences are known to act as zzso these results imply that there is an integration hot spot on human zzso zzso The sequence was mapped within zzso
