With the increasing availability of zzso databases and whole zzso zzso zzso have become the most abundant and powerful zzso zzso However, zzso chip data generally suffers from zzso biases caused by the zzso discovery and selection process in which a small number of individuals are used as discovery zzso The ongoing International zzso Genome zzso sequencing project of the highly zzso Clementine and sweet orange zzso will soon result in the release of several hundred thousand zzso The primary goals of this study were: zzso to estimate the zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso discovered from Clementine zzso sequencing zzso zzso to estimate bias associated with the very narrow discovery panel, and zzso to evaluate the usefulness of the zzso zzso markers for diversity analysis and comparative mapping studies between the different cultivated zzso zzso 

zzso zzso covering the main zzso species and 52 zzso hybrids between zzso and Clementine were zzso on a zzso array platform using zzso zzso zzso from Clementine zzso and 37 zzso identified between and within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results were obtained from zzso zzso zzso Of these zzso 116 displayed incomplete zzso primarily in zzso zzso zzso zzso and wild zzso zzso The two primary biases associated with the zzso mining in Clementine were an zzso of the zzso zzso diversity and an zzso of the zzso zzso However, the genetic zzso of the gene pool was high, with very frequent significant linkage zzso Furthermore, the shared zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generally enough to perform zzso comparative genetic zzso 

A set of zzso zzso markers providing consistent results was zzso Of the markers zzso from zzso zzso were successfully transferred to the whole zzso gene zzso Despite the zzso biases in relation to the Clementine origin, the zzso data confirm the important zzso of the gene pools around zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as previous hypothesis on the origin of secondary zzso The implemented zzso marker set will be very useful for comparative genetic mapping in zzso and genetic association in zzso zzso
