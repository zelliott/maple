zzso seminal zzso protein zzso acid zzso zzso and human zzso acid zzso zzso show high affinity for protein zzso zzso The zzso and kinetic properties of the zzso and human zzso are zzso The main objective of this study was to establish the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it with that of human zzso zzso Also, the zzso sequence of zzso zzso was compared with the sequence of human zzso zzso was isolated from zzso seminal zzso fluid and zzso zzso to zzso seminal zzso zzso was zzso amplified by zzso cloned in zzso coli and zzso The obtained zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso showed zzso identity with the zzso zzso sequence of human zzso The determined sequence of a 354 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity with the corresponding sequence of human zzso On the basis of this sequence a 118 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This zzso showed zzso identity with the corresponding zzso of human zzso and had a similar zzso zzso The compared sequences differ in terms of their zzso points and zzso zzso This may explain the differences in zzso specificity and inhibitor resistance of zzso zzso and human zzso
