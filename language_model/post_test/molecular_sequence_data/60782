zzso class switching is induced upon B cell zzso in zzso by zzso or infection or in zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and results in the expression of different heavy chain constant region zzso genes without a change in the zzso variable zzso This DNA zzso event allows zzso to alter their biological activity while maintaining their zzso zzso Little is known about the molecular mechanism of switch zzso To attempt to develop an zzso for zzso DNA binding zzso and DNA sequences that mediate switch zzso we have constructed a zzso DNA zzso that will undergo switch zzso upon stable zzso into the surface zzso B cell line zzso zzso a cell line capable of undergoing switch zzso of its zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso occurs between the two switch regions of the zzso as zzso by zzso across the integrated zzso switch regions, followed by Southern zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso products confirmed the occurrence of S zzso alpha zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso cells does not require treatment with zzso of switch zzso suggesting that zzso activity is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso does not require high levels of zzso across the switch regions of the zzso Fewer zzso events are detected in four different B and T cell lines that do not undergo switch zzso of their zzso zzso
