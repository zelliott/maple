The zzso constitute a large family of zzso zzso components primarily responsible for maintaining the structure and biological integrity of zzso zzso These proteins exhibit considerable diversity size, zzso tissue distribution, and molecular zzso Fourteen types of zzso and/or zzso zzso thus far reported, are zzso by a minimum of 27 zzso zzso of these zzso including several that are closely linked, have been assigned to 10 separate zzso and one collagen gene has been mapped to the X zzso We have isolated a zzso human zzso clone coding for a collagen zzso different in sequence and structure from types zzso zzso This zzso has been designated the alpha 1 chain of type zzso zzso To determine the location of the corresponding zzso the zzso clone was zzso to zzso hybrid zzso and to human zzso zzso The results obtained using the hybrid cell lines showed that this newly identified collagen zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso In zzso zzso allowed zzso to zzso zzso zzso a region to which no other collagen genes had previously been zzso Our data further demonstrate the complex arrangement of the many collagen genes in the human zzso
