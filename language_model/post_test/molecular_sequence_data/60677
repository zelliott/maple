The zzso checkpoint is thought to be essential for ensuring accurate zzso segregation by implementing zzso delay in response to a zzso zzso To date, however, very little data has become available on the defects of the zzso checkpoint in human cancer zzso In the present study, impaired zzso checkpoint was found in four zzso of nine human lung cancer cell zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of frequent impairment of the zzso checkpoint in this leading cause of cancer zzso As an initial step towards zzso of the underlying zzso we further undertook a search for zzso in a key component of the zzso checkpoint, known as zzso and its immediate downstream zzso zzso No such zzso were found, however, in either 21 lung cancer cell lines or 25 primary lung cancer cases, although we could identify silent zzso and the transcribed and processed zzso zzso that was subsequently mapped at zzso The present observations appear to warrant further zzso such as search for zzso in other zzso to better understand the molecular zzso of this fatal disease, and warn against potential zzso when performing zzso analyses for other cancer types based on zzso zzso
