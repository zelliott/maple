Biological weighted sequences are used extensively in molecular biology as profiles for protein families, in the representation of binding sites and often for the representation of sequences produced by a shotgun sequencing zzso In this paper, we address three fundamental problems in the area of biologically weighted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso pattern matching, and zzso zzso of zzso Our zzso can be used as basic building blocks for more sophisticated zzso applied on weighted zzso
