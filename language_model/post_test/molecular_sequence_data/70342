We have analyzed the relationships of 337 zzso and related sequences using a distance zzso zzso Based on our results, zzso sequences can be classified into at least 30 distinguishable zzso zzso belonging to the same class are highly similar to each other but there are no obvious close relationships between the separate zzso Since many of these classes each contain sequences from quite zzso organisms, we conclude that these separate classes of zzso sequences were established early during zzso
