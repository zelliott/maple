The zzso complex zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and acts as a zzso during collagen synthesis in zzso zzso The beta zzso of this complex is identical to protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is encased in a zzso zzso and represents an excellent model for the study of collagen zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes with respect to their role in collagen modification and formation of the zzso zzso zzso We identified genes zzso two zzso and a single associated zzso and showed that all three are expressed in zzso zzso cells at times of zzso collagen zzso zzso of the zzso gene via zzso interference resulted in embryonic zzso Similarly, the combined zzso genes are required for embryonic zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso which we determined to be identical to the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso strains were shown to have zzso zzso for zzso and to have a reduced zzso content in their zzso zzso This study demonstrates in zzso that this zzso complex plays a central role in zzso zzso formation and is essential for normal zzso zzso
