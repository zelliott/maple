The replication of human zzso 71 zzso in cell culture is inhibited by zzso of zzso that do not have an zzso adverse effect on host cell zzso Although the zzso zzso protein zzso is known to play an important role in viral zzso zzso its precise zzso activities and structure have not been fully zzso Here we describe zzso acid zzso in zzso protein zzso that zzso resistance to zzso Three zzso virus populations were independently isolated and found to contain five zzso in protein zzso one of which, zzso zzso was present in two of the independently selected zzso This zzso was introduced into a zzso infectious zzso clone and was sufficient to zzso complete resistance to growth zzso in the presence of zzso zzso In the first zzso population selected, the zzso zzso occurred in association with an additional zzso zzso zzso located in the putative zzso replication element zzso of coding region zzso This zzso zzso only partial zzso resistance when introduced into the zzso infectious zzso When the zzso and zzso zzso were introduced into zzso together, the zzso zzso did not increase the level of zzso resistance due to the zzso zzso zzso This study confirms that zzso resistance can be readily selected in zzso and is attributable to zzso within protein zzso
