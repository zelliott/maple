The zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso They are kept in an inactive state by an zzso interaction between the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain zzso It is considered that the zzso of this zzso interaction upon binding of zzso zzso to the zzso binding domain next to DID zzso exposure of the zzso zzso which assemble zzso zzso Here, we isolated two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso extracts by zzso affinity column zzso We characterized them by a novel zzso where beads coated with the zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso were incubated with zzso zzso and the assembled zzso filaments were observed after zzso with zzso Both zzso generated fluorescent zzso structures on the zzso zzso of the zzso intensity of the beads revealed that the initial zzso in the presence of zzso was more than 10 times faster than in the presence of zzso The zzso assembly activities of both zzso were inhibited by adding zzso DID zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso bound to both zzso and zzso and efficiently neutralized the zzso by the DID zzso The association between zzso and zzso was induced by zzso stimulation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso which was inhibited by the DID zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso assembly factors having distinct zzso and they are directly regulated by zzso zzso
