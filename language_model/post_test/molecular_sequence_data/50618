zzso and zzso zzso package zzso DNA more efficiently than zzso DNA and zzso plasmids carrying DNA sequences necessary for DNA packaging zzso zzso The zzso sequence contains a promoter for zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the promoter is necessary for DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso specific for their own zzso To examine the relationship between DNA packaging and transcription, we constructed a cleared in zzso system for packaging zzso or zzso DNA containing an ammonium zzso zzso of a high-speed zzso of zzso zzso In the system, DNA packaging required zzso and was inhibited by the zzso analog of zzso zzso or zzso The DNA packaging activity paralleled the zzso activity, zzso by incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso In the system, zzso DNA was packaged more efficiently than zzso DNA, but zzso DNA was packaged as efficiently as zzso DNA by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso specificity determines the DNA packaging specificity of zzso and zzso
