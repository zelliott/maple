zzso are zzso zzso that bind to the zzso family of proteins and have important regulatory roles in plants and zzso Here, we show that zzso exhibit targeting activity in cells when delivered as single strands that are zzso and that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso preferences, chemical modification sensitivity, and zzso zzso targeting all suggest that this activity is zzso zzso could be enhanced by zzso of segmented passenger strands containing zzso acid zzso Furthermore, screening of randomly generated sequences identified zzso rich 3' cassette sequences that increased single strand zzso These results provide an initial step in the development of zzso zzso mimics for therapeutic zzso
