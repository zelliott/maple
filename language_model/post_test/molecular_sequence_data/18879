zzso zzso Factor zzso is a complex zzso zzso that plays a central role in blood zzso It is the zzso precursor to the zzso zzso that zzso the formation of the zzso zzso and regulates a multitude of other cellular responses related to zzso and zzso For the biological activity of zzso the vitamin K dependent zzso modification of zzso acid zzso to zzso acid is of crucial zzso zzso can be zzso expressed using zzso cell zzso However, the product is a zzso mixture of zzso with different degrees of zzso requiring separation of closely related charge zzso A second challenge for zzso is the need to remove traces of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso to extremely low zzso In this work, we describe a zzso strategy that provides solutions to both challenges and results in an efficient and robust process for active zzso zzso We also describe the zzso characterization of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and complementary zzso zzso
