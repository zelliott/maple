The zzso and zzso genes of zzso coli K-12 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A highly zzso sequence in the promoter regions of these two genes is similar to the zzso operator, which is the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso expression was zzso approximately twofold in cells grown in the presence of zzso zzso through a mechanism requiring zzso A zzso designated zzso which alters a zzso region within the zzso sequence in the zzso promoter eliminated zzso repression of zzso zzso This result indicates that zzso binds to the zzso (and presumably to the zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso regulation of zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso zzso act through independent mechanisms to control the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso
