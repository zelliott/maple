zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and protein were examined zzso to determine whether adult mouse brain expresses full-length zzso zzso that can be translated to functional zzso protein and zzso to compare zzso zzso proteins in brain and zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in mouse brain with zzso The zzso was zzso cloned into an expression zzso zzso into zzso cells, and cell protein was zzso for zzso zzso zzso proteins were examined on western blots zzso with four different zzso to zzso 

zzso confirmed identity of the entire coding sequences of zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso and adrenal to a zzso reference zzso zzso of the brain zzso into zzso cells resulted in zzso activity that was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso zzso but not by zzso which has a high affinity for zzso zzso to either the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso detected two proteins zzso and 55 zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso detected both proteins in extracts of mouse zzso cortex, zzso and zzso but only the 73 zzso protein and higher molecular weight zzso proteins in mouse adrenal and rat zzso cells, which are positive controls for zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate that a functional zzso zzso coding sequence is expressed in mouse brain and suggest processing of zzso protein differs in mouse adrenal and zzso
