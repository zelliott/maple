zzso is a lupus zzso locus identified on mouse zzso 7 of the New Zealand zzso Zealand White zzso zzso zzso Based on previous zzso this locus appears to contribute to lupus zzso through its impact on diversification of immune zzso To understand how zzso affects zzso diversification of zzso responses, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso and assessed peripheral zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso mice zzso for zzso zzso In addition to altered zzso zzso zzso profiles, sequences from zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso zzso structures characteristic of zzso B cells and consistent with peripheral B cells bearing zzso edited zzso zzso expression of zzso genes and circular zzso gene zzso products were detected in zzso mature B cells of zzso but not B6 mice, showing that peripheral zzso zzso occurred beyond zzso zzso Taken together, on the zzso background, zzso affected zzso zzso diversity and zzso zzso diversity and led to zzso zzso of zzso excluded zzso genes in the zzso Such impact on zzso zzso diversification may contribute to the development of zzso B cell zzso This is the first report to present evidence for significant association of a lupus zzso zzso which has been mapped to a zzso region in which no zzso genes have been identified, with zzso zzso sequence diversity and peripheral H chain zzso editing or revision without relying upon zzso zzso zzso
