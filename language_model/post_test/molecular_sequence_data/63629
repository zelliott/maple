Recent clinical observations reported the occurrence of zzso acid zzso at position 181 of the zzso zzso associated with a viral breakthrough under zzso or zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the main zzso harboring the zzso zzso isolated from 10 consecutive patients who developed zzso and/or zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene amplified by zzso from serum samples during viral zzso The main zzso were then tested after zzso of zzso cells for their resistance profile to zzso zzso 

zzso analysis revealed the zzso on the same zzso zzso of zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso following zzso zzso or zzso zzso In cell culture, the zzso zzso induced a decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Interestingly, the association of zzso with zzso on one clinical isolate zzso increased the resistance to these three zzso All the tested zzso remained sensitive to zzso 

Our observations suggest that a single zzso acid change at position zzso may induce zzso to zzso and zzso These data emphasize the clinical relevance of zzso and zzso analysis in the management of zzso drug zzso
