zzso zzso involving band zzso occur in several zzso zzso A clone with a zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared at the zzso phase in a patient with acute zzso leukemia who exhibited a sole zzso zzso zzso zzso at initial zzso After the appearance of this zzso the leukemia progressed with marked zzso and combination chemotherapy was zzso Southern zzso analysis showed a zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso beta zzso gene at zzso which was not observed at initial zzso This zzso resulted in a zzso transcript fusing the zzso gene on zzso with a novel zzso zzso located at zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso upstream of the zzso was not zzso However, the 3' region of zzso which was transcribed as part of the zzso fusion zzso was zzso A partial zzso for a novel zzso zzso includes a zzso zzso motif and putative zzso hormone zzso interacting domain and is expressed in a wide range of zzso The expression of a zzso fusion gene in association with aggressive leukemia progression suggests that this protein has zzso zzso
