zzso screening of zzso clones from a zzso library of Antarctic zzso zzso allowed the identification of two bacterial zzso clones belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso These clones were very zzso forming a zzso cluster with the environmental sequence zzso that zzso at the base of the zzso Except for the possession of complete zzso zzso without associated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were very different in gene content and zzso Gene density was much higher in zzso whereas nearly one-third of zzso corresponded to zzso zzso Many of the predicted genes zzso by these zzso clones were informational zzso involved in zzso transcription, translation and related zzso Despite this, a few putative cases of horizontal gene transfer were zzso including a zzso zzso contained one putative gene zzso a long zzso zzso probably zzso and zzso with only zzso zzso zzso carried some predicted genes involved in zzso pathways that suggested this zzso may be zzso and able to zzso and to degrade complex compounds zzso
