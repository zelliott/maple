We investigated the microbial community in an zzso zzso sludge blanket zzso reactor treating domestic wastewater zzso during two different periods of organic loading rate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone libraries were generated, and quantitative real-time zzso zzso analyses were zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso ratio affected the abundance and the composition of the zzso zzso community, mainly at the species level, as well as the performance of the zzso zzso The zzso analysis suggested that there was a decrease in the bacterial cell number during the rainy season, when the zzso and zzso ratio were zzso However, the bacterial diversity was higher during this time, suggesting that the community zzso more diversified zzso The diversity and the abundance of the zzso community were higher when the zzso ratio was zzso Shifts in the zzso community composition might have influenced the route of methane production, with methane produced by zzso zzso zzso season), and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This study revealed higher levels of bacterial diversity, zzso specialization and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of the zzso zzso reactor during the rainy zzso
