The carbon zzso of zzso zzso are zzso by sequential zzso of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso through actions of a series of zzso called zzso Recent molecular analyses of zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, Zhang zzso zzso Y, Li zzso zzso T & zzso K (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that not only the primary structure but also the crystal structure of zzso were totally different from those of zzso Although many studies on zzso relationships of zzso have been reported, regulation mechanisms for the ultimate zzso chain length have not yet been zzso We report here that the ultimate chain length of zzso products can be controlled through structural manipulation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 26, based on comparisons between structures of various zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which are located in the proximity of the zzso binding site, with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in shorter ultimate products with zzso Additional zzso of zzso resulted in even shorter zzso On the other hand, zzso of charged zzso originating from zzso zzso into zzso which zzso in constitution of the large zzso zzso resulted in lengthening of the ultimate product chain zzso leading to zzso These results helped us understand reaction mechanisms of zzso including regulation of the ultimate zzso zzso
