The structure of human zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso The resulting structural information is compared to that available for zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso revealing a high level of overall similarity but several significant zzso These findings further our zzso of the structural basis for zzso zzso The interactions of the protein with the zzso zzso are zzso using zzso nuclear zzso effects zzso and zzso zzso These interactions are seen across almost the full length of zzso and show the zzso expected for an zzso zzso interacting with the zzso surface of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we observe specific contacts between zzso zzso of zzso and zzso near the zzso group of zzso consistent with the predictions of the so-called zzso zzso of the structural basis for the zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso Jackson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1974) A molecular theory of zzso interactions in the plasma zzso zzso zzso 38, zzso These findings offer the most detailed structural information available for the interaction between an zzso and the zzso of the zzso surface and provide the first direct structural support for the snorkel zzso
