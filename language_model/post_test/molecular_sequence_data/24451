The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distributed in zzso regions of the western United States and Mexico, include a mixture of zzso and more recently evolved zzso To investigate relationships among the zzso we screened and partially zzso zzso clones of the nuclear zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso zzso region for 16 zzso from zzso zzso and nine representatives from four other zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of clones reveal zzso zzso suggesting that concerted evolution is operating slowly on the ITS in pine zzso Two ITS clones were identified as zzso zzso zzso in the zzso form stem zzso comparable to those in other zzso of zzso and may be promoting zzso between zzso repeats, resulting in zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso structure is present, but different clones from the same (or zzso individuals of a species are zzso indicating that zzso of ITS copies within individual zzso predates evolutionary divergence in the zzso At the level of zzso and above, the ITS region zzso well with zzso and zzso zzso Except for zzso zzso the zzso are zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso forming a zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of western North zzso
