Changes in zzso free zzso concentration zzso affect many different aspects of zzso function ranging from zzso regulation of zzso channels to long term changes in gene zzso These effects of zzso are zzso by zzso proteins that act as zzso sensors by binding zzso undergoing a zzso change and then zzso the function of additional target zzso zzso species express 14 members of the zzso calcium sensor zzso family of zzso zzso zzso proteins which are expressed mainly in zzso cells or zzso Many of the zzso proteins are membrane targeted through their zzso zzso either zzso or following exposure of the zzso group after zzso binding (the zzso zzso The zzso proteins have been implicated in a wide range of functional roles in zzso regulation, several of which have been confirmed though molecular genetic zzso
