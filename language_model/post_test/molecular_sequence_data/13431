We have characterized the expression of a zzso zzso zzso and determined the location of its gene product, a protein zzso zzso zzso during virus zzso Using an zzso raised to a zzso fusion to zzso zzso we found that zzso was expressed as a 19 zzso zzso at late times during virus zzso However, we also found that zzso was present in the zzso of both the zzso and zzso forms so that a low level of zzso is also present at the beginning of the infection zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso was primarily localized to the zzso in zzso cells but that zzso was present in both the zzso and the nucleus of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was associated with zzso structures which form in both the zzso and the nucleus of zzso zzso
