zzso plasma membrane fusion is preceded by zzso zzso to the egg plasma zzso zzso zzso frequently involves multiple zzso molecules on the adhering zzso One zzso surface protein with a role in zzso plasma membrane zzso is zzso a zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso alpha and beta are the first identified members of a new family of membrane proteins that each has the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This protein family has been named zzso because all members contain a zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies indicate that the zzso domain of zzso beta functions in zzso zzso leading to zzso Full length zzso clones have been isolated for five zzso expressed in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, and zzso zzso The presence of the zzso domain, a known zzso zzso suggests that like zzso zzso other zzso zzso could be involved in zzso zzso to the egg zzso We tested zzso zzso from the predicted binding sites in the zzso zzso of the five zzso zzso in a zzso plasma membrane zzso and fusion zzso The active site zzso from zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and fusion and was a more potent inhibitor than the zzso beta active site zzso zzso generated against the active site region of either zzso or zzso beta also strongly inhibited zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these two zzso family members showed that they are both processed during zzso maturation and present on mature zzso zzso zzso on live, zzso zzso using zzso against either zzso or zzso beta showed zzso of the equatorial region, a region of the zzso membrane that zzso in the early steps of membrane zzso zzso these data indicate that a second zzso family member, zzso functions with zzso beta in zzso plasma membrane zzso leading to zzso
