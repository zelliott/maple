The human zzso virus zzso zzso protein zzso containing two zzso zinc fingers was proposed to be involved in reverse zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis through promotion of zzso zzso to the zzso primer binding site, improvement of DNA strand zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso The zzso structural characteristics are crucial because zzso altering the finger domain zzso led to zzso viruses characterized by defects in zzso zzso These findings prompted us to study a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using far Western analysis or zzso immobilized on beads clearly showed the formation of a complex between zzso and zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso was zzso zzso with a zzso zzso This interaction was confirmed by chemical zzso and zzso of the two proteins in a viral zzso Competition experiments using different zzso zzso showed that zzso of the finger structure disrupted zzso recognition, giving insights into the loss of zzso of corresponding zzso zzso Together with structural data on zzso these results suggest that the role of zzso could be to enhance zzso zzso through stabilization of a zzso active form of the zzso zzso and open the way for designing new zzso zzso
