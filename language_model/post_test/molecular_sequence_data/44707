The zzso short arm of human zzso 1 zzso is rearranged in a variety of zzso and several genetic diseases also map to this zzso We have constructed an integrated transcript map to precisely define the positions of genes and expressed sequence tags zzso previously mapped to zzso a region spanning approximately 40 zzso To anchor the integrated map, a framework genetic map was constructed with 24 genetic markers and a marker order of zzso zzso yielding an average resolution of zzso zzso An additional 106 genetic markers were localized relative to the framework genetic zzso To place markers more precisely within zzso a zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso panel was zzso Individual DNA fragments of the zzso panel were identified and ordered by zzso with the framework genetic zzso A total of 250 zzso including 142 genes and zzso were mapped by zzso against the zzso zzso The map has an observed resolution of 800 zzso and the results closely match and more precisely define previous mapping information for most zzso This map will help to identify candidate genes for genetic diseases mapping to zzso zzso and is fully integrated with existing genetic and zzso maps of the human zzso
