The attenuated strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used worldwide to prevent tuberculosis and zzso is also clinically used as an zzso agent against superficial zzso zzso An zzso zzso has been isolated from the boiling water extract of the Tice zzso of zzso and tentatively characterized as consisting primarily of repeating units of zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and other zzso species produce a zzso zzso composed of repeating units of zzso zzso zzso zzso at some 6 positions by short zzso units that also exhibits an zzso zzso zzso the impression prevails that zzso zzso different types of zzso zzso or, zzso the zzso zzso are singular in producing a unique type of zzso that may zzso to them their zzso zzso The present study addresses this question through the comparative analysis of zzso zzso from the zzso materials and boiling water extracts of three vaccine zzso The zzso were zzso and their structural features were established by zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso of the zzso and chemical degradation products of the zzso zzso The zzso isolated by the two methods from the three zzso of zzso were shown to exhibit identical structural features shared with the zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis and other zzso zzso we observed an occasional release of zzso from zzso columns that may explain the reported occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso
