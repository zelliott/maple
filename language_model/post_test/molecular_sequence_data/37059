zzso family small zzso regulate multiple cellular functions through reorganization of the zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso induce zzso or peripheral processes in cultured zzso We have identified a member of the family, designated as zzso which is closely related to zzso zzso was highly expressed in muscular zzso and brain and remarkably induced during differentiation of C2 skeletal muscle cells and zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso was predominantly expressed in heart and zzso and induced during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso generated zzso peripheral processes longer than the zzso zzso whereas zzso produced much longer and thicker processes containing zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso induced zzso outgrowth in zzso and zzso cells, but zzso did not do this by zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso bound to the zzso zzso portion of zzso and activated zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso The formation of peripheral processes and zzso by zzso and zzso was prevented by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso is essential for the process formation and zzso outgrowth induced by zzso and zzso zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso and by serum zzso respectively, was prevented by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, all these zzso family proteins are required for zzso zzso but they exert their functions zzso in process formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by these small zzso mediates zzso differentiation in addition to its recently identified role in zzso zzso
