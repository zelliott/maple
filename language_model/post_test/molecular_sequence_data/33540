zzso zzso regulate numerous zzso processes such as cell division and differentiation in many tissue types including stem zzso To probe the role that zzso play in regulating processes relevant to embryonic stem cell biology, we used zzso interference to silence zzso and zzso the two main zzso processing zzso zzso with a role for zzso in maintaining normal stem cell division and renewal, we found that zzso of zzso zzso function in human embryonic stem cells zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell growth can be partially restored by introduction of the mature zzso zzso and zzso These zzso regulate two tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a negative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex and zzso which encodes zzso a zzso zzso dependent zzso inhibitor that regulates the zzso zzso We show that in zzso zzso zzso 1 levels control the rate of zzso division, whereas zzso levels must be maintained at a low level for zzso division to zzso These data support a model for zzso cell cycle control in which zzso regulate negative cell cycle zzso at two zzso of the cell cycle to ensure proper zzso of the stem cell zzso
