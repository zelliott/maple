In certain curved DNA fragments without AA zzso the gel zzso anomaly associated with zzso passes through a maximum with zzso zzso indicating length (and electric zzso dependent structural transitions in the zzso We suggest that zzso induced zzso zzso in DNA are stabilized in the zzso thus zzso the effects of zzso These zzso are shown to occur specifically at zzso and zzso zzso Other physical and biological evidence points to frequent structural zzso at CA and zzso zzso These zzso sequence dependent zzso may therefore represent a novel class of structural zzso recognition zzso
