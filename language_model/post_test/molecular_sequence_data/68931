zzso blood B cells of a zzso person were separated into zzso zzso and zzso subsets, and zzso sequences of expressed zzso light chain variable zzso regions zzso by V zzso 3 and V zzso 4 gene family members were determined from amplified zzso V region sequences from zzso cells (the major B cell population in the zzso showed no or little zzso zzso zzso in contrast to V zzso sequences from zzso and zzso B cells zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that in the human like in the zzso and independently of age, zzso zzso memory B cells accumulate in the compartment of zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso consists of cells whose zzso repertoire is mainly determined by V region gene zzso and zzso zzso at the molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells may represent early descendants of zzso cells recruited into the memory cell zzso
