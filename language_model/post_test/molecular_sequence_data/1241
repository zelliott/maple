Genes of the zzso complex zzso zzso factors whose activity regulates the development of neural zzso The zzso restricted expression of zzso on the zzso of higher flies zzso the development and positioning of the large sensory zzso On the zzso the zzso are arranged into zzso patterns, based on an ancestral arrangement of four zzso zzso This pattern appears to date back to the origin of zzso flies about zzso million years zzso The origin of the zzso zzso which is independent of body size, and the reasons for its zzso are not zzso 

We report that zzso for attachment of the indirect flight muscles are invariably located between the bristle rows of the zzso throughout the zzso zzso development depends on the activity of a zzso factor zzso by the gene zzso In zzso stripe and zzso have separate expression zzso leading to spatial segregation of zzso precursors and bristle zzso zzso the products of these genes act zzso zzso zzso expression prevents bristle development and zzso zzso expression prevents normal muscle zzso The product of stripe acts downstream of zzso and interferes with the development of bristle zzso 

The pattern of flight muscles has changed little throughout the zzso and we argue that the sites of muscle attachment may have constrained the positioning of zzso during the course of zzso This could account for the pattern of four bristle rows on the zzso
