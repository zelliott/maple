zzso changes during glacial periods have had a major influence on the recent evolutionary history of living organisms, even in the warm temperate zzso We investigated zzso patterns of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso seed zzso of zzso zzso growing in the zzso evergreen forests in zzso We examined zzso zzso of zzso DNA for 204 individuals collected from 62 populations of the zzso Four major zzso were zzso in southwestern and northeastern parts of the main islands and in central and southern parts of the zzso zzso The demographic population expansion was detected for the two groups in the main islands but not for the zzso zzso The beginning time of the expansion was dated to zzso years ago, which is consistent with the end of the last glacial zzso Our data also demonstrated that the southwestern population of the main islands has experienced a more severe bottleneck and more rapid population growth after glacial ages than the northeastern zzso At least three zzso areas in the main islands were likely to have existed during the last glacial zzso one of which had not previously been recognized by analyses of zzso zzso DNA variation of several plant species growing in the zzso evergreen zzso Our results represent the first zzso and population demographic analysis of an insect species associated with the zzso evergreen forests in Japan, and reveal more detailed zzso history of the zzso
