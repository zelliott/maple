The zzso zzso group comprises several closely related species that are involved in food contamination and zzso Specifically, the interest in zzso as a zzso of dairy products increased after the cases of zzso zzso that occurred in Italy in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso scheme was developed and applied to zzso 136 zzso zzso strains and food borne zzso at strain level, to reveal the genetic relationships among them and to disclose any possible genetic zzso of zzso markers involved in food zzso zzso zzso zzso activities and pigmented or fluorescent zzso zzso The production of dark blue zzso zzso was evaluated on several bacterial culture media and directly on mozzarella zzso The zzso scheme provided precise zzso at the strain level, and the population analyses of the zzso sequences allowed major zzso to be zzso This approach was revealed to be suitable for tracking the strains according to their origin, such as dairy plants or food zzso The genetic analysis revealed the presence of a connection between the blue zzso production and a specific zzso zzso The development of the online database specific to the zzso group zzso will facilitate the application of the scheme and the sharing of the zzso
