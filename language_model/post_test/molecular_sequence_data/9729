The small zzso zzso is implicated in zzso zzso including stress fiber and focal zzso formation and in the zzso zzso of zzso serum response zzso In zzso zzso which is activated by zzso zzso not only zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the formation of stress fibers and focal zzso in zzso Here we show that the expression of zzso active zzso increased the level of zzso zzso The activity of zzso was necessary for maintaining the zzso focal zzso whereas organized zzso stress fibers were not necessary for zzso The zzso of zzso active zzso into zzso induced the formation of focal zzso to some extent under the conditions where organized zzso stress fibers were zzso The expression of zzso active zzso also zzso the zzso activity of zzso serum response zzso These results suggest that zzso has distinct roles in divergent pathways downstream of zzso which include zzso zzso leading to stress fiber formation, focal zzso formation, and gene zzso
