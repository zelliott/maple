We have zzso zzso zzso elements from five independently isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso We also zzso zzso copies of zzso elements amplified from the zzso of the zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso larvae using the zzso chain reaction zzso The sequences of all the newly isolated zzso elements closely resemble the previously described zzso zzso Each of the zzso isolated from the virus zzso duplicated a zzso zzso target site upon zzso into the viral zzso Four of these zzso elements zzso into three different zzso target sites within the 25 K gene zzso zzso map units zzso of zzso The fifth zzso element inserted at a zzso site within the zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso element, amplified from the zzso cell line DNA by an inverse zzso method, duplicated a zzso zzso target site that is present only once in the zzso zzso DNA zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso into both viral and cellular sites is identical in specificity and zzso
