zzso zzso are the key zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, as they catalyze the zzso of the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso to the specific zzso zzso From zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso named zzso a zzso zzso named zzso and two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were recently isolated zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso The aim of our work in this study was to identify zzso within these zzso zzso zzso determining the product zzso zzso swapping experiments between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso were zzso We found that within the zzso domain of these zzso zzso a region zzso 200 zzso zzso of which 41 are different between zzso and zzso determines the specificity for the formation of zzso or zzso respectively, while another region localized further downstream is required for a zzso zzso to yield products in the same ratio as in the zzso zzso For zzso the two zzso together appear to be sufficient for its zzso zzso but many zzso were inactive probably due to the low zzso with zzso zzso modeling was used to further pinpoint the zzso acids responsible for the differences in product specificity of zzso and zzso
