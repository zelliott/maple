The zzso of zzso zzso infections is dependent upon expression of various zzso factors, which are under the control of multiple regulatory systems, including zzso regulatory systems and zzso regulators such as the zzso family of zzso As a part of a continuing effort to understand the regulatory mechanisms that involve the zzso protein family, the regulation and physical characterization of rot zzso is described zzso The rot zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso was previously characterized and has been shown to regulate a large number of zzso The rot locus is composed of multiple overlapping transcripts as determined by primer extension and was proposed to zzso an open reading frame of 133 zzso zzso of rot was significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso shift and zzso studies revealed that zzso could bind to the rot promoter region, probably acting as a zzso for rot zzso The data indicate that the expression of rot zzso is significantly zzso only by zzso among the zzso family of zzso tested at the zzso phase of zzso
