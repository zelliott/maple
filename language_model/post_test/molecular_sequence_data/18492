All species from the zzso zzso class zzso are currently part of a single family, zzso Using zzso data from 17 zzso species, detailed zzso and comparative zzso analyses were carried out to understand their evolutionary relationships and identify molecular markers that are indicative of species relationships within the zzso In the zzso zzso gene tree and zzso trees based upon two different large sets of zzso members of the zzso zzso formed a number of zzso zzso Character zzso analysis on the protein sequence data also recovered a single largest zzso that exhibited similar zzso to the protein trees and where all zzso were supported by multiple compatible zzso Comparative zzso analyses have identified 85 molecular zzso in the form of zzso signature zzso zzso which are specific for different observed zzso of zzso at multiple zzso zzso Eleven of these zzso were specific for the zzso zzso whereas nine others supported a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Ten other zzso provided evidence that the zzso zzso and zzso shared a common zzso exclusive of the other zzso and four and eight zzso in other proteins were specific for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two other deep branching zzso one consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso and the other zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso were also supported by multiple zzso Based upon the consistent branching of the zzso species using different zzso approaches, and numerous identified zzso supporting the zzso of different zzso it is proposed that the class zzso should be divided into three orders zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing four families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the results of our zzso studies along with the species distribution patterns of 22 identified zzso provide compelling evidence that the current zzso zzso is comprised of two evolutionary distinct groups and that it should be divided into two zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso zzso should retain only the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the other zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subterranean and zzso zzso be transferred to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso
