Many zzso regulators function in zzso or zzso zzso The same protein can carry out distinct regulatory functions depending on the partner with which it zzso Here, we describe a zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso that has an altered zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso form zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the formation of a parallel zzso structure, and our zzso zzso bears an zzso acid substitution affecting the first zzso position zzso within the zzso that mediates zzso zzso The genetic strategy we used to isolate this zzso altered zzso specificity zzso zzso is zzso and could be zzso to isolate zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso
