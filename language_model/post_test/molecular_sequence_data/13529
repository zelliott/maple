The mechanism by which zzso bacteria like zzso coli zzso zzso into the culture medium is unique and quite different from the mechanism by which other proteins are zzso across the two bacterial zzso namely through the known branches of the general zzso zzso The release of zzso requires the expression and activity of a so-called zzso release protein and the presence of the zzso zzso A in the outer zzso The zzso release proteins are highly expressed small zzso which are zzso with a signal zzso that remains stable and which accumulates in the zzso membrane after zzso The combined action of these stable, accumulated signal zzso the zzso mature zzso release proteins zzso and zzso A cause the release of zzso The structure and mode of action of these zzso as well as their application in the release of zzso proteins by zzso coli is described in this zzso
