The destruction and zzso of entire tissue segments represent an insurmountable barrier to zzso zzso and zzso in chronic spinal zzso zzso To circumvent this problem, we engineered neural zzso by assembling zzso zzso and zzso peptides into composite guidance channels and transplanted them into the zzso of a zzso chronic spinal zzso injury rat model, also providing delivery of zzso zzso Six months later conspicuous zzso reconstruction was zzso The zzso was replaced by newly formed tissue zzso neural and zzso zzso Nerve fibers were zzso between and inside the guidance channels, spanning the zzso zzso a well-developed vascular network, zzso zzso and zzso This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the activity of ascending and descending motor pathways and the global locomotion zzso Thus by engineering zzso zzso into zzso it is possible to recreate an zzso zzso and zzso zzso which leads to the replacement of large, hollow tissue gaps in the chronically injured spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso and neurological zzso
