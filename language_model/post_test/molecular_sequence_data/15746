zzso zzso have central functions in various cellular signal zzso pathways through their zzso zzso Here we show that a protein zzso zzso has unexpected role as a scaffold for an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with an zzso zzso complex containing zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as a scaffold for the zzso complex, because zzso depletion of zzso zzso the formation of the zzso zzso Although the zzso activity of zzso is zzso for its ability to mediate zzso complex formation, it is required for the zzso and subsequent degradation of its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso our results reveal a new type of zzso zzso complex in humans that depends on a protein zzso for complex formation as well as for the subsequent zzso zzso and degradation of their zzso
