The zzso zzso of zzso zzso has previously been reported to be located in both the inner and the outer zzso We have cloned the zzso designated zzso zzso this zzso and determined its zzso zzso No significant sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli was found at either the DNA or protein zzso However, a sequence is zzso in the zzso coli zzso which zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso analysis has allowed the identification of the zzso zzso which has an Mr of zzso as compared to an Mr of zzso for the zzso coli zzso Most of the protein zzso zzso is located in the inner zzso Two independent membrane zzso procedures indicate that the remainder may be associated with the outer zzso The deduced primary structure indicates the presence of an zzso signal zzso although certain features of the region surrounding the putative processing site indicate that processing may be inefficient, or may not zzso zzso with several zzso of signal zzso function fail to demonstrate the appearance of a precursor zzso
