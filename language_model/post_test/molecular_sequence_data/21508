The zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso exists in an zzso zzso unable to suppress the zzso zzso zzso zzso is disabled by zzso zzso of zzso after zzso The zzso zzso binds to mature zzso zzso its zzso activity, and, presumably, also targets zzso for zzso zzso suppression of zzso is effectively antagonized by the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite rigorous effort, the molecular mechanisms behind these observations are zzso Here we report a zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso which reveals how the zzso sequences recognize a zzso surface groove in zzso to achieve zzso and a zzso zzso crystal structure of active zzso bound to zzso zzso which provides a structural explanation to zzso zzso of zzso These structures and associated zzso zzso together with published reports, define the molecular zzso that govern the interplay among zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
