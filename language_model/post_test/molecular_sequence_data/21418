zzso in zzso zzso were shown to significantly alter the stability of the open state of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso with zzso channels, we tested the hypothesis that channel zzso involves zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso Among the 11 positions tested in the zzso zzso of domain II, zzso of the zzso zzso at position zzso were found to destabilize significantly the closed state with a zzso zzso shift in the zzso potential and a zzso zzso shift in its zzso relationship as compared with zzso zzso A double zzso cycle analysis was performed by introducing pairs of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Strong zzso energies zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso were measured for the zzso gating of 12 of 39 pairs of zzso zzso zzso was strongly coupled with zzso zzso in zzso from zzso to zzso In particular, the double zzso zzso showed strong zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that both positions contribute to the zzso gating of the zzso Altogether, our results highlight the role of a zzso zzso in zzso and provide the first series of evidence that the zzso and zzso regions are energetically coupled during the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso
