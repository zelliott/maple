zzso growth zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that stimulates cell zzso zzso and zzso by zzso of its zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a series of structural units, including an zzso segment with a hairpin loop, four zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain retains the zzso properties of full-length zzso In contrast to a previous hypothesis, selected basic zzso acid zzso in the hairpin loop are not critical for zzso zzso although zzso substitution at a subset of these sites markedly reduced the biological activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso binding was strongly dependent on zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso cells not only restored zzso zzso but also increased zzso Met zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, our results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso through an interaction with the N zzso These findings establish the importance of the N domain for zzso and zzso zzso and demonstrate a crucial role for zzso in zzso binding and signal zzso
