zzso play essential roles in a variety of zzso responses that contribute to the development and reproduction of zzso Both the zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso family, which has a zzso zzso motif zzso at the zzso We identified the full-length zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a major zzso zzso of zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso is 591 zzso in zzso zzso 197 zzso zzso from which five putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso was highly similar zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but possesses a unique zzso zzso zzso where zzso has replaced a zzso zzso present in other zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA sequence of zzso is zzso zzso in size and is composed of six zzso zzso analysis has revealed that the zzso protein sequence is closest to its zzso in zzso but distant from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which agrees with the current zzso zzso transcripts were present in the head and zzso complex, but absent in the abdomen of zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso have demonstrated a relatively higher expression of zzso zzso in the latter half of the zzso stages and in zzso These findings represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the zzso gene architecture and zzso and raise the possibility of using zzso to manage zzso zzso populations through molecular zzso
