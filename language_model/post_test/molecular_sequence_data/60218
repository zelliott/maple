A new approach that permits zzso identification of zzso that respond to specified stimuli was zzso This approach was illustrated by examination of zzso that grew in response to various zzso supplements added to zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and supplements were added to soil and incubated for 3 zzso DNA was extracted from the soil, and the newly zzso DNA was isolated by zzso of the zzso zzso The unique perspective this approach offers was demonstrated by comparing the microbial community structures obtained from total soil DNA and the zzso fraction in an zzso gene zzso zzso The traditional total DNA analysis revealed no notable differences between the treatments, whereas the zzso DNA showed significantly different zzso patterns between the zzso supplement treatments and compared with total DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed to specifically amplify the zzso region of an zzso sequence unique to the zzso analysis of a zzso supplement zzso zzso of DNA from all treatments using these zzso showed that it was unique to the zzso treatment and that it was present in both the total DNA and zzso DNA zzso This result demonstrates the promise of this new strategy, because it was able to permit identification of a sequence from a zzso zzso that was not zzso in the traditional total DNA community structure zzso
