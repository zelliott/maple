The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso sources has previously been shown to exhibit a marked dependency upon the presence of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso We now show that the activity of AK from diverse sources, including plant, zzso and zzso species, is also markedly enhanced in the presence of zzso In all cases, zzso or other zzso exerted their effects primarily by decreasing the zzso for zzso and alleviating the zzso caused by high zzso of zzso These results provide evidence that zzso dependency is a zzso property of AK and perhaps of the zzso family of zzso zzso which includes zzso On the basis of sequence zzso we have identified a zzso motif zzso within the zzso zzso The N and E of this motif make close contacts with zzso and zzso zzso in the crystal structures of AK and bacterial zzso (another zzso member which shows zzso zzso implicating these zzso in their zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in Chinese zzso AK have resulted in active proteins with greatly altered zzso stimulation and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso leads to the formation of an active protein whose activity was not zzso by zzso or inhibited by high zzso of zzso or zzso The activity of the zzso zzso protein was also not significantly altered in the presence of zzso Although zzso had no effect on the zzso for this zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso In contrast to these zzso zzso or zzso zzso proteins showed greatly decreased activity with an altered zzso zzso These observations support the view that zzso and zzso play an important role in the binding of zzso and zzso zzso required for the zzso activity of zzso zzso
