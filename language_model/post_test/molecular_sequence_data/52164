zzso zzso in the zzso coli zzso gene result in the unique zzso of not affecting growth at temperatures below zzso degrees C but leading to a loss of viability at temperatures above this in rich zzso When zzso bacteria growing in rich media were shifted to the zzso temperature of 42 degrees C, they continued to grow at a rate similar to that at 30 degrees C but they produced zzso at the rate required for growth at 42 degrees zzso This led to the zzso of more than twice as much zzso per zzso of protein compared with that in zzso zzso zzso with zzso playing a role in zzso zzso one zzso group of spontaneously arising zzso that suppressed zzso zzso were mapped to the zzso zzso This zzso codes for the zzso zzso carrier protein and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso complex, which zzso the first step in fatty acid zzso Four zzso zzso mapped to this zzso Two zzso were identified as zzso in the zzso zzso the third zzso was identified as a zzso in the zzso zzso and the fourth zzso was shown to be an zzso of an zzso zzso element in the promoter region of the zzso resulting in reduced zzso The zzso zzso caused a decrease in the rate of zzso zzso restoring the balance between the zzso of zzso and growth rate, thus enabling zzso bacteria to grow at high zzso
