zzso peptides zzso are components of the immune system of both zzso and zzso zzso This study describes the isolation, primary structure, zzso zzso and tissue expression profile of two zzso zzso from the zzso of the cattle tick zzso zzso A zzso Da zzso with six zzso zzso and no sequence similarity to any known zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso Because of its sequence originality, this zzso was named zzso The second zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da and six zzso is a zzso with similarity to the insect zzso family zzso The zzso cloning established that zzso is zzso as a zzso while the tick zzso is zzso as a zzso Interestingly, despite the fact that zzso and zzso have been isolated from different zzso their gene expression was found to have similar tissue zzso
