A zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso was related to members of the zzso zzso and showed highest similarity with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of the new isolate were consistent with the description of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso was of type zzso and contained the zzso acids zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso acid in an approximate zzso ratio of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had zzso and zzso as major zzso and contained zzso and zzso as major fatty zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso characteristics and zzso analysis, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
