Guide zzso zzso have been proposed to mediate zzso zzso zzso editing of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The Us are proposed to be derived either from zzso by two successive zzso or zzso or from the 3' end of the zzso by the same zzso We have demonstrated zzso U insertions into a specific editing site of a zzso zzso which was incubated in a zzso extract from zzso zzso The zzso number of U insertions was determined by the number of guiding zzso in the added zzso and the formation of a zzso anchor duplex was necessary for zzso zzso and zzso bond zzso of zzso were required, and the activity was inhibited above zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of up to approximately 13 Us occurred in the absence of the added zzso zzso the extent of this activity was affected by sequences upstream and downstream of the edited zzso zzso inhibited the zzso U zzso activity and had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso the 3' OH of the zzso had little effect on the zzso U zzso zzso The data are consistent with a zzso model in which the Us are derived directly from zzso
