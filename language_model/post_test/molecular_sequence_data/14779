The zzso protein zzso controls zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates expression of a large number of genes that differ both in their ancestry and in the zzso functions and zzso roles of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso genes are zzso zzso To understand how a bacterial zzso might generate varied gene expression zzso we investigated the zzso promoter features zzso the number of zzso binding sites, as well as their orientation and location with respect to the sites bound by zzso zzso and the sequences that constitute the zzso binding zzso in 23 zzso zzso Our results show that natural zzso promoters zzso only a limited number of combinations of zzso zzso promoter zzso We determine that zzso activates zzso by different mechanisms, and that ancestral and zzso acquired zzso genes have distinct promoter zzso
