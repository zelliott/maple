A zzso inhibitor is strongly induced in tobacco leaves reacting zzso to tobacco mosaic zzso The tobacco inhibitor is highly active against four different zzso zzso of zzso and bacterial origin zzso zzso but zzso poorly two zzso zzso of animal origin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor has been zzso to zzso by successive steps of conventional and zzso liquid zzso When zzso under zzso conditions, it behaves as a small zzso with a molecular weight of about zzso From its zzso acid composition and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, it appears that the inhibitor belongs to the potato inhibitor I zzso A zzso zzso was raised against the zzso tobacco inhibitor and was used in zzso experiments to follow inhibitor zzso during the hypersensitive reaction of tobacco to tobacco mosaic zzso The inhibitor is highly efficient and might represent a potent zzso and/or zzso to be used in plant zzso
