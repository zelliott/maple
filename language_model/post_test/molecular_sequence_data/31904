The conventional mass zzso zzso strategy is often inadequate for the comprehensive characterization of various size zzso without the assistance of zzso zzso This study evaluated sequence coverage of different size zzso in two zzso species, blue crab zzso zzso and Jonah crab Cancer borealis using conventional zzso zzso and revealed limitations to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we attempt to establish a zzso strategy for simultaneous and confident sequence zzso of various sizes of peptides in the zzso nervous zzso Nine novel zzso spanning a wide range of molecular weights zzso were fully zzso from a major neuroendocrine organ, the zzso zzso of the zzso lobster zzso zzso These novel zzso included seven zzso zzso and zzso zzso one zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso accurate zzso characterization of a collection of varied size zzso was achieved by zzso traditional zzso tandem zzso improved bottom-up sequencing, multiple fragmentation zzso zzso sequencing, chemical zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability to characterize a zzso with vastly differing zzso sizes from a neural tissue extract could find great utility in unraveling complex signaling zzso zzso employed by other biological zzso 

Mass zzso zzso zzso aims to completely characterize the zzso in a target zzso as an important first step toward a better understanding of the structure and function of these complex signaling zzso Although liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso zzso with zzso acquisition is a powerful tool in zzso research, it often lacks the capability for de zzso sequencing of zzso and large peptides due to inefficient fragmentation of peptides larger than zzso This study describes a zzso strategy for complete and confident sequence zzso of various sizes of zzso in the zzso nervous zzso The aim is to fill a technical gap where the conventional strategy is inefficient for comprehensive characterization of a complex zzso without assistance of zzso zzso Nine novel zzso in a wide range of molecular weights zzso were fully zzso from a major neuroendocrine organ of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting molecular information extracted from such zzso zzso analysis will greatly accelerate functional studies of these novel zzso
