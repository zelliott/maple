A zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned from a rat brain zzso library zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso This zzso contained a zzso domain and a presumed zzso protein zzso zzso domain that are found in other zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso had zzso shared identity with the presumed zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the two molecules had a region of similarity that is not zzso in other zzso zzso By examining zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells using zzso tag zzso as well as conventional methods, the product zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was recovered predominantly from the soluble fraction and the activity was markedly enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso and was relatively insensitive to zzso by zzso In addition, the zzso zzso activity was completely inhibited in the presence of 10 zzso zzso When examined by zzso tag zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in a zzso region juxtaposed to the zzso and was faintly but widely dispersed in the zzso By in zzso zzso analysis, the zzso for zzso zzso was expressed zzso and was detected in most zzso throughout the zzso matter of the brain, with higher expression intensity found in fetal than in adult zzso
