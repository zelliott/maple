zzso editing in flowering plant zzso addresses several hundred specific C zzso in individual sequence contexts in zzso and zzso Many of the in zzso steady state zzso are edited at some sites but not at zzso It is still unclear whether such incompletely edited zzso can either be completed or are zzso To learn more about the dynamics of the zzso recognition process, we investigated in zzso zzso editing at a locus in the zzso zzso where three editing sites are clustered within four zzso A single zzso of about 20 zzso serves in the recognition of at least two zzso Competition with this sequence element suppresses in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso and edited competitors are equally zzso zzso with partially zzso zzso indicate that indeed the editing status of a zzso zzso does not affect the binding affinity of the specificity zzso zzso molecules in which all editing sites are zzso by either A or G still compete, confirming that editing site recognition can occur independently of the actual editing zzso These results show that incompletely edited zzso can be zzso for further rounds of zzso editing, resolving a long debated zzso
