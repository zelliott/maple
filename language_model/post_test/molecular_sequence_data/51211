Relative zzso of aromatic zzso acid zzso are investigated by using differential scanning zzso zzso on 10 synthetic zzso of zzso of zzso zzso the zzso process of the inverse temperature transition exhibited by these zzso in zzso solution, the relative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are determined by the critical temperature and heat of the zzso The zzso data for the aromatic zzso containing zzso zzso solution indicate that zzso is the most zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the third most zzso on basis of transition temperature and the second on basis of transition zzso For zzso significant differences are observed between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso At pH 7, where zzso is zzso it is found to be the second most zzso zzso acid zzso on the basis of the transition temperature, whereas on the basis of the heat of transition, it is less zzso than both zzso and zzso zzso the pH from pH 7 to pH 12, for example, for zzso zzso in zzso solution shifts the transition temperature from 7 to 49 degrees C with a dramatically reduced zzso On the basis of both the transition temperature scale and the heat of transition, the zzso zzso appears less zzso than zzso
