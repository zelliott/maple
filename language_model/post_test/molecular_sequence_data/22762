zzso are zzso zzso zzso that direct zzso formation, enabling faithful zzso zzso zzso regions of higher zzso are structurally complex, consisting of various zzso modified zzso types including specialized zzso at the zzso itself, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the features necessary for the establishment and maintenance of discrete zzso zzso remain poorly zzso two models have been proposed based either on the passive convergence of competing activities involved in individual domain formation or, zzso on the action of specific zzso sequences and associated proteins to actively block the propagation of one zzso type into zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso sequences located at the intersection of zzso zzso central core zzso and outer repeat zzso identified a zzso barrier that contains a transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso or modification of the barrier sequences result in the propagation of zzso zzso beyond its normal zzso The zzso gene is zzso active, and barrier activity requires sequences necessary for zzso zzso III zzso Moreover, absence of the barrier results in abnormal zzso zzso zzso 

The identification of DNA sequences with zzso barrier activity at the zzso zzso zzso provides a model for establishment of zzso zzso zzso in higher zzso
