The role of six zzso of zzso in channel gating was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso loop between segment zzso and the pore zzso were each zzso to zzso the zzso channels were expressed and studied by patch clamping in zzso zzso zzso and zzso conducted calcium zzso while the other zzso were not zzso zzso and zzso as well as double zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the calcium zzso shifted the zzso curve in the zzso direction and slowed down channel zzso zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shifted the current zzso curve of zzso channels in the zzso zzso zzso curve for all zzso channels was shifted in zzso direction by zzso while zzso caused a zzso zzso Our study reveals that the zzso we studied have an essential role in zzso zzso We zzso that zzso in the large zzso loop of zzso form bridges within the loop and/or neighboring channel segments that are essential for channel zzso
