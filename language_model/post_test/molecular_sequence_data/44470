We have isolated and characterized the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso While this zzso has zzso identity with the closest zzso family member, zzso it is the zzso domain of this zzso that is the most zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso exists as a zzso expressed zzso however, expression of transcripts and protein increase during zzso and again in the late swimming zzso zzso In the adult, zzso is expressed at low levels in most adult zzso with increased levels observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso While low levels of zzso expression are observed in the adult brain, in zzso zzso analysis demonstrates prominent expression in the developing zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we have shown that zzso transcripts are significantly elevated during zzso induction caused by zzso and zzso but not during zzso zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in the developing zzso and nervous zzso
