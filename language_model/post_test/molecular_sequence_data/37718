A whole zzso zzso radiation hybrid cell panel was used to construct a map of 54 markers located on bovine zzso 5 zzso Of the 54 zzso 34 are zzso selected from the cattle linkage map and 20 are zzso Among the 20 mapped zzso 10 are new assignments that were made by using the comparative mapping by zzso and sequence similarity zzso A zzso radiation hybrid framework map consisting of 21 markers was zzso The relatively low retention frequency of markers on this zzso zzso prevented zzso ordering of the other 33 zzso The length of the map is zzso zzso corresponding to a ratio of approximately zzso zzso Type I genes were zzso for comparison of gene order among zzso humans, and zzso Multiple internal zzso within zzso zzso groups were apparent upon comparison of gene order on zzso and zzso and zzso A similarly high number of zzso were observed between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The detailed comparative map of zzso should facilitate identification of genes affecting economically important traits that have been mapped to this zzso and should contribute to our understanding of zzso zzso zzso
