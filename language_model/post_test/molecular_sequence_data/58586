zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso that has a narrow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in MRS broth was pH dependent, with maximum activity detected in broth culture maintained at pH zzso zzso zzso was zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and sequential zzso exchange and zzso zzso The sequence of the first 24 zzso acid zzso of the N zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso as determined by mass zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso effect but not a zzso effect on sensitive zzso zzso zzso dissipated the membrane potential and the pH zzso in sensitive cells, which affected such zzso motive zzso processes as zzso acid zzso zzso zzso also caused an zzso of zzso previously taken up via a zzso zzso transport zzso Secondary structure prediction revealed the presence of an zzso zzso region that could form zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that creates cell membrane channels through the zzso zzso
