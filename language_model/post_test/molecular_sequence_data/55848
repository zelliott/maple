We constructed a full open reading frame zzso for the rat zzso zzso zzso using two non functional zzso clones of a putative zzso zzso zzso I was complete but zzso in addition, two small zzso interrupting the frame, while clone II lacked 104 zzso at the zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso III and zzso zzso I fragments from clone I and a zzso zzso I zzso from clone II then zzso the three fragments with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Following this 4 zzso zzso zzso we obtained one correct insert in a clone we zzso in the zzso zzso I sites of zzso This zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with this correct zzso (but not with a truncated zzso zzso binding was selectively displaced with zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso while related peptides were inefficient at 1 zzso This demonstrated that the zzso previously described is indeed the rat zzso zzso zzso
