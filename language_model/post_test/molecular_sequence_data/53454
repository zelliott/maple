zzso is a selective zzso zzso of the zzso calcium channel currently in clinical trials for zzso zzso reached a zzso brain concentration of between zzso and zzso of the injected material per gram of tissue at zzso zzso after zzso injection, and this decayed to below zzso after 2 zzso The structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso was considerably more persistent in brain after zzso administration, with zzso of the injected material present at 2-4 h after zzso injection, and zzso present at 24 zzso Similar results zzso greater persistence of zzso were obtained when the peptides were zzso through in zzso dialysis zzso implanted into the zzso Image analysis and serial zzso showed that diffusion of zzso in the zzso fluid around the dialysis probe was zzso with the zzso located within 1 zzso of the probe after 2 zzso In zzso diffusion through cultured bovine brain zzso zzso cells zzso verified that a close structural analog of zzso zzso passed through this zzso barrier zzso model as expected for peptides of similar physical properties zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from blood to brain was also verified by in zzso zzso through the carotid zzso A statistically greater amount of zzso was found to cross the zzso after zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso depletion experiments and zzso analysis defined the brain location and zzso
