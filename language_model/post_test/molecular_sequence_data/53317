The human zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a binding site within its 33 zzso zzso region zzso for zzso zzso II zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso this zzso binding site was determined by zzso competition and by testing the ability of zzso and point zzso of the zzso sequence to bind zzso with a sensitive zzso plate binding zzso A synthetic zzso consisting of the entire 33 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could compete with a zzso fusion protein of the zzso zzso for binding to immobilized zzso while a zzso consisting of the last 16 zzso zzso could zzso A series of zzso zzso of the zzso showed that the terminal 21 zzso of zzso were not required for binding zzso zzso of four additional zzso zzso from the zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region zzso were critical for binding since mutating this sequence in the zzso to zzso zzso or zzso caused loss of zzso zzso A zzso construct zzso to zzso the zzso sequence in zzso could bind zzso zzso is a widely expressed zzso zzso and has a zzso zzso region with zzso sequence identity to zzso A zzso fusion protein of the 33 zzso zzso of zzso could bind to zzso similarly to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to an zzso motif within the zzso of zzso zzso may be a general mechanism for promoting zzso transport across cell zzso
