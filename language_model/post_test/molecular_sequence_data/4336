During B zzso cells undergo successive rounds of division and growth arrest coupled to intermittent selection on the basis of zzso zzso It is unresolved whether differentiation requires specific signaling or is merely the consequence of sustained cell zzso zzso expression of the cell death zzso zzso promoted zzso of B zzso cells in mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and in mice lacking the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso differentiation occurred, however, only in the zzso and zzso zzso The appearance of B lineage cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso was associated with zzso zzso which zzso a truncated C zzso protein called D zzso in zzso mice and with expression of zzso heavy chain classes other than zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In neither case, however, were zzso cells observed in the more mature B lineage compartments in the bone zzso Thus, continued B cell development requires signaling via zzso heavy zzso receptors and is not simply a consequence of blocking zzso
