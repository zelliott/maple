zzso of soil and water with zzso bacteria may create reservoirs of zzso resistance genes that have the potential to zzso impact future public health through horizontal gene zzso The zzso zzso resistance genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso amplification of zzso DNA from surface sediments of the Tijuana River zzso a zzso coastal zzso along the zzso border; sediments of zzso zzso a nearby urban zzso that is largely unaffected by zzso contained only zzso zzso and zzso The number of zzso sites and replicates increased in both wetlands after zzso zzso quantitative zzso revealed a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso abundance zzso per gram zzso or per zzso zzso zzso in Tijuana River zzso sediments immediately following zzso but no significant change was measured at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of cloned zzso zzso were all affiliated with zzso genes found on plasmids of clinical zzso with one exception that was most similar to the zzso zzso gene found in zzso zzso Our results suggest that urban wetlands may become reservoirs of zzso resistance zzso particularly where wastewater is improperly zzso
