The zzso preferences of the zzso zzso zzso was investigated using a global search algorithm, namely the zzso Driven zzso Carlo zzso method, and the zzso potential energy zzso This particular sequence zzso to the zzso portion of a zzso zzso zzso whose three zzso structure, when zzso to a zzso zzso was reported zzso As a result of this study a series of low-energy zzso were identified showing a common folding pattern with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso forming a beta zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso with the one determined by X-ray zzso in the zzso complex reveals marked zzso In most of the cases zzso zzso smaller than zzso A were found for the backbone atoms of the four zzso forming the zzso These results suggest that the recognition process is accomplished in this case through the interaction of the zzso with relatively stable zzso of the zzso zzso
