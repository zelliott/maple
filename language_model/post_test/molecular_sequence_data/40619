zzso binding protein zzso levels during zzso recovery of zzso zzso were significantly enhanced by zzso gamma rays or zzso C treatment but not by exposure to zzso rays, hydrogen zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso prior to zzso recovery blocked such zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed a zzso zzso zzso response motif zzso at zzso zzso to zzso and a somewhat similar sequence zzso at zzso zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso open reading zzso zzso of these zzso elements in zzso zzso gene expression was assessed by constructing zzso zzso of edited versions of the zzso promoter region with a zzso acid zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains carrying such zzso clearly revealed zzso zzso induction of the zzso promoter upon zzso and zzso C treatment but not upon zzso or zzso treatment and zzso involvement of both zzso sequences in such zzso of zzso zzso in an additive zzso
