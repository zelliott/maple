It has been previously reported that zzso cells, derived from a primary zzso of the breast, zzso express zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and that zzso zzso zzso can be found in cell zzso Here we have zzso measured zzso zzso in zzso cell medium using zzso raised against zzso and zzso fragments, and also demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso we have examined the role, if any, zzso by diverse zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso and invasive zzso in zzso related to production of zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso zzso and, to a minor extent, zzso and zzso are zzso but zzso for zzso cells, and suggest that diverse zzso activities may contribute to cell invasion in response to different zzso zzso In light of the present data on a zzso role for zzso in zzso we zzso that this protein might intervene in local control of the invasive process in breast zzso
