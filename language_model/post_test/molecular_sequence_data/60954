zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso have been observed in the brain of zzso Disease zzso patients and may be related to zzso loss in this zzso This reduction may be caused by a dysfunction of zzso zzso II zzso zzso the major zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso in the zzso zzso understanding the role of zzso II in zzso we isolated and characterized the zzso sequence and determined the zzso organization of mouse zzso II zzso The full length zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso 425 zzso zzso and shares zzso zzso acid similarity with the rat zzso zzso The gene for zzso is composed of 13 zzso divided by 12 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso is mainly expressed in kidney and zzso zzso showed zzso expression in the brain starting from at least zzso of embryonic zzso An alternative zzso zzso derived from the usage of novel zzso shows a different expression pattern from zzso Western zzso analysis of various mouse zzso shows a zzso protein in brain, heart, zzso and zzso In the kidney and liver an additional zzso zzso was zzso Use of the zzso zzso mapping panel from The Jackson Laboratory indicates that the zzso gene zzso with zzso markers zzso and zzso on mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso organization, the zzso zzso expression patterns, the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso generated here, will provide the tools for further studies and allow generation and characterization of mice that are zzso for zzso
