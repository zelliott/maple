Heat shock proteins zzso are a family of highly zzso proteins present in all zzso They mediate a range of zzso functions as molecular zzso and are recently reported to regulate the immune zzso Using suppression zzso zzso we isolated and characterized a cucumber zzso designated zzso which encodes a putative heat shock protein of zzso zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso zzso belonging to the Type I zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed that zzso was significantly induced in cucumber leaves zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in this incompatible zzso Gene expression was also strongly zzso by various zzso zzso zzso was mainly expressed in flowers with a zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso This suggests that zzso harbors zzso responses to both zzso and zzso stresses and may play a role in zzso zzso resistance in zzso
