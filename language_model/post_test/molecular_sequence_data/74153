The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the latest identified member of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with potential functional implications in inflammatory diseases and zzso The zzso is primarily expressed in zzso and mast cells and has the highest zzso with the zzso The occurrence of at least zzso different zzso zzso zzso zzso led us to investigate the possible existence of zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we report on the cloning of the first two alternatively spliced zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and mast zzso These zzso zzso zzso are localized predominantly zzso when expressed zzso in zzso zzso We failed to detect any zzso zzso zzso induced zzso or zzso activity for these zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso with full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso of 390 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso have a dominant negative effect on the surface expression of zzso We detected zzso zzso zzso zzso by employing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were detected in various cell types and expressed at similar levels to the full-length zzso zzso in, for example, zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso described here have a dominant negative effect on zzso zzso as they are able to retain zzso zzso and zzso a population of zzso presumably via zzso
