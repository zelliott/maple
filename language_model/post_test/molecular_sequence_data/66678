The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are recognized as influential and important zzso of pathogen cell zzso zzso the major zzso zzso protein of the type IV zzso zzso colonization factor of zzso zzso zzso unique, zzso modifications with these zzso These zzso modifications have been shown to be zzso alternately to a specific, zzso zzso zzso of zzso However, the zzso and precursors involved in their addition are unknown, and the full spectrum of zzso zzso modifications has yet to be zzso Here, an intact zzso mass zzso approach was integrated with zzso and reverse zzso to address these zzso zzso we show that a protein limited in its distribution to zzso zzso species and structurally related to zzso implicated in zzso modification of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso modification with zzso and zzso These findings strongly suggest that protein zzso modification is mechanistically similar to processes underlying analogous modifications of zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso modifications and that the zzso of site occupancy can be influenced by zzso primary structure and the abundance of the zzso protein zzso Together, these findings have important implications for the structure and zzso of zzso
