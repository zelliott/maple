zzso of heat shock proteins in zzso coli is primarily caused by increased cellular levels of the heat shock zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Increased zzso levels result from both enhanced synthesis and zzso Previous work indicated that zzso synthesis is induced at the zzso level and is zzso by the zzso secondary structure formed within the zzso sequence of zzso including the translation initiation zzso To understand the mechanism of heat induction of zzso synthesis further, we analyzed expression of zzso gene zzso with altered stability of zzso structure before and after heat zzso A clear correlation was found between the stability and expression or the extent of heat zzso zzso profiles of zzso with or without zzso correlated well with the expression patterns of fusion genes carrying the corresponding zzso in zzso Furthermore, temperature dependence of zzso zzso complex formation with zzso or zzso zzso in zzso agreed well with that of the expression of gene zzso in zzso Our results support a novel mechanism in which partial melting of zzso secondary structure at high temperature enhances zzso entry and zzso initiation without involvement of other cellular zzso that is, intrinsic zzso stability controls synthesis of a zzso zzso
