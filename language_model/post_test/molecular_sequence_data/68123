Our previous work zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown that a highly repetitive component in rat nuclear DNA forms a zzso bend to have the binding affinity for the nuclear scaffold zzso zzso In the present experiment, the mobility shift zzso zzso suggested that the formation of the repetitive zzso complex is based on some cooperative mode of zzso The zzso I footprint analysis revealed that the major binding region of this protein in the DNA is located near the center of the zzso zzso repeat which has a strongly bent overall zzso These results imply that a nuclear scaffold protein such as zzso binds to zzso zzso in a highly repetitive DNA to play an important role in construction of a zzso zzso zzso
