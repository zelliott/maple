The zzso zzso zzso zzso family consists of Type I and Type II zzso that typically catalyze the addition of zzso acid zzso to the zzso of specific proteins using zzso A as a zzso However, the zzso of certain proteins in zzso and bovine zzso are modified with fatty acids other than zzso acid, and this zzso of alternative zzso has not been found in any other zzso This alternative use of zzso groups is known as zzso zzso zzso and occurs by an unknown zzso zzso the focus of this work has been to identify zzso zzso that may be unique or zzso expressed in bovine zzso that may zzso zzso in addition to zzso 

We used zzso library zzso zzso and zzso to identify zzso in bovine zzso and liver, then compared these proteins to previously described zzso by zzso acid zzso We used northern zzso to determine the level of Type I and Type II zzso in a human zzso zzso in bovine zzso and in bovine zzso Southern zzso was done to determine if one or more zzso copies of Type II zzso are present in the bovine zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso is provided to describe the lineage of zzso from a variety of zzso 

We identified a Type I zzso in zzso that is nearly identical to previously described Type I zzso as well as a novel Type II zzso We further characterized the zzso specificity of the novel zzso by evaluating which Type II zzso are present in bovine zzso We find that cow liver contains a Type II zzso identical to the previously described zzso found in human liver, as well as a partial clone that is identical to the novel Type II zzso from zzso zzso Type I and II message expression appears to vary in a panel of zzso and we suggest that zzso expresses at least three zzso zzso with the Type I short form and Type II being more abundant than the Type I long form zzso We also present evidence that there are two copies of Type II zzso in the bovine zzso 

Our efforts to find a zzso zzso resulted in the identification of a previously unknown Type II zzso but this zzso also appears to be expressed in zzso zzso we are unable to conclude that zzso zzso occurs by means of an exclusive zzso capable of efficiently utilizing multiple zzso zzso solely in zzso Nonetheless, our results lead to an improved understanding of protein zzso zzso and encourage us to further identify factors that influence zzso expression of each zzso and regulate their zzso activity in terms of zzso selectivity and zzso protein zzso
