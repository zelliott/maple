A zzso library was constructed in a zzso zzso zzso using zzso isolated from zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso was obtained using a combination of library screening and zzso zzso chain zzso zzso of the clone revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with a signal zzso of 15 zzso The calculated molecular mass of the zzso was zzso zzso in accordance with those of the zzso zzso pancreatic zzso forms zzso and zzso as determined by mass zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso sequence with published zzso sequences of zzso identified a number of zzso The sequence of the zzso reported here provides a sequence reference for zzso in excellent agreement with the refined three-dimensional structures of both zzso and zzso No evidence for a second zzso was found in the zzso library and it is most likely that zzso and zzso are two forms of the same zzso The primary structure of zzso shows high zzso with human, mouse and rat pancreatic zzso The zzso region, corresponding to a mobile loop involved in zzso binding and processing near the active site, is fully zzso
