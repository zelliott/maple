The concerted activity of four influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso and replication of the viral zzso in the nucleus of the zzso The three P proteins form a zzso complex in zzso and the zzso of infected zzso zzso analyses have shown specific interactions between zzso and PA as well as zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is the backbone of the zzso To identify zzso of zzso involved in binding zzso a zzso system adapted for zzso cells zzso was zzso First, we demonstrate the ability of zzso and PA to interact efficiently and specifically in zzso combinations of zzso reporter zzso suggesting that zzso factor module fusion did not interfere zzso or zzso with interaction between zzso and zzso zzso analyses with a set of zzso proteins with zzso of the zzso C zzso N zzso or internal sequences led to the identification of a region at the N zzso of zzso responsible for binding zzso Forty-eight zzso acids at the N zzso of zzso were sufficient for binding PA in zzso with the same efficiency as the complete zzso zzso This region of zzso responsible for binding PA does not overlap with other previously described zzso functional zzso involved in nuclear transport and zzso zzso We propose to name this region of interaction with PA domain zzso to differentiate it from other functional zzso described for zzso
