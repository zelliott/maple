The zzso system of zzso zzso which mediates zzso stabilization by the killing of zzso cells, codes for two zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso translation of the stable zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso folds into a single zzso domain with an 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso The initial recognition reaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso takes place between the zzso domain and the complementary region in zzso zzso In this communication we examine the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso E zzso the zzso zzso from its zzso end and that this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso E zzso occurs in the part of zzso zzso that is responsible for the initial recognition of the target loop in zzso zzso and thus leads to functional zzso of the zzso The major zzso E zzso product zzso zzso is rapidly zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso E zzso tags zzso for further rapid degradation by zzso from its 3' zzso We also show that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso I zzso zzso and that the zzso is prerequisite for the rapid zzso degradation by zzso
