zzso zzso type zzso is caused by zzso that render the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso is inactive in cells grown at 37 degrees C but displays full activity in cells grown at 31 degrees zzso To distinguish whether the zzso zzso of the common zzso zzso of human zzso is due to altered zzso activity or to zzso and a zzso in zzso trafficking, we analyzed its zzso and processing in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C but exits the zzso and accumulates in zzso structures in cells grown at 31 degrees zzso The inability of the zzso zzso to exit the zzso is confirmed by the failure to acquire zzso H resistance at 37 degrees C and cannot be accounted for solely by enhanced zzso zzso zzso retention at 37 degrees C is zzso by the zzso domain of zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso to the zzso and is zzso Finally, a zzso zzso form of zzso is partially zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The data show that human zzso expressed in zzso cells folds and exits the zzso zzso and that zzso zzso exaggerates this zzso resulting in a failure to exit the zzso at zzso zzso
