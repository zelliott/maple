zzso (three zzso acid loop zzso zzso proteins include the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso proteins form zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso is crucial to DNA binding and for nuclear zzso zzso zzso bind DNA also in combination with zzso zzso thereby modulating their zzso zzso zzso proteins therefore play crucial roles in multiple zzso and differentiation pathways in zzso We report the identification and characterization of a novel human gene zzso to zzso called zzso zzso comparisons indicate that zzso and zzso define a novel zzso of zzso zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of human adult zzso and displays a more restricted expression pattern than zzso zzso is capable of zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso appears to be essential for nuclear zzso of both zzso and zzso A comparison between the functional properties of zzso and zzso reveals that zzso display a faster zzso rate than zzso zzso suggesting different roles in controlling gene zzso Like zzso zzso zzso are capable of forming zzso complexes with zzso The analysis of some zzso in zzso properties suggests a functional diversification among zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
