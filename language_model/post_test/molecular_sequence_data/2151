We have zzso a zzso 20 zzso zzso from zzso zzso to apparent zzso The final zzso preparation was zzso zzso with a recovery of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that the native zzso zzso zzso was a zzso composed of zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso point was approximately pH zzso The zzso zzso was highly specific for zzso zzso possessing 17 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had high specific activity for the reduction of zzso zzso 280 zzso per zzso of zzso zzso 22 zzso but was less zzso with cortisol zzso 120 zzso per zzso of zzso zzso 32 zzso at pH zzso The apparent zzso for zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso was observed with zzso of zzso greater than zzso zzso The zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of 20 zzso zzso 200 zzso per zzso of zzso zzso 41 zzso at pH zzso The apparent zzso for zzso was 526 zzso The initial reaction zzso with zzso were less than 50% of those with zzso The zzso sequence was determined to be zzso These results indicate that this zzso is a novel form of 20 zzso zzso
