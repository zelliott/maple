The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso pauses and is zzso at a unique 8 zzso zzso sequence found at the junction of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA generated during zzso DNA zzso The paused zzso may recruit the zzso DNA processing machinery, which zzso the zzso DNA within this 8 zzso zzso junction zzso zzso of the zzso at the zzso involves structural changes in both the zzso and zzso zzso However, these structural changes have not been fully zzso nor is it understood how the zzso sequence itself causes the zzso to change its structure, to pause, and to become less zzso Here we use solution and zzso chemical zzso to probe the zzso transcript and changes in the zzso structure as the zzso pauses and zzso at the zzso Together with extensive zzso scanning of regions of the zzso that are likely to be involved in recognition of the zzso we are able to develop a description of the events that occur as the zzso transcribes through the zzso and subsequently zzso In this process, a local change in the structure of the zzso bubble drives a large change in the architecture of the zzso This altered zzso structure may then serve as the signal that recruits the processing machinery to the zzso
