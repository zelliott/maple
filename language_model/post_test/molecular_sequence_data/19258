zzso zzso zzso of many zzso zzso zzso and zzso involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso short interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains several families of zzso zzso zzso that form in zzso phased zzso through the zzso zzso and that zzso regulate target zzso Using deep sequencing technology and zzso approaches, the phasing patterns of known zzso and zzso zzso from across the zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso plants and zzso zzso Several gene transcripts were found to be routed through the zzso zzso after initial targeting by one or multiple zzso or zzso the most conspicuous example of which was an expanding zzso of genes zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis using zzso zzso revealed evidence for small zzso regulatory mechanisms within a similarly expanded group of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso mechanisms operate on an evolutionary scale to buffer the effects of rapidly expanding gene zzso
