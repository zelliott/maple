zzso zzso represent a class of small zzso zzso molecules that play a crucial role in zzso gene zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso have been characterized to date, predominantly from the plant species whose zzso is well zzso However, information on the zzso of these regulatory zzso in economically important but genetically less characterized crop species are zzso zzso zzso is an important grain zzso which is grown primarily for its protein-rich edible zzso zzso from this species have not been identified to date due to lack of zzso sequence zzso To identify zzso from zzso zzso a small zzso library was constructed from young zzso zzso zzso sequencing technology and zzso analysis of the small zzso reads led to the identification of 66 zzso zzso represented by 45 zzso zzso belonging to 19 families and eight zzso zzso belonging to seven zzso Besides, 13 novel zzso candidates in zzso zzso were also zzso zzso patterns of selected zzso zzso and novel zzso candidates have been demonstrated in zzso zzso and root zzso by quantitative zzso chain reaction, and potential target genes were predicted for most of the zzso zzso This information offers zzso resources for better understanding of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
