We report that expression of a nearly full-length zzso clone of the zzso zzso zzso virus causes virus loss in a zzso strain of zzso zzso We show that in this system exclusion of the zzso virus is independent of the presence of the packaging site or of zzso sites for replication and zzso and completely dependent on expression of functional zzso gag and zzso fusion zzso Thus, this exclusion is not explained in terms of zzso of packaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso known to repress the copy number of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso nearly eliminates the zzso We suggest that exclusion is due to competition by proteins expressed from the zzso for a possibly limiting cellular zzso Our hypotheses on exclusion of zzso proteins may also apply to resistance to plant viruses produced by expression of viral zzso in transgenic zzso
