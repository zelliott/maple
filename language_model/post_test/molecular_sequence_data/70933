Several approaches have been used to study the interactions of the zzso of protein zzso zzso The inactive zzso of zzso that has zzso 156 zzso to Ala zzso is able to bind the zzso zzso and to compete effectively in this binding with zzso zzso alpha and zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was also demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the beta zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso activity of the extracts obtained from cells zzso zzso with these different zzso yielded some surprising zzso The zzso specific zzso activity of these cells zzso with the inactive zzso was considerably higher than the control cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expressed in these cells, however, demonstrated that the zzso was indeed zzso It can be concluded that zzso of the inactive zzso affects the zzso activity of zzso zzso experiments with zzso and beta zzso and zzso were also used to confirm the interaction of zzso with the general zzso inhibitor zzso zzso into these zzso Finally a search in the zzso zzso for proteins with properties similar to those derived from the zzso acid composition of zzso indicated that zzso is related to protein zzso 2A and to other zzso as well as to a zzso of some zzso zzso
