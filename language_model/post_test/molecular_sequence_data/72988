In animal systems the zzso zinc finger protein zzso gene family is the largest group of regulatory proteins and its members have a wide and important role in growth and zzso It is likely that this family of zzso zzso factors will also be important in zzso We have used a zzso approach employing highly zzso zzso zzso to isolate several zzso zzso and zzso clones zzso potential zzso In addition we have used the sequence information from these clones to identify two zzso as members of this zzso Five zzso and one zzso zzso have been zzso Outside of the zinc finger regions, there is considerable sequence diversity, including the sequence and length of the zzso zzso the expression pattern of each gene is zzso This is the first report of the isolation of a zzso plant zzso zzso gene and we discuss its possible evolutionary origin from zzso zzso zzso
