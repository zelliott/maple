zzso is a major protein responsible for regulating the nucleation of zzso zzso and as such, it permits the cell to control where and when to assemble zzso zzso It is zzso by a zzso family zzso 21 members in zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be separated into two zzso zzso there are 11 class I zzso and 10 class II zzso zzso questions remain unanswered regarding the molecular mechanism of zzso nucleation and zzso zzso by each zzso zzso and how the different zzso coordinate to regulate zzso dynamics in zzso Here, we characterize a class II zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso retains all general properties of the zzso family, including nucleation and barbed end capping zzso It can also generate zzso filaments from a pool of zzso zzso bound to zzso However, both the nucleation and barbed end capping activities of zzso are less efficient compared to those of another zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso competes with zzso zzso in binding zzso filament barbed ends, and zzso the effect of zzso zzso on zzso We thus propose a mechanism in which two zzso different zzso coordinate to regulate zzso dynamics by competing for zzso filament barbed zzso
