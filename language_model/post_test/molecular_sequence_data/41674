A zzso zzso was zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso zzso which has previously been shown to assist in delivering large zzso across the cellular zzso We demonstrate that the attachment of the zzso zzso sequence to the zzso of a zzso allows the zzso to penetrate into the cellular zzso whereas the zzso zzso is excluded from zzso The zzso zzso is rapidly taken into the cells mainly through a zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the presented zzso scaffold may be a promising material for efficient drug zzso
