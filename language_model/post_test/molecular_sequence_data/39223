zzso zzso is one of the few naturally occurring zzso and is characterized by a zzso bond between the zzso and zzso zzso Previously, we zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which is an zzso producer, and this zzso was expected to zzso zzso to the zzso produced by the zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso was cloned based on the zzso zzso acid sequence determined in this study, and a sequencing analysis revealed eight open reading frames zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso region surrounding the zzso gene zzso in zzso To investigate the biological function of zzso we constructed a knockout zzso in which the zzso gene is zzso Studies on zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso productivity demonstrated that the zzso gene does play a partial role in zzso and that zzso zzso was found to produce other zzso zzso in addition to zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a zzso gene for a zzso possessing zzso zzso
