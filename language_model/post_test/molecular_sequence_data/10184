zzso prion protein zzso which is a zzso zzso of a zzso protein designated zzso serves as a specific marker protein for the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The generation of suitable zzso to zzso therefore zzso the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic zzso However, most zzso reported to date are directed to a limited number of zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso cell membrane protein in all zzso species studied to zzso In an attempt to generate zzso to further regions of zzso we raised zzso in rabbits and chicken against zzso synthetic peptides which represent the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso By this approach zzso was overcome and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso at almost any site of zzso zzso and zzso A large number of different zzso zzso also with zzso zzso from other zzso species including zzso zzso zzso man, dog, cat, zzso zzso zzso and guinea zzso No zzso however, was recognized exclusively on the pathological or cellular zzso of zzso indicating that both zzso occur in highly zzso zzso on the zzso zzso to the zzso are suitable for zzso of zzso The availability of rabbit and chicken zzso zzso to zzso will greatly improve zzso diagnosis and zzso studies on these zzso
