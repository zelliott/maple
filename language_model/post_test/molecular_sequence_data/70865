The human zzso virus type I zzso zzso protein is initially zzso as the central domain of the zzso zzso and is subsequently zzso processed into a discrete zzso protein that forms the distinctive zzso core of the mature zzso The crystal structures of two proteins that span the zzso domain of the zzso are reported here: one encompassing zzso zzso zzso and the other extending to include the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso structures were determined by molecular replacement and have been refined at zzso A resolution to R factors of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ordered zzso comprise zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and their refined structures are essentially zzso The proteins are composed of a 310 zzso followed by an extended strand and four zzso A zzso twofold generates a zzso that is stabilized by parallel packing of an zzso 2 across the zzso interface and by packing of the 310 zzso into a groove created by zzso 2 and 3 of the partner zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the full affinity of the intact zzso zzso and their structures therefore reveal the essential zzso interface of the zzso zzso
