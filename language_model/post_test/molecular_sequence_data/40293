zzso zzso uniquely zzso a broad range of zzso zzso by binding the zzso zzso on the zzso surface zzso zzso zzso that resemble these natural zzso of zzso would be highly desirable components for an zzso zzso However, zzso zzso motifs have been unsuccessful so far at zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso Based on the surprising observation that zzso binds zzso zzso zzso with higher affinity than zzso we show here that a designed set of zzso synthetic zzso are potent zzso When introduced to the zzso of the D1 arm of protein zzso recognized by zzso their zzso is significantly zzso zzso variation of these zzso zzso zzso key zzso and the molecular basis of this increased zzso was zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso particle protein zzso containing such zzso zzso are bound more tightly by zzso As zzso they elicit higher zzso of zzso than those zzso zzso containing the self D1 zzso zzso These zzso generated from zzso zzso also zzso with this self zzso which is found in the zzso zzso when it is presented in a range of different zzso and zzso However, these zzso did not bind this zzso motif when present on zzso
