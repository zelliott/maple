A zzso protein was zzso from zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso as a complex with zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso these zzso were zzso converted by zzso to a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and then a zzso mature zzso This zzso process was consistent with that in the absence of the zzso zzso but differed in producing the zzso form as the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso protein may be a regulatory protein for zzso zzso The zzso intermediate was a zzso zzso with the zzso sequences corresponding to those of the light and heavy chains of mature zzso whereas the zzso sequence of its heavy chain was identical with that of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso intermediate is produced from zzso zzso during zzso zzso by the zzso of the zzso bond between zzso and zzso which results in the formation of the light and heavy zzso
