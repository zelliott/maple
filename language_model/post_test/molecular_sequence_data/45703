zzso bent DNA sites were identified in the zzso zzso segment encompassing the replication zone which directs DNA amplification and zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso fragments showed reduced zzso mobility in zzso zzso The zzso modeling of the zzso DNA path and the zzso ratio values obtained from the zzso wedge model of zzso revealed the presence of four major bent sites, positioned at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that these zzso are composed of 2-6 zzso zzso tracts in phase with the DNA zzso zzso The circular zzso analysis permitted the zzso that the fragments containing the zzso sites promote zzso in other sequence zzso Computer analyses of the zzso zzso sequence revealed low zzso stability zzso zzso negative roll angles indicating a narrow minor groove and a putative zzso attachment zzso The data presented in this paper add to information about the structural features involved in this amplified zzso
