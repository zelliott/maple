This study investigated the genetic organization of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their distribution in zzso clinical zzso By comparatively analyzing reference zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso we demonstrated a substantial correspondence between zzso and zzso which have the same resistance gene combination zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share the zzso element, containing a second zzso and only differ by a zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso detected in zzso from zzso zzso reference strain zzso These results enabled zzso of the structure of zzso the first zzso zzso described in zzso zzso A collection of 83 zzso and zzso clinical zzso representative of recent Italian zzso carrying zzso as the sole zzso resistance zzso was used to investigate the distribution of the different zzso All 83 organisms were positive for zzso and bore an zzso zzso that could be characterized by using a specific set of primer zzso zzso was detected in 18 zzso zzso in 59 zzso and zzso in 6 (the sole zzso zzso The genetic organization of zzso zzso with its specific zzso was not detected in any of the zzso zzso The zzso elements of zzso zzso substantially corresponded to those zzso a silent zzso zzso recently detected in zzso zzso Overall, in zzso zzso zzso was the least common zzso zzso element and zzso the most zzso
