The zzso zzso zzso gene belongs to the zzso class that includes a large number of zzso zzso genes and is shown to be expressed in specific muscle founder cells and a subset of zzso cells in the zzso nerve zzso during zzso To determine the zzso regulatory elements controlling the zzso expression of zzso we measured zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene activities from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells using various zzso zzso containing different zzso upstream regions of zzso From the initial analysis of zzso zzso of the zzso upstream region, we have found that the regions from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso contained strong negative and positive regulatory zzso zzso Within the positive zzso region an zzso DNA zzso (from zzso to zzso was sufficient to activate the reporter gene in zzso cells, whereas additional regions (from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso were required for optimal activity in zzso zzso zzso shift and zzso zzso zzso have defined a plausible binding site for zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a novel binding site for unknown factors, zzso zzso to zzso Further zzso analysis has revealed that the novel binding sequence for unknown factors is necessary and sufficient for zzso activity for reporter gene expression in zzso zzso cells in an zzso zzso
