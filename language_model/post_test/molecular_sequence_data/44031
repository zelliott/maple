The possible role of the zzso group of zzso 108 in the zzso mechanism of human zzso zzso zzso has been investigated by means of zzso zzso zzso kinetic analysis, and zzso zzso Three representative zzso have been used, zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso In the presence of zzso acid, the zzso follows a rapid equilibrium random zzso mechanism with a zzso step which occurs after the addition of the zzso and before the release of zzso The replacement of zzso 108 with zzso yields a zzso decrease of zzso while it does not change appreciably the affinity of the H site for the zzso In this case, it would appear that the role of the zzso function is to stabilize the transition state for the chemical step, zzso the Michael addition of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso data are compatible with this conclusion showing the zzso group of zzso in hydrogen bonding distance of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Parker, zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso Moreover, no structural differences are observed between the zzso zzso and the wild type, suggesting that the removal of the zzso group is solely responsible for the loss of zzso A different involvement of zzso 108 appears in the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in which the zzso step is of a physical nature, probably a structural transition of the zzso zzso The substitution of zzso 108 yields an approximately zzso increase of zzso and a constant zzso zzso Lack of a critical hydrogen bond between zzso and zzso 108 appears to be the basis of the increased zzso In the zzso system, no appreciable changes of zzso parameters are found in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso has a zzso role in zzso zzso zzso zzso depending on the nature of the zzso zzso
