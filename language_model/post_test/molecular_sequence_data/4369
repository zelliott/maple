The zzso zzso sequence of the 3' terminal region of onion yellow dwarf virus zzso isolated from zzso zzso bearing the genes for viral coat protein zzso and a truncated zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence in the corresponding region and the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with the zzso of zzso yellow stripe virus zzso from garlic were zzso and zzso Variation in the zzso sequence is concentrated in the boundary region between the putative zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso gene as well as in the 3' zzso zzso These sequence zzso including the deletion of 79 zzso resulted both in zzso to the zzso acid sequence and the absence of 28 zzso acid zzso in the zzso terminal region of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso In addition, the length of the 3' zzso sequence of zzso was one-third that of zzso zzso of the 3' terminal zzso zzso sequence of zzso with sequences of the respective zzso cloned by zzso directly from the total zzso of infected zzso plants that included two varieties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso overall zzso even though they have long been cultivated in locally restricted area in zzso These findings appear to suggest that a single strain of zzso invaded Japanese zzso plants long ago and spread throughout zzso
