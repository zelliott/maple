We describe the successful zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso Special attention was paid to the influence of different zzso usage and zzso content in the coding region on zzso protein zzso Use of zzso zzso zzso usage and lower zzso content in a synthetic gene zzso resulted in a significant improvement in the level of the zzso zzso and a dramatic increase in the quantity of zzso protein produced such that it accounted for approximately zzso of the total soluble zzso We suggest that redesigning the primary DNA sequence zzso a desired protein product can be an extremely effective method for improving zzso protein production in zzso zzso
