zzso zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for the rhythmic production of the zzso hormone zzso It plays a crucial role in the synchronization of biological functions with changes in the zzso Annual and daily fluctuations in light are known to be key environmental factors involved in such zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso activity is also markedly influenced by temperature but the mechanisms through which it impacts the zzso activity need to be further zzso We investigated zzso primary to zzso structures zzso zzso and zzso in relation to temperature for a variety of zzso species from tropical to Arctic zzso The results extend our knowledge on the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso and bring strong support to the idea that zzso diversification was limited by stabilizing selection zzso to the zzso well zzso secondary and zzso zzso Only a few changes in zzso acids appeared sufficient to induce different zzso activity zzso It is concluded that zzso evolution is mainly driven by zzso relationships although zzso properties zzso turnover and zzso zzso are also under the influence of the respective species normal habitat zzso
