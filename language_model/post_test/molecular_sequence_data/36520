The presence of two types of zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso was demonstrated in bovine zzso zzso These zzso zzso were separated from the zzso of bovine zzso zzso by successive zzso zzso The major zzso inhibitor was further zzso to zzso by affinity zzso using zzso pancreatic zzso immobilized on zzso zzso and gel zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of this inhibitor was first determined, and it was shown to be a zzso of 58 zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The Ki value against bovine zzso zzso was 6 zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor was found to be identical with basic pancreatic zzso zzso
