The flexible zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was reported to contain the zzso binding zzso To zzso the zzso binding zzso of the zzso as well as to examine a synthetic approach to potential zzso 26 zzso zzso bridged zzso zzso were zzso Solid phase zzso synthesis was performed on different zzso supports by individual zzso zzso with zzso strategy, and simultaneous multiple zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso Both strategies gave zzso peptides in comparable zzso zzso using the zzso strategy employed the zzso zzso group zzso for zzso protection of zzso in contrast, the zzso protecting groups, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were chosen for zzso employing zzso zzso Ring closure reactions by zzso zzso were carried out starting from protected zzso zzso or unprotected zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso acid analysis, and zzso zzso investigations using CD zzso and theoretical structural investigations by means of molecular dynamics calculations revealed that slight variations in sequence result in pronounced zzso zzso The potential of zzso zzso zzso to activate or to zzso guinea pig zzso a standard test system for biological activities of zzso peptides like zzso revealed relatively low activities for zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequences like zzso led to amplified biological zzso Three of the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso point in the direction of zzso zzso
