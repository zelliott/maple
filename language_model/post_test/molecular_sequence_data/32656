A common task posed by zzso experiments is to zzso the binding site preferences for a known zzso factor from a collection of genes that it regulates and to ascertain whether the factor acts alone or in a zzso The converse problem can also be zzso Given a collection of binding sites, can the regulatory factor or complex of factors be zzso Both tasks are substantially facilitated by using relatively simple zzso models for zzso zzso as well as the rapidly expanding protein structure zzso For budding zzso we are able to construct reliable structural models for 67 zzso factors and with them zzso factor binding sites by using a zzso Gibbs sampling zzso and an extensive protein zzso data zzso For 49 factors in common with a prior analysis of this data set (based largely on zzso zzso we find that half of the previously predicted binding motifs are in need of some zzso We also solve the inverse problem of zzso the factors from the binding sites by assigning a correct protein fold to 25 of the 49 cases from a previous zzso Our approach is easily extended to other organisms, including higher zzso Our study highlights the utility of enlarging current structural zzso projects that zzso sample fold structure space to include all factors with significantly different zzso zzso
