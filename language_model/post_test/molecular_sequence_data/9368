The zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso gene zzso and functions as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso is restricted to cells of the zzso zzso We present zzso that the zzso gene promoter exhibits a zzso activity, as its activity is significantly higher in zzso zzso cell zzso The activity of the zzso gene promoter is dependent on the occupancy of zzso zzso sequences both in zzso and in zzso and whose integrity is required for zzso responsiveness and for the cooperative actions of zzso with zzso factors of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso levels diminish upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso cell zzso changes that correlate with an increase in zzso zzso disruption of zzso sites led to enhanced promoter activity, and small interfering zzso reduction of zzso expression resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso gene promoter is zzso regulated by zzso zzso factors, which contribute to the zzso and the regulated expression of zzso during zzso differentiation and zzso zzso
