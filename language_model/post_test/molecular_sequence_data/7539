A 14 zzso zzso clone covering the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso region extending from zzso zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso zzso over the zzso signal at the 3' end has been zzso The gene consists of nine zzso including one with an exceptional size of zzso zzso representing zzso of the protein coding zzso zzso are relatively small zzso 100 zzso except for the 3' zzso which has a size of zzso zzso an exceptionally large size among zzso zzso Five of the zzso are in the same positions in zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso There is only one zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso as was shown by zzso analysis zzso zzso and zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso revealed a potential zzso initiation site 876 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso with a zzso 23 zzso upstream of this zzso Analysis of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso gene suggests the presence of potential recognition sequences of various zzso zzso factors and shows a region with remarkable similarity to that in the rabbit zzso zzso The tissue distribution of expression of the zzso zzso gene has been studied by in zzso zzso zzso on microscopic zzso A low zzso abundance can be detected in each tissue of adult flies, suggesting a zzso function for the zzso On the other hand a pronounced tissue specificity of expression has also been found as the zzso zzso is expressed at a very high level in cell bodies of the central nervous system and in various zzso
