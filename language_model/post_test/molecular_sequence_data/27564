zzso of the zzso family, characterized by the targeted zzso of zzso to generate zzso within DNA, mediate numerous critical immune zzso One family member, zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively introduces zzso into zzso variable and switch regions, promoting zzso diversity through zzso zzso or class zzso Other family members, including zzso and zzso play an important role in zzso defense by acting on viral reverse zzso These zzso are distinguished from one another by targeting zzso within different DNA sequence zzso however, the reason for these differences is not zzso Here, we report the identification of a recognition loop of zzso zzso acids that contributes significantly to the distinct sequence motifs of individual family zzso When this recognition loop is grafted from the donor zzso or 3G proteins into the zzso scaffold of zzso the zzso signature of AID changes toward that of the donor zzso These zzso zzso of AID provide useful tools for zzso the biological impact of DNA sequence preferences upon generation of zzso diversity, and the results have implications for the evolution and specialization of the zzso zzso
