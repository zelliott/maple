Human acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso degradation of zzso to zzso and zzso An inherited zzso zzso leads to zzso disease, a severe zzso storage zzso The zzso was zzso and cloned over 10 years zzso Since then, only a few structural properties of zzso have been zzso For understanding of its complex functions including its role in certain signaling and zzso events, complete structural information about the zzso is zzso Here, the identification of the zzso bond pattern of zzso is reported for the first zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells using the zzso expression system was zzso and zzso by zzso zzso analysis of the resulting peptides revealed the four zzso bonds zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two additional zzso bonds zzso and zzso which were not directly accessible by zzso zzso were identified by a combination of a method of partial reduction and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso domain of zzso one zzso bond was assigned as zzso The existence of two additional zzso bridges in this region was proved, as was expected for the known zzso bond pattern of zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso domain as predicted by sequence comparison zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso An additional analysis of zzso isolated from human zzso shows that the zzso and the native human protein possess an identical zzso zzso
