zzso and evolution of zzso zzso are of particular interest since the zzso is structurally unique and zzso is under zzso zzso In this study, three new members of the zzso zzso gene family were identified and characterized from zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso and zzso also exhibit the unusual structure and organization previously reported for the zzso gene of a related zzso zzso zzso three repeated zzso each zzso an active zzso site, multiple gene copies, and tandem zzso The zzso zzso involved in the pH regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity, and implicated in the regulation of zzso are also fully zzso in zzso zzso The zzso conservation between the individual zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is higher than among zzso zzso indicating that this unique gene structure arose through zzso events that occurred prior to the divergence of these zzso However, zzso zzso zzso genes differ from zzso zzso in several respects, notably, the occurrence of an zzso in one gene zzso a zzso zzso region connecting zzso and zzso and, of particular interest, an zzso rate of synonymous zzso zzso along the repeat zzso in contrast to zzso zzso zzso where the occurrence of synonymous zzso is practically absent in the central region of the zzso
