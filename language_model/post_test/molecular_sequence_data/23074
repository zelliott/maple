Plant zzso zzso are known to be involved in zzso of plant secondary zzso especially zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso was cloned and characterized from rice using a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The blast results for zzso showed a zzso identity with zzso acid zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and its zzso protein was zzso using affinity zzso It was then tested for its ability to transfer the zzso group of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which have a zzso functional zzso The reaction products were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed that zzso transferred the zzso group specifically to the zzso group of zzso resulting in the formation of its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso converted zzso containing the zzso functional group such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the corresponding zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is an zzso with strict specificity for the zzso group of zzso
