Previous studies from Japan have described an association between a zzso sequence within the zzso C virus zzso zzso and resistance to zzso zzso therapy for patients infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Journal of Clinical Investigation zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso New England Journal of Medicine zzso The present study examines zzso acid sequences surrounding the putative zzso zzso zzso Region zzso of the zzso gene of zzso in 21 North American patients with zzso zzso or zzso infection receiving zzso zzso zzso The zzso consensus or intermediate pattern was observed in 13 of 14 zzso clones from North American patients infected with zzso zzso However, we found no evidence of the consensus zzso sequence in any zzso clones isolated from 15 patients with zzso zzso zzso In select cases, gel shift analysis showed no significant changes in the zzso frequency of the putative zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso or zzso infected patients who were either zzso to zzso therapy, or relapsed following withdrawal of zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso zzso domain is neither associated with, nor responsible for, zzso resistance in North American patients infected with zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate a need for further investigation into the reported association between zzso consensus sequences and zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso
