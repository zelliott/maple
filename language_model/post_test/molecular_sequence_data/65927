zzso zzso of zzso remains highly important even in countries where wild zzso circulation has been zzso zzso data on representative wild strains from all geographical regions is required for surveillance purposes and surveillance for zzso zzso with increased potential for zzso in humans should zzso 

To report the genetic characteristics of wild and zzso zzso isolated in zzso from 1991 to zzso 

Wild zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso region and compared to each zzso zzso zzso were assessed for genetic zzso by zzso and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso viruses were assessed for genetic drift in the zzso zzso 

The zzso sequences of the last wild zzso all from zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso No zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso differences in the zzso sequences of zzso viruses ranged from zzso to zzso indicating a limited replication zzso 

This study provides sequence data on wild zzso from zzso Africa and shows that in countries with continuous high vaccine coverage transmission of zzso zzso is zzso
