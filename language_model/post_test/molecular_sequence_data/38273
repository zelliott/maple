zzso from channel zzso liver and zzso zzso has high zzso activity with low zzso of zzso zzso or zzso To further investigate this zzso pathway, zzso activity toward zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso on zzso exchange and zzso affinity zzso zzso of the active zzso showed that one major band with molecular size of about zzso Da was isolated from zzso while two bands of about zzso and 31,000 Da were obtained from zzso zzso against human zzso zzso zzso strongly with the zzso bands from liver and zzso but zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence information could not be obtained from the pure zzso Following zzso an internal sequence of 20 zzso acid zzso was obtained from the zzso zzso zzso which matched a sequence found in several zzso zzso No fish zzso sequences were available for zzso The identity of the zzso zzso protein was not zzso The zzso zzso proteins had very high activities with zzso zzso or zzso with zzso values in the zzso zzso range and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed when the zzso of zzso zzso were above zzso zzso As well as zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds were the preferred zzso for the zzso zzso
