zzso was first identified in the chick zzso and like a number of cell surface proteins of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso called cell zzso molecules or zzso it is expressed on growing nerve cells in the developing nervous system of zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in other embryonic zzso suggesting a more general role in zzso processes such as tissue growth regulation, zzso recognition, and cell zzso zzso unlike the zzso is closely related to a unique tumor zzso candidate zzso deleted in zzso zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso protein consists of four zzso zzso zzso followed by six zzso type III zzso a zzso domain, and an zzso zzso We now report the cloning and sequencing of zzso clones coding for the human zzso zzso Human zzso shares zzso identity with its chicken zzso and like its chicken counterpart it is expressed in at least two different zzso derived from alternative zzso in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed two zzso species of about 5 and 7 zzso The zzso location of the human zzso gene zzso symbol zzso was determined as zzso using zzso in zzso zzso The gene therefore maps in the vicinity of a locus associated with zzso zzso The identification of human zzso and its zzso location provides a basis for studying its involvement in genetic disorders or zzso
