A novel approach for the synthesis of zzso DNA fragments from only one long zzso zzso is zzso The basic strategy is to use zzso which possess a short zzso repeat at their 3' end resulting in the formation of a hairpin zzso The 3' end of this hairpin then serves as a primer in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso zzso synthesis of the second DNA zzso zzso of the loop structure as well as generation of sticky ends for subsequent cloning is achieved by zzso with restriction zzso Several zzso ranging in size from 130 to 147 zzso were zzso and successfully used in the cloning of gene fragments of up to 120 zzso in zzso Furthermore, a strategy for the simultaneous cloning of two synthetic DNA fragments is outlined yielding even larger gene zzso By sequential cloning of these gene fragments the methodology presented here will allow the synthesis of genes of any zzso The proposed methodology should also be useful for zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso
