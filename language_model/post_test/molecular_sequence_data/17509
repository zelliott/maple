The saliva interacting protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso related to zzso zzso from zzso zzso also termed B, zzso zzso is probably involved in the adherence process of zzso zzso to the tooth zzso A zzso adherence zzso showed that 38% of the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was due to this zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso gene zzso which produces a zzso protein zzso with a relative molecular mass of zzso as estimated by zzso The strong zzso relationship and functional identity of the zzso and zzso indicate that the Mr zzso protein is probably a precursor form, zzso zzso of the zzso produced in zzso zzso The gene zzso consists of zzso zzso and codes for a zzso Mr zzso zzso features of the protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso may explain the difference observed between the zzso estimated molecular mass of the immature protein and the one deduced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using three zzso restriction fragments isolated from gene zzso as zzso showed that the sequence is highly similar in strains from zzso c and zzso We have also shown that a fraction of the heart specific zzso induced in rabbits during zzso with the zzso or zzso zzso predominantly with human zzso and suggest the hypothesis of zzso mimicry as an explanation for the production of zzso zzso It will be of great importance to identify the zzso zzso within the zzso before considering its use in protective zzso against oral zzso
