The zzso repeat zzso motif is a zzso repeat motif found in proteins that influence various aspects of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This functional association with zzso suggested that zzso repeat tracts might bind zzso However, zzso binding activity has not been reported for any zzso repeat zzso and recent literature has emphasized a protein binding zzso In this study, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso consists of 11 tandem zzso repeats and short zzso regions that are also predicted to form zzso zzso The minimal zzso binding site spans zzso zzso consistent with the possibility that zzso repeats bind zzso through a modular one zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to its native zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso local zzso structure and protects the adjacent zzso from zzso in zzso These activities can account for the zzso stabilizing, zzso processing, and zzso zzso functions attributed to zzso based on genetic zzso We suggest that analogous activities contribute to the functions of zzso zzso found in zzso complexes in the zzso zzso
