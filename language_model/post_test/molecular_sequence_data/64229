zzso zzso in zzso seed zzso involves two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity is an important factor regulating the distribution and amount of zzso zzso substitution of the zzso zzso zzso The model zzso zzso zzso is shown now to have zzso seeds with zzso cell walls that contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in developing zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and a zzso zzso a functional zzso has been obtained from zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso has been transformed with sense, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Some of the sense, zzso and zzso transgenic lines exhibited zzso with altered zzso zzso values in their zzso zzso seeds, at zzso that were consistent with zzso zzso of zzso For zzso generation individuals, zzso inheritance was correlated with zzso composition and amount in the zzso All the zzso individuals had unchanged zzso whereas those that had inherited a zzso zzso exhibited a range of zzso values, up to about 6 in some zzso For zzso values up to 4, the results were consistent with lowered Gal substitution of a constant amount of zzso zzso Further lowering of Gal substitution was accompanied by a slight decrease in the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from the developing zzso generation zzso of transgenic lines showed reduced zzso activity relative to zzso zzso The results demonstrate structural modification of a plant cell wall zzso by designed regulation of a zzso zzso
