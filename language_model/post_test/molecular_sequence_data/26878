A step toward the molecular zzso of prostate cancer was the discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso most commonly fusing the zzso zzso promoter to zzso The zzso fusion is observed in around zzso of tumors that zzso the zzso zzso The goal of the current study was to complete the characterization of these zzso prostate zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso we screened 101 prostate zzso identifying 34 cases zzso with the zzso zzso Seven cases demonstrated zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso without the presence of zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso for known zzso partners, we determined that three cases zzso the zzso zzso To discover novel zzso partners in these zzso and zzso cases, we used zzso zzso zzso We first confirmed the utility of this approach by identifying the zzso fusion in a known positive prostate cancer case and then discovered a novel fusion involving the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso downstream regulated gene 1), and zzso in two zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso the zzso fusion is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso Like zzso zzso and zzso are zzso not only by zzso but also by zzso This study demonstrates that most zzso prostate zzso harbor zzso regulated zzso zzso or zzso zzso Broader implications of this study support the use of zzso sequencing to discover novel cancer zzso
