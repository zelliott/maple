A combination of zzso zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso analyses and internal transcribed zzso zzso sequencing was used to investigate zzso species that were collected from woodlands in zzso zzso We harvested 52 specimens from 20 sites during rainy seasons between 1997 and zzso According to their zzso features, these specimens were initially zzso and we then identified six species of zzso Two of the species were clearly determined as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The four remaining species were characteristically described as zzso displaying big spores with spines up to 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso producing spores without zzso zzso zzso zzso spores with very small spines zzso zzso and zzso with yellow zzso and zzso spores zzso zzso The specimens were then zzso using zzso of the zzso regions of zzso ITS and zzso and ITS zzso The restriction fragments obtained with two zzso zzso and zzso on ITS and zzso regions, showed that some zzso of zzso zzso had the same patterns as zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had common restriction fragments as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences were observed in the two previously determined species, as well as in zzso zzso The ITS sequencing and zzso analyses showed that the zzso identified by zzso within these species might be zzso zzso Combining these molecular results allowed zzso the six zzso species in three sets of cryptic zzso a first set with two species including zzso zzso zzso a second set with four species, including both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a third set with two species, including zzso zzso These investigations and the combined zzso and molecular analyses used to sort out species paved the way for identifying larger populations of zzso species in zzso zzso and other tropical zzso
