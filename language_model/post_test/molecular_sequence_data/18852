zzso responsive element binding zzso zzso factors play an important role in the regulation of stress-related zzso These factors contribute to resistance to different zzso zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso factor, zzso isolated from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso protein was estimated to have a molecular weight of zzso a zzso of zzso and a typical zzso zzso The expression of zzso was involved in responses to drought and salt zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco showed higher relative water and zzso content, and was associated with lower zzso content under drought stress, suggesting that the transgenic tobacco may tolerate drought stress zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso may play an important role in the regulation of zzso stress responses, and mediate many zzso pathways that enhance stress tolerance in zzso
