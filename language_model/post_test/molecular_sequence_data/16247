It has now become clear that protein zzso C zzso plays a fundamental role in cellular growth control in higher zzso In addition, since zzso has also been shown to be the zzso zzso zzso for several classes of tumor zzso the study of zzso has also become a central focus of current work in cancer zzso We have isolated zzso clones zzso several forms of this zzso and we have used these clones to begin to study in detail the role of zzso in growth control and tumor zzso The complete primary structure of one of these forms, designated zzso beta 1, exhibits structural and functional characteristics which are shared among all of the currently identified forms of zzso These include an zzso terminal zzso domain which mediates zzso and zzso zzso tumor promoter zzso and membrane association, and a zzso terminal zzso domain which possesses zzso protein zzso zzso To further characterize the function of zzso we have generated a series of rat zzso cell lines which zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso the beta 1 form of this zzso These cell lines contain a zzso to zzso increase in zzso activity, and also have an increase in high affinity zzso zzso zzso relative to control zzso They also exhibit dramatically enhanced zzso changes in response to treatment with the tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso These cell lines grow to a higher zzso density in zzso culture and, when maintained at zzso develop small, dense zzso In contrast to the control cells, which display complete zzso zzso the cell lines that zzso zzso form small colonies in soft zzso in the absence of zzso and larger colonies in the presence of zzso Thus, the mere overproduction of a single form of zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso independent growth and other growth abnormalities in rat zzso Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that zzso plays a critical role in normal cellular growth control and that it mediates zzso and perhaps all of the cellular effects of the zzso zzso tumor zzso
