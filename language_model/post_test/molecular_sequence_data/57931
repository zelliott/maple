zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso at the zzso of adjacent zzso zzso in a zzso bundle protein were used to determine a precise value for the contribution of indirect zzso interactions to overall protein stability, and to simulate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso double zzso cycles were constructed to measure the interaction energy between such charges on adjacent zzso zzso in the zzso bundle zzso zzso from zzso zzso Previously, theoretical calculations of zzso zzso interactions using modeled zzso bundle proteins have predicted values ranging over an order of magnitude from zzso to zzso zzso Our system represents the first experimental evidence for zzso interactions such as those between partial charges due to zzso zzso zzso At the positions zzso we have measured a favorable interaction energy of zzso zzso between opposite charges simulating an zzso zzso zzso zzso of negative or positive charges simulating a parallel orientation of zzso produce an zzso interaction of similar zzso The interaction energies show a strong dependence upon zzso strength, consistent with an zzso zzso zzso zzso contacts do appear to zzso a limited stabilization upon the association of zzso packing of zzso favoring this orientation by as much as 1 zzso at 20 zzso K zzso
