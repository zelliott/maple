Growth rates of zzso coli zzso colonizing the large zzso of zzso mice were estimated by quantitative zzso with zzso target zzso and by zzso zzso The zzso contents in bacteria isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and feces were measured and correlated with the zzso contents of bacteria growing in zzso at defined zzso The data suggest that zzso coli zzso grows at an overall high rate in the zzso However, when taking into account the total zzso volume and numbers of bacteria present in zzso zzso zzso zzso and feces, we suggest that zzso coli zzso in the zzso consists of two zzso one in the zzso which has an apparent generation time of 40 to 80 zzso and one in the zzso contents which is zzso
