The zzso zzso zzso gene family is composed of five members zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso with zzso to form zzso zzso zzso zzso channels that zzso the zzso zzso and regulate zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of one or a mixture of these channels may be an attractive therapeutic agent for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown efficacy in zzso and clinical zzso However, more selective pharmacological profiles, including greater zzso zzso zzso could provide efficacy with fewer side zzso One such compound, zzso zzso selectively enhances the zzso of zzso channels and also exhibits efficacy in zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso The binding site of zzso zzso zzso maps to the zzso pore domain and is altered by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2005) zzso zzso et zzso (2005) zzso Here we report that the activity of the zzso selective opener zzso is not affected by these zzso zzso and does not map to the zzso zzso Rather, the selective activity of zzso is determined by a novel site within the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso may arise from greater sequence diversity of zzso family members within the zzso binding pocket, allowing for more selective small zzso zzso
