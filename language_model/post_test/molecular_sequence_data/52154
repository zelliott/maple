The zzso gene of zzso zzso 1 and the zzso genes of zzso coli K-12 and zzso zzso zzso have been studied to determine their relationship to zzso zzso core zzso and their role in the attachment of O zzso to zzso It has been zzso from the zzso sequence that the zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso Da which has a structure similar to that of zzso zzso zzso of this gene in zzso coli K-12 results in the loss of one of the three bands seen in gel analysis of the zzso and in the appearance of a new, more slowly zzso zzso This is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is a sugar zzso which zzso a subset of core molecules so that they become zzso for attachment of zzso zzso O zzso A shift in gel migration of the bands carrying zzso zzso O zzso and disappearance of the zzso band in strains producing O zzso suggest that the core may be trimmed or modified further before attachment of O zzso zzso of zzso results in a loss of the rough zzso band which appears to be modified by zzso and prevents the appearance of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso protein is involved in core modification and is more than just a component of the zzso zzso The products of zzso and zzso also appear to be involved in modification of the core prior to attachment of O zzso and the sites of zzso modification are different in zzso coli K-12 and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso and zzso result in changes in the zzso core but do not affect the attachment of O zzso We propose that these genes are involved in an alternative zzso for the synthesis of rough zzso species which are similar to zzso of other species and which are not zzso for zzso zzso All of these studies indicate that the apparent zzso of zzso coli K-12 zzso observed on gels is not an artifact but instead a reflection of functional differences among zzso zzso
