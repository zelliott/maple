We characterize one zzso factor of zzso proteins zzso that was isolated from a zzso zzso library of wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso contains one zzso zzso domain, and shows similarity with zzso zzso zzso family members in both overall zzso sequences and the secondary structure arrangement within the zzso zzso In zzso zzso system, zzso can specially activate the genes fused with the promoter containing three zzso repeated copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In different wheat zzso the zzso zzso gene is induced by low temperature, zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso that contains zzso motifs in its promoter is closely related to the expression of zzso These results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso factor in zzso We also observed the dwarf zzso in transgenic rice zzso zzso zzso
