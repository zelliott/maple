Comparative studies showed that, like zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are specifically linked to zzso zzso studies provided evidence that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display similarly high affinities towards zzso and are also almost equally efficient in catalyzing the production of zzso Nevertheless, in contrast to the zzso ME from zzso zzso which is highly activated by zzso (over zzso the zzso zzso zzso is slightly more active zzso in the presence of this zzso zzso In zzso zzso both zzso appear to be clearly more abundant in the insect stage, although they can be zzso in the zzso zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso the expression of the zzso ME seems to be clearly zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso appears to be more abundant in the insect stages of the zzso It might be hypothesized that in those environments where zzso is very low or zzso these pathogens depend on zzso zzso such as the zzso for zzso production, as in those conditions the zzso zzso zzso cannot serve as a source of essential reducing zzso
