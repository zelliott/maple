For the various types of di in humans, animal models are zzso However, their value for explaining human di is for the major part an indirect one; by studying cellular mechanisms in these animal models, fundamental aspects of the cellular processes become available, which will help to understand similar processes in human di and subsequently lead to the molecular zzso of the various types of human zzso Finally, it is to be expected that in the very near future transgenic animals will be raised in which very specific genetic information is zzso (or knocked out by zzso zzso McMahon and Bradley, zzso Recently zzso could be shown in transgenic mice, providing an animal model for the syndrome of the inappropriate VP zzso zzso and Schwartz, zzso which is often observed in patients with lung zzso that zzso express the VP gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso it will be possible to study the exact zzso of human di by performing in zzso zzso and to express the zzso zzso within a zzso translation system and in zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and subsequently study the pattern of precursor zzso packaging and zzso
