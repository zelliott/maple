A protein in zzso zzso zzso which became zzso in response to zzso zzso was identified as the zzso protein called zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso The zzso of this protein was prevented by specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso indicating that it was zzso via the classical zzso zzso Further experiments showed that zzso was zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso 2) at two zzso sequences zzso and zzso and that both sites became zzso in zzso zzso embryonic kidney zzso cells in response to zzso or zzso zzso growth zzso or zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso induced by each stimulus was prevented by two structurally distinct zzso of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso or the zzso of these zzso caused zzso to zzso from its binding partner zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso and thereby stimulates the translation of zzso containing short zzso tails zzso zzso zzso Cooke and Gray (2005) zzso zzso 24, zzso In the present study we have shown that zzso cannot bind simultaneously to zzso and zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may allow the former to stimulate translation by interacting with zzso
