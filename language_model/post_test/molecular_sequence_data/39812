A majority of small zzso zzso zzso for zzso receptors in general are characterized by the presence of one or two centrally located, positively charged nitrogen atoms and these compounds are also often of relatively similar zzso overall structure with terminal aromatic zzso In the corresponding main zzso zzso of the zzso zzso receptors is found a centrally located zzso acid zzso in position 6 of zzso segment zzso in zzso of the zzso receptors but only in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be zzso important for the binding and action of a number of zzso zzso in for example the zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that in zzso receptors in general zzso serves as a selective anchor point for the centrally located, positively charged nitrogen of the small zzso zzso and that the two peripheral chemical zzso of the zzso from this central point in the zzso structure explore each of the two halves of the main zzso binding zzso It is envisioned that knowledge of this binding mode can be exploited in zzso discovery and design of novel zzso zzso zzso and especially zzso with specifically zzso zzso
