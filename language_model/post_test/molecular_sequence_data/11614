We describe a novel zzso hormone response element zzso zzso clone zzso isolated by zzso of nuclear zzso hormone zzso zzso complexes from the rat zzso tumor cell line zzso These cells express several zzso of approximately 10 zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso clone zzso These zzso are zzso at the zzso level in the absence of zzso hormone zzso and zzso in its zzso The sequence protected from zzso I zzso by zzso in clone 144 contains two consensus zzso zzso arranged as zzso zzso The clone 144 zzso is located in the 3' untranslated region zzso of several related zzso A reporter construct zzso into zzso cells was responsive to zzso regulation when the clone 144 zzso was inserted in the 3' zzso but not when inserted upstream of the zzso As found for the zzso 144 zzso the 144 zzso reporter construct is activated by zzso in the absence of zzso but not in its zzso zzso analysis showed that clone 144 sequences zzso the zzso were necessary for zzso regulation, suggesting that the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso through a zzso in the 3' zzso is different from that through the zzso located in the promoter zzso
