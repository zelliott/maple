zzso zzso zzso is an effective tool to analyze zzso mixture derived from zzso with high zzso However, zzso has a disadvantage that a few zzso of a sample solution are injected to a narrow zzso zzso we have to prepare a sample solution of high concentration for zzso zzso In the present study, we applied head column zzso sample stacking method to the analysis of zzso zzso derived from zzso separated by two-dimensional gel zzso Model studies demonstrated that we achieved zzso times concentration effect on the analysis of zzso chains labeled with zzso acid zzso The method was applied to the analysis of zzso zzso from zzso separated and detected on PAGE zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso and zzso zzso were released by zzso zzso with zzso zzso The released zzso were zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso The results showed that zzso having lower zzso values contained a larger amount of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso having higher zzso values contained zzso zzso zzso The result clearly indicated that the spot of a zzso zzso detected by zzso brilliant blue zzso on zzso gel is sufficient for quantitative profiling of zzso
