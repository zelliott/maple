This paper describes a multiple alignment method using a zzso and zzso The method is based on the alignment of a set of aligned sequences with the new zzso and uses a zzso procedure of such zzso The alignment is executed in a reasonable zzso time on diverse levels from a zzso to a zzso from the viewpoint of alignment results and zzso speed by parallel zzso The application of the zzso is illustrated by several examples of multiple alignment of 12 zzso acid and DNA sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso graphic programs on a zzso and parallel processing on a supercomputer are zzso
