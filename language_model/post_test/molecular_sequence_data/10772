We have identified and characterized a zzso zzso which we have named zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso This zzso is essential for the zzso of various zzso and we find that in the absence of both maternal and zzso activities of this zzso zzso zzso develop with segment polarity zzso reminiscent to loss of either zzso or zzso zzso To analyze the function of zzso in zzso interaction zzso we have focused our analysis on its requirement for zzso signaling in different zzso We report that zzso zzso impair signaling by zzso suggesting that zzso contribute to the reception of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso can bypass the requirement for zzso suggesting that zzso zzso signaling by zzso possibly by limiting its diffusion and thereby zzso the binding of zzso to its zzso We discuss the possibility that zzso regulation of zzso may be involved in regulating both zzso zzso or long-range zzso
