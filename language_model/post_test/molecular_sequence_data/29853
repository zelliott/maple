We have recently identified and characterized a zzso inner nuclear zzso protein in zzso and termed it zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of zzso and zzso clones of the zzso zzso Based on sequence analysis, we deduced that the primary translation product has a calculated mass of 45 zzso contains many zzso and zzso zzso and is mostly zzso However, in the zzso zzso there is a zzso region which may serve as a membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene codes for a single zzso transcript of zzso zzso and that relatively large amounts of this transcript are present during zzso stages in which many nuclear divisions zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso translation product react with a zzso zzso nuclear envelope zzso demonstrating evolutionary zzso
