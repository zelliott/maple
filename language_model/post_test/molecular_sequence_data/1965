The zzso zzso promoter possesses a zzso zzso site with affinity to zzso and zzso complexes while the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso site has exclusive affinity to zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether the two zzso B sites play a role in the capacity of tumor necrosis factor zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso to produce zzso amounts of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso promoters were cloned into zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoters was used to mutate the zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso reporter zzso into a motif with exclusive affinity to zzso and to mutate the zzso B binding motif in the zzso zzso reporter zzso into a motif with affinity to zzso zzso activity was determined after zzso of reporter zzso zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm binding of zzso B zzso to zzso and zzso promoters in zzso 

zzso with affinity to zzso zzso were active in driving the expression of the reporter zzso whereas promoters with affinity to zzso zzso did not induce significant reporter gene zzso zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso site immediately upstream of zzso sites significantly enhanced promoter zzso 

The results suggest that the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors with zzso promoters and not zzso promoters account for the capacity of zzso to produce zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
