Heat shock protein 10 zzso is a member of the molecular zzso and works with zzso in zzso various protein folding zzso zzso is a representative protein of zzso from zzso zzso Recently, we found that zzso formed a typical zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso unfolded state at neutral zzso Here, we report that other zzso zzso such as human zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso from T4 zzso and zzso from the zzso bacteria zzso zzso also form zzso zzso from an unfolded zzso Interestingly, whereas zzso formed zzso from either the zzso unfolded state (at neutral zzso or the zzso unfolded state (at pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso from only the zzso unfolded zzso Core zzso regions of these protein zzso were determined by zzso treatment followed by a combination of zzso degradation and mass zzso analyses of the zzso zzso The core peptides of zzso zzso were identical for zzso formed from the zzso unfolded state and those formed from the zzso unfolded zzso However, a zzso with a different sequence was isolated from zzso of zzso and zzso With the use of zzso peptides of the determined core regions, it was also confirmed that the identified regions were capable of zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso formed typical zzso zzso under zzso unfolding conditions but that the zzso core structures were different, perhaps zzso to differences in local zzso acid zzso
