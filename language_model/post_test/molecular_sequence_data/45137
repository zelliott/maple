zzso zzso receptors are zzso channels composed of three zzso each having two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although alternative zzso extensively zzso the zzso sequences of zzso zzso the direct influence of such zzso modifications on zzso architecture and function remains poorly zzso In this study, we focused on mouse zzso zzso zzso In this zzso progressive zzso of the zzso C zzso generated two functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso which exhibited accelerated zzso rates and attenuated calcium signals when the receptors were in zzso zzso To measure the zzso interaction in living cells, the efficient transfer of zzso resonance energy between zzso and fluorescent proteins attached to the zzso or zzso zzso of these zzso was zzso The zzso interactions between the full-length C zzso of zzso zzso were detected by a significant increase in zzso intensity ratio compared with negative zzso Moreover, interactions between C zzso and between zzso and N zzso of adjacent zzso were significantly enhanced in zzso and zzso receptors containing zzso or zzso zzso Finally, deletion of two zzso acids at the zzso zzso but not at the zzso end of the zzso zzso resulted in the enhancement of channel zzso and zzso resonance energy zzso These results indicate that zzso structure plays a critical role in the zzso zzso interactions and suggest that the extent of zzso interactions before zzso application could contribute to the subsequent channel activity and zzso changes associated with zzso zzso
