zzso zzso zzso zzso controls a key zzso step in the regulation of cell growth and zzso This step is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso step in the synthesis of the zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso have been identified, one of which zzso zzso is significantly zzso regulated in zzso and zzso zzso As such, it has been identified as a major target in zzso and zzso drug zzso We present here the zzso structure of a zzso complex of the human type II zzso of zzso The complex contains the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the active zzso of the zzso drug zzso The zzso forms a zzso with the zzso binding at the zzso zzso The 6 zzso zzso base is zzso forming a zzso zzso at zzso with zzso The zzso zzso base is stacked against the zzso zzso ring in an orientation consistent with the zzso zzso of hydride transfer seen with zzso The zzso end of the zzso interacts with zzso not zzso between the type I and type II zzso suggesting strategies for the design of zzso zzso
