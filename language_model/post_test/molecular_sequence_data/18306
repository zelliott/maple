Human growth hormone releasing factor zzso gene has been zzso and zzso The sequence of the synthetic zzso zzso consisting of preferred zzso for expression in zzso coli, was designed with the aid of computer zzso Six segments with lengths ranging from 39 to 51 zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso The entire gene of 141 base pairs was constructed by zzso zzso of all synthetic segments and then cloned into zzso zzso The positive colonies were confirmed by the screening of zzso resistance, inactive zzso and analyzing by use of restriction zzso and zzso zzso The cloned gene was zzso by zzso zzso chain termination method and proven zzso
