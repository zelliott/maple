Global zzso causes an extensive cell death 3 days after the zzso in the zzso region of the zzso which is preceded by induction of a spectrum of genes with both zzso and zzso zzso This delayed cell death has been suggested to be mainly caused by programmed cell zzso Here we applied differential display to characterize transcripts induced by global zzso after 1 day in Mongolian zzso when the cells in the zzso region are still viable, but initiating the cell death zzso One of the cloned transcripts turned out to be a repeat sequence termed zzso zzso We also cloned the other member of the zzso family, zzso zzso and found it also to be slightly induced by zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso repeat regions are not translated and their role in zzso may be related the zzso attempt to cope with decreased zzso levels and/or zzso zzso Together with the previous data demonstrating the zzso of the zzso transcripts using in zzso stress models, the present study shows that zzso transcripts are zzso factors in the central nervous zzso
