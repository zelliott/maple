The juvenile development and zzso zzso zzso also called zzso zzso was originally identified through zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso Studies with a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso later indicated that the zzso effects of these zzso were probably caused by disruption of a single zzso Recent work has demonstrated that the zzso zzso is associated with deletions and point zzso in zzso a gene zzso an exceptionally large zzso zzso exchange factor protein thought to play a role in zzso zzso Here we describe the molecular characterization of a collection of zzso and chemically induced zzso zzso Ten of the 13 zzso zzso zzso we studied are deletions that remove specific portions of the zzso coding zzso DNA zzso were also detected in two additional zzso Our studies also revealed that zzso transcripts are zzso not zzso or are present in significantly altered quantities in animals carrying most of the zzso zzso we zzso including six independent zzso zzso These data provide new molecular clues regarding the wide range of zzso and p zzso that are expressed by this collection of recently generated and classical zzso zzso
