The zzso distribution of zzso can be explained by DNA zzso zzso like processes and base zzso Nevertheless, zzso are also frequently associated with repetitive DNA, raising the question of the relative contributions of these processes to zzso zzso We show that in zzso zzso about 50% of the zzso isolated by an enrichment cloning protocol are associated with repetitive zzso Based on the zzso zzso we distinguished seven different classes of repetitive zzso zzso zzso designed for the zzso sequences of an individual clone amplified a zzso family of repetitive zzso Despite considerable variation in the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso the zzso repeats did not show any evidence for zzso Rather, we observed the emergence of a new repeat type that probably arose by zzso and was spread by replication zzso In fact, a complete repeat type switch could be observed among the zzso zzso We propose that the analysis of zzso sequences embedded in repetitive DNA provides a zzso largely unexplored tool to study zzso zzso
