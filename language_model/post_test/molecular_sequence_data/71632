zzso zzso proteins are putative zzso signaling molecules that regulate cell differentiation in zzso zzso proteins are characterized by the presence of a motif unique to these zzso the zzso zzso and a variable number of zzso repeated copies of an zzso growth zzso zzso zzso We have completed a zzso analysis of 15 zzso proteins from eight zzso Our findings reveal that at least one gene zzso occurred prior to the divergence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with subsequent zzso in zzso The three known zzso zzso proteins likely arose by two independent zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso repeats suggests that zzso 2 has been zzso among zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso The sequences of two zzso repeats have been perfectly zzso in zzso zzso zzso 2 in Delta and zzso 15 in zzso Finally, the linear order of zzso repeats has been zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Delta zzso
