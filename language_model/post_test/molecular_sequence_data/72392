zzso zzso 1 zzso is a recognized cause of acute zzso respiratory disease in zzso although the virus is rarely isolated from such animals, despite zzso rates as high as 50% in some horse zzso Recently, zzso has been shown to be most closely related to zzso disease virus, raising questions as to its disease associations in zzso We report that zzso infection was the likely cause of two separate outbreaks of severe zzso respiratory disease which involved more than 20 zzso Attempts to isolate zzso from zzso zzso by conventional cell culture methods were zzso in that zzso was not zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso in the zzso of cells infected with 10 of 15 zzso zzso samples, indicating the presence and presumably replication of zzso A rise in serum zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was zzso associated with one of the zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso collected from all horses during the acute phase of disease by reverse zzso zzso sequencing of amplified products showed that within each outbreak a single strain of zzso was involved but that distinct viruses were involved in each zzso A retrospective study of samples from nine other outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses suggested zzso zzso in at least two of zzso We conclude that the relative importance of zzso as a cause of acute zzso respiratory disease in horses has been underestimated due to failure in many instances to isolate virus by conventional cell culture zzso
