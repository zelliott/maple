zzso 4 zzso gene expression is controlled at the level of zzso by the complex interactions of multiple factors that bind to a zzso promoter zzso Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso can bind up to five zzso sequences in the zzso promoter termed the P elements zzso In this paper, we characterize a novel P element in the upstream region of the human zzso promoter that we term zzso zzso shares a core zzso motif zzso and additional sequence similarity with the other P elements and supported strong interactions between the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was significantly impaired in a reporter construct in which the zzso element was zzso in the context of the full-length zzso We conclude that zzso represents a novel zzso promoter P element that contributes to zzso promoter zzso
