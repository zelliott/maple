In this study, the nearly complete sequence zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso All protein coding genes zzso are in the arrangement known to be ancestral for insects, but three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso have zzso to derived positions and there are three tandem copies of zzso each of which is potentially zzso All of these zzso except for that of zzso is within the short span between zzso and zzso and there are numerous blocks of zzso sequence in this region, perhaps as remnants of larger scale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composition is strongly biased toward A and zzso as is typical for insect zzso There is also a significant strand skew in the distribution of these zzso with the zzso being richer in A than T and in C than G, and the zzso showing an opposite skew for complementary pairs of zzso The hypothetical secondary structure of the zzso zzso has also been zzso obtaining a structural model similar to that of other zzso
