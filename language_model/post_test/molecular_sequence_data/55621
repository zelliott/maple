The zzso virus zzso origin of zzso replication zzso includes two known zzso zzso the zzso symmetry region and the family of zzso We used zzso zzso a zzso zzso to probe zzso zzso for DNA sequences that are zzso easy to unwind on a zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso hypersensitivity was detected in the family of repeats on an zzso zzso and in the zzso symmetry region on a zzso that lacks the family of repeats, indicating that the DNA in both zzso components is zzso easy to zzso The hierarchy of zzso hypersensitivity indicates that the family of repeats is more easily zzso than the zzso symmetry region, consistent with the hierarchy of zzso stability predicted by computer analysis of the DNA zzso A specific subset of the family of repeats is zzso zzso and the DNA structure deduced from zzso analysis of the zzso zzso nicks is a zzso near a zzso zzso The zzso symmetry region zzso to form a broad zzso bubble containing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We propose that the intrinsic ease of unwinding the zzso symmetry region, the actual origin of DNA zzso is an important component in the mechanism of zzso
