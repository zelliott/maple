The present study describes a 7 zzso zzso sequence zzso which is identical in zzso zzso chain and zzso virus zzso protein and is additionally followed by one conservative zzso acid zzso As such a long zzso acid zzso is extremely rare in two zzso unrelated proteins the possibility that it could induce zzso zzso was zzso Several zzso zzso suggested high zzso potential within this zzso zzso peptides containing this sequence were zzso with zzso of zzso zzso specific for zzso virus zzso protein in zzso High zzso levels against this zzso were found in zzso of zzso human zzso and zzso levels clearly increased after natural zzso infections and zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso chain zzso zzso reacted with corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso against the zzso zzso reacted with the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso against the zzso chain zzso also reacted with zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso against the zzso zzso reacted with zzso chains expressed in zzso zzso One zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso also reacted with cells expressing zzso zzso In zzso rabbit zzso against the zzso chain zzso bound to zzso chains while zzso against the zzso zzso did zzso The results suggest that there is zzso similarity in zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain which may cause zzso zzso between these zzso
