The zzso B virus zzso C gene directs the synthesis of two major gene zzso zzso core zzso zzso which forms the zzso and zzso e zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is produced by several processing events during its zzso These proteins contain an zzso acid sequence similar to the zzso zzso of zzso acid and zzso zzso On the basis of this sequence zzso which is highly zzso among zzso zzso a model has been put forward according to which processing to zzso is due to zzso of zzso involving the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso in conjunction with transient expression of zzso proteins in the human zzso cell line zzso we tested this zzso Our results with zzso zzso in which one or two of the zzso zzso acids have been replaced by others suggest strongly that processing to zzso does not depend on the presence of an intact zzso sequence in the core zzso Attempts to detect an influence of this sequence on the processing of zzso P gene products into zzso active viral zzso also gave no conclusive evidence for the existence of an zzso zzso zzso replacing the zzso essential zzso acid showed little effect on zzso zzso Additional substitution of the likewise zzso zzso zzso by zzso in contrast, almost abolished the activity of the zzso We conclude that an zzso zzso if it exists, is functionally different from zzso acid and zzso zzso
