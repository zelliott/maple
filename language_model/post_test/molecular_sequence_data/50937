zzso zzso zzso studies have been employed to map the locations of high affinity binding sites of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Bound zzso levels were kept low (less than 20 bound zzso zzso per DNA zzso in order to observe only the binding to the high affinity zzso zzso of certain restriction zzso was observed in a limited number of locations on these zzso zzso increased as bound zzso increased and the particular restriction zzso inhibited varied with zzso On all three zzso activities of these zzso was not affected in other zzso zzso of the sequences at the sites of zzso on the three zzso indicates that all sites have common sequence zzso the presence of either the sequence zzso or the sequence zzso
