A library of zzso zzso DNA was screened with zzso raised to the zzso particle associated with this zzso A clone was isolated that expresses a zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso zzso when examined by zzso analysis using zzso raised to the zzso Southern zzso zzso indicates that the gene is present on the bacterial zzso and packaged into the zzso zzso zzso A zzso probe zzso to multiple bands of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso with several different restriction zzso Thus, the gene is present in multiple copies on the zzso or in different arrangements within a given population of zzso zzso zzso The gene coding for zzso has been zzso and codes for a zzso protein with a deduced molecular weight of zzso zzso The deduced protein shows zzso identity over a zzso sequence with the zzso gene product of zzso zzso zzso is partially located within the zzso P region of the zzso element zzso found on the zzso coli zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is present on a mobile genetic element of the zzso zzso zzso and is also packaged into the zzso zzso
