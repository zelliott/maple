We have previously reported a gene zzso zzso called zzso that is temporally expressed in zzso eggs and in early zzso of the zzso The putative zzso protein carries a tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso On the analysis of nine bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso we have uncovered four more zzso zzso in the mouse zzso designated zzso through zzso zzso and zzso are found 30 zzso apart in a fully zzso zzso clone zzso zzso number zzso The genes are zzso in the coding region and each carries an zzso in the zzso region as in other early embryonic zzso The zzso gene cluster is mapped on zzso 3 at zzso zzso experiments and a search of expressed sequence tag zzso databases show that the zzso genes are transcribed in early zzso particularly at the zzso zzso Exhaustive database searches have further uncovered three more mouse zzso zzso in zzso 3 and 11 and 25 other zzso zzso in the zzso of other animal and plant species including human, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the rat zzso eight rat zzso genes are found as a cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins form a new protein family on the basis of similar protein domain zzso Based on reported characteristics of known zzso and zzso zzso we speculate that zzso proteins may be nuclear scaffold proteins probably involved in zzso regulation in early development and other cellular zzso
