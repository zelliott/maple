As it feeds upon zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso a number of zzso organisms, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of bovine zzso The zzso zzso female gut zzso was studied for two zzso adult females feeding on a bovine host infected with zzso zzso and adult females feeding on an zzso zzso zzso was zzso and used to generate a zzso zzso library from zzso zzso female gut, and zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso Gene expression was also measured by a zzso designed from the publicly available zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared gene expression in the tick gut from females feeding upon an zzso bovine to gene expression in tick gut from females feeding upon a zzso bovine infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso represented on the zzso were expressed at a higher level in female gut samples from the ticks feeding upon a zzso zzso calf compared to expression levels in female gut samples from ticks feeding on an zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed at a lower level in the ticks feeding upon zzso zzso female guts compared with expression in female gut samples from ticks feeding on the zzso zzso These array data were used as initial characterization of gene expression associated with the infection of zzso zzso by zzso zzso
