The zzso surface comprises a multilayered zzso which consists mainly of collagen zzso We identified, cloned and characterized the first zzso collagen zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso encodes a zzso collagen zzso including a zzso which possesses a zzso zzso zzso Six zzso were identified in the gene zzso with three slightly different zzso zzso The basic structure of the predicted zzso protein sequence is highly similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity between the two zzso acid zzso Relative to zzso the putative zzso protein has a shorter zzso This zzso feature may indicate different contributions of zzso and zzso zzso to the structure of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso transcripts were found mainly in zzso developing eggs, less in zzso zzso and zzso juveniles and young females shortly after the fourth zzso and much less in females before zzso
