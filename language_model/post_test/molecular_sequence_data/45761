zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the regulatory step in the zzso for synthesis of bacterial zzso and starch in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and from potato zzso zzso zzso zzso are activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso To study the function of two putative zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the potato zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the inverse zzso These zzso were expressed separately or together with the large zzso of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these forms showed that the zzso determines stability and regulatory zzso zzso The zzso forms exhibited intermediate zzso zzso properties with respect to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the interaction between the putative zzso and zzso determines the affinity for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed the functionality of the large zzso mainly in modulating regulation of the zzso by the coordinate action of zzso and zzso zzso
