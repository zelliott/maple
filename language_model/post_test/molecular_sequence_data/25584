In order to examine the mechanisms by which zzso deletion of zzso T cells occurs, a zzso zzso was used to induce deletion of zzso zzso in zzso Mice transgenic for a T cell zzso zzso that zzso to this zzso contain zzso that progress from the immature to the mature zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso to transgenic mice results in a rapid deletion of the immature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cortical zzso can be seen within 20 hours of zzso These results provide direct evidence for the in zzso role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso
