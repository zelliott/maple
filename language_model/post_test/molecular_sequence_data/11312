zzso zzso fusion protein zzso attachment protein zzso is a soluble protein that enables the zzso zzso to associate with zzso and facilitate membrane trafficking zzso Although zzso and zzso have been shown to be required for many membrane transport zzso their role in the transport of zzso zzso receptors from zzso to the trans zzso network was not zzso We present here a novel in zzso zzso that monitors the transport of zzso zzso zzso receptors between zzso and the trans zzso zzso The zzso relies on the trans zzso network zzso of zzso zzso and monitors transport of zzso zzso receptors engineered to contain a consensus sequence for modification by this zzso Using this new zzso we show that zzso strongly stimulates transport in reactions containing limiting amounts of zzso Together with zzso zzso can increase the extent of zzso These data show that zzso a soluble component of the zzso zzso machinery, zzso transport from zzso to the trans zzso zzso
