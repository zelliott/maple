By comparing zzso and zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso cells by the differential display technique, we have cloned a new zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso a new member of the tumor necrosis zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acids type I zzso protein characterized by three zzso zzso in the zzso domain and similar to zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resulted to be expressed in normal T zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso although no expression was detected in other zzso zzso including brain, zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was induced in T zzso upon zzso by zzso zzso Con A, or zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso The zzso expression of a zzso zzso gene induced resistance to zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso expression lead to increased zzso The protection toward T cell zzso zzso was specific, because other zzso signals zzso zzso zzso treatment, or zzso zzso were not modulated by zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a new member of tumor necrosis zzso growth factor zzso family involved in the regulation of T cell zzso cell zzso
