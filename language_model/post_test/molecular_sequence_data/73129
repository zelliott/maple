The complete zzso sequence of the zzso of a Taiwan isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined from three overlapping zzso clones and by direct zzso zzso zzso was made with the reported Hawaii isolate of zzso zzso Both zzso are zzso zzso long, excluding the zzso They zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a zzso leader of 85 zzso and a 3' zzso region of 209 zzso The two zzso share an overall zzso identity of zzso and an zzso acid identity of zzso The 3' zzso regions show zzso zzso The first 23 zzso of the leaders are zzso while the remaining parts of the leaders only show zzso zzso The zzso protein genes of the two zzso are very different, with zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso acids zzso However, the other viral proteins of the two virus zzso are similar, with a zzso zzso identity of their genes and zzso zzso acid identity, indicating that they are strains of the same zzso Analysis of the ratios of zzso differences to the actual zzso acid changes revealed that there are only zzso zzso changes for each zzso acid change in the zzso zzso whereas for the other proteins zzso zzso changes are required for each zzso acid zzso The zzso protein has zzso of all the differences of zzso The unusual variation in the leader sequences and the zzso proteins suggests that the two zzso strains were derived from different evolutionary pathways in different geographic zzso
