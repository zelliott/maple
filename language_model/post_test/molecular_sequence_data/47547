The frontal zzso and associated zzso pathways in larvae of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied zzso with zzso against the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Two pairs of large zzso zzso contain zzso zzso with the zzso of these pairs showing zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso exit the frontal zzso in the zzso nerve and traverse the surface of the crop to give terminal zzso around the zzso zzso There is a greater degree of lateral branching of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso over the crop zzso In zzso experiments show that the two types of peptides have zzso effects on the spontaneous zzso of the crop zzso zzso is zzso at zzso as low as zzso M, enhancing both frequency and zzso of zzso waves of zzso All members of the zzso family inhibit zzso completely at zzso of zzso M and, to varying degrees, at zzso zzso On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that zzso zzso of the frontal zzso play a major part in regulating zzso zzso through the zzso actions of the zzso and zzso
