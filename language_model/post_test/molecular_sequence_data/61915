Using zzso scanning zzso analysis, we recently identified potential zzso regulatory elements contained within the zzso upstream regulatory region zzso domain and auxiliary zzso zzso region of the human zzso type 31 zzso zzso involved in the regulation of zzso promoter activity at different stages of the viral life zzso For the present study, we extended the zzso scanning zzso analysis to identify potential zzso elements located in the zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso and to characterize cellular factors that bind to these elements under conditions representing different stages of the viral life zzso The zzso scanning zzso analysis identified viral zzso elements located in the zzso region that regulate zzso in the presence and absence of any viral gene products or viral DNA replication and determine the role of host tissue differentiation on viral zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we illustrated defined reorganization in the composition of cellular zzso factors binding to the same zzso regulatory elements at different stages of the zzso zzso life zzso Our studies provide an extensive map of functional elements in the zzso region of the zzso zzso identify zzso regulatory elements that exhibit significant zzso regulatory potential, and illustrate changes in specific zzso interactions at different stages of the viral life zzso The variable recruitment of zzso factors to the same zzso element under different cellular conditions may represent a mechanism underlying the tight link between zzso differentiation and zzso zzso
