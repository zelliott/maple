The identification of zzso in zzso collagen genes in inherited forms of zzso zzso and other zzso cartilage diseases has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient tissue to isolate zzso and by the loss of the cartilage zzso during in zzso zzso zzso To overcome these limitations we employed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to amplify zzso for the zzso zzso types II, IX and zzso from zzso obtained from small numbers of zzso We also amplified zzso for these zzso from zzso zzso from zzso virus zzso zzso Total zzso was obtained from freshly isolated human fetal and adult zzso and from long-term (90 zzso zzso zzso The zzso was reverse transcribed to zzso and the zzso amplified in the same tube with zzso zzso specific for types II, IX and zzso zzso The amplified zzso products were cloned and zzso zzso amplification of the entire zzso zzso of the type II zzso zzso was obtained from as little as 6 zzso of zzso from freshly isolated fetal human zzso Seven hundred and zzso base pairs of the alpha 1 zzso collagen zzso and the entire published sequence of alpha 2 zzso collagen zzso were also amplified from these zzso We were also able to amplify zzso for the three zzso zzso from zzso zzso from zzso zzso Thus, these methods will allow the identification of zzso in zzso collagen genes in patients with inherited zzso and other zzso cartilage diseases from small amounts of cartilage or zzso zzso or from zzso zzso
