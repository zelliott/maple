A diverse family of zzso zzso has been identified, but the rules that govern their zzso specificity are not zzso Here we propose a novel zzso of zzso zzso based on the nature of zzso acids in the two critical positions in the zzso domain zzso Using these principles, we classified zzso zzso present in the SMART zzso Using zzso zzso in zzso pull-down and zzso surface resonance zzso we demonstrated that in agreement with their position in the proposed zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display similar dual zzso zzso The proposed zzso helps to organize zzso domain containing zzso
