zzso protein 15 zzso of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso produced in zzso coli has zzso activity that zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso either the zzso or 3' zzso did not affect zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both zzso for zzso but with different zzso for zzso zzso at 2 to 10 zzso was needed for optimal zzso activity, but zzso and several other zzso metals were capable of supporting only a low level of zzso zzso of zzso needed for zzso activity induced significant zzso zzso in the zzso as measured by changes in zzso zzso A similar zzso activity was detected for the zzso protein from another zzso demonstrating that the zzso activity of zzso may be common to zzso This work presents an initial zzso characterization of a novel coronavirus zzso
