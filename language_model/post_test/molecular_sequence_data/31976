In this work, the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was characterized in solid and liquid cultures using different culture zzso The results showed that zzso was produced in all media and under all culture conditions, with the most activity in solid culture at an zzso pH of zzso Following zzso the 41 zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso The zzso was stable at a wide range of temperatures and pH values, but zzso and pH 3 were zzso The zzso and zzso values obtained were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as proteins obtained from corn zzso roots, stems and slides at pH 3 and also had zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this protein has zzso similarity to the zzso sequence theoretically obtained from the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso
