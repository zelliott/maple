Moving past the discovery phase of zzso the term targeted zzso combines multiple approaches investigating a certain set of proteins in more zzso One such targeted zzso approach is the combination of liquid zzso and selected or multiple reaction monitoring mass zzso zzso zzso zzso requires prior knowledge of the fragmentation pattern of zzso as the presence of the zzso in a sample is determined by measuring the zzso values of zzso precursor and zzso zzso Using scheduled zzso many zzso can robustly be monitored allowing for zzso sample analysis of the same set of proteins over many zzso In this chapter, zzso of zzso are explained as well as an zzso zzso pipeline from zzso generation to data zzso
