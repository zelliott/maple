zzso encodes a 196 zzso acid zzso that is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affect plaque formation by the zzso zzso by blocking the action of the zzso zzso protein zzso Here we describe the selection of a set of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso resistance to the expression of gene E from a zzso These zzso occur disproportionately in zzso of zzso that, based on the structure of the zzso zzso zzso make zzso contacts with zzso drug molecules or are zzso in other zzso zzso A wide variation in the zzso efficiency of zzso on these zzso strains is observed, relative to the zzso indicating that these zzso differ widely in residual zzso zzso Moreover, it is found that zzso zzso cause significant growth rate defects in zzso coli B and C zzso Finally, zzso of zzso causes zzso of the zzso Thus, among the zzso genes found in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum, zzso is unique in having three distinct zzso zzso
