A protein sequence database zzso containing about 11,000 entries is available for Macintosh zzso The zzso can be easily updated by importing sequences from the zzso collection through the zzso The most important feature of the database is its organization in families of closely related zzso each family being characterized by its average zzso composition zzso (1993), zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso This allows one to perform a rapid and sensitive protein similarity search by comparing the zzso family zzso composition with that of the query sequence by a linear correlation zzso An example of an application in which a new protein was classified by using a sequence of a zzso just 19 zzso long is zzso
