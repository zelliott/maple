We initially describe a novel zzso zzso family, abundantly and randomly distributed in the zzso of the bat zzso zzso We present evidence that the LINE zzso machinery is recruited for the creation of a new zzso zzso constituted by the partial LINE reverse zzso zzso which is interrupted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and Homo sapiens zzso 6 zzso zzso allows us to propose multiple zzso partners for zzso zzso such as zzso proteins and LINE zzso zzso Moreover, on the basis of the LINE and zzso zzso zzso we propose a mutual relationship between zzso and LINE zzso
