zzso 8 zzso is a novel zzso which possesses zzso zzso and zzso activities in addition to zzso activity for zzso and T zzso It has been shown that zzso is produced by a variety of human zzso cells including zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and several types of tumor cell zzso We have examined here whether or not human gastric cancer cell lines produce zzso in zzso The production of zzso protein was detected by zzso zzso zzso in the culture zzso derived from eight of nine human gastric cancer cell lines zzso with either zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso or zzso alpha plus zzso gamma zzso zzso In some of the gastric cancer cell lines such as zzso 45 and zzso zzso alpha plus zzso gamma zzso induced the production of zzso In zzso 45 cells, synergistic increase of the steady state level of zzso zzso by zzso alpha plus zzso gamma was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso gamma changed neither the number nor the affinity constant of zzso alpha binding sites on a gastric cancer cell line, suggesting that the zzso was a zzso zzso Furthermore, synergistic induction of zzso zzso activity by zzso alpha plus zzso gamma was observed in zzso 45 that were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso reporter genes driven by the zzso regulatory region of human zzso zzso Through the zzso of the regulatory region of the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso factor binding elements were presumed to be involved in zzso the responsiveness to zzso alpha plus zzso zzso Moreover, gel zzso analyses revealed that zzso alpha and zzso gamma zzso induced the binding of zzso like as well as zzso like proteins bound to these zzso These results indicated that zzso gamma zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso production in a human gastric cancer cell line through synergistic zzso of zzso factors without zzso zzso alpha zzso
