Human zzso zzso infections of the zzso zzso are associated with high-level expression of the zzso protein during the productive phase of zzso However, the precise mechanisms of how zzso contributes to the replication cycle of the virus are poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a novel binding partner of zzso type 1 zzso zzso We map critical zzso within an zzso domain of zzso zzso and in a region known to facilitate zzso zzso that are requisite for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso show that zzso binding is associated with zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso We show that zzso is zzso into zzso inclusion bodies in terminally differentiated cells within zzso warts and that zzso between zzso and zzso is not dependent on additional zzso zzso Moreover, we also identify zzso binding of zzso proteins of zzso and zzso Our findings indicate that zzso binding is a zzso function of zzso proteins of diverse virus zzso zzso influences important zzso processes within the cell, including nuclear organization and zzso zzso While zzso of zzso zzso by zzso may directly influence zzso zzso function during the infectious cycle, the zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso may affect the ability of zzso to zzso its cellular targets, thereby zzso the productive phase of the zzso replication zzso
