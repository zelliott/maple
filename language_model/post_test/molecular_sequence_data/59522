In zzso analyses of zzso sequence requirements for zzso zzso in tobacco zzso have previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso sites are selected by their position relative to zzso elements within plant zzso and by their degree of zzso to the zzso small nuclear zzso To determine whether the presence of adjacent zzso affects zzso zzso site recognition in plant zzso we have analyzed the in zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso site zzso in the second zzso These experiments indicated that the zzso site selection patterns in plant zzso are defined primarily by sequences within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by weak interactions across zzso zzso zzso The effects of these secondary interactions became evident only when zzso in the downstream zzso zzso site decreased its functionality and differed depending on the availability of cryptic zzso sites close to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso transcripts containing multiple cryptic zzso zzso sites, the presence of an intact upstream zzso significantly increased zzso at the downstream zzso zzso sites in a polar fashion without zzso zzso zzso In a natural zzso transcript, which does not contain cryptic zzso sites, zzso of the first zzso of the downstream zzso activated an array of zzso zzso and 3' zzso sites and some zzso zzso
