Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been characterized and their zzso mass zzso assessed by zzso mass zzso The intact zzso zzso all bound zzso and gave normal zzso zzso indicating that they were correctly zzso zzso produced at Washington State University included a parent zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary sequence zzso zzso a zzso analogue containing an zzso extension, and five different zzso zzso The smallest of these was a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso with primary sequence zzso All zzso except for the smallest exhibited significant mass instability, assessed by zzso mass zzso that was apparent within zzso days standing in a sterile environment at room zzso Two full-length zzso zzso expressed independently in geographically remote laboratories zzso Illinois University and zzso University of zzso also exhibited this mass zzso A mass loss of as much as approximately zzso of the starting mass has been observed, which could explain the zzso terminal zzso acids in published crystal zzso This work documents the phenomenon and its persistence despite zzso sample zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary sequence variations, zzso the presence or absence of zzso zzso and zzso the presence or absence of zzso
