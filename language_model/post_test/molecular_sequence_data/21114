An efficient cellulose degrading bacteria exists in the zzso wheat zzso community, zzso However, this strain cannot be isolated and cultured using conventional separation techniques under strict zzso zzso We successfully isolated a strain of effective cellulose degrading bacteria zzso using a zzso heat zzso and zzso alternating zzso Analysis of its properties revealed that, although the community containing the strain zzso grew under zzso conditions, the zzso strain zzso only grew under zzso culture zzso The strain zzso had a striking capability of degrading cellulose zzso weight loss after 9 days of zzso The highest efficiency value of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso cellulose degradation efficiency by zzso was remarkably high at zzso degrees C with the highest degradation efficiency observed at 60 degrees zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the closest relative to strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of utilizing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also grew with zzso as the sole carbon source, whereas zzso zzso is unable to do zzso
