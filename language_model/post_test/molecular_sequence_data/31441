Commercial zzso used to diagnose human zzso are obtained from either a soluble zzso extract or a zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to identify zzso proteins as potential diagnostic candidates in zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional zzso and zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with serum samples obtained from patients with zzso zzso and from a zzso control zzso Six zzso proteins were identified and zzso by liquid zzso zzso Among these we found zzso which was previously identified as a diagnostic candidate in a study conducted in zzso Central zzso Here, we evaluated zzso and the zzso zzso as potential zzso diagnostic zzso and also investigated the zzso and partial function of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was recognized by all 10 serum samples from zzso individuals, whereas zzso was identified by only five of the 10 positive zzso None of the zzso were recognized by negative control zzso Despite the limited number of serum samples evaluated in this study, the results suggest that zzso can be a suitable candidate for diagnosis of human zzso not only in Central America but also in sub-Saharan zzso
