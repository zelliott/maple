zzso of the zzso gene is the molecular consequence of the zzso zzso zzso which is found in approximately zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the ability of the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect this zzso in zzso samples, we studied 48 cases of zzso zzso using DNA extracted from paired samples of zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso A standard zzso DNA extraction method was used for both types of zzso zzso of the major zzso region zzso and minor cluster sequence zzso were zzso Three segments of the human zzso gene were also amplified to estimate the degree of DNA degradation in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA revealed zzso products in 29 of the 48 zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso DNA studies were positive in 24 zzso zzso products were detected in 24 zzso samples, and varied from 80 zzso to zzso zzso zzso Twenty of these cases yielded zzso products in the corresponding zzso DNA, ranging from 80 to 276 zzso Five zzso and four zzso samples produced zzso segments that ranged from 340 zzso to zzso zzso Four of the five samples with no zzso zzso or zzso zzso using zzso DNA had products greater than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso segment of the zzso gene was amplified in all 29 zzso zzso a 324 zzso zzso was produced in 20 samples zzso and a zzso zzso segment was detected in 13 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
