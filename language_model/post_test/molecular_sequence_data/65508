The human zzso protein has a long-standing association with zzso since the zzso gene was originally identified in the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso Recent studies have partly unveiled zzso cellular functions including zzso zzso in primary cells as well as cancer cells, determination of 3' zzso site of transcribed zzso and suppression of zzso initiation by zzso zzso It has been previously shown that the zzso region of zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso important in zzso and in zzso functions of zzso which include zzso DNA zzso zzso introduction of constrained positive zzso into closed zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso as determined using solution zzso The zzso part of zzso which contains a putative zzso motif zzso zzso folds into a zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso part of zzso shows a very similar structure to the zzso part, although the zzso and the zzso part differ zzso in their zzso acid zzso As a consequence, the structure of zzso has a zzso twofold plane zzso In addition, we tested zzso binding of zzso by monitoring changes of zzso chemical shifts upon addition of zzso We found that not only the zzso part containing the zzso motif but the zzso part is also involved in zzso zzso zzso Our study illustrates a new structural zzso and reveals novel zzso properties for proteins containing the zzso zzso
