zzso zzso harbors a zzso surface protein zzso by the zzso zzso This gene has been shown to be part of a zzso putative zzso zzso A gene similar to zzso has recently been found in zzso zzso zzso recovered from hospitalized zzso In the present study we analyzed the zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso and we investigated the association of zzso with neighboring zzso zzso The zzso gene showed considerable sequence zzso in the regions zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein as well as differences in the number of zzso DNA sequencing of zzso regions zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso revealed seven open reading zzso representing putative genes implicated in zzso regulation of transcription, and zzso zzso These zzso regions were invariably associated with the presence or absence of the zzso gene in zzso zzso indicating that zzso in zzso zzso is part of a distinct genetic zzso Because of the presence of zzso genes in this gene zzso the lower zzso content relative to that of the zzso and the presence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso outbreaks and clinically documented infections, we conclude that this genetic element constitutes a putative zzso island, the first one described in zzso zzso Except for the presence of zzso and zzso this zzso island is completely different from the zzso zzso island previously disclosed in zzso zzso
