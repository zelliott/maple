An zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso was compared to two other clones that were derived from the zzso salt sensitive zzso and salt resistant rat zzso All zzso differ at the alternative zzso site and at zzso acid 218 for zzso zzso activates zzso but not zzso while zzso was also activated by zzso zzso of zzso activities by zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was elevated from 50 to 125 zzso zzso zzso 4) with zzso (40 zzso and reduced from 50 to 29 zzso zzso zzso 4) and 18 zzso zzso zzso 4) with 10 or 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso was active at all three zzso while zzso and zzso were only active at lower zzso zzso zzso pH zzso without zzso or zzso and zzso pH zzso with 10 zzso zzso from pH zzso to zzso zzso or zzso showed that zzso activity was attenuated at both low and high zzso zzso activity was attenuated only at pH zzso and zzso (with or without zzso while zzso activity was attenuated at pH zzso (with or without zzso and pH zzso (with zzso Finally, only zzso activity was zzso by 250 zzso zzso or 250 zzso zzso zzso Thus the differential regulation of zzso by these zzso is dependent upon the pattern of cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso
