A protein modification essential for the cellular sorting of many biologically relevant proteins is the zzso attachment of zzso lipids by specific zzso zzso is known to render protein zzso zzso thereby zzso the interaction with zzso zzso and/or membrane zzso The target for the modification with zzso groups is the zzso sequence zzso Among the variety of zzso proteins the only one reported so far to be located to zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Recently we published data on the zzso of the human gene zzso zzso Braun et zzso 1994, Gene zzso zzso which was revealed to be the human zzso of zzso and was consequently renamed zzso The zzso structure, molecular zzso and evolutionary conservation of zzso are described zzso The exact location of the gene was defined as zzso zzso The gene spans a region of approximately 9 zzso containing eight zzso and seven zzso The zzso upstream region showed two potential zzso sites and an zzso repetitive zzso zzso reporter zzso capacity confirmed the presumed promoter activity of this zzso On the zzso level, we detected four zzso zzso originating either from zzso skipping or from alternative zzso zzso For the zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso zzso was zzso Through the use of zzso zzso the protein was shown to be attached to the outer surface of zzso This zzso together with the similarity to a zzso assembly protein from zzso zzso suggests zzso is involved in the process of zzso zzso or zzso
