In animal zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso are formed from their corresponding zzso zzso by the zzso of a specific zzso D zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso Despite its potential zzso importance, zzso has not yet been characterized with a zzso zzso zzso In the present study we expressed a zzso zzso in zzso coli and highly zzso zzso The zzso zzso was remarkably activated in a zzso manner by zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso and, zzso appeared to be zzso zzso The zzso showed extremely high specificity for zzso among various zzso but did not reveal obvious selectivity for different long chain or medium chain zzso species of zzso These results suggested the ability of zzso to degrade different zzso without damaging other membrane zzso Metal analysis revealed the presence of zzso important zinc in zzso In addition, zzso zzso studies were addressed to several zzso and zzso acid zzso of zzso that are highly zzso within the zzso zzso Single zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso or remarkable reduction of the zzso zzso Moreover, when six zzso zzso were individually zzso to zzso only zzso showed a considerably reduced zzso The activities of zzso and zzso found as single zzso zzso were also zzso Thus, zzso appeared to function through a mechanism similar to those of the well characterized members of this family but play a unique role in the zzso metabolism of animal zzso
