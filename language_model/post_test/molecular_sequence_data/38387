We have previously prepared human zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso clones using zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of genes of zzso zzso heavy and light chain variable regions in these zzso clones suggested that the zzso activity of the clones depended on light chain zzso To confirm the role of the light chain in zzso binding to DNA, we constructed in the present study's new zzso zzso clones by heavy and light chain zzso between the original zzso zzso zzso zzso constructed by pairing zzso fragments with the light chain from a high zzso clone showed high zzso activities, whereas other constructed clones using light chains from low zzso clones showed low zzso zzso Our results indicate that light chains in zzso zzso can determine the zzso activity of the zzso zzso chain zzso of zzso zzso may be useful for investigating the molecular mechanisms for zzso binding of human zzso
