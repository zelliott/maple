To test the hypothesis that zzso recognition differs between bacterial and human zzso zzso we zzso several clones identified as human zzso zzso zzso by the Human Genome zzso We found that human zzso zzso is composed of three zzso 1) an zzso zzso fold domain that is responsible for formation of the activated zzso intermediate and is zzso among bacteria, zzso and zzso 2) a zzso zzso recognition domain that has not been zzso between bacteria and zzso and 3) a zzso domain that is unique to the human zzso zzso and whose primary structure is zzso identical to the putative human zzso zzso zzso protein II, 50% identical to the zzso domain of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso identical to the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso The first two zzso of the human zzso zzso are 52, 36, and zzso identical to zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nine of zzso zzso acids known to be involved in the formation of the zzso complex in zzso zzso are zzso across all of the organisms, whereas zzso acids involved in the recognition of zzso are not zzso zzso analyses of zzso human and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli indicate that human zzso zzso zzso human but not zzso zzso zzso and vice versa, supporting the original zzso It is proposed that like zzso zzso protein II and the zzso domain of zzso the zzso domain of human zzso zzso evolved from gene zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso and may direct zzso to the active site of the zzso
