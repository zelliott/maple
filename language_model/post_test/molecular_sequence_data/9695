The zzso domain is a very common zzso protein domain involved in recognition of a wide range of zzso structures and zzso Two structures of human zzso in complex with distinct zzso zzso have revealed important aspects of zzso recognition, but have also raised intriguing questions concerning the origin of binding zzso The zzso of the domain provides an extensive zzso platform for packing aromatic zzso bases and zzso protein side zzso However, many interactions between functional groups on the zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso surface are potentially common to zzso proteins with diverse specificity and therefore make only limited contribution to molecular zzso The refined structure of the zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso element reported here zzso the role of the zzso domain principal specificity zzso (the variable zzso in molecular zzso The most variable region of zzso zzso loop 3, plays a crucial role in defining the global geometry of the zzso zzso zzso interactions with the zzso zzso backbone involve protein side chains that are unique to zzso and are likely to be important for zzso This analysis provides a novel picture of zzso recognition, much closer to our current understanding of zzso recognition than that of zzso zzso
