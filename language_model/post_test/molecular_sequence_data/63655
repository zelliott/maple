zzso finger proteins are zinc finger proteins containing the zzso zzso They act mainly as zzso zzso zzso bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso and promote degradation of targeted zzso Many novel genes have been isolated and zzso expressed in human adult and zzso zzso by a zzso zzso differential display zzso A novel zzso finger zzso is highly expressed in adult zzso and at low level in fetal zzso It was named zzso It contains a zzso zzso ORF, encodes a zzso zzso zzso and has a zzso finger in its C zzso zzso zzso shows that the gene is located on zzso 13 and contains five zzso A multiple tissue expression profile also indicates that it is highly expressed in human zzso so we speculate that it may be associated with human zzso by virtue of the action of its zzso zzso
