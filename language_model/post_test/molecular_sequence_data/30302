zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in extracts of zzso cells both as a free protein (Mr zzso zzso and as a component (Mr approximately zzso of the high molecular weight zzso zzso complex (Mr greater than zzso Several pieces of evidence indicate that the low molecular weight free form is not a zzso degradation product of the zzso zzso but that it zzso in zzso zzso the zzso free form differs in size from the active zzso zzso generated in zzso zzso conditions expected to increase or decrease the amount of zzso do not alter the ratio of the two forms of the zzso and zzso the free form contains an zzso zzso zzso A model is presented that provides a rationale for the existence of two forms of zzso zzso in zzso In this model the zzso zzso supplies zzso for protein zzso whereas the free zzso provides zzso for the zzso zzso modification of proteins by zzso zzso This latter process targets certain proteins for removal by the zzso protein degradation zzso The necessity for an additional pool of zzso for the modification reaction leads to the conclusion that the zzso destined for protein synthesis zzso protein zzso is channeled and unavailable for other zzso Other evidence supporting channeling in protein synthesis is zzso
