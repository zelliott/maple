We show that zzso zzso has a zzso 2 complex, and that this complex is strongly zzso with the zzso one, both in structure and in the rules of spatial and zzso sequential expression of its genes during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, two zzso known to alter zzso patterning of the body when applied to zzso zzso produce, respectively, zzso with reduced zzso but exaggerated anterior structures and zzso with zzso of anterior zzso We report here on the effect of these zzso on the expression of zzso 2 genes in the zzso zzso zzso has a dramatic effect on zzso zzso suppressing the expression of these genes during zzso and early zzso However, later on expression of these genes reaches significant levels, suggesting the existence of two zzso in the control of zzso gene zzso zzso acid increases the steady state level of transcripts from zzso genes with the greatest effect on zzso zzso the most anterior of the genes zzso This suggests that the results obtained in zzso cells zzso et zzso 1990, zzso reflect what occurs in zzso Neither zzso nor zzso change the sequential order of the onset of expression of the zzso showing that these zzso do not zzso the molecular mechanisms used to establish the sequential zzso of the genes of the zzso zzso
