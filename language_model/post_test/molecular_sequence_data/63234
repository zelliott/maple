The molecular mechanism of entry of zzso viruses requires a zzso fusion zzso zzso entry and zzso fusion of zzso zzso virus zzso requires four zzso zzso zzso and zzso The role of zzso remained elusive until recently, when the crystal structure of zzso zzso became zzso zzso B zzso represent the most highly zzso group of zzso virus zzso however, despite the high degree of sequence and structural zzso differences in zzso processing are observed for different members of this virus zzso Whereas zzso of zzso is not zzso processed after zzso most other zzso zzso are zzso by a cellular zzso into zzso that remain linked through zzso zzso zzso zzso is common for zzso of many other viral fusion zzso so it remains difficult to zzso a common role for different zzso virus zzso structures in the fusion zzso We selected bovine zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso as representative viruses expressing zzso and zzso zzso and have screened their zzso acid sequences for regions of highly zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to such regions were tested for their ability to induce the fusion of large zzso zzso and to inhibit zzso virus zzso These results underline that several regions of the zzso protein are involved in the mechanism of membrane zzso
