In healthy virus carriers, zzso is subject to strong zzso responses that principally target the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso 3B, zzso subset of virus zzso In zzso zzso of this kind have proved very effective in treating zzso zzso lymphoma, a zzso that expresses the full range of virus zzso However, targeting other zzso tumors will require zzso that recognize some of the zzso viral zzso since in zzso zzso and zzso Hodgkin's disease, zzso zzso membrane protein zzso 1, and zzso are the only virus proteins zzso zzso healthy virus carriers zzso and zzso we identified five zzso target zzso in zzso restricted through zzso zzso particularly common in the southern Chinese population, which is most at risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of zzso zzso zzso especially in the context of zzso for which four zzso are present at significant frequency in the Chinese zzso As to virus zzso zzso zzso sequences (in contrast to zzso zzso 3B, and zzso zzso were shown to be zzso zzso among zzso zzso from different world zzso including viruses present in zzso zzso and Hodgkin's disease biopsy zzso Thus, zzso zzso and Hodgkin's disease are predicted to express zzso proteins that contain zzso zzso target zzso restricted through common zzso zzso boosting responses to these zzso could form the basis of a zzso therapy for these zzso
