A number of marine bacteria isolated from young zzso were characterized as belonging to the family zzso The zzso characterization of strain zzso zzso which was isolated from an acrylic surface at the zzso at zzso Korea, is reported zzso The nearly complete zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso zzso was determined and was found to have a high level of similarity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis and comparison with closely related strains confirmed that the strain represented a novel member of the zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso of strain zzso zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The dominant fatty acid zzso zzso were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : zzso 16 : zzso and 15 : zzso Growth was observed at zzso degrees C zzso 30 degrees zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and with zzso % zzso zzso 1 zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso evidence zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified as the type strain of a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
