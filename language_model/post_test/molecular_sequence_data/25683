We have constructed a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso extension zzso using a zzso zzso which zzso the nascent zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was zzso from cell zzso by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso which recognizes a portion of the zzso extension zzso zzso was characterized as biologically indistinguishable from the unmodified zzso zzso for release of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso In contrast to unmodified zzso which is not recognized by zzso zzso following binding to its cellular zzso zzso zzso is recognized by the zzso zzso directed against the zzso extension zzso Because the zzso zzso recognizes the zzso complex on cells, this methodology is useful in zzso sorting of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso affinity column was constructed by zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was zzso to the zzso and zzso by zzso of the zzso complex from the zzso Analysis by zzso gel zzso revealed a unique protein band at zzso consistent with the molecular weight predicted from zzso experiments when the contribution of zzso is zzso Development of this zzso zzso zzso provides a useful probe previously unavailable for the zzso zzso zzso
