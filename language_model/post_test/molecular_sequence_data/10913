A novel, zzso zzso DNA zzso that was earlier identified as a component of the zzso zzso alpha complex zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso has been zzso to zzso and zzso Thus far, our studies demonstrated that zzso A shares certain unique features of two other zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso of zzso coli and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso activity was zzso by zzso replication protein A zzso and to a lower extent by zzso coli zzso DNA binding protein zzso The zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 90 zzso as determined by its mobility on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso followed by a zzso search of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The search identified a zzso zzso open reading frame previously designated as zzso on zzso zzso that codes for a zzso zzso (683 zzso zzso zzso The important features of the zzso sequence of zzso A included a type I zzso binding zzso and a K E E R R L N V A M T R P R R sequence at the zzso that may be indicative of a nuclear zzso signal which is required of a nuclear DNA zzso The zzso sequence of zzso A appears to have zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso The facts that these two zzso are vastly separated by evolution and retained similar structural and functional features, as demonstrated here, point to a possible significance of this limited zzso Although the amount of zzso zzso A was zzso we have carried out necessary zzso characterization so that these data could be correlated with that of zzso zzso A and zzso zzso A expressed in zzso zzso
