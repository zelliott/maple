In zzso growing plant cells, cortical zzso play an important role in regulating the direction of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is defective in directional cell zzso and exhibits right-handed zzso growth in zzso expanding zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The growth of zzso roots is more sensitive to zzso drugs than is zzso root zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein containing zzso motifs that are implicated in zzso zzso When expressed zzso zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso and was localized to cortical zzso as well as other zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso protein directly bound to zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and mass zzso identified a tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso protein zzso from tobacco zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein and is required for proper zzso function involved in zzso zzso
