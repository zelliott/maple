zzso bacterial community composition zzso dynamics in response to zzso and breakdown of zzso zzso were examined by conducting in zzso zzso experiments with varying levels of zzso zzso zzso ranging from 15 to zzso zzso as measured by zzso concentration in the freshwater water zzso The zzso was assessed by means of terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes followed by cloning and sequencing of selected zzso The results showed that the composition of both zzso and zzso bacterial communities changed during the zzso and breakdown zzso of a zzso zzso and differences were also evident with different levels of zzso zzso The relative abundance of bacteria affiliated with zzso and zzso increased in general after amendment with zzso zzso correlation between the relative abundance of zzso and breakdown of zzso biomass was also zzso zzso correspondence analysis zzso showed that the changes in the zzso and zzso bacterial community were mostly related to the changes in the zzso of zzso dissolved organic carbon zzso dissolved oxygen zzso and zzso which were mainly induced by the breakdown of zzso zzso Overall, our study revealed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their breakdown have strong impacts on bacterial community zzso zzso there might be zzso association between zzso and decomposition of zzso zzso zzso it is necessary to reveal potential associations between zzso organisms and zzso zzso in zzso freshwater zzso
