The primary structures of the plasmids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso pneumoniae, respectively, which carry genes for a Type II zzso system zzso with the specificity zzso were determined in order to zzso the structural relationship between zzso The data suggest a possible role for zzso events at zzso zzso of zzso regions and the sites of resolution of zzso zzso forms zzso zzso zzso in the structural evolution of zzso zzso Analysis of the sequences of zzso and zzso showed that the genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the sequences of the rep zzso regions in the two zzso are almost zzso In both zzso these regions are localized between the zzso regions and the zzso zzso The rest of the zzso sequence is almost identical to that of the mob zzso region of zzso and the corresponding segment of zzso is almost identical to part of zzso from zzso zzso The difference in primary structures results in different zzso properties of zzso and zzso The complete sequences of zzso zzso and the zzso comparison of the sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that plasmids may exchange DNA units via zzso zzso events at zzso and zzso zzso In the course of zzso database searches using the zzso sites of zzso and zzso as queries, we found zzso zzso sites of natural zzso zzso of these sequences reveals that they fall into two zzso The plasmids in each group possess related segments between their zzso and zzso zzso
