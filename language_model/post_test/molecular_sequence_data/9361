The zzso rich prostate and zzso expressed zzso proteins identified till date are thought to resemble the three fingered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, for the first time, we report the zzso cloning and characterization of rat zzso gene cluster and also determine the expression zzso The rat zzso genes are clustered on zzso 8 and their predicted proteins retained the ten zzso signature characteristic to zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso three zzso protein structure was found to be similar to that of the toxin zzso Though zzso gene expression is thought to be prostate and zzso specific, we observed that rat zzso genes are also expressed in seminal zzso and zzso and in zzso beyond the male zzso zzso In the developing rats zzso day zzso expression of zzso genes seem to be zzso dependent in the zzso and zzso In the adult zzso zzso zzso resulted in down regulation of the majority of zzso genes in the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were found to be expressed abundantly in the male zzso tract of rats and on the zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited potent zzso activity, whereas zzso did not exhibit any zzso zzso zzso expression was induced in the zzso when challenged with zzso Based on our results, we conclude that rat zzso proteins may contribute to the zzso and defense zzso
