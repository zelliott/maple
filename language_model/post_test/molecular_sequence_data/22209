The zzso : zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso family is responsible for the first committed step in the synthesis of zzso zzso on protein zzso Previous work from our group has demonstrated both sequence and functional conservation between members of this family in zzso and the fruit fly, zzso zzso One member of this family in zzso has been shown to be essential for viability and zzso In an effort to understand the zzso stages and processes in which zzso is involved, we have determined the expression pattern of each functional family member as well as putative zzso during zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso are expressed in discrete spatial and zzso fashions during development, with some zzso being found uniquely in restricted areas of the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas others are found in multiple regions and overlap with the expression of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso and the zzso during zzso Additionally, we examined expression patterns in zzso discs from third zzso larvae, which will become the adult zzso Most zzso are also expressed in the zzso discs, with some showing unique transcript zzso and spatial regulatory zzso Thus, this report provides insight into the specific regions during zzso development that may require zzso zzso in zzso as well as which zzso may act zzso in certain zzso and which may be uniquely responsible for zzso in zzso
