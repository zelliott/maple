We have identified and characterized a zzso zzso zzso 1 ( zzso ) gene from tobacco ( zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to early flowering in the zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso Hicks, and under zzso zzso also in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Hicks Maryland Mammoth ( zzso ) tobacco and the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants remained in the zzso stage and never zzso under zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso transgenic plants bolted but did not zzso However, if treated with zzso transgenic zzso zzso plants zzso much faster under zzso short days than corresponding wild type plants, indicating an additive effect of zzso and the zzso protein in flowering time zzso The zzso wild type zzso Hicks and the zzso zzso Hicks zzso plants exhibit an initial zzso stage, both under zzso and zzso In the transgenic lines, this zzso stage was completely zzso zzso plants of zzso Hicks zzso never zzso under long zzso however, all transgenic lines zzso zzso zzso under this otherwise zzso zzso
