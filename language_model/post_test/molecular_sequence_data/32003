zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso promotes the degradation of low density zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in regulating plasma zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso growth factor precursor zzso domain A zzso of the zzso is critical for zzso binding at the cell surface zzso zzso Here, we further characterized the role of zzso in binding of zzso to the zzso We found that zzso efficiently bound to the zzso but not to other zzso family zzso Replacement of zzso in the very low density zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso promoted the degradation of the zzso zzso induced by zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso bound to zzso zzso in a zzso manner with stronger binding at pH zzso We also identified zzso acid zzso in zzso of the zzso important for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso binding to the zzso at neutral pH without effect at pH zzso while zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso binding at both pH zzso Thus, our findings reveal that zzso of the zzso is critical for zzso binding at the cell surface zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso environment zzso zzso but different zzso contribute to efficient zzso binding in different pH zzso
