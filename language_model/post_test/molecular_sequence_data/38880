In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso replication factor C zzso plays key roles both in zzso DNA replication and in DNA replication checkpoint zzso At the replication fork, the zzso zzso complex functions to load the zzso zzso accessory factor zzso onto zzso zzso then acts as a sliding zzso zzso Pol delta to the DNA to zzso its zzso Here we describe the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is interrupted by five zzso ranging in size from 49 to 165 zzso The spliced zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso protein that is approximately 50% identical at the zzso acid sequence level to the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso with zzso cells being defective for DNA zzso Loss of zzso function can be rescued by zzso expression of either the zzso zzso zzso or human zzso proteins in zzso zzso
