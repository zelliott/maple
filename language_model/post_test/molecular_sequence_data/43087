We have studied the zzso effect of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso B virus surface zzso Human zzso cell line zzso harbors several integrated copies of the zzso zzso and produces and zzso zzso B virus surface zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to various regions of the surface zzso gene were zzso and their ability to block its expression was zzso zzso zzso and zzso complementary to regions covering zzso zzso of both zzso and S genes significantly inhibited zzso and S protein zzso Less efficient zzso was achieved when the zzso complementary to the inside S gene region was zzso
