We propose that the zzso binding site in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lies in the predicted zzso zzso We examined the zzso zzso and G protein zzso of 28 zzso forms of zzso in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso The zzso acids we zzso are: 1) predicted to be oriented toward the zzso space; 2) analogous to those required for zzso binding in various other G zzso zzso 3) divergent from zzso A4 zzso a low affinity zzso for zzso zzso and 4) either highly zzso or divergent in other G zzso zzso Some zzso resulted in zzso zzso suggesting that the receptors were zzso Most zzso receptors that were transported to the zzso bound zzso with affinities similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in reduced affinities zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso also appeared to affect G protein zzso suggesting that these zzso may also be involved in signal zzso and/or are essential for proper folding of the zzso Some of the zzso zzso that appeared to be involved in binding of zzso peptides were located at sites analogous to those identified in zzso binding to certain other G zzso zzso It is thus possible that several G zzso receptors have a common placement of zzso zzso zzso
