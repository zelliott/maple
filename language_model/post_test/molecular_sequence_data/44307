The central zzso disease progressive zzso zzso zzso is caused by the human zzso zzso virus zzso zzso evolved as geographically based zzso of which Type 3 is an African zzso first characterized in zzso positive patients from zzso This study reports the complete sequence of five zzso Type 3 zzso The entire zzso zzso was zzso amplified from urine specimens of three African and two African-American zzso The African consensus sequence was compared to the Type 1 and Type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Type 3 differed in zzso of its coding region zzso from zzso zzso and in zzso from zzso Within the coding region the sequence variation among the three types was higher in the zzso protein zzso and in the regulatory protein large T zzso than in the zzso or in zzso zzso Type zzso changes were located at sites adjacent to the zinc finger motif and near the major donor and zzso zzso junctions of large T zzso Four of the five urinary Type 3 strains had an zzso zzso regulatory zzso African strain zzso showed a zzso deletion at a location similar to that previously described for zzso from zzso The African-American Type 3 strain zzso was closely related to the African consensus zzso The complete zzso of a urinary zzso strain from another African-American male, previously reported as a possible Type 5, showed a sequence difference of only zzso from the zzso consensus and has been reclassified as a zzso of Type zzso
