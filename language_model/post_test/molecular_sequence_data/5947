Bone zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso and inhibitor of neural zzso We have used differential screening to identify genes involved in zzso induction downstream of zzso and report here evidence of a novel zzso mechanism that regulates the division of the zzso zzso into regions of neural and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso leads to an increase in the expression of translation initiation factor zzso zzso a divergent member of the zzso gene family until now characterized only in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is elevated in the zzso zzso a site of active zzso signal zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells that would otherwise adopt a neural fate, mimicking the effects of zzso zzso induction by zzso requires both an active zzso signaling zzso and an zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso can regulate changes in cell fate through selective zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso interact through a positive feedback loop in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
