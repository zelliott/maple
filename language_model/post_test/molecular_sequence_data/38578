The zzso of zzso zzso shares zzso zzso zzso with one end of the linear zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso terminal sequence followed by the zzso zzso zzso element zzso The zzso zzso terminal sequence was zzso The mean zzso content of this sequence is zzso zzso with a striking G vs C bias in the last zzso The terminal 232 zzso contained 10 zzso sequences with potential to form complex secondary zzso One typical zzso coding sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso was predicted in the determined zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso product contained a zzso zzso zzso and exhibited similarity to type I restriction zzso zzso zzso in the database, suggesting a possible role in replication of the zzso However, all the zzso sequences on the zzso and zzso could be simultaneously knocked out by targeted zzso without affecting the viability of the cells and the zzso of the zzso and zzso This ruled out zzso as an essential component in the maintenance of the linear zzso and zzso
