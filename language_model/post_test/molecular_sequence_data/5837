The zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso was cloned from rabbit zzso zzso by using a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso 236 zzso acids possesses high zzso acid identity zzso with the previously cloned zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were recorded in zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso a result consistent with zzso expression in zzso zzso A widespread distribution and marked expression of zzso zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and pigmented zzso zzso zzso cells was found for the first zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression is more abundant in zzso than zzso These findings are consistent with the idea that zzso may be an important regulatory element in these zzso zzso
