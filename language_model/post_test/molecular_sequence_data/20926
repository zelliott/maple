zzso virus zzso a highly zzso member of the zzso which originated from zzso encodes for a fusion zzso protein which is zzso processed within zzso by zzso zzso We show here that sequence requirements for zzso F zzso differ markedly from other zzso or zzso fusion zzso In contrast to other viral fusion proteins with zzso zzso sites, processing of zzso F proteins with one single basic zzso acid in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is very inefficient, and introduction of a consensus sequence for zzso does not result in zzso by this ubiquitous zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso F protein completely zzso zzso processing and the generation of biological zzso
