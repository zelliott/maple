zzso protein zzso and zzso examination by means of a panel of 64 tests were used to identify 14 putative zzso to the species zzso The results were confirmed by means of zzso zzso experiments and were used to discuss zzso of zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The data indicated that comparison of near-complete zzso zzso DNA sequences does not always provide conclusive evidence for species level identification and may prove highly zzso The data also indicated that zzso zzso is a junior synonym of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso strain zzso belongs to the same zzso zzso zzso occurs in various animal zzso including zzso dogs, zzso rats, and zzso zzso growth conditions and identification strategies will be required to establish the genuine significance of this widely distributed zzso zzso
