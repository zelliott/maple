The zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso cells responsible for the formation and zzso of zzso humor in the zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso clone from a zzso zzso zzso library of bovine zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso a member of a new family of zzso zzso The bovine zzso clone contains an open reading frame of 226 zzso acids zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from the bovine zzso zzso clone shows zzso identity with the human counterpart isolated from zzso and a lower degree of identity with a group of related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in growth zzso Analysis of bovine zzso zzso reveals that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso which is zzso predominantly in cornea and at low levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and transformed cell lines established from the zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant levels of zzso zzso These results raise questions regarding possible roles of zzso in the anterior segment of the zzso
