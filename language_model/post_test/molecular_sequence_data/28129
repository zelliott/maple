Because of previous indications that zzso zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso testosterone zzso production in some species, the production of zzso and zzso gene expression in human fetal zzso were zzso zzso zzso from 14 fetuses zzso age zzso weeks) were incubated with and without 200 zzso highly zzso zzso and the production of zzso and T was measured by zzso zzso T production was high at 15-18 weeks of gestation and decreased zzso zzso production was low in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in fetal zzso zzso when studied by Northern and dot zzso zzso zzso and fetal liver expressed zzso zzso but fetal zzso contained only zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the production of both T and zzso in the zzso of older fetuses zzso weeks), but the zzso zzso production of the youngest fetuses zzso weeks) did not increase significantly after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso activity and gene expression are very low in human fetal zzso These findings suggest that zzso may not play a major role in zzso T production in the human zzso
