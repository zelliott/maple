The complete sequence of the zzso zzso has revealed a zzso sequence that yielded an authentic zzso when zzso in zzso zzso In this paper we describe this zzso zzso zzso in more zzso Islands of strong similarity to plant zzso were found throughout the zzso sequence whereas zzso zzso identify it as a likely sensory zzso zzso a family to which plant zzso are zzso An approximately 300 zzso portion that is important for plant zzso function is missing from the zzso zzso immediately in front of the putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso is soluble and can easily be zzso to zzso by affinity zzso zzso and similar zzso are zzso attached within seconds, an zzso process followed by slow zzso changes culminating in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics are remarkably similar to those of plant zzso although the zzso of the zzso is likely to be more zzso in the zzso zzso According to zzso zzso the native zzso zzso and zzso zzso predominantly as zzso and zzso species, zzso Both tend to form zzso in zzso and zzso under low salt zzso Nevertheless, the purity and zzso of the zzso gene product make it a most attractive model for molecular studies of zzso including zzso zzso
