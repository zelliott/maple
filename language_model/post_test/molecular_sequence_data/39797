zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso that acts as a sensor of cellular energy zzso Once activated it switches on zzso pathways and switches off many zzso processes zzso zzso to preserve the energy status of the zzso In order to identify new targets of zzso action we have performed a zzso screening of a human zzso zzso zzso As a result, we have identified zzso as a novel target of zzso zzso This protein belongs to the zzso family of proteins located at the focal zzso plaques in the plasma zzso although they may also travel to the nucleus, where they have regulatory zzso We confirmed the physical interaction between the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex and zzso in zzso cells by zzso and zzso zzso We also showed that zzso was able to zzso in zzso zzso at the zzso Finally, we present evidence that zzso zzso properties of zzso were enhanced by zzso zzso
