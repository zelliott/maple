The signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso promotes alkaline zzso export to the zzso coli zzso However, high level expression of this zzso protein interferes with cell zzso Since most zzso of this toxic zzso map to zzso and zzso growth arrest results from a defective interaction of the zzso protein with the export zzso We have characterized zzso which map in zzso a newly defined gene of the export zzso All single zzso acid zzso map to three adjacent zzso These zzso zzso have a weak zzso zzso as determined by their effect on export zzso by zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso a zzso disruption zzso also zzso a weak zzso zzso it does not suppress the toxicity of the zzso zzso This difference results from a selective effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso of export zzso by the zzso signal zzso Using a zzso signal sequence zzso which has a zzso in zzso zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso zzso Most zzso map to zzso and several are zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of protein export, suggesting that there are two types of functional zzso zzso with or without zzso
