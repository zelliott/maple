An experimental procedure zzso both zzso exchange mass zzso zzso and zzso was developed to identify the zzso region of small zzso targeting the motor domain of the human zzso zzso zzso All the tested zzso decrease the zzso incorporation rate of the same peptides corresponding to the following secondary structure zzso loop zzso zzso zzso zzso and strand zzso zzso zzso zzso Replacement of these two regions by the equivalent ones from zzso zzso conventional zzso heavy chain completely zzso the modification of the zzso incorporation rate by the zzso as well as their effects on the zzso zzso zzso The six tested zzso thus share a common binding site on zzso The strategy reported here allows the regions of a protein involved in zzso binding to be rapidly zzso and can be applied to other proteins and used as a general in zzso screening procedure to identify compounds targeting specific binding zzso
