In the association of zzso zzso with their zzso zzso and zzso an important interaction is the fitting of the zzso side chain of the zzso or inhibitor into a zzso cavity of the zzso called the zzso zzso In turkey zzso third domain, which is a zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso Here we report the values of equilibrium constants, zzso for turkey zzso third domain and 13 additional zzso zzso with six zzso zzso bovine alpha zzso A, zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B, and human zzso zzso Eight of the zzso are coded zzso zzso Ala, zzso zzso Met, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five are zzso zzso Ape, zzso zzso and zzso They were chosen to simplify the zzso acid zzso In the zzso series of zzso side chains Ala, zzso Ape, zzso zzso free energy of binding decreases zzso with the zzso length for zzso with large binding pocket, but even for this zzso shows zzso For the two zzso zzso zzso a minimum appears to be reached at zzso A minimum is clearly evident for the two zzso where increasing the zzso length from zzso to zzso greatly zzso zzso but much more so for the apparently more rigid pancreatic zzso than for the more flexible zzso zzso zzso zzso is very deleterious for five of the six zzso it is only slightly deleterious for the more flexible human zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso of introduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of introduction of charge zzso and zzso are tabulated and zzso An important component of the free energy of interaction is the distortion of the binding pocket by bulky or zzso side zzso Most of the zzso studied were obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and combined with natural reduced zzso zzso zzso bridges were zzso The zzso was removed and the zzso zzso bond zzso was zzso by complex formation with zzso zzso The zzso complexes were zzso by sudden pH zzso This zzso controlled zzso afforded zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
