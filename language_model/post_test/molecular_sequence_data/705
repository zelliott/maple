The invasion of North American zzso by the zebra zzso zzso zzso has caused ecological zzso in North zzso Unfortunately, little is known about this nuisance zzso and its host defense zzso In this study, 32 expressed sequence tags zzso associated with zzso stimulation were obtained from a suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso library was produced by using a zzso library of zzso zzso as the driver and a zzso library of zzso zzso with a mixture of microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso The driver zzso was zzso from the tester to increase the relative abundance of the zzso that were induced by zzso The putative function of 27 zzso were obtained by using the zzso searching program zzso and zzso Four zzso zzso the protein product zzso to zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso were selected for a subsequent study using quantitative zzso zzso zzso with the zzso extracted from zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results of quantitative zzso with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the four candidate genes were zzso by zzso zzso The expression levels of both zzso and zzso genes between zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples are the most significant with zzso and zzso fold increases, zzso The significant changes of zzso and zzso genes were observed after zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated that this protein is zzso close to the zzso identified from other zzso This study shed light on zzso host defense mechanisms of zzso zzso
