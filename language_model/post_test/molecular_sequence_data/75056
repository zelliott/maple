zzso zzso a cells zzso an zzso zzso called zzso activity, that acts as an zzso of alpha factor, the zzso mating zzso produced by zzso alpha zzso We report here the DNA sequence of zzso the structural gene for barrier zzso The deduced primary translation product of 587 zzso acids has a putative signal zzso nine potential zzso zzso sites, and marked sequence similarity of the first two-thirds of the protein with zzso zzso zzso activity was abolished by in zzso zzso of an zzso acid predicted from this sequence zzso to be in the active zzso zzso barrier protein is probably a zzso that zzso alpha zzso The sequence similarity suggests that the first two-thirds of the barrier protein is organized into two distinct structural zzso like those of the zzso zzso However, the zzso gene product has a third zzso domain of unknown zzso deletion of at least 166 of the 191 zzso acids of this region has no significant effect on barrier zzso
