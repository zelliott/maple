zzso or zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso with various zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso binding module zzso family 1 were expressed in a zzso zzso expression system, and the resulting fusion proteins were used to examine the feasibility of large-scale affinity zzso of zzso proteins on cellulose zzso We found that zzso fused with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at up to zzso in the culture zzso which could be directly injected into the cellulose zzso The fusion protein was tightly zzso on the cellulose column in the presence of a sufficient amount of ammonium zzso and was efficiently zzso with pure zzso zzso serum zzso zzso was not captured under these conditions, whereas both zzso and the fusion protein were zzso on a zzso column, indicating that the cellulose column can be used for the zzso of not only zzso proteins but also for zzso zzso Recovery of various fusion proteins exceeded zzso Our results indicate that protein zzso by expression of a target protein as a fusion with a zzso family 1 zzso tag in a zzso expression system, followed by affinity zzso on a cellulose column, is simple, effective and easily zzso
