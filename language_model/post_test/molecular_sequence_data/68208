The zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated in zzso The former two modified bases are known DNA zzso formed by the human zzso vinyl zzso beta is formed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso Ade and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were described previously zzso zzso 26, zzso zzso zzso was inserted into an zzso zzso zzso by a mild zzso synthetic zzso which avoided exposure of the base to alkaline zzso zzso zzso coupled with reasonable efficiency zzso to the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso in a reaction zzso by T4 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Each of the three modified zzso and an unmodified control were inserted into a zzso gap positioned at a known site in the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso was placed in the DNA strand opposite that containing the single DNA zzso enabling the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso coli, each of the zzso was found to be zzso The most toxic zzso was zzso which reduced survival of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Ade reduced survival by zzso and zzso zzso An examination of the surviving zzso populations revealed that each of the three zzso was zzso The least zzso zzso was zzso Ade zzso of the survivors were zzso which showed primarily zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
