This study was undertaken to characterize the interaction of zzso zzso zzso and some of its zzso with their receptors on rat gastric zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso of gastric smooth muscle zzso zzso effects were observed in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso effect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for Gal is zzso indicating an interaction of one Gal zzso with one zzso fulfilling the criteria of classical zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso zzso are different from 1, namely zzso and zzso pointing out that the principle of interaction of one drug zzso with one zzso may not zzso The contraction induced by 300 zzso of Gal was not significantly modified by zzso to substance P zzso On the contrary the introduction of zzso to SP decreased the zzso effects of zzso and zzso by about zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings suggest that zzso actions of zzso and zzso are probably not only due to their zzso activities at Gal receptors but may result from a subsequent stimulation of receptors for SP or release of zzso zzso
