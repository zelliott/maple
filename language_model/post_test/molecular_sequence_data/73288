The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso was placed under the control of zzso zzso of promoter sequence from the zzso zzso zzso gene isolated from an zzso zzso zzso The construct was introduced into canola zzso zzso and tobacco zzso zzso zzso transcripts were followed during zzso development of transgenic plants by northern zzso The zzso of transformed plants from the zzso generation was zzso and we observed an increased branching of zzso in tobacco and canola plants expressing the zzso zzso Comparing with controls, the average number of capsules and zzso in zzso plants was zzso and zzso higher, zzso This result was correlated with an increase in zzso levels in transgenic plants, as revealed by zzso Indeed, zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso zzso seeds were found zzso higher than zzso contents of control seeds, and zzso zzso zzso zzso capsules contained zzso more zzso than control zzso In zzso the average seed weight per capsule was lower in zzso plants while the seed number per zzso and the average seed weight were not modified in canola carrying this zzso The average seed yield per plant was not significantly increased in zzso tobacco or canola zzso
