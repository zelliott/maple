zzso zzso zzso contain several regions within their zzso zzso that are highly zzso However, within some of these zzso regions are several zzso that may be used to define different classes of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso One class can be defined by the zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso and zzso while the corresponding positions within the zzso zzso zzso which defines a second class of zzso contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of these differences within otherwise highly zzso regions of this family suggests that these zzso may be critical for the specificity of zzso function or zzso zzso we have constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in which these zzso zzso have been changed to other zzso acid zzso including zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies showed that zzso which lies near the active site zzso is essential for zzso zzso The addition of a second zzso in zzso which now zzso both the zzso and zzso changes, restored partial function to the zzso zzso Moreover, the deletion of zzso 103 to 114 within zzso which are not present in the zzso zzso allowed the zzso zzso to function as efficiently as zzso zzso zzso Finally, the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso of zzso indicated that zzso is also unique to the zzso class of zzso zzso and that zzso at this position can be zzso to zzso zzso Our results suggest that several key zzso within zzso regions of the zzso zzso family genetically interact with each other and define a class of zzso zzso zzso
