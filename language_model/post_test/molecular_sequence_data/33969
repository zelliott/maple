The zzso complex has been implicated as a possible component of zzso zzso zzso zzso quality control, although the zzso of its exact role is zzso zzso a putative zzso resident zzso plays a zzso role in generating a signal that targets zzso zzso zzso for zzso degradation zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso human zzso predominantly resides in the zzso complex, where it is subjected to zzso To distinguish the zzso site where the zzso zzso signal is generated, a zzso motif was appended to the N zzso of the zzso protein to facilitate its retrograde zzso back to the zzso zzso zzso of the modified zzso was observed along with an accelerated rate at which zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso NHK were zzso Despite these zzso the rate of NHK degradation was not accelerated, implicating the zzso complex as the site for zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide a potential zzso explanation for the spatial separation by which zzso quality control components operate in zzso zzso
