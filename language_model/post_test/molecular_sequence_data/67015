An zzso zzso acid sequence of a previously reported honey bee zzso zzso 110 zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as reference to identify the predicted zzso sequence in a public zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed an zzso of zzso zzso that encompasses eight zzso The conceptual translation product is a zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which contains the zzso M and C zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso with specific zzso allowed for an analysis of zzso levels during worker bee development and under different zzso zzso zzso the abundance of the respective zzso in the zzso was examined by zzso zzso 110 transcripts were found in high levels during the zzso zzso then decreased gradually during the zzso stage, and increased again in zzso zzso 110 zzso were highly abundant in zzso zzso decreased at the zzso and remained at low levels in zzso and zzso In 5th zzso larvae, neither zzso nor supplementation of zzso food with royal jelly changed the zzso 110 transcript levels or the amounts of zzso 110 zzso in zzso In adult workers, high levels of zzso 110 zzso but not of the respective zzso were related to zzso zzso and also to the consumption of a zzso zzso
