The circular zzso zzso spectrum of the Rev protein from zzso indicates that Rev contains about 50% alpha zzso and zzso beta sheet at 5 degrees C in zzso zzso zzso pH 3, and 300 zzso zzso The spectrum is independent of protein concentration over a zzso zzso At neutral zzso Rev is relatively zzso but can be brought into solution by binding to its specific zzso binding site, the zzso element zzso at a zzso ratio of about zzso zzso binding to zzso does not zzso zzso As judged by difference CD zzso the zzso of Rev when bound to the zzso at neutral pH is similar to the zzso of zzso Rev at pH 3, although changes in the zzso may also contribute to the difference zzso Indeed, some difference is observed near 260 zzso consistent with a zzso change of the zzso upon Rev zzso Rev alone at pH 3 shows irreversible zzso as the temperature is raised, while Rev bound to the zzso at neutral pH shows a zzso transition with a zzso of 68 degrees zzso
