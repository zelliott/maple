zzso distribution, gene flow, and population genetic structure of the zzso shell zzso zzso were studied using a partial sequence of a zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis of 100 specimens obtained from a total of seven zzso in Korea, one in China, and one in zzso revealed 29 zzso ranging in sequence divergence from zzso to zzso Among these, the most frequent zzso zzso was extensively distributed over study areas, especially in all Korean zzso This extensive distribution consequently resulted in the near absence of statistically significant genetic zzso Also, a high rate of gene flow was characteristic among localities in zzso A test of genetic population structure showed that the zzso shell in Korea formed a large genetic zzso Moreover, an zzso test to determine the allocation of the genetic zzso showed that most of the zzso was distributed between zzso instead of within zzso However, a significant population differentiation was found between geographic populations zzso zzso zzso 6) in Korea and zzso zzso 5) in China and zzso zzso 7) in zzso based on geographic distance and population zzso These distinct groups may be associated with geographic characteristics and zzso The results suggest that most of the zzso shell populations in Korea caused considerable distribution to form a genetically homogeneous and zzso structure, whereas some of the Korean and Chinese and Russian populations had a significantly different genetic zzso
