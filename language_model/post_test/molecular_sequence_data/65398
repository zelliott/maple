Cellular zzso acid binding protein zzso is a small zzso zzso acid binding protein made of seven zzso zzso and an zzso rich zzso zzso is zzso zzso among zzso and was reported to play zzso functions in zzso cells zzso Neither its biological function nor its mechanisms of action were zzso zzso The main goal of this work was to gain further insights into the zzso zzso and molecular zzso We studied zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso acid zzso representing the main reported zzso putative zzso We report that, although zzso is able to bind zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso it binds zzso as a zzso zzso whereas both zzso and zzso are able to bind to zzso A systematic analysis of zzso zzso shows that the preferred zzso targets contain zzso zzso zzso These data expand the knowledge about zzso binding zzso and begins to dissect the main features of zzso zzso acid zzso Besides, we show that zzso presents a highly zzso predicted structure and promotes the zzso and melting of zzso acids in zzso These features are typical of proteins that function as zzso acid zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso may function as a zzso acid zzso through zzso zzso and stabilizing zzso acids secondary zzso This novel zzso zzso activity zzso the field of study about its biological function and may be the basis to understand the diverse ways in which zzso controls gene zzso
