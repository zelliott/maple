zzso zzso which specifically zzso zzso zzso in zzso DNA, was zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso to apparent zzso with zzso overall zzso The zzso consists of a single protein chain with zzso molecular zzso zzso activity was found at pH zzso and zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a marked zzso spectrum with a main band in the blue region zzso zzso zzso a protein band zzso zzso zzso and a low intensity band above 500 zzso The zzso extinction zzso of native zzso was estimated zzso at zzso zzso The action spectrum for zzso shows zzso activity at 440 zzso and zzso closely with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains two different intrinsic zzso in zzso zzso which were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The low intensity zzso band of native zzso zzso exhibits a shoulder at zzso and zzso at 588 and zzso zzso This band is attributed to a neutral zzso zzso radical which accounts for the major part of the zzso present in dark zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso the zzso spectrum due to formation of fully reduced zzso but exposure to air in the dark restores the spectrum zzso On zzso at zzso zzso the disappearance of zzso zzso is more zzso indicating that the zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso and possibly also the reduced zzso zzso appear to act as a primary zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
