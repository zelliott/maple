The zzso zzso gene is reported to consist of 15 zzso that zzso a single zzso zzso referred to as zzso and zzso We now demonstrate that zzso the zzso gene contains two additional coding zzso downstream of zzso 1, zzso zzso involves the use of multiple zzso and zzso the zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso As a result, three zzso are expressed that zzso three putative protein zzso that differ at their zzso zzso zzso transcripts are induced in zzso in multiple zzso in response to the liver X zzso zzso zzso Identification and characterization of four liver X zzso response elements in the zzso downstream of zzso 2 provides a mechanism by which this induction zzso zzso cholesterol zzso to high density zzso was zzso following zzso of zzso cells with plasmids zzso individual zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies in embryonic day zzso mouse zzso revealed strong expression of zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso hind brain, eye, and zzso root zzso The relatively high levels of expression in zzso zzso and the eye suggest that zzso cholesterol zzso may be critical for normal zzso function in addition to its role in zzso
