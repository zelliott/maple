zzso protein A zzso is a zzso zzso factor from the zzso zzso zzso Because of their small size and zzso zzso activities, zzso of protein A are targets for protein engineering efforts and for the development of zzso approaches for de zzso protein zzso The zzso solution structure of an engineered zzso domain of zzso the Z domain (an analog of the B domain of zzso has been determined by simulated zzso with restrained molecular dynamics on the basis of zzso zzso zzso The Z domain contains three zzso zzso corresponding to zzso segments zzso to zzso zzso 1), zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso A family of ten zzso representing the solution structure of the Z domain was zzso by simulated zzso of restrained molecular dynamics using the program zzso The average of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso relative to the mean zzso for the backbone atoms zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso through zzso is zzso zzso the corresponding backbone zzso for the zzso core is zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 are zzso in orientation zzso degrees , zzso degrees , zzso degrees zzso A comparison of backbone zzso zzso exchange rates in free and zzso Z zzso demonstrates that the zzso zzso of zzso 1, 2 and 3 are protected from rapid exchange in both states, indicating that all three zzso are also intact in the zzso zzso These solution zzso results differ from the previously determined X-ray structure of the similar zzso B domain in complex with the zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso where zzso 3 is not observed in the electron density map and from the solution zzso structure of the B domain, where zzso 3 is observed but zzso 1 is zzso by approximately 30 degrees with respect to zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation is observed for all three zzso of the Z zzso these capping interactions appear to be highly zzso in the five zzso zzso of zzso
