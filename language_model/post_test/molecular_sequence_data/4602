zzso driven and systematic zzso relationship zzso investigations have resulted in the development of effective central nervous system zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso of our zzso standard zzso On the other hand, equally potent zzso zzso that block the zzso zzso axis had not been described until zzso zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that zzso and its family members zzso and zzso assume an zzso zzso when interacting with zzso zzso To further test this hypothesis, we have systematically scanned the zzso or zzso sequences with an zzso + 3) bridge consisting of the zzso scaffold which we and others had shown could maintain or enhance zzso zzso From this series we have identified seven zzso that are either zzso to, or 3 times more potent than, the zzso zzso in addition, as presented earlier zzso zzso zzso is 32 times more potent than the zzso standard in blocking zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell culture zzso In zzso zzso is also significantly more potent than earlier zzso at reducing zzso zzso zzso in intact stressed or zzso zzso Since the corresponding linear zzso that were tested are significantly less zzso our interpretation of the increased potency of the zzso zzso is that the introduction of the side chain to side chain bridging element zzso and to a lesser extent that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso environment a putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso that is not otherwise heavily zzso The effect of the introduction of two favored zzso zzso and zzso yielded 37 with a potency 8 times that of the zzso standard but actually 12 times less than expected if the effect of the two cycles had been zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso can discriminate between slightly different identifiable zzso dramatically illustrating the role that secondary and zzso structures play in modulating biological signaling through specific zzso zzso
