The synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso acid solution and in the gel phase has been studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso form zzso gels over a broad composition range by lowering the zzso The value of the zzso temperature depends on the composition of the mixture, with low values for zzso with low zzso zzso For zzso gels, a power law can describe the frequency dependence of the complex zzso with power law zzso close to zzso The gel evolution of zzso zzso upon a temperature zzso below the gel point has been zzso Evidence is provided for a relation between zzso and phase separation in the process of zzso zzso of zzso zzso A simple model is proposed to zzso the zzso process in these zzso
