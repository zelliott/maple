In this study, we have isolated a bovine zzso zzso of lethal giant larvae zzso tumor zzso zzso from bovine brain by zzso using zzso designed based on the zzso sequences for zzso family zzso The sequence analysis showed that the zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with the molecular weight of approximately 112 zzso containing a domain characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed a zzso of zzso and zzso identity to that of mouse and human, zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso was highly expressed in brain, zzso and zzso with moderate expression in liver, zzso lung and zzso This suggests that the zzso may play essential roles in each of these zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the bovine zzso partially restored the zzso tolerance in the absence of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a bovine zzso of the zzso zzso
