zzso flowering is a major factor determining crop performance and is controlled by interactions between environmental signals and the zzso zzso We proposed zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso as a candidate underlying the early maturity 10 zzso locus in barley zzso zzso zzso The link between zzso and zzso was discovered using zzso sequencing of enriched libraries and segregation zzso We conducted functional, zzso and diversity studies of zzso and zzso to understand the genetic control of zzso response in barley and to characterize the evolution of zzso genes within barley and across zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso causes zzso defects and interacts with the zzso response gene zzso to accelerate flowering under long and short zzso The results of zzso and diversity analyses indicate that zzso was under zzso selection, duplicated at the base of the grass zzso and zzso independently of zzso genes in other plant zzso Taken together, these findings contribute to improved understanding of the barley zzso clock, its interaction with the zzso pathway, and evolution of zzso systems in barley and across zzso and zzso
