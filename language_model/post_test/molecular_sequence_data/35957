The genetic analysis of zzso patterning in zzso has identified a zzso zzso zzso that is required for zzso zzso The cloning and zzso protection analysis of a zzso zzso of this gene has suggested a possible role in the zzso of zzso Here, we describe the cloning of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso studies of its zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals substantial conservation of the second to fifth zinc fingers, but not of the first zinc finger in the zzso zzso zzso occurs in the zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic and zzso zzso in neural crest and in condensing zzso Based on the timing and spatial restriction of expression in embryonic zzso we suggest that zzso might be required for the early development of this zzso as is the case for its zzso zzso In addition, we propose that zzso might have an analogous role in the development of neural zzso The expression in condensing zzso indicates that this gene also has a later function in zzso
