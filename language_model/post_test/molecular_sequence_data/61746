The zzso zzso system in sunflower zzso zzso zzso zzso is distinguished by the coexistence of two different zzso zzso zzso I and zzso So far, this phenomenon has only been described for zzso from sunflower zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso only, while zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a more broad zzso specificity towards zzso zzso of different chain zzso Here, we report on the cloning of zzso II from sunflower zzso The known DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to generate zzso for cloning the corresponding zzso from sunflower zzso zzso was then used to generate an internal zzso of the sunflower zzso gene and the zzso were isolated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso was generated using zzso with sunflower zzso zzso zzso the coding zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso sharing at least zzso identity with other plant zzso at the zzso acid zzso The zzso sunflower zzso II was expressed in a bacterial system in an active form and zzso to apparent zzso in a single step using zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso and had a specific activity of 235 zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso column resulted in an zzso yield of active zzso to be used for further zzso
