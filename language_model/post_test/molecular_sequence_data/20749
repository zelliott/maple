We isolated a new strain of zzso zzso zzso from the stems of Chinese parsley zzso zzso zzso and it is tentatively identified as zzso zzso according to analysis of the entire zzso zzso profiles using zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso An array of evidence established that many zzso bacteria employ zzso sensing zzso system to regulate gene expression in response to cell density using small zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and control diverse zzso traits in zzso zzso In this study, we showed that zzso zzso strain zzso can produce several types of zzso at a zzso level using Thin zzso zzso (TLC) analysis combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso value zzso is the major signal zzso Furthermore, we have identified its zzso sensing system composed of zzso and zzso by cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso is responsible for synthesis of zzso signal zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso Finally, we zzso expressed the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso and verified it using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis using zzso revealed highly similarities exist among the zzso zzso suggesting it is evolutionary well zzso in the zzso zzso
