The zzso protein is a zzso zzso It binds to the promoter region of zzso and zzso To understand the molecular mechanism for the interaction between zzso and its binding zzso the functional zzso of zzso were zzso The zzso zzso method and the zzso expression system were used to study the zzso interaction of zzso The results of these experiments showed that zzso forms zzso zzso of the last 44 zzso acid zzso at its C zzso but not the first 12 or 57 zzso at the N zzso abolished the ability of zzso to form zzso indicating that the zzso interaction domain of zzso is located at its C zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that deletion of the last 29 zzso acid zzso at its C zzso had no effect on the DNA binding ability of zzso In contrast, deletion of the first zzso 12 zzso abolished the DNA binding capability of zzso These results indicate that the DNA binding domain of zzso is located at its N zzso
