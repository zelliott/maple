A novel fusion zzso was constructed by replacing signal zzso zzso of chicken zzso zzso with SP of chicken zzso zzso The fusion zzso zzso was cloned into the expression zzso zzso to generate zzso An animal experiment was carried out to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso on DNA vaccine zzso against zzso zzso zzso The zzso profiles of zzso and zzso in zzso were characterized by means of real-time zzso The zzso positive zzso expression zzso zzso were constructed zzso The protective effects provided by zzso with 100 zzso zzso and 50 zzso zzso measured by relative body weight gain zzso average zzso score in zzso and zzso decrease ratio, showed no significant difference with 50 zzso zzso as an zzso on day 6 post infection zzso However, chickens zzso with zzso and zzso exhibited significant zzso level of zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso Our original data suggests the constructed novel zzso zzso could be a potential zzso used to enhance the immune protective effects, although the zzso dosage need to be explored zzso
