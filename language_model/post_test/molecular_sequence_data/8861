In a microbial fuel cell zzso zzso which transfer electrons to the zzso have been regarded as a key factor for electricity zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso methods were used to isolate zzso from the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso were identified depending on isolation methods, despite the use of an identical zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that certain zzso became dominant in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was similar to zzso zzso belonging to the zzso which was shown to be able to function as an zzso in a previous zzso Three zzso one affiliated with zzso zzso and two with zzso zzso were identified using the zzso method, which belonged to the zzso bacteria, the zzso The zzso zzso were zzso with the three zzso using the zzso method, operated in the batch mode and the current was zzso All of the zzso zzso zzso with each isolate after isolation from plates produced lower current zzso current zzso zzso zzso than those in zzso zzso with mixed culture zzso zzso Although the zzso produced low zzso various bacterial groups were found to be involved in current zzso
