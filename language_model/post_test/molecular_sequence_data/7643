zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the insulin zzso zzso and the IGF-1 zzso zzso was investigated using the zzso system by assessing for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The experiments were performed with the zzso beta domain zzso type or zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso or its zzso (N + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso The results of zzso zzso indicated that zzso N + zzso and zzso interact with both zzso beta and zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso + zzso interact only with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso beta zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso 43 zzso acids (including the zzso zzso were deleted, zzso The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating zzso for zzso or zzso for zzso zzso of zzso upon interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso was zzso less as compared to zzso zzso This zzso with zzso and zzso beta was zzso less as compared to zzso beta and was somewhat increased zzso for zzso beta zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain in zzso appears to exert a negative control on binding of zzso thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
