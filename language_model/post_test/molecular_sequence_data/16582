A cellular signal zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso and transmitted by zzso dysfunction is proposed in zzso In this investigation, we further resolve the zzso by identifying a subset of hypersensitive response zzso marker genes as downstream zzso In a previous report, we identified zzso 1 zzso and two closely related genes as responsive to zzso Other zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso zzso of these zzso marker zzso including zzso by zzso was suppressed by zzso with zzso calcium channel blockers, inhibitor of zzso zzso transition pore openings, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Such zzso is also observed for zzso zzso of two zzso protein zzso zzso salicylic zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that all these components are part of the same signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso studies on zzso cascade members reveal that the expression of zzso zzso marker genes varies with respect to involvement of zzso zzso
