Like zzso zzso is an important survival factor for many zzso its expression contributing to zzso and disease zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso zzso zzso stability is acutely zzso For example, the zzso zzso 3 zzso protein zzso which zzso binds to zzso also targets it for zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the discovery and characterization of a novel zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso which is highly selective for zzso Unlike zzso zzso is unable to trigger zzso degradation, yet, like zzso zzso promotes cell killing only when zzso is absent or zzso Furthermore, killing by zzso zzso is not associated with zzso zzso Thus, functional zzso of zzso does not always require its zzso Rather, it can be efficiently antagonized by a zzso zzso tightly engaging its binding groove, which is confirmed here with a structural zzso Our data have important implications for the discovery of compounds that might kill cells whose survival depends on zzso
