Recently we divided zzso zzso zzso strains into group 1, having seven zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and group 2, having three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, partial zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso from group 2 was zzso and compared with that of zzso from group zzso zzso showed a large deletion upstream of zzso with more than half of the zzso zzso gene cluster missing including zzso a positive zzso regulatory zzso zzso to the deletion of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso has a unique sequence of about 8 zzso and a zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso zzso strains with four kinds of probe derived from the unique sequence of zzso showed that all group 2 strains have identical zzso zzso zzso chain reaction with specific primer set designed to amplify the junction between zzso and the unique sequence of zzso resulted in the same size of DNA zzso only from group 2 zzso Based on these results, we developed a useful genetic tool that zzso zzso zzso group 2 strains from the other groups' strains and propose that it might have differentiated from the ancestral strains due to zzso zzso
