The master zzso response regulator functions in zzso to repress replication initiation in different zzso of the cell zzso Here, we identify an essential zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso zzso by zzso Although zzso is present throughout the cell cycle, it moves to a cell pole in S phase, and upon cell division it zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso results in loss of polar zzso and cell zzso We propose that polar zzso functions to activate zzso just after the initiation of DNA zzso thereby preventing premature zzso of zzso zzso Thus, dynamic changes in cellular location of critical signal proteins provide a novel mechanism for the control of the zzso cell zzso
