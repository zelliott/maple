A zzso containing coding information for zzso I, the zzso stomach zzso zzso was identified by zzso The cloned zzso zzso a protein of 129 zzso acids whose zzso zzso was identical to zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the cloned zzso revealed that it had over zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso Both Northern and Southern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso and zzso I were zzso by the same zzso A specific zzso responsible for the generation of zzso I from zzso zzso was found to be present in the crude extracts of the zzso zzso These results suggest that there exists a specific regulation mechanism which converts the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
