A single zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample taken in zzso zzso The isolate showed zzso and zzso typical of the zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso in length and zzso zzso in diameter, with a wavelength of zzso zzso and an zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso strain zzso grew in zzso medium at 13, 30 and 37 degrees C, and also in the presence of zzso zzso strain zzso produced zzso towards several members of the zzso zzso but was found to be zzso unique by zzso zzso test and thus represented a novel zzso The proposed name for this zzso is zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences placed this novel strain within the radiation of the zzso zzso with sequence similarities within the range zzso with respect to recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso against the three most closely related zzso species was used to confirm the results of the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso content of the zzso of strain zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
