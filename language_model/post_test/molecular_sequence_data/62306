The class II zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange of peptides bound to class II zzso zzso and is an important component of the zzso presentation zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso is largely zzso zzso zzso exchange of peptides of varying zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso component of the zzso interaction could be involved in the zzso zzso Twelve zzso hydrogen bonds between the zzso backbone and the zzso are a prominent zzso feature of the zzso zzso To evaluate the relative importance of these hydrogen bonds toward zzso action, we prepared zzso zzso that lacked the ability to form one or more of the hydrogen bonds as a result of backbone zzso zzso or zzso and tested their ability to be exchanged by zzso We found that disruption of hydrogen bonds involving zzso zzso zzso a short extended segment at the N zzso of the alpha zzso zzso region, led to heightened zzso zzso zzso We propose that those bonds are disrupted in the zzso zzso recognized by zzso to allow structural transitions in that area during zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that peptides or compounds that bind zzso but cannot form these interactions would be zzso edited out by zzso
