The human zzso B zzso neutralize zzso or zzso zzso and reside predominantly within the zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the 13 human zzso B zzso map to either zzso zzso zzso 3) or zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the mouse zzso B zzso map to zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso The mouse zzso B cluster at zzso shows a marked expansion in the number of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar expansion occurred at zzso Using zzso zzso comparative zzso DNA sequence analysis, and zzso zzso we found that the mouse zzso B cluster at zzso showed nearly complete conservation of gene number, order, and orientation relative to those of zzso The only exception was the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso locus contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the mouse locus contains four zzso and three zzso Based on zzso analysis and predicted zzso acid zzso amplification of the mouse zzso locus occurred after zzso and primates zzso and was associated with some diversification of zzso zzso activity relative to that of zzso
