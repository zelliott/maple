zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein zzso that zzso several zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso activity have been poorly zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso is required for its zzso and nuclear zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is activated through zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso at zzso which zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso rendering zzso defective in both nuclear zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the external addition of nerve growth factor, which has been previously identified as an zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were found to be essential for induction of zzso cellular processes by zzso The present findings suggest that zzso is an initial key event required for the functional zzso of zzso
