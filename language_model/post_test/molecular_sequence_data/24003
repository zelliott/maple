zzso 273 zzso of the human zzso gene is a zzso hot spot for the environmental zzso zzso We incorporated a single zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso at the second position of zzso 273 of the human zzso gene and explored the zzso potential of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso or zzso were incorporated into zzso shuttle zzso and zzso into zzso kidney zzso zzso plasmids were then used to transform zzso coli zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and DNA sequence analysis to establish the zzso frequency and spectrum produced by the zzso zzso We determined the zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso to be zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated by both zzso were G zzso T zzso with some G zzso A zzso When the zzso zzso to zzso was replaced by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were reduced to zzso and zzso respectively, while the zzso specificity remained zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso at zzso 273 in zzso may reflect either zzso zzso of zzso and/or inefficient repair of zzso zzso positioned at this zzso
