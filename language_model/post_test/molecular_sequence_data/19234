Human zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with a modular zzso that includes 43 zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso arranged as multiple tandem repeats zzso with transforming growth factor beta binding zzso zzso zzso We have studied zzso zzso zzso which affect calcium binding to zzso and demonstrate that in human zzso cells they cause unexpected zzso zzso zzso indicative of a folding zzso zzso and zzso studies of in zzso zzso fragments from the zzso region indicate long-range and zzso effects of these zzso on the adjacent zzso domain zzso In contrast, only short-range effects of a zzso zzso affecting calcium binding to zzso are observed, and zzso of this zzso protein zzso Further zzso studies on zzso zzso and zzso identify a zzso dependence of domain folding where calcium binding to zzso is required before zzso can adopt a native zzso zzso These data demonstrate that during zzso of zzso multiple tandem repeats of zzso zzso may not necessarily fold independently and therefore zzso zzso resulting in identical zzso may have different effects on the fate of the zzso zzso Complex folding of modular proteins should therefore be considered when interpreting the molecular pathology of zzso zzso
