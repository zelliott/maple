We have characterized a new zzso of the zzso 15 gene zzso that arose as a spontaneous, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso strain at Jackson zzso Analysis revealed an zzso deletion in zzso which is predicted to result in partial deletion of zzso domain zzso 9) in zzso zzso study revealed normal to moderately defective cochlear hair cell zzso in zzso zzso at zzso day 2 zzso zzso abnormalities were consistently present at zzso and zzso zzso changes including loss of inner and outer hair cells were seen at zzso with severe sensory cell loss in all cochlear turns occurring by zzso The hair cell zzso observed in the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is the least severe zzso yet observed in zzso zzso However, young zzso mice are unresponsive to auditory stimulation and show circling behavior indicative of zzso zzso Since these animals show severe functional deficits but have relatively mild zzso defects at a young age they may provide an appropriate model to test for a direct role of zzso in zzso
