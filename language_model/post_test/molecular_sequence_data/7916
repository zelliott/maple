A zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso by a combination of zzso amplification, using zzso based on internal zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso and zzso library screening by zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the rat zzso showed significant zzso to the known zzso zzso zzso from zzso and plant zzso zzso and still retained zzso identity to two bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso Like other zzso the rat zzso is rich in aromatic zzso acids and contains five so-called zzso zzso highly zzso regions with a repetitive zzso turn zzso The binding site sequence for the zzso zzso a zzso irreversible inhibitor specific for the zzso zzso is zzso in all known zzso The zzso plot revealed a rather zzso zzso region and the absence of a zzso signal zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso showed no clearly delineated zzso zzso A full-length zzso was constructed and zzso into a zzso zzso selected in zzso coli cells, and used to transform the zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso The zzso rat zzso expressed was efficiently labeled by the zzso inhibitor zzso
