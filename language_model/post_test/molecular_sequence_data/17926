In light of recent work implicating zzso from human zzso as a possible regulator of both zzso dynamics and zzso zzso zzso we have further characterized the interaction of zzso zzso and the two zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso from human zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso with relatively high affinity zzso approximately 1 zzso for zzso by equilibrium gel zzso but interacts only zzso (if at all) with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The two zzso of zzso zzso both have a lower affinity for zzso than does human zzso zzso but the more basic zzso zzso from zzso zzso has a much higher zzso zzso zzso affinity than the zzso zzso zzso 100 to zzso zzso None of the zzso bind to zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The differences in affinity for zzso parallel the ability of these three zzso to inhibit zzso zzso by soluble zzso C zzso The results show that the interaction of zzso with zzso is specific with respect to both the zzso and the zzso In zzso the two zzso of zzso may have specialized functions on the basis of their identical zzso 10 zzso affinities for zzso zzso and different affinities for zzso
