To characterize the binding specificity and zzso and zzso variable region usage in zzso human zzso zzso to zzso zzso we constructed zzso from peripheral blood B cells of three zzso arthritis zzso zzso From a panel of more than 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso chain first zzso determining segments zzso we characterized two zzso molecules from a single patient in zzso These bound to both zzso zzso zzso and intact zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso surface zzso zzso analysis using zzso mimicking a set of 24 zzso genes indicated that one zzso bound only a few members of the set, whereas the second showed considerable zzso zzso by binding to more than half of the tested zzso zzso Both zzso used zzso of a zzso gene that were very similar to one another and to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso used a zzso gene identical to a zzso prototype, while the other incorporated a zzso sequence differing in only a single zzso from its zzso zzso The zzso of both were large and distinct from each other as well as from the corresponding segments of zzso factors and zzso zzso using the same or related zzso zzso zzso These zzso offer models for deciphering the basis of zzso zzso and serve as candidates for direct use in zzso because they are of intrinsic human origin and do not require molecular engineering to adapt them for use in zzso
