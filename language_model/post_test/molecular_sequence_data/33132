zzso proteins are integral to formation and function of a zzso zzso zzso apparatus that directs zzso segregation and precedes cell zzso zzso to the mechanism of zzso assembly and stability are balanced zzso promoting and zzso opposing zzso zzso zzso roles in zzso in zzso have not been zzso but are suggested by zzso pole interactions that affect establishment and by zzso zzso and sliding that maintain zzso and zzso zzso zzso roles also imply specialized functional zzso By zzso analysis of compatible mechanisms in establishing zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso human zzso zzso functionally replaces zzso zzso zzso and its action is similarly blocked by zzso in a zzso binding site on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to bundled zzso zzso in zzso zzso and does not replace zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso assembly and zzso progression defined critical zzso The Tail of zzso contains functional elements enabling its role in zzso assembly that are distinct from but zzso to zzso whereas zzso function zzso both Tail and zzso zzso Our analysis is the first to demonstrate distinct mechanisms between zzso and zzso and reveal that zzso shares functional overlap in zzso pole zzso
