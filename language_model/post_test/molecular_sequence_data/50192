Using a zzso zzso approach we have identified a zzso zzso expressed in 13 of 14 zzso zzso cell lines, but not in any zzso or zzso cell zzso It expresses zzso and zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso acid protein containing two highly zzso zzso zzso a novel, moderately zzso 20 zzso acid sequence that is repeated zzso zzso zzso comparison identifies an additional 43 zzso acid domain that is zzso to a repeated sequence found in the members of the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in zzso but in no other zzso zzso including plasma cells induced by zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cell hybrids derived from zzso and zzso or zzso lines have a zzso or zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso genes zzso zzso the expression of which is extinguished in these hybrids, zzso zzso appears to be zzso turned on in these zzso Since zzso is not expressed in normal plasma cells, it appears that its expression is a cause or consequence of the zzso process that generates zzso zzso
