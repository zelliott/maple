Previous deletion studies established that the zzso region of zzso is important for zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to generate 47 different zzso in this region of human zzso zzso and evaluated zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso stood out as zzso intolerant sites, while neighboring polar zzso were comparatively zzso A series of synthetic zzso zzso was designed to test these zzso zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso zzso cells zzso constant zzso approximately 5 zzso was dramatically reduced by the substitution of either zzso or zzso with zzso zzso approximately 20,000 and 8,000 zzso zzso The zzso substitution also sharply reduced affinity zzso approximately 200 zzso In contrast, the nearby zzso change of zzso had no effect on binding affinity zzso approximately 5 zzso Similar effects were observed in the zzso kidney cell zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso kidney cells zzso approximately 10 zzso was abolished by zzso zzso at position 24, 28, or zzso the zzso change was without zzso These results suggest that the adverse effects of the zzso zzso on zzso binding are not due purely to the disruption of zzso interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso do not affect local zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso contribute important zzso interactions and are consistent with the hypothesis that an zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso is involved in zzso zzso
