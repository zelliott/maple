The zzso family of zzso DNA zzso was initially thought to be limited to zzso cells, but zzso sequencing efforts have revealed the presence of zzso proteins in certain zzso species as zzso Here, we report the first molecular characterization of a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the protein was zzso to zzso As expected, zzso zzso zzso was found to be a DNA zzso which releases zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso However, kinetic analysis showed that zzso removed zzso much faster than human zzso with a zzso higher value for zzso whereas the rate of zzso of 1, zzso was found to be zzso In contrast, it was found that zzso removes zzso and zzso approximately zzso times more slowly than human zzso and there was hardly any zzso zzso of zzso It thus appears that zzso has a minor role in the repair of DNA zzso damage and an important role in preventing the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
