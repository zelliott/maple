We have developed a method for structure refinement based on molecular dynamics in four spatial dimensions zzso The method was applied with success to the structure refinement of zzso A zzso and the zzso zzso zzso using zzso distance restraints derived from zzso data, two cases where conventional MD refinement methods zzso In the case of zzso we were able to refine seven out of nine substantially different structures, while conventional MD only zzso three zzso Previously, it had appeared to be impossible to refine a given zzso structure with conventional MD methods, manual modifications were necessary in order to zzso all the distance zzso In this study we show that zzso can be refined without manual interference and using only zzso steps (10 zzso of zzso The latter result is particularly interesting because it indicates that this method may be a very useful tool when zzso zzso in zzso
