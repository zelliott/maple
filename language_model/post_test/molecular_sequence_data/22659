zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso is a zzso regulator of complement zzso being comprised of 15 or 16 short complement repeat zzso zzso A zzso zzso human zzso zzso 1-2 domain pair was engineered with the zzso zzso of a mouse zzso zzso to create a zzso zzso containing the major zzso binding zzso Such a zzso has therapeutic potential as a complement inhibitor or immune zzso X-ray and zzso scattering and zzso zzso identified its domain structure in solution, and provided a comparison with controversial zzso crystal structures for zzso zzso zzso zzso The radius of zzso zzso of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso by X-ray and zzso zzso zzso The maximum dimension of zzso was determined to be 17 zzso The molecular mass of zzso ranged between 101,000 Da and zzso Da as determined by zzso scattering and zzso zzso in good agreement with the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complete models for zzso were constructed from crystal structures for the zzso zzso 1-2 and mouse zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were joined by zzso zzso zzso The analysis of 35,000 possible zzso models showed that only those models in which the two zzso zzso were arranged in an open zzso in random zzso about the zzso zzso accounted for the scattering and zzso zzso It was not possible to define one single zzso family of zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso This flexibility is attributed to the relatively long zzso sequence and the absence of the zzso light chain from zzso The zzso also confirmed that the structure of zzso zzso 1-2 is more extended in solution than in its crystal zzso
