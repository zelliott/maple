The zzso are enigmatic crustaceans from zzso cave systems, first described only 30 years ago, whose zzso affinities are as yet zzso Here we report the sequence of zzso from zzso zzso zzso 1987 zzso zzso This is the first proof of the presence of this type of respiratory protein in a zzso zzso other than zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of multiple distinct (at least three) zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the sequences are most similar to zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate with the type 1 zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso associates with the type 2 zzso of zzso Together, zzso and zzso zzso are in the zzso position to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso provide no indication of a close relationship of zzso and zzso but support zzso zzso + zzso Our results also suggest that zzso are zzso and that zzso may have evolved from a zzso zzso Thus, zzso occupy a key position for the understanding of the evolution of zzso which are and have been one of the world's most zzso lineage of zzso
