Two previously zzso zzso were identified in a variety of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso using methods for sequence profile zzso A small domain consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso was detected in the zzso protein zzso two families of zzso zzso a novel family of predicted zzso zzso a zzso protein containing a zzso zzso and a zzso domain, bacterial zzso zzso and a number of zzso small proteins that may be involved in translation zzso Another novel domain, designated zzso domain, after zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a family of predicted zzso that may be involved in zzso zzso a family of predicted zzso and bacterial zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso domain was detected in a family of zzso proteins that also contain a domain zzso to the translation initiation factor zzso these proteins may comprise a novel type of translation zzso zzso the zzso domain was detected also in bacterial and zzso zzso zzso this is compatible with the demonstrated role of these zzso in the regulation of the expression of other zzso We propose that the zzso domain and the zzso domain bind zzso molecules with complex folded structures, adding to the growing collection of zzso zzso zzso associated with DNA and zzso modification zzso The evolution of the translation machinery components containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso must have included several events of lateral gene transfer and gene loss as well as zzso domain zzso
