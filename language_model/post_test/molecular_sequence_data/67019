The cattle zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso genes zzso members of the zzso Class I zzso that have zzso to the human zzso zzso Human zzso and zzso interact with the zzso zzso to activate zzso cells in the immune zzso The human zzso zzso protein is known to disrupt the zzso interaction, thereby zzso natural killer zzso zzso Previous Southern zzso experiments identified evidence of increased zzso copy number within the zzso of zzso zzso On the basis of these observations we hypothesized that the cattle zzso evolved by zzso and sequence divergence to produce a sufficient number and diversity of zzso molecules to deliver an immune zzso signal in the presence of zzso zzso Given the importance of the zzso in zzso immunity in other species, our goal was to determine the copy number and zzso organization of the zzso genes in the cattle zzso 

zzso of cattle bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso resulted in the identification of 30 cattle zzso zzso existing in two gene zzso Evidence of extensive zzso zzso and approximately 14 zzso of novel repetitive sequences were identified within the major zzso Ten zzso are predicted to be expressed at the cell zzso zzso analysis revealed 11 zzso directed zzso in the predicted zzso zzso that show evidence of positive zzso zzso These positively selected zzso have only one zzso that zzso with those proposed to interact with zzso thus suggesting the interaction with molecules other than zzso 

The zzso zzso in the cattle zzso apparently arose by gene zzso and subsequent sequence zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins provided convincing evidence for positive selection on zzso zzso that may interact with zzso zzso These results support our hypothesis that the cattle zzso evolved under zzso diversifying selection to avoid interaction with a zzso zzso whilst preserving the zzso binding zzso The large number of zzso in zzso their extensive diversification, and the high prevalence of bovine zzso infections make this gene family a compelling target for studies of zzso zzso
