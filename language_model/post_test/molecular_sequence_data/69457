zzso in the zzso zzso gene of zzso cause deformation of zzso and zzso Our molecular analysis showed the f gene to span more than 30 zzso and to zzso two major zzso zzso and zzso zzso long, both of which are prematurely terminated in gypsy and zzso zzso zzso These truncated zzso were zzso using putative zzso signals within the zzso of the inserted zzso No evidence was found for effects of the zzso insertions on the promoters for zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso a single gypsy element was found to be inserted at identical sites in the second zzso of region zzso the zzso zzso f zzso and both truncated and zzso sized zzso were zzso zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso increased the fraction of zzso sized zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso product either stimulates premature termination at the gypsy zzso or zzso normal zzso In zzso a zzso element inserted in the third zzso of the region zzso the zzso zzso f zzso completely suppressed the formation of apparently zzso zzso
