The zzso zzso gene works in concert with zzso zzso at the bottom of the zzso hierarchy to control zzso sexual differentiation in zzso zzso zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene exhibits major complexity with respect to the zzso zzso It is expressed in males and females and its zzso is subject to differential zzso events which affect both the protein coding and the zzso zzso Moreover, Northern zzso experiments revealed the presence of a zzso transcript in zzso zzso which appears to be the first described sex specific transcript of zzso zzso characterized to zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso transgenic flies indicates that the zzso product, which shares a relatively high degree of zzso with the zzso IX zzso is able to partially zzso the zzso zzso zzso
