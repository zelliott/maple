zzso editing is the specific zzso zzso of U zzso within zzso zzso zzso We used a novel zzso cloning scheme and analyzed partially edited zzso and zzso zzso Our major unanticipated findings are: First, editing appears zzso indiscriminate within editing zzso inserting and deleting variable numbers of U zzso at all sites, both those requiring editing and those that do zzso Second, this incomplete editing occurs in precise zzso not in adjacent regions zzso in mature zzso Third, editing appears to zzso prior to zzso We propose that within a region being zzso there are cycles of indiscriminate zzso U addition or zzso and zzso sites that become correctly edited would be protected from further modification by zzso with short zzso complementary to the edited zzso
