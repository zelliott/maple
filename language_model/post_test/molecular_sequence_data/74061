The feed profile of zzso during zzso zzso could be used to influence the retention of the zzso product zzso An increased feed rate led to a higher production rate but also to an increased specific zzso which reduced the zzso zzso Three growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso where studied and resulted in 20, 9 and zzso respectively, of the total zzso accumulating in the zzso It was also shown that leakage during zzso production of a zzso zzso was also influenced by the feed rate in a similar manner to zzso If zzso product zzso is desired the advantage of a high zzso resulting from a high zzso feed rate, is diminished because of a reduced product zzso zzso analysis revealed that the growth rate, resulting from a zzso limited feed, influenced the outer membrane protein compositions with respect to zzso and zzso whilst zzso was largely zzso As the feed rate increased the amount of total outer membrane protein zzso When zzso was produced there were further reductions in outer membrane protein zzso by 82, 100 and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the total reduction was almost zzso with a high product formation zzso We suggest that the reduced zzso of the outer membrane zzso zzso and zzso may have contributed to a reduced ability for the cell to retain zzso protein zzso to the zzso
