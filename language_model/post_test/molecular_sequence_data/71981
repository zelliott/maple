The envelope zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso consists of two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso portion zzso of zzso contains an zzso domain that likely represents the core of the zzso zzso of the zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a zzso autonomous folding zzso that retains key zzso in specifying the overall fold of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso is formed by zzso attachment of peptides zzso and zzso by a short flexible zzso in place of the normal zzso loop zzso zzso forms a highly zzso zzso zzso Point zzso within the envelope protein complex that abolish membrane fusion and zzso zzso also impede the formation of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso core plays a direct role in the membrane fusion step of zzso infection and thus provides a molecular target for the development of zzso pharmaceutical zzso
