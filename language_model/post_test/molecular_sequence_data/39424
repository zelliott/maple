zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso Short zzso zzso thereby regulating signaling by the bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In mice there are four zzso zzso two of which, zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso are responsible for zzso the zzso zzso zzso thereby regulating signaling by zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, although zzso zzso markedly zzso zzso zzso mice doubly zzso zzso for zzso and zzso genes are not zzso in early zzso Only a single zzso zzso has previously been reported for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso results only in mild zzso zzso by loss of the most zzso cell types of the zzso Here we identify and map the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso expression results in a mild tail zzso However, simultaneous zzso of mini fin and zzso results in severe zzso resembling the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused by defects in major zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso gene products functionally overlap and are together responsible for a key portion of the zzso processing activity necessary to formation of the zzso zzso zzso
