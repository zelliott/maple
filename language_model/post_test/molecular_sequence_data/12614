Agents that damage DNA in zzso coli or interfere with its replication induce DNA repair and zzso via the zzso zzso This well-known activity is regulated by the zzso protein and the zzso zzso Following repair or bypass of the DNA zzso the cell returns to its resting state by a largely unknown zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the recovery of zzso and that it is regulated by the zzso zzso This protein was induced by zzso zzso zzso required zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso was not sufficient for zzso indicating the requirement for an additional protein under zzso zzso Finally, a zzso in the corresponding zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso zzso also plays a role in respiratory zzso zzso which suggests a mechanism for zzso resumption during the termination of the zzso zzso
