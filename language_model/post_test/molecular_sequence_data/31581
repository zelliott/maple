zzso a major component of zzso cell walls and zzso zzso is an zzso abundant zzso ranking next to zzso Industrial demand for zzso and its degradation products as raw materials for fine chemical products is zzso A zzso with high zzso activity, zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil by using a screening medium containing zzso zzso Although zzso zzso several zzso zzso and thoroughly zzso the powder, the zzso fluid alone broke them down zzso Based on expression cloning and zzso analysis, at least seven family 18 zzso genes were found in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the product of only one gene zzso was identified as possessing three zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso family 18 zzso zzso Since zzso zzso are known to function as anchors to the zzso bacterial cell surface, zzso was suggested to be a novel zzso zzso zzso and to play an important role in the complete degradation of zzso Indeed, the zzso protein was localized on the cell zzso Each of the seven zzso genes zzso to zzso and zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli cells for zzso characterization of their zzso In particular, zzso and zzso showed high activity for zzso zzso The high zzso activity of strain zzso and the zzso may be useful for environmentally friendly processing of zzso in the manufacture of food and/or zzso
