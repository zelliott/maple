In the absence of zzso zzso zzso on the surface of target cells, or free zzso zzso in the vicinity of their zzso zzso growth factor zzso family members cannot exert their biological activity and are easily damaged by zzso This limits the utility of zzso in a variety of applications including treatment of zzso burn, and zzso tissue wounds, gastric ulcers, zzso zzso zzso ligament and spinal zzso zzso Here we describe an zzso analog engineered to overcome this limitation by fusing zzso with HS zzso zzso core zzso The fusion protein zzso which was expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells and collected from the zzso zzso possessed both HS and zzso zzso sugar zzso After zzso intact zzso proteins with little affinity to immobilized zzso and high-level HS zzso but not their zzso or zzso zzso exerted zzso activity independent of zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso Although zzso was resistant to zzso zzso its zzso degradation with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso its zzso activity toward human zzso zzso The same treatment abolished the activity of simple zzso zzso By constructing a biologically active zzso fusion zzso we have demonstrated an approach that may prove effective for engineering not only zzso family members, but other zzso molecules as zzso
