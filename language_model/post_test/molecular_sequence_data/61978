We previously demonstrated the growth zzso property of zzso and its possible roles in zzso zzso To further understand the regulation and roles of zzso in zzso we proceeded to clone and characterize the human zzso gene and three of its zzso with transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso gene spans approximately 18 zzso and contains 8 zzso and 7 zzso with zzso size ranging from 92 to zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis suggest that different transcripts were arrived through differential promoter usage and alternate zzso Multiple zzso zzso array zzso and Multiple zzso Northern zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso expressed in all zzso with high expression in liver, zzso and zzso The cancer profiling array zzso of paired zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso of kidney zzso Western analysis revealed that the zzso protein was zzso in zzso (7 of 9 zzso of kidney tumor zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso of zzso of kidney tumors were either lost or zzso zzso protein compared with the adjacent normal zzso A zzso study using zzso zzso construct showed that zzso of the 52 zzso zzso protein in zzso cells resulted in growth zzso and cell zzso This study demonstrates the complex zzso structure of the zzso gene and its growth zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest the potential use of zzso in diagnosis, zzso and/or treatment of kidney zzso
