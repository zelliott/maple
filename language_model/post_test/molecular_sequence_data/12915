The zzso of canary grass, which was introduced as a pasture grass from Europe, is a major zzso source in the external environment of southern zzso This study was performed to characterize the major zzso zzso of canary grass zzso It is anticipated that zzso zzso may be useful in diagnosis and zzso of grass zzso induced zzso 

To clone major canary grass zzso zzso and assess their zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso with other grass zzso zzso This sequence information may then be useful in T and B cell zzso mapping zzso 

A canary grass zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library was constructed and screened with zzso of zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated, zzso into zzso coli, zzso and, along with the deduced zzso acid zzso compared with other sequences in zzso and zzso acid zzso 

One of the clones zzso the group 1 zzso of canary grass zzso zzso a 1, with a deduced zzso acid sequence identity of zzso with zzso p 1, from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 1, from velvet grass zzso and zzso with zzso p 1, from zzso grass zzso The other clones zzso zzso 5, 14, 28, 29) zzso zzso forms of zzso a zzso These zzso forms showed between zzso zzso and zzso deduced zzso acid sequence identities with each zzso Moreover, they shared significant sequence identity with other group 5 zzso from zzso zzso and Kentucky bluegrass zzso 

Group 1 and four zzso of group 5 zzso of canary grass zzso have been cloned and upon sequencing demonstrated strong zzso and zzso acid sequence identities with other group 1 and 5 grass zzso zzso
