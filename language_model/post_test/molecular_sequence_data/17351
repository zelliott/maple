zzso sites on the zzso zzso protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus zzso were mapped by zzso analysis with overlapping peptides that span the N protein zzso Two major zzso zzso located in the zzso region zzso acids zzso 362 to zzso and middle region zzso 153 to zzso reacted with more than zzso of zzso from SARS zzso Several minor zzso zzso were zzso with about 50% of the SARS zzso zzso from mice zzso with zzso zzso recognized the two major zzso zzso and one zzso site located adjacent to the zzso region zzso 76 to zzso which did not react with the zzso from SARS zzso Several zzso zzso against zzso bound to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the above zzso sites on the N protein are important in zzso zzso immune response against zzso in humans and animals and can be used as zzso for developing diagnostic zzso
