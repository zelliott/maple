In the olive fruit fly zzso zzso previous studies have described a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso alcohol zzso and provided evidence that the zzso is under the influence of zzso A recent study has shown that this species carries a zzso zzso for alcohol zzso Here, we show that the zzso maps at one of the duplicated zzso zzso and identify the zzso and, therefore, the zzso zzso acid differences among the three zzso At the zzso acid level, the zzso is of the simplest possible form: there is no zzso variation, and zzso differences are restricted to one zzso acid for two pairs of zzso and to two zzso acids for the third zzso Consideration of the zzso acid zzso at the sites that segregate in zzso zzso in four zzso species and the zzso trees produced from the zzso sequences of the zzso gene of these species point to the same zzso as the ancestral form of the zzso Interestingly, this zzso comprises less than zzso of the gene pool of zzso natural populations of zzso zzso where the other two zzso appear to form a stable zzso Previous studies have shown that the frequency of the rare zzso rises rapidly in laboratory colonies maintained on artificial diet and declines again when the artificial diet is replaced with olive fruit, the natural zzso of zzso zzso The geographical distribution of several zzso species suggests that zzso zzso originated in the Indian zzso where the olive tree is practically zzso The poor performance of the ancestral zzso on the olive fruit suggests the possibility that the decline of this zzso and the zzso rise of the presently common zzso might be associated with the expansion of the zzso geographical distribution to areas where the olive tree has become its main and perhaps sole zzso The estimated age of the zzso is compatible with this hypothesis, but firmer support could be difficult to zzso
