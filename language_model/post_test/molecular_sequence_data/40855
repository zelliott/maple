The zzso zzso zzso zzso is ubiquitous in both zzso and zzso organisms, where it plays a critical role in stress resistance and zzso zzso Here, we cloned the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso and expressed and then zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity analysis indicated that the high zzso efficiency of zzso from zzso zzso zzso resulted from the high affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso at low zzso We also confirmed that the zzso sequence of zzso has a large effect on its affinity for zzso zzso analysis indicated that the flexibility of the zzso may be directly related to the zzso efficiency of zzso at low zzso
