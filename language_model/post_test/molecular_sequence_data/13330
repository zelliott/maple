Little is known about the extent to which protein flexibility contributes to zzso recognition and zzso Using short zzso peptides zzso zzso as model zzso we demonstrate that a zzso zzso can force a zzso zzso into a zzso that is similar to the zzso of the zzso zzso against which the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso that forms a very stable coiled zzso The two zzso zzso strongly with the random zzso analogue zzso that contains zzso and zzso zzso in positions 7 and 14, zzso The zzso zzso zzso adopted an altered zzso that possibly was coiled zzso as shown by CD difference zzso and zzso zzso experiments on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with the random zzso zzso zzso exhibited a large zzso zzso This, however, was strongly compensated by a more favorable zzso resulting in only a small difference between the association zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the opposite type of zzso zzso zzso zzso was raised against the random zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with coiled zzso zzso zzso by forcing it to zzso into single zzso zzso compensation again enabled the zzso which now was zzso favored and zzso zzso The rate of reaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was controlled by the rate of zzso of zzso into single zzso This zzso as well as the generally much slower reaction rate with the zzso zzso indicated that the zzso occurred because the zzso selected the zzso of the zzso that binds the zzso a mechanism we call zzso fit by zzso zzso
