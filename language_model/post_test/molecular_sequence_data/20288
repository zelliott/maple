zzso are zzso respiratory proteins in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso gave rise to zzso which have lost the ability to bind copper and thus zzso zzso are thought to act mainly as storage proteins in zzso zzso So far, zzso have only been identified in zzso zzso but not in zzso Here we report the identification of a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso measures zzso zzso and translates into a native zzso of zzso zzso zzso As in other zzso the six zzso zzso are not zzso However, sequence comparison and zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is not closely related to other zzso zzso which derive from zzso type 1 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but rather resembles a zzso of zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso storage proteins emerged at least two times independently in zzso
