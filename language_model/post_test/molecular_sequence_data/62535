Recently, it was discovered that zzso zzso zzso zzso in human interacts with zzso zzso and removes the zzso from zzso zzso Thus, human zzso zzso the status of zzso zzso zzso cell growth repression and zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized a mouse zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was cloned from mouse zzso cells by zzso The open reading frame consists of zzso zzso and encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of approximately 135 zzso The zzso region contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are highly zzso in all zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that two transcripts were detected in various zzso with strong expression in brain, zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso has zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso reduces the amount of zzso zzso indicating that it functions as a zzso zzso for zzso
