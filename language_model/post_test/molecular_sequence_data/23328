zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso widely represented in the natural zzso of fresh zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in protein expression during environmental changes encountered during technological processes in which zzso zzso is involved in order to gain insight into the ability of this species to grow and survive in such zzso Using two-dimensional zzso we observed significant variation of a set of 21 proteins in cells grown at 4 degrees C or in the presence of zzso zzso Six proteins could be identified by determination of their zzso zzso and the corresponding gene clusters were zzso Two proteins belong to carbon zzso zzso and four can be clustered as general stress zzso A zzso was observed at low temperature for five of the six zzso constructed for these zzso The survival of four zzso during stationary phase at 4 degrees C was affected, and surprisingly, one zzso showed enhanced survival during stationary phase at low zzso
