In this study, we investigated whether active human zzso infection could be detected in 20 systemic lupus zzso zzso patients over a one-year observation period by zzso chain reaction on serial urine specimens and by monitoring of zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiles in serial serum zzso Of zzso urine samples zzso for the presence of human zzso DNA, only 2 specimens zzso collected from two different patients contained genuine human zzso sequences as determined by zzso chain reaction and subsequent sequencing of the zzso zzso These two patients had one positive sample out of 36 samples or 40 samples, zzso zzso of the patients zzso possessed zzso zzso against human zzso while 9 zzso produced zzso zzso However, none of the patients showed signs of an active virus infection as judged by the stable zzso zzso or zzso zzso levels during the observation period, nor was any correlation between disease activity and zzso zzso zzso Of single serum samples of 26 zzso and zzso blood donors, 21 zzso were zzso zzso positive and 1 zzso was zzso zzso In conclusion, our data fail to establish an active human zzso infection in zzso zzso
