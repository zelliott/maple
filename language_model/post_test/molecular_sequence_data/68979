DNA typing systems currently used in zzso involve either zzso Southern blots with repetitive sequence zzso or amplifying zzso sequences using the zzso chain reaction zzso Both such approaches zzso zzso length variation, usually in zzso zzso repeated DNA zzso Where an appropriate target locus exists, an alternative zzso strategy which reveals zzso sequence variation in zzso repeated DNA offers a more accurate and internally controlled zzso We describe such a strategy for the rapid extraction of information on tandem repeat sequence variation from zzso zzso and apply it to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The extreme zzso of such DNA zzso can be used to identify zzso stocks and zzso This system is also potentially useful for population genetic and zzso studies since it offers the possibility of following the spread of zzso marked zzso zzso in samples taken from infected zzso
