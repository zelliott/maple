The three-dimensional structure of the zzso B zzso zzso selective zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 16 zzso acid zzso with a novel internal linkage between the zzso group of zzso and the zzso group of zzso The structural calculations were carried out with the combined use of distance geometry and simulated zzso The result indicates that zzso adopts an extraordinary zzso the zzso zzso passes through the zzso region zzso Several critical zzso directly support this extraordinary zzso The folding of zzso turned out to be the same as that zzso et zzso calculated for zzso zzso which possesses the same internal linkage as zzso The obtained structure suggested that the region consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the region consisting of zzso zzso and zzso are involved in a binding with zzso
