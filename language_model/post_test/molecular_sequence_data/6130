To induce an zzso specific zzso or zzso response, an zzso must be delivered into the appropriate cellular zzso We explored the role of zzso in the presentation of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Class zzso zzso zzso and the effect of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were used as target zzso After zzso infection, only the targets which expressed zzso were zzso by zzso class zzso zzso When zzso was zzso zzso presentation by zzso class I molecules was retained but could be blocked by fusion zzso which block virus cell zzso When zzso was zzso with formaldehyde, zzso was no longer presented by zzso class I zzso although it was still presented by zzso class II molecules to a zzso class zzso T cell zzso These data show that zzso binding to the zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso fusion and that zzso delivery of zzso is necessary for presentation by class I zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of virus zzso the loss of class zzso presentation of zzso due to selective zzso of fusion and zzso delivery of zzso
