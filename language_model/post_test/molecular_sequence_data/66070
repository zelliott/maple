To analyze zzso interactions with zzso binding molecules an zzso microchip containing immobilized zzso with protective groups zzso zzso at zzso positions was zzso The zzso were immobilized within three-dimensional zzso zzso pads fixed on a glass zzso The protective groups preserved the zzso from degradation and were suitable to be removed directly on the microchip when needed, right before its zzso These zzso zzso zzso were tested for their interaction with zzso labeled zzso and analyzed for their availability to be zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso immobilized zzso after zzso years of storage as well as after direct zzso action was also zzso Melting zzso of short zzso hybrids that had formed into gel pads of the microchip were found to exhibit clearly defined zzso shapes, with the melting temperatures in full accordance with those theoretically predicted for the same zzso zzso This approach, based on keeping the protective groups attached to zzso can be applied for manufacturing any zzso zzso containing immobilized zzso including zzso with two-dimensional zzso zzso These zzso zzso can be used to measure zzso parameters of zzso or zzso duplexes as well as to study zzso or zzso zzso
