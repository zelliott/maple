A zzso zzso a novel human zzso was isolated by random sequencing of zzso clones from human zzso zzso This protein has been termed zzso zzso zzso because it appears to be zzso specifically by cells of the zzso zzso zzso has the zzso motif and other highly zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso but it shares zzso identity with any of the known zzso zzso zzso was expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells and zzso by zzso zzso zzso sequencing and mass zzso were used to verify the zzso zzso and molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso migration zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso natural killer cells migrated to zzso in a zzso manner, with a zzso zzso response at 1 zzso Freshly isolated zzso also migrated toward zzso but with a peak response at 100 zzso zzso Northern analyses indicated zzso is highly expressed in zzso and in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso natural killer cells, or several cell lines of zzso zzso or zzso zzso High expression was also detected in normal zzso and less expression in lung and zzso Unlike most other zzso zzso zzso is zzso on human zzso zzso zzso is thus a unique member of the zzso zzso family that may play a fundamental role in the function of zzso cells, natural killer cells, and zzso
