The zzso diversity of zzso channels mainly depends on the expression of several genes zzso different zzso We have cloned a new zzso channel zzso zzso that is unable to form functional channels on its own but that has a major regulatory zzso zzso can zzso selectively with other zzso to form functional zzso zzso channels with kinetic properties that differ from those of the parent zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in the brain, being concentrated particularly in zzso zzso The functional expression of this regulatory zzso represents a novel mechanism without zzso in zzso channels, which might contribute to further increase the functional diversity of zzso channels necessary to specify the intrinsic electrical properties of individual zzso
