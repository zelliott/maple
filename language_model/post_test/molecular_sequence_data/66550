To investigate the functions of zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso at different stages of cell zzso The engineered zzso embryonic stem zzso cells with conditional knockout of zzso were developed depending on zzso 

zzso system was used in a conditional targeting zzso The competent zzso bacteria, which expressed zzso was used to confirm the zzso deletion of the zzso zzso 7 and 8 of zzso The targeting zzso was zzso into the zzso cells, and the zzso zzso cells were screened with zzso and zzso Finally, the zzso clones with correct targeting events were identified by Southern zzso and zzso 

The targeting zzso with conditional knockout of zzso zzso was successfully constructed and confirmed by zzso and zzso analysis in zzso 86 zzso clones were collected by selective culture with zzso and zzso Four of the 86 zzso clones were found containing the targeting gene sequence in zzso DNA proved by Southern zzso with a zzso flank zzso Two of the four zzso clones had the correct targeting events that included the zzso of the targeting gene sequence in zzso DNA and were checked by Southern zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso zzso between zzso 8 and 9 in zzso DNA was identified in one of the two zzso clones by Southern zzso and zzso 

zzso conditional knockout depending on zzso can be successfully used in zzso zzso
