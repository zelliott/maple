The function of zzso zzso as a regulatory factor in the growth of tumor cells has been well zzso However, its precise mechanism of action and its clinical significance remain to be worked zzso 

zzso from zzso patients were analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso were also used for analysis of cell zzso 

zzso is able to interact with zzso zzso and binds to the element of the regulatory region of the zzso gene in the zzso tissue of zzso zzso An zzso of zzso cell lines of differing zzso expression showed that zzso zzso is able to block zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells led to greater binding of zzso to its response zzso The expression of the zzso gene was therefore up regulated as reflected by increases in zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso gene resulted in apparent reduction of zzso binding to DNA and zzso zzso 

zzso of the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso expression of the zzso gene strongly indicates zzso plays a signal zzso role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
