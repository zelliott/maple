zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a complex interplay between viral regulatory proteins and cellular zzso factors that interact with the viral long terminal repeat zzso region of zzso However, several cellular zzso factors have been identified that can interact with the zzso zzso the significance of all of these factors is not clearly zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso region of different zzso of zzso with regard to zzso sequence and promoter zzso The zzso regions of zzso from peripheral blood zzso cells of 29 infected individuals originating from 10 different geographical regions were zzso and further analyzed for zzso activity in transient zzso of zzso cells, in the context of a reporter gene and in the context of the complete virus zzso We found several zzso zzso sequences of the various zzso zzso such as an zzso that created a potential third zzso site in the zzso of the zzso C zzso The zzso site in the zzso also contained zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso activities of the zzso C zzso were higher than the activities of the other zzso analyzed here zzso A, B, D, zzso and zzso suggesting that the potential third zzso site may zzso higher zzso activity or that the zzso C zzso may be less zzso Thus, our data suggest that genetic diversity of the zzso may result in zzso zzso with different zzso zzso
