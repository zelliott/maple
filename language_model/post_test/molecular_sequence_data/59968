zzso zzso release factors, zzso and zzso zzso protein release at zzso and zzso stop zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are known to cause zzso suppression for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and they do not exert a zzso zzso suppression zzso We aimed to isolate zzso zzso of such zzso activity, which we designated zzso zzso in this zzso 

Using a zzso zzso reporter, we selected amber zzso zzso occurring in the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso Of nine such zzso zzso zzso five were zzso zzso and four were zzso zzso The former zzso zzso retained the zzso activity and zzso zzso termination both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso deletions equivalent to the zzso zzso exerted amber suppression as well as zzso suppression zzso Moreover, the equivalent zzso segments also showed both the suppression zzso 

All the zzso zzso were mapped at the zzso half of zzso and are zzso zzso with the highly conservative zzso zzso suggesting that they affect the zzso function of bacterial zzso We propose here that there should be an zzso zzso step of zzso to the zzso preceding stop zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso that are truncated or affected by the zzso zzso are responsible for this step and interfere with the proper functioning of zzso release factors on the zzso
