The brain specific zinc zzso protein zzso can be related to the zzso zzso of Alzheimer's zzso In order to analyze the metal binding ability of human zzso zzso here we report a zzso and solution structural zzso CD, zzso zzso study of zzso zzso and zzso complexes of three peptides mimicking the possible metal binding sequences of this zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a minimalist, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a more complete model of the zzso zzso loop, which is widely accepted as a putative metal binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso complexes are the major species in the corresponding zzso systems, with zzso zzso and zzso coordination zzso zzso The species zzso has zzso orders of magnitude higher stability than the other two complexes, indicating the presence of a zzso zzso site at the zzso tail of the human zzso zzso Moreover, zzso shows preferred zinc binding as compared to zzso zzso zzso - log zzso zzso zzso probably due to the higher preference of zzso for zzso zzso These facts suggest that zinc binding to the zzso zzso sequence of human zzso may be involved in the biological activity of this zinc zzso protein in zinc zzso binding or zzso zzso
