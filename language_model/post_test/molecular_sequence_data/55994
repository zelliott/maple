Using zzso protection analysis, zzso growth zzso zzso zzso levels were measured in various zzso from fetal sheep during late gestation zzso 146 zzso 2 zzso and after experimental manipulation of fetal plasma cortisol zzso No zzso trend in zzso zzso levels was observed in the fetal zzso zzso or skeletal zzso However, in the fetal liver, there was a marked decline in zzso zzso abundance immediately before term, which closely paralleled the normal zzso surge in fetal plasma zzso This decrease in zzso zzso zzso levels toward term was prevented when the cortisol surge was abolished by fetal zzso and was zzso prematurely in fetuses younger than 130 days by zzso infusion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also reduced when fetal cortisol levels were raised zzso by maternal zzso in late zzso Muscle zzso zzso levels were reduced by fetal cortisol infusion, but not by maternal zzso and were higher in zzso than in intact fetuses in late zzso No change in zzso zzso levels were observed in the fetal lung in response to altering the fetal cortisol level either zzso or zzso When the data from all fetuses were combined regardless of treatment or zzso age, there was a significant inverse correlation between the plasma cortisol level in zzso and zzso zzso abundance in the fetal liver zzso zzso zzso but not in any of the other fetal zzso zzso These findings show that cortisol suppresses zzso gene expression in the liver of the sheep fetus and indicate that the zzso change in zzso zzso status toward term may be due to the zzso cortisol zzso
