Major zzso complex zzso zzso bind peptides of diverse sequences with high zzso They do this in order to generate zzso zzso protection by covering the spectrum of peptides that may be seen by a host over the course of its zzso However, in many circumstances the immune system does not recognize a particular zzso that it should for maximum advantage over the zzso In other situations, the immune system goes awry and incorrectly recognizes a zzso that it should zzso This results in disease characterized by recognition and attack of zzso zzso arthritis is an example of just such a zzso In either of these situations, zzso zzso for immune therapy would be an zzso However, zzso therapies require a thorough understanding of the forces involved in zzso zzso Great strides have been made in zzso the mechanisms by which these zzso proteins may bind peptides with diverse sequences and high zzso This review summarizes the current data obtained from zzso analyses of zzso binding for both class I and class II zzso zzso Unfortunately, as yet these data have not allowed us to predict which peptides will bind with high affinity to a specific zzso zzso
