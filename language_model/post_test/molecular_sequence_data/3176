Nerve growth factor zzso can induce zzso in neural cells via zzso of the low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death zzso is a zzso protein that mediates zzso in response to zzso by interacting with the death domain of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kimura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso Greene, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed extensive zzso analysis on zzso to better characterize its structural and functional zzso zzso of a minimal region, including zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso was found to be sufficient to induce zzso The designated regulatory region includes the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and is essential for zzso regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso with zzso acid zzso in the zzso nuclear export signal zzso sequence zzso zzso abolished the export of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso of the zzso also abolished zzso of zzso its interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this region has a dominant negative effect on zzso zzso These studies identify distinct regions of zzso that are involved in regulating specific functions involved in zzso signal zzso
