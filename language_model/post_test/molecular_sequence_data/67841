The design of zzso zzso and materials of defined size and shape is challenging as it pushes our understanding of zzso assembly to its zzso In such endeavors, DNA is the current building block of choice because of its predictable and zzso zzso The use of zzso and zzso systems, however, has potential advantages due to their zzso zzso structures and functions, and the prospects for zzso production through gene synthesis and zzso Here, we present the design and characterization of two complementary peptides programmed to form a parallel zzso coiled zzso which we use as the building blocks for larger, zzso zzso To achieve the latter, the two peptides are joined via zzso zzso of variable lengths to produce a range of zzso from flexible fibers of indefinite zzso through large zzso zzso down to closed and discrete zzso objects of defined zzso We zzso that the different modes of assembly reflect the interplay between zzso constraints imposed by short zzso and the bulk of the zzso and zzso factors that favor the formation of many smaller objects as the zzso length is zzso This approach, and the resulting linear and zzso zzso represents a new route for constructing complex zzso zzso and zzso
