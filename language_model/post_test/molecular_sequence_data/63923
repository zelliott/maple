Many naturally occurring peptides exhibit a high degree of zzso across zzso coupled zzso zzso The degree to which this phenomenon occurs, and its zzso significance is not well zzso In addition, many zzso peptides exist for which there are no known zzso zzso to identify novel interactions between biologically active peptides and zzso coupled zzso a library of nearly 200 peptides was screened against the human zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso Factor zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso receptors using a zzso functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed that the zzso zzso zzso selectively activated the zzso no activity was observed at the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was a potent zzso at the zzso with similar efficacy as human zzso and a potency of 11 zzso These results were confirmed in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso could be suppressed by the zzso salmon zzso zzso In competition binding studies, salmon zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each able to inhibit zzso from cell zzso containing zzso expressed zzso These results indicate that the orphan zzso zzso is a potent zzso at the zzso
