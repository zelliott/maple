The T cell zzso zzso zzso is produced in the zzso zzso where it associates with the zzso zzso and the members of the zzso complex to form the complete zzso When the other chains of the complex are not available, the zzso is rapidly zzso within the zzso zzso When incomplete zzso complexes are formed, they are transported through the zzso apparatus and zzso in zzso In this study, a truncated form of the zzso zzso has been made by removal of the zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the normal zzso the truncated zzso is stable and is transported through the zzso apparatus and zzso This process occurs at a similar rate in both T and B cells, indicating that it is not affected by the presence or absence of zzso zzso These data suggest that an element in the zzso or zzso region of the zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso control mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso
