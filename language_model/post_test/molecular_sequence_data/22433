Two of the four human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso region during zzso Although the only difference between these zzso is the presence of an additional 11 zzso acids at the N zzso of zzso these zzso possess remarkably different abilities to pattern the zzso and anterior zzso To reveal the structural basis by which alternative zzso zzso the organizing activity of zzso we solved the crystal structure of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso Using surface zzso resonance zzso we also characterized the zzso specificity of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structure shows that alternative zzso permits a single additional contact between zzso 32 zzso of zzso and a zzso groove within zzso domain 3 of the zzso that is also present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the structure, zzso of zzso to zzso reduces the affinity of zzso toward all these receptors to levels characteristic of zzso More importantly, analysis of the zzso patterning ability of the zzso zzso in chick zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows that this zzso functionally converts zzso to zzso Moreover, our data suggest that the intermediate zzso affinities of zzso and zzso relative to zzso and zzso also account for the distinct patterning abilities of these two zzso We also show that the mode of zzso zzso specificity is distinct from that of other zzso and provide the first zzso evidence for a zzso zzso interaction during zzso zzso zzso with the indispensable role of zzso in embryonic development, we show that the zzso mode of zzso binding appeared as early as in zzso and has been preserved throughout zzso
