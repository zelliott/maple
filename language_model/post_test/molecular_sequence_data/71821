Recent studies on zzso zzso by the de zzso method as well as zzso proteins including prion proteins and Alzheimer's zzso have provided insights into the zzso changes, such as zzso to zzso involved in folding and zzso zzso We have found that an exposed zzso nucleation domain at zzso causes a structural transition of a zzso from zzso to zzso It became clear that zzso zzso groups of particular lengths in a zzso zzso caused the zzso to undergo an zzso zzso The zzso with the zzso group zzso showed the highest rate of zzso The study of the designed peptides revealed that these zzso transitions were closely related to the initial zzso zzso and its zzso Engineering peptides that undergo zzso transitions are attractive not only to the study of zzso proteins such as prion zzso but also to the control of zzso of zzso which will lead to the development of zzso zzso zzso
