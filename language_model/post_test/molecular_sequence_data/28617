We have zzso the zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso an zzso previously classified as a zzso green zzso but now recognized as a lower fungus based on molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso is maintained as a zzso linear zzso with zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso at both ends, a rare zzso architecture in zzso The zzso encodes only 14 known zzso zzso 7 zzso the large zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in two gene pieces that are located 8 zzso apart on the zzso zzso and fragmented zzso zzso are well known from green algae and zzso zzso but are unprecedented in zzso zzso genes code for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3, zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, zzso 5, and 6, and zzso zzso 6, 8, and 9 zzso and several of these genes are organized in zzso zzso The set of seven zzso zzso zzso is insufficient to recognize all zzso that occur in the zzso protein zzso When taking into account the pronounced zzso bias, at least 16 zzso zzso are assumed to be imported into the zzso Three of the seven predicted zzso zzso sequences carry zzso in the first three positions of the zzso zzso This strongly suggests that these zzso are edited by a mechanism similar to the one seen in the fungus zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analysis confirms with overwhelming support that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso specifically related to the zzso
