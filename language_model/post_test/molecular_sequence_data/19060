zzso zzso zzso play vital zzso zzso and regulatory roles in protein function and are commonly zzso to zzso zzso within the protein zzso Current methods to identify zzso zzso rely on zzso studies based on known zzso zzso as well as high-resolution structural zzso These available approaches zzso the global identification of putative zzso zzso particularly on poorly characterized proteins in the zzso zzso we describe an experimental platform that identifies zzso zzso on the basis of their reduced zzso upon treatment with metal zzso As validation of our platform, we zzso a zzso zzso probe to show that the known zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso demonstrates an expected loss in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and a gain in zzso upon treatment with a zzso zzso We also identified the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso as a potential zzso site, albeit with lower metal affinity relative to zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso results in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, we apply a zzso zzso probe to globally identify putative zzso zzso across zzso zzso in the human zzso This zzso study identified several zzso zzso zzso as well as numerous zzso proteins from functionally distinct zzso This platform is highly versatile and provides an experimental tool that zzso existing zzso and structural methods to identify zzso zzso zzso
