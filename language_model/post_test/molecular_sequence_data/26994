zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from the blood of a patient with zzso zzso zzso and from the hip joint fluid of a patient with an infected zzso zzso zzso zzso These strains were characterized by using a zzso zzso zzso Based on cellular zzso and zzso criteria the two zzso were tentatively assigned to the zzso zzso although they did not zzso to any recognized zzso The zzso fatty acids were a mix of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for strain zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso was closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso was closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data and zzso zzso these zzso are considered to represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
