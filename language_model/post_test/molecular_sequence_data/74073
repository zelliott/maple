Plants produce small zzso to zzso regulate zzso viral zzso zzso and repetitive elements at either the zzso or zzso level in a process that is referred to as zzso zzso While zzso zzso has been extensively studied across the different zzso of the animal kingdom zzso zzso fly, zzso similar studies in the plant kingdom have focused primarily on zzso thus limiting evolutionary studies of zzso zzso in zzso Here we report on an unexpected zzso difference in the size distribution of small zzso among the vascular zzso By zzso total zzso from freshly growing shoot zzso we conducted a survey of small zzso in 24 vascular plant zzso We find that zzso which radiated from the other zzso plants approximately 260 million years ago, fail to produce significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso that are known to guide DNA zzso and zzso formation in zzso Instead, they zzso a diverse population of small zzso that are exactly zzso zzso This finding was confirmed by zzso sequencing of the small zzso sequences from a zzso zzso zzso A conifer zzso search revealed the presence of a novel zzso zzso family, which may be responsible for the observed change in small zzso zzso No evidence for zzso an zzso that matures zzso zzso in zzso was zzso We zzso that the diverse class of zzso zzso found in zzso may help to maintain organization of their unusually large zzso
