The human zzso zzso disorder zzso syndrome and its zzso zzso beige are associated with the formation of giant zzso that cluster near the zzso region of zzso We prepared a zzso zzso against a zzso zzso fusion protein and demonstrated by Western analysis that the beige gene encodes a protein of 400 zzso that is expressed in cultured zzso zzso as well as most mouse zzso The protein was not detected in either cultured zzso or mouse zzso from two different beige zzso zzso zzso transformed with multiple copies of zzso artificial zzso that contain the full-length beige gene showed much higher levels of zzso protein than either wild type zzso or mouse zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso protein was zzso and, under the conditions of isolation, had no measurable membrane zzso zzso mouse zzso in which the zzso protein was zzso had smaller than normal zzso that were more peripherally distributed than in control zzso These findings, coupled with earlier published results, suggest that the zzso protein regulates zzso zzso
