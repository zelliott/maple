As much as a quarter of the human zzso has been reported to vary in copy number between individuals, including regions containing about half of the members of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We have undertaken a detailed study of zzso variation of zzso to zzso the selective and zzso forces acting on this gene family and the true impact of zzso variation on human OR zzso We argue that the properties of zzso zzso zzso and other sets of large zzso regions violate the assumptions of statistical methods that are commonly used in the assessment of gene zzso Using more appropriate methods, we provide evidence that OR enrichment in zzso is not due to positive selection but is because of OR preponderance in zzso duplicated regions, which are known to be frequently zzso zzso and because zzso selection against zzso is lower in zzso regions than in regions containing essential zzso We also combine multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso and zzso to zzso the copy numbers of 37 candidate zzso zzso in a panel of approximately 50 human zzso We confirm zzso variation of 18 zzso but find no variation in this zzso panel for 16 other zzso highlighting the zzso that reported intervals often zzso true zzso The zzso variation we describe is likely to zzso significant variation in zzso abilities among human zzso Finally, we show that both zzso and zzso processes have played a recent role in zzso the OR zzso
