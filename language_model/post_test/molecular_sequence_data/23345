zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that zzso a wide variety of zzso and causes zzso in zzso It is recognized as a potential agent of zzso due to its low infectious dose and multiple routes of zzso To date, genetic manipulation in zzso zzso has been limited due to the inefficiency of DNA zzso the relative lack of useful selective zzso and the lack of zzso replicating zzso zzso the goal of this study was to develop an enhanced shuttle zzso that could be zzso for a variety of genetic procedures in both zzso and zzso zzso A hybrid zzso zzso was isolated that was transformed by zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mug of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso Furthermore, this zzso was zzso maintained in zzso zzso zzso after passage in the absence of zzso selection in zzso and after 3 days of growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives carrying zzso were zzso in their growth characteristics in laboratory medium and zzso compared to zzso zzso We also constructed derivatives of zzso containing expanded multiple cloning sites or zzso zzso that failed to allow zzso replication in zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, the utility of zzso as a vehicle for gene zzso as well as zzso was zzso In zzso we describe construction of a zzso shuttle zzso that is transformed at high efficiency, is zzso zzso and does not alter the growth of zzso in zzso This new tool should significantly enhance genetic manipulation and characterization of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
