A complete zzso zzso a potato zzso zzso has been identified and zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid zzso the still enigmatic molecular structure of the classical zzso potato zzso could eventually be zzso Basically, the potato zzso consists of two nearly identical zzso zzso built up of two zzso arrayed zzso zzso that are interconnected by an zzso domain of approximately 60 zzso acid zzso Although this structure confirms the zzso zzso nature of the zzso zzso it differs fundamentally from all previously proposed zzso The new insights in the structure are also discussed in view of the zzso role of the zzso zzso
