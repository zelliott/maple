zzso zzso zzso is found in most organisms, but its biological role remains zzso In zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso remain low, probably because of zzso by a specific 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to use quantitative zzso for comparing the 25 zzso zzso zzso expression in various mouse zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at only a few copies per zzso The highest amount of zzso was found in zzso followed by lung and muscle, while the highest zzso activities were found in liver and zzso The poor correlation between zzso levels and zzso activities might result either from zzso zzso regulation of zzso processing and/or translation or from the regulation of zzso activities by zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso was zzso by zzso zzso II, but this zzso did not modify the zzso zzso However, the characterization of the zzso zzso region revealed a unique, highly zzso zzso sequence that might be involved in zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies in zzso suggest a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in poorly differentiated zzso zzso This is the first study demonstrating a zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso might be related to the degree of differentiation or the zzso state of the zzso
