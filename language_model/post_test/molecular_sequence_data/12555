The zzso zzso zzso encodes a high molecular weight integral membrane zzso that is present on the zzso surface of most simple zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed and zzso zzso by most zzso and zzso zzso Numerous functions have been proposed for this zzso including protection of the zzso cell surface, an involvement in zzso zzso and a role in tumor zzso Mice deficient in zzso were generated using zzso zzso in embryonic stem zzso These mice appeared to develop normally and were healthy and zzso However, the growth rate of primary breast tumors induced by zzso middle T zzso was found to be significantly slower in zzso deficient zzso This suggests that zzso plays an important role in the progression of zzso zzso
