The zzso zzso zzso zzso is efficiently mobilized during zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso a complex of zzso DNA and zzso zzso forms at the origin of transfer zzso and is required for zzso Transfer is initiated by zzso and zzso zzso of the DNA within this zzso We show by probing with zzso zzso that zzso DNA is locally melted within the zzso in the region from the zzso repeat to the site that is zzso zzso in this region of zzso and in genes zzso the protein components of the zzso affect both zzso and melting of the zzso The zzso protein in the zzso is zzso which also zzso the transferred zzso single strand at the termination of a round of zzso We propose that there is an underlying similarity in the zzso for these two zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso has an additional role in transfer, beyond the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
