zzso zzso zzso zzso are classically regulators of zzso zzso however, recent evidence suggests that some function zzso Such zzso zzso include the human zzso zzso 6 zzso 8 zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 2, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso B zzso inhibitor that has an unusual zzso zzso and is present primarily in zzso In a search for the zzso equivalent of zzso we screened zzso libraries, and performed reverse zzso chain reaction on zzso isolated from zzso cell lines and from zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We identified 10 new zzso zzso zzso two resemble zzso two resemble zzso and the remaining six have no obvious human zzso By zzso analysis only one of the two sequences resembling zzso zzso zzso is present in mouse zzso while the other (a partial clone designated zzso is predominantly in zzso zzso comprises a zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso that is zzso identical to zzso zzso is zzso identical to zzso and over zzso identical to zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso differ from zzso both contain a zzso in a region likely to contain the zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso using a coupled zzso system formed an zzso complex with human zzso and did not interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in a zzso expression system was used to examine the interaction with human zzso in more zzso The zzso rate constant for the interaction was estimated as 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso depended on the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the same region on mouse zzso 13 as zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso We conclude that even though their zzso centers are not highly zzso zzso is a functional zzso of zzso and that the regulation of zzso in the mouse may involve a second zzso zzso by zzso Our identification of multiple sequence zzso of zzso and zzso and six new zzso zzso is consonant with the idea that the larger set of zzso and other zzso known to exist in the mouse zzso with zzso is balanced by a larger array of zzso
