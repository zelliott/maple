The zzso zzso has been implicated in control of cell growth, division and zzso Although zzso contains a zzso zzso it fails to bind DNA alone but can do so by forming zzso with an unrelated zzso zzso zzso Max zzso and zzso zzso share the ability to bind zzso or zzso zzso Current models, based on zzso induced zzso of zzso and Max in zzso cells, propose that zzso zzso repress while zzso zzso activate zzso through zzso binding zzso The interpretation of the results using zzso cells is complicated by the presence of numerous unrelated zzso binding zzso zzso and the existence of two alternative Max zzso partners, Mad and zzso Thus, the mechanism zzso zzso of Max leads to zzso repression remains to be zzso Using a zzso system we show that Max zzso have the potential to activate zzso through zzso zzso zzso by Max requires DNA binding and zzso acids outside the zzso domain but is reduced compared with zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is strongly inhibited in zzso by specific sequences zzso the core zzso binding zzso presumably reflecting reduced DNA binding zzso These results suggest a mechanism for directing the zzso complex to a specific subset of zzso target zzso
