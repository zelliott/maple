Resistance to the fusion inhibitor zzso zzso is achieved by changes in the zzso zzso of the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways correlate with zzso recovery, even after zzso failure, suggesting that the acquisition of zzso resistance alters zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we have characterized the zzso fusion zzso induction of zzso T cell loss and single zzso T cell death of 48 zzso proteins derived from three patients displaying different zzso acids zzso T or I) at position 140 that developed a zzso zzso after zzso zzso 

In all cases, zzso comparison of zzso isolated zzso or zzso showed comparable values of expression and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with either N or T at position 140 induced comparable losses of zzso zzso irrespective of the zzso present at position zzso zzso zzso acquiring the zzso zzso in a zzso background induced a significantly reduced loss of zzso T cells and lower zzso death than did their baseline zzso No altered ability to induce zzso death was observed in the other zzso 

Overall, primary zzso proteins with both zzso and zzso changes showed a reduced ability to induce single cell death and zzso zzso T cells, despite maintaining fusion zzso The specificity of this zzso highlights the relevance of the genetic context to the zzso capacity of zzso and the role of zzso zzso in modulating viral zzso in zzso further supporting the hypothesis that zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso
