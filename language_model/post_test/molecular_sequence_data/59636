zzso and other related zzso antibiotics are clinically very important because they often represent the last line of zzso against bacteria that have developed resistance to zzso zzso is believed to act by binding nascent cell wall zzso terminating in the sequence zzso weakening the resulting cell zzso zzso zzso and other studies have shown that the formation of zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso zzso Despite intensive efforts the crystal structure of zzso has been extremely difficult to zzso partly because high-resolution data were zzso and partly because the structure was too large to be solved by conventional zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso X-ray data combined with new zzso zzso techniques for solving the zzso phase problem, we have succeeded in determining the crystal structure of zzso at atomic zzso The structure provides much detailed information that should prove invaluable in zzso and zzso zzso 

Our structure confirms that zzso exists as an zzso zzso The zzso zzso allows the zzso of two zzso peptides in opposite zzso these presumably would be attached to different zzso zzso In the zzso one of the binding pockets is occupied by an zzso zzso that mimics the C zzso of the nascent cell wall zzso the other is closed by the zzso zzso which occupies the place of a zzso The occupied binding pocket exhibits high flexibility but the closed binding pocket is relatively zzso We propose that the zzso zzso may hold the binding pocket in a suitable zzso for zzso zzso swinging out of the way when the zzso enters the binding zzso
