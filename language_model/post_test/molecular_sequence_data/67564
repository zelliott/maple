zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso play essential roles in the mechanisms governing the zzso stability and assembly of integral membrane zzso Thus, it is appealing to identify zzso contacts and to seek the structural zzso of such interactions at the molecular zzso Here, we provide a protocol for detecting and measuring specific zzso interactions in zzso by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso using peptides corresponding to the TM zzso of an integral membrane zzso We give a detailed procedure and practical guidelines on how to design, zzso handle, and characterize zzso labeled TM peptides zzso in large zzso zzso zzso We also discuss some critical aspects of zzso zzso to ensure the correct analysis and interpretation of spectral zzso Our method uses zzso as the zzso zzso pair, but it can be easily adapted to other zzso pairs and to other membrane zzso zzso The ability to identify crucial zzso contacts is a valuable tool for the study of the stability, zzso and function of the important and zzso challenging zzso membrane zzso
