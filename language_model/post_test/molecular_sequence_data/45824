zzso is expressed widely in the developing zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, reducing calcium zzso and single-channel zzso The zzso binding properties of zzso are unknown but shape the role zzso plays when incorporated into zzso zzso Here, a soluble zzso zzso binding domain zzso zzso was constructed based on zzso acid sequence alignments with other zzso zzso zzso channels and is expressed in zzso zzso After zzso by zzso gel zzso and zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso behaves as a zzso even at a concentration of 20 zzso as determined by zzso zzso and dynamic light zzso zzso zzso has very high affinity for zzso with an apparent zzso constant zzso of 40 zzso zzso less than the zzso for zzso zzso which binds to zzso zzso also binds to zzso but with very low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, binding of zzso to zzso was not zzso even at a 300 zzso zzso The zzso binding profiles of zzso and zzso also show striking zzso zzso zzso and its analog zzso bind to zzso zzso with low zzso zzso whereas for zzso the affinity of zzso increases zzso compared with zzso Other zzso zzso zzso also show very weak binding to zzso zzso protection experiments reveal that zzso and zzso bind to and stabilize domain 1 of zzso zzso but increase zzso of domain 2, indicating that they produce zzso changes distinct from those induced by zzso and zzso
