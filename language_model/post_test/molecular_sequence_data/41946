We describe the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 5-1 gene which codes for an zzso zzso binding zzso finger protein of the zzso zzso Associated zzso zzso The gene contains six zzso zzso a leader zzso zzso four zzso zzso each of them zzso one individual copy of the zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso the zzso as well as the complete zzso of the corresponding zzso Isolation and characterization of distinct zzso revealed that primary transcripts are alternatively zzso thereby leading either to zzso containing different copy numbers of the zzso repeat or, by zzso of an alternative zzso zzso site in front of zzso zzso to an extension of the zzso region between the zzso repeats and the zzso zzso We also describe the zzso of a closely related zzso termed zzso zzso which is located downstream to the zzso 5-1 zzso The general structural organization in both genes is zzso but point zzso should give rise to a zzso zzso protein with a different number of zzso finger zzso
