The induction of zzso zzso by human peripheral blood zzso T cells was zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso with zzso 7 zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso upon zzso with zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, induction of zzso cultures initiated with zzso or zzso yielded only low levels of zzso and virtually zzso levels of zzso or zzso while zzso zzso was zzso No difference was seen in the ability of zzso and zzso zzso grown in zzso to produce zzso In contrast, subdivision of T cells into memory and zzso populations using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that almost all of the potential to zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso resided in the zzso memory zzso zzso of zzso cells appeared to be a direct effect of zzso as zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso had no effect on the levels of zzso zzso The differences observed in the ability of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso production was supported by measurement of zzso zzso levels by zzso The elevated levels of zzso zzso seen in cells cultured with zzso was not due simply to increased viability in these cultures compared with those containing zzso or zzso as these populations showed comparable cloning zzso in zzso zzso + zzso These results demonstrate that zzso in the absence of zzso is a potent initial stimulus for multiple zzso production by human T cells upon zzso
