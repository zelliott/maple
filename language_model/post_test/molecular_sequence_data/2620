zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the purple zzso zzso zzso renders it incapable of zzso growth zzso zzso However, zzso zzso which restore the ability to grow zzso are obtained at relatively high frequency zzso in zzso We examined two such zzso zzso zzso and zzso and found the expected complement of electron transfer proteins minus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Instead of zzso zzso which zzso from zzso between zzso and zzso zzso at about 50 zzso zzso strength in zzso zzso we found a new high zzso potential zzso c in the zzso which zzso with zzso zzso at about 150 zzso zzso zzso The new zzso is more zzso than zzso zzso but is about the same size or slightly smaller zzso zzso The zzso potential of the new zzso from strain zzso zzso zzso is about 70 zzso lower than that of zzso zzso The 280 zzso zzso of the new zzso is smaller than that of zzso zzso which suggests that there is less zzso (the latter has two zzso In zzso zzso of reduction by zzso and zzso zzso show that the zzso of the new zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso and that there is a relatively large positive charge zzso at the site of reduction, despite the overall negative charge of the zzso This behavior is characteristic of zzso zzso and unlike the majority of bacterial zzso zzso Fourteen out of zzso of the zzso zzso acids of the new zzso are identical to the sequence of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were the zzso The zzso and sequence data indicate that the new protein may be a zzso zzso zzso which is not zzso in zzso cells under zzso growth zzso We propose the name zzso zzso zzso for the new zzso produced in the zzso zzso
