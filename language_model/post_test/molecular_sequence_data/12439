zzso zzso strain zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso the zzso from this strain was zzso and the zzso were zzso The structural gene of zzso consisted of zzso base pairs, which zzso a zzso consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 130 zzso which was zzso as a zzso zzso The deduced zzso 14 zzso acids zzso molecular mass of 120 zzso and zzso of zzso of the predicted matured zzso were consistent with those previously found for the zzso zzso from the zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli using the zzso promoter and zzso binding sequence in zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not its own putative promoter and zzso zzso The consensus zzso acid sequence zzso of an active site of the metal zzso including the zzso from zzso zzso and a series of human zzso was found in the zzso protein of the zzso
