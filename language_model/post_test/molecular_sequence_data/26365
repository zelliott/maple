zzso defined synthetic zzso known as multiple zzso zzso systems zzso represent an effective and novel approach for engineering zzso zzso Ten different zzso and zzso zzso models, containing different arrangements and zzso of functional B and/or T helper zzso from the zzso protein of zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso High zzso of zzso and protective immunity against zzso challenge were zzso by zzso containing T and B zzso arranged in tandem and in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may serve as a basis for developing zzso vaccines to induce high levels of zzso against zzso
