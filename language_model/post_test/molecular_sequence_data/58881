zzso Y zzso signals through a family of zzso receptors present in the brain and sympathetic zzso To further our understanding of the genetic elements involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized the human gene zzso the type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso symbol zzso The transcript spans 9 zzso of zzso sequence and is zzso on two zzso As in the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso is interrupted by an intervening sequence ( approximately zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso gene does not contain an zzso analogous to that present in the coding region of the zzso zzso The predicted transcript size ( approximately zzso zzso is consistent with the size observed by Northern zzso The zzso sequence deduced from the open reading frame is identical to that zzso by the zzso The zzso zzso gene maps to human zzso zzso the same region containing the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso may have arisen by gene zzso despite their structural zzso
