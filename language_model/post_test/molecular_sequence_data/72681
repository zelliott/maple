The gamma zzso of zzso translation initiation factor 2 is an zzso protein that plays an essential role in protein zzso We have isolated an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso among three zzso zzso from humans, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso reveals the presence of a domain zzso to the zzso zzso domain that varies in length zzso to zzso from 12 zzso in zzso zzso to 89 zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso these sequences are not essential for zzso However, unlike a zzso a zzso zzso in this domain zzso a slow growth zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also contain a partially zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the G domain that is absent from zzso and other G zzso Unlike the variable zzso domain, these zzso are required for the essential function of zzso
