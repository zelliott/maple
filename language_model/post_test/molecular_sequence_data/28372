Two long stretches of the zzso from zzso zzso were zzso using reverses zzso and the chain termination zzso zzso values were calculated for 11 zzso zzso and a zzso tree constructed from evolutionary distance values zzso Slow and fast growing zzso used in this study form a zzso unit but were zzso well zzso It could be confirmed that zzso zzso is a true member of the slowly growing zzso zzso branching off intermediate to other members of this zzso zzso of the 16 zzso primary structures reveals that the zzso sequence of zzso zzso contains regions of sufficient variation to serve as potential target sites for DNA zzso Here we describe the designation of a DNA zzso and its use in dot zzso zzso experiments were it was directed against bulk zzso isolated from several zzso
