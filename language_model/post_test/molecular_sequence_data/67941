zzso catalyze the zzso of the zzso acid zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso are used in cancer chemotherapy to zzso zzso from the blood, because several zzso zzso depend on zzso zzso for zzso To avoid the immune response against the bacterial zzso it would be beneficial to replace them with human zzso However, unlike the bacterial zzso the human zzso have a zzso zzso value for zzso making them inefficient in depleting the zzso acid from zzso To facilitate the development of human zzso suitable for therapeutic use, we determined the structure of human zzso zzso This zzso is an zzso zzso zzso family member that requires zzso between zzso and zzso to become zzso zzso For most zzso zzso this zzso zzso occurs zzso In contrast, zzso is relatively stable in its zzso state, and this allowed us to observe the structure of the zzso prior to zzso To determine the structure of the zzso state, we exploited our discovery that the free zzso acid zzso promotes complete zzso of zzso Both zzso states were zzso in the absence and presence of the product zzso Together, these structures provide insight into the zzso changes required for zzso and the precise zzso zzso The new understanding of zzso will serve to guide the design of zzso that possess a decreased zzso value for zzso making the human zzso a suitable replacement for the bacterial zzso in cancer zzso
