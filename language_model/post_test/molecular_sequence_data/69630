Five small nuclear zzso zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso participate in precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso To probe their interactions within the active center of the zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso zzso zzso adjacent to either zzso site were zzso and zzso were induced during the course of in zzso zzso An zzso loop sequence in zzso small nuclear zzso contacts zzso 1 before and after the first step of zzso because a zzso between zzso and the last zzso of zzso 1 appeared in the zzso and then in the zzso zzso 1 zzso Both of these zzso species could undergo subsequent zzso indicating that the zzso reflect a functional interaction that is maintained through both reaction zzso The same zzso loop zzso the two zzso for zzso since the first zzso of zzso 2 also became zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso An zzso sequence in zzso zzso became zzso to the zzso second position of the zzso within both the zzso intermediate and the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of these results, several zzso arrangements of small nuclear zzso within the zzso active center can be zzso and additional zzso parallels between the zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso
