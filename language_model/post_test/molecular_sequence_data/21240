zzso and zzso elements zzso which are zzso mobile zzso can zzso transfer between zzso Recently, we identified a zzso island of zzso zzso a common agent of zzso urinary tract infection zzso that possesses all the properties consistent with an zzso This element, designated zzso is highly zzso in other zzso agents of zzso suggesting its zzso We demonstrate that zzso can actively zzso from the zzso in a zzso population of bacteria and that this zzso is zzso zzso Although in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso as integrated into the zzso zzso gene zzso we show that zzso can integrate into either zzso or zzso We determined that zzso transfers at a frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso using plate mating zzso with clinical zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso gene on zzso decreased transfer zzso of zzso to below the limit of zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso also eliminates transfer and demonstrates that this element is indeed zzso and not transferred in zzso as are some zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings clearly demonstrate that zzso can actively zzso from the zzso in an zzso manner, zzso integrate into both zzso zzso zzso and transfer into clinical strains using its own zzso zzso
