When zzso in polarized zzso cells, the envelope zzso zzso of influenza and G of zzso zzso virus are targeted to the zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso To determine which portions of these zzso proteins contain information necessary for their zzso the behavior of two different zzso zzso zzso consisting of all or nearly all the zzso portion of the zzso zzso virus G protein linked to zzso segments of influenza zzso that included its zzso and zzso zzso was studied in zzso cells transformed with the corresponding zzso Both zzso were transported from the zzso zzso to the zzso apparatus and from there to the cell surface with the same rapid zzso as the intact G zzso By using a cell surface zzso zzso with zzso cultured on permeable filters that allows the recovery of labeled protein molecules present in each cell surface domain, it was found that both zzso proteins as well as the intact G protein were delivered almost exclusively to the zzso zzso This polarized distribution of the zzso did not change during a subsequent zzso chase period, although during this time a large fraction of the zzso molecules underwent zzso In addition, a small fraction of the cell zzso zzso molecules shed their zzso segments into the zzso zzso apparently as a result of a zzso zzso zzso on zzso frozen sections and zzso zzso revealed a prominent zzso of the zzso zzso in the lateral cell zzso with lesser amounts on the zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that information specifying the zzso transport of the G zzso is located within the first zzso zzso zzso acids of its zzso zzso
