The zzso position of eight fluorescent zzso zzso from two Lebanese spring waters, which were previously recognized by zzso analysis as members of a new zzso zzso zzso was zzso Except for one strain, the new zzso exhibited internal DNA zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso was measured with the type or reference strains of other zzso zzso The highest DNA binding value was found with zzso zzso strains zzso The zzso content of the DNA of the type strain was 58 zzso A comparison of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence of the strain representing zzso zzso zzso zzso with the sequence of other strains of the zzso zzso revealed that strain zzso zzso was part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a new zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the seven strains of zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been deposited in the Collection de zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains are zzso and zzso homogeneous and can be differentiated from most other fluorescent species by several zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is based mainly on zzso zzso zzso zzso can be differentiated from zzso zzso (all zzso by zzso zzso The clinical significance of zzso zzso is zzso
