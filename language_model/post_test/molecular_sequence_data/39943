zzso clock protein zzso has a zzso zzso structure composed of six identical zzso zzso The opposing zzso regions of the zzso structures zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Previously, we hypothesized that the zzso domain of zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso while the zzso domain is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso et zzso 2004, zzso zzso zzso 279, zzso Here, we tested that hypothesis using the zzso protein of each zzso We prepared zzso and zzso domain proteins zzso and zzso respectively), examined their function by analyzing their zzso or zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso and zzso and we demonstrated the zzso zzso zzso had higher zzso or zzso zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso had zzso activity as zzso whereas zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso whereas zzso did zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso did not require that zzso has a zzso zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso Furthermore, we presented evidence for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso activity due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso when it was zzso with zzso We propose that the zzso zzso consists of a rigid ring structure formed by six zzso zzso with zzso activity and a flexible structure formed by six zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso
