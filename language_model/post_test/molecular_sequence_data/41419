Aquatic and zzso associations of zzso and zzso zzso active in hydrocarbon zzso have been described zzso The question zzso do similar zzso also occur in the zzso Dust samples at the height of zzso were collected from Kuwait City air, and analyzed zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were subsequently characterized according to their zzso zzso gene zzso The hydrocarbon zzso potential of the zzso alone, and in association with the zzso partners, was measured zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso zzso commune and zzso zzso were found associated with dust, and (for zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from coastal zzso All zzso cultures zzso oil zzso bacteria in the magnitude of zzso Each zzso culture had its unique zzso zzso however, the bacterial composition in zzso cultures from air and water was zzso The zzso bacteria were affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cultures, when used as zzso in batch cultures, attenuated crude oil in light and dark, and in the presence of antibiotics and absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso extracts from the zzso cultures enhanced the growth of the pertinent zzso bacteria in batch cultures, with oil vapor as a sole carbon zzso It was concluded that the airborne microbial associations may be effective in zzso atmospheric hydrocarbon pollutants in zzso Like the aquatic and zzso zzso the atmosphere contains zzso associations of zzso and zzso zzso bacteria that are active in hydrocarbon zzso
