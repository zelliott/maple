zzso evidence derived from a zzso zzso DNA analysis indicated that the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is less closely related to the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso than to the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso The zzso position of zzso zzso is supported by the presence of zzso variation A3 alpha and by the presence of zzso as the major zzso a characteristic also found in strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The last six species and zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of zzso in the zzso bridge of the zzso zzso has not been found in the zzso of other zzso species or in members of the zzso zzso Despite the fact that a zzso life cycle is not known, these data support the proposal that zzso zzso should be transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso
