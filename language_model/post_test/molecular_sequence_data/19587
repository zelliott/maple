Selective targeting of cells engaged in pathological activities is a major challenge for medical zzso We generated zzso zzso zzso that exclusively zzso at zzso ranging from 2 to 100 zzso to a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso fluid cells from zzso of zzso arthritis zzso zzso These zzso zzso with zzso expressing wild type zzso zzso only at a relatively high concentration zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed, in 33 out of 43 zzso and zzso arthritis patients, an extra zzso zzso zzso which allows translation of an extra zzso This zzso zzso a zzso change on the cell surface zzso of zzso zzso fluid cells, creating an zzso zzso and zzso the ability to produce zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to induce zzso in zzso fluid cells from zzso patients, but not in peripheral blood zzso from the same patients, in zzso from normal donors or in zzso fluid cells from zzso zzso Furthermore, injection of zzso zzso reduced joint inflammation in zzso mice with zzso zzso These findings show that zzso zzso are both zzso and zzso
