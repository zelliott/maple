To evaluate the association of zzso zzso E zzso and a zzso zzso transfer protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso and with zzso profile in zzso 

A group of 144 normal pregnant women zzso in the third zzso were compared with 51 cases of zzso in the third zzso of zzso zzso E and zzso zzso were determined by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using commercially available zzso LDL size was assessed by zzso gel zzso 

No differences were found in the distribution of subjects with respect to zzso in the zzso E and zzso zzso between control and zzso zzso In the third zzso of gestation (both control and case groups zzso zzso E zzso but not zzso zzso was associated with different zzso and zzso zzso Patients carrying the zzso zzso zzso presented with significantly lower values of LDL cholesterol zzso compared with carriers of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also presented with the highest zzso zzso level, although this was not statistically zzso On the other hand, HDL cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced in zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso presented with the highest total cholesterol and LDL and therefore zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were significantly higher in this group compared with the other zzso 

Neither of our candidate genes showed association with zzso However, zzso E zzso was associated with changes in zzso and zzso profiles in pregnant zzso
