zzso in the zzso gene cause two zzso zzso forms of muscular zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscular zzso type zzso The purpose of this study was to diagnose a Chinese pedigree with the zzso zzso form of muscular zzso and conduct zzso zzso 

The pedigree was diagnosed accurately by using zzso linkage analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso followed by DNA zzso 

zzso linkage analysis showed significant zzso scores with makers from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso of muscle zzso from the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed a novel zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

We identified an zzso Chinese pedigree with zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso is predicted to result in premature termination of translation contributing to zzso zzso
