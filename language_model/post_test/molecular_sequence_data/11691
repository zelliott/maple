To compare 3 zzso an immune complex zzso and an application of the zzso chain reaction zzso for the diagnosis of zzso meningitis zzso 

zzso fluid zzso from 33 patients with zzso and from 34 control patients with infectious and zzso zzso diseases was zzso 

The zzso zzso were either zzso or zzso However, detection of zzso zzso immune complexes correlated strongly with infection, as they were detected in the zzso from zzso of the patients with zzso compared to only 3 zzso of the control zzso zzso analysis, using zzso zzso zzso zzso also strongly correlated with infection, as DNA was amplified from zzso of the samples from patients with zzso but from only 2 zzso of the control zzso Both zzso zzso samples were also positive in the immune complex zzso and came from 2 patients with zzso brain zzso It is conceivable that these patients suffered from zzso tuberculosis with secondary zzso zzso When combining the immune complex zzso with zzso by zzso zzso of the culture positive and zzso of culture negative samples were found to be positive, while maintaining a high zzso 

Parallel analysis to detect zzso immune complexes and zzso zzso DNA by zzso from the zzso of patients may offer a sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of zzso
