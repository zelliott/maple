zzso class I zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a retinal zzso in the zzso of zzso acid, a zzso of gene expression and cell zzso As the first step towards studying the regulation of zzso and its zzso role in the zzso of zzso acid, mouse zzso zzso and zzso clones have been zzso During the cloning process, an additional closely related gene was also isolated and named zzso zzso to its high zzso acid sequence identity zzso with the rat zzso zzso protein zzso zzso spans about 45 zzso in zzso whereas zzso spans about 35 zzso Both genes are composed of 13 zzso and the positions of all the zzso boundaries are zzso with those of human zzso The promoter regions of zzso and zzso demonstrate high sequence similarity with those of human zzso and rat zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is zzso with zzso for both genes being found in the liver, lung and zzso but not in the heart, zzso or zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso was also detected at high levels in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso acids with zzso zzso zzso To examine the relative roles of these two zzso in zzso acid synthesis in zzso zzso zzso were injected with zzso zzso these zzso to zzso the effect on conversion of zzso retinal into zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso acid synthesis in zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Thus our results indicate that zzso can function in zzso acid synthesis under zzso conditions, but that the closely related zzso does not share this zzso
