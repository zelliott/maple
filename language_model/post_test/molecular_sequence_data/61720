We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso which is structurally most zzso to zzso When injected into zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a secondary zzso zzso zzso protein zzso directly with zzso in a competitive manner to prevent binding to the type I zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso induction of alkaline zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso behaves as a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression is restricted to zzso of various developing joint cartilage surfaces and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Adult zzso zzso cells expressed zzso and its levels decreased during zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein to a zzso culture system reduced cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso detected in normal adult joint zzso However, zzso expression was zzso in middle zone zzso in zzso joint cartilage (where zzso markers are zzso zzso depressed zzso zzso when added during the zzso differentiation of cultured zzso cartilage zzso Thus, zzso may play negative roles in the zzso and maturation of zzso zzso in the zzso cartilage of both developing and zzso zzso
