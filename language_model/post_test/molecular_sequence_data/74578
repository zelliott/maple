The zzso zzso proteins zzso play an essential role in regulating various cellular zzso zzso zzso is the first reported protein that has multiple GAP zzso It is exclusively expressed in male germ zzso However, zzso does not possess GAP activities in zzso No zzso zzso has been identified in other zzso In this study, we searched the zzso databases and identified many genes whose protein products possess 2-4 GAP zzso in zzso mouse and zzso These genes all showed sequence similarity to zzso The rat zzso gene zzso all locate on zzso 2 and are all expressed in zzso in zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene zzso also clustered on zzso 3 but zzso analysis showed most are zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment showed that many zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif within the GAP zzso of predicted zzso proteins have zzso suggesting that zzso proteins do not possess GAP zzso We also zzso the evolutionary relations among the rat zzso zzso Based on the zzso analysis data, we proposed that zzso genes and zzso genes have a common zzso
