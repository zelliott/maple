A small blue copper protein with a molecular mass of about zzso zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso which was named zzso contains one zzso The circular zzso spectrum in the region of the zzso of the zzso bond reveals mainly zzso zzso The zzso spectrum in the visible range has three zzso with the main band at 600 zzso The circular zzso spectrum in this region is characterized by four zzso with zzso at 413 and zzso zzso and zzso at 477 zzso as well as zzso zzso The electron zzso resonance spectrum displays a zzso structure which shows a close resemblance to those of zzso The cumulative spectral data agree well with those of other small blue copper proteins with zzso symmetry of the zzso zzso In zzso one can deduce that zzso may adopt a type I copper binding site with two zzso one Met, and one zzso as probable zzso This conclusion is confirmed by the zzso sequence which zzso zzso to other known sequences of type I copper zzso three of the four copper zzso zzso can only be removed from the membrane by mild treatment with zzso This observation indicates that zzso is a peripheral membrane protein which serves as a mobile electron zzso The presence of type I blue copper proteins is zzso might lead to further insights into their zzso zzso
