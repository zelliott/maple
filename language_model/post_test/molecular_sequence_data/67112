zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso play key roles in synaptic transmission throughout the nervous zzso zzso mediate zzso transmission in zzso and they are targets for zzso zzso The zzso agents zzso and zzso which are potent zzso of zzso muscle zzso are partial zzso of zzso muscle zzso To further explore the structural basis of the differential zzso of zzso zzso by zzso we studied the zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso form of the zzso zzso which is a good model for pharmacological studies involving the zzso region of zzso zzso and single-channel current recordings show that zzso is a weak zzso of zzso It is interesting that zzso is a more potent zzso of zzso than zzso zzso To identify zzso of this differential zzso we replaced zzso of the complementary face of the binding site by the zzso zzso in the muscle zzso zzso and evaluated changes in zzso The zzso zzso does not affect the zzso by either zzso or zzso However, it increases zzso values and decreases the zzso response to zzso zzso analysis shows that gating of the zzso channel activated by zzso is profoundly zzso The decreased sensitivity of zzso to zzso agrees with its weak action at muscle zzso indicating that when zzso occupies position 57, as in the zzso muscle zzso zzso behaves as a partial zzso Thus, position 57 located at the complementary face of the binding site plays a key role in the selective zzso of zzso by zzso
