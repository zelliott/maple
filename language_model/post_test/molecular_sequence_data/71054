zzso coli responds to external zzso zzso zzso to zzso by zzso a newly identified, approximately zzso zzso zzso At zzso levels of induction it is one of the most abundant small zzso in the cell and is relatively stable bacterial zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the gene zzso it, designated zzso (for acid shock zzso mapped at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso Analysis of the zzso DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso with a deduced molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso According to zzso analysis, the predicted zzso contains a typical signal sequence of 30 zzso acids and might represent either a zzso or an outer membrane zzso The zzso gene cloned downstream from a zzso promoter was translated in zzso after zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso fusion under a native zzso promoter was reduced approximately zzso in a complex zzso such as zzso zzso versus the minimal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was abolished in the presence of a zzso (a zzso regulatory system, controlling the pho zzso zzso by zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso induction of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso strain was restored by introduction of the zzso with cloned zzso zzso zzso extension analysis of the zzso transcript revealed a region similar to the zzso box (the consensus sequence found in promoters zzso activated by the zzso zzso upstream from the determined zzso zzso The zzso promoter DNA region was demonstrated to bind zzso protein in zzso We discuss our results in terms of how bacteria might employ the zzso regulatory system to sense an external acidity and regulate zzso of the zzso zzso
