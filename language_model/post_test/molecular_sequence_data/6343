We have recently identified on rat zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso sclerosis gene zzso the gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso condition is lethal at around the 13th day of fetal zzso In zzso zzso invariably develop in the first year of zzso zzso zzso develop through multiple stages from early zzso zzso zzso zzso altered zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been found even in the earliest zzso zzso fitting zzso two-hit hypothesis and supporting the hypothesis that zzso is a tumor zzso zzso In this study, zzso deletion of the zzso zzso on rat zzso zzso was observed in 14 of 24 zzso zzso cell zzso This may represent involvement of a second tumor zzso zzso contributing to tumor zzso Considering previous results of studies of zzso deletion of the zzso alpha gene in five of 24 cases zzso and the zzso beta gene in one of 24 cases zzso the order of the genes may be zzso zzso zzso zzso instability was not observed in 26 zzso rat zzso
