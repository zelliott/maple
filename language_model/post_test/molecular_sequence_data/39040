Although zzso of the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in various systems, the respective roles of these zzso in the responses to damaged and/or zzso DNA in zzso have not been delineated zzso Likewise, it is largely unknown how damaged DNA and zzso DNA trigger the pathways that contain these zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso is zzso and activated by the presence of some simple DNA molecules with zzso ends in zzso zzso egg zzso zzso is not affected by zzso an agent that zzso DNA replication zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso responds to DNA replication blocks but not to the presence of zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from egg extracts did not zzso the cell cycle delay induced by zzso DNA zzso These results imply that the cell cycle delay triggered by zzso DNA ends either does not involve zzso or uses a zzso that can act zzso with zzso
