zzso cells missing B zzso is a zzso factor that is expressed in the zzso hormone zzso cells of the zzso zzso Several zzso in zzso have been reported to cause zzso zzso We identified a family with two individuals in two generations zzso and zzso who are affected by zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso in zzso 2 of zzso was identified in both affected individuals that changes zzso at position 106 of the putative zzso domain of zzso to zzso zzso 

We performed zzso analysis of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso The identified zzso zzso was characterized by functional studies including nuclear zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso was performed to generate a three-dimensional structural model for the zzso domain of zzso to predict the structural consequences of the identified zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso failed to interact with the DNA consensus recognition zzso as determined by zzso Furthermore, in comparison with zzso zzso the zzso zzso demonstrated reduced zzso in zzso reporter zzso however, the zzso zzso failed to reduce the activity of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso findings, zzso zzso analysis suggested that replacement of zzso 106 with zzso would interfere with DNA zzso 

We have identified a novel zzso zzso that may explain zzso in our zzso However, the exact mechanism by which this zzso zzso leads to the disease in the described family remains to be zzso
