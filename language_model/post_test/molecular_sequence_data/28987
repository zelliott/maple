The cellular zzso for zzso zzso (or zzso is the founding member of a new class of zzso zzso zzso which include the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and three proteins termed zzso Using a zzso zzso screen we have discovered that the zzso domain of zzso associates strongly and specifically with zzso a light chain of the zzso motor complex, the latter representing the major driving force for retrograde transport of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We confirmed the interaction zzso and by zzso and we mapped the zzso binding site to a zzso motif within the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso was detected in mouse zzso nerve and spinal zzso zzso zzso of central importance for zzso zzso in zzso possibly zzso zzso We propose that the zzso domain may target zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso viruses like zzso zzso rabies virus, and zzso virus all zzso zzso retrograde transport to invade the central nervous zzso Association with zzso and, zzso with the zzso motor complex may offer an explanation for how zzso hijacks the cellular transport machinery to zzso ascend along the zzso to the zzso cell zzso
