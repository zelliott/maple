zzso zzso changes in the zzso state of DNA and are required for many aspects of DNA zzso While the functions of zzso I and II in zzso are well established, the role of zzso III remains poorly zzso We have identified a gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso which shows significant sequence similarity to genes zzso zzso III zzso in other zzso zzso In common with zzso zzso zzso but in contrast to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is essential for long-term cell zzso zzso zzso zzso spores containing a disrupted zzso zzso zzso zzso but then undergo only a limited number of cell zzso Analysis of these zzso zzso revealed evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso where zzso is completed prior to nuclear zzso zzso with the existence of an intimate association zzso identified in zzso ) between zzso III and DNA zzso of the zzso family, deletion of the zzso zzso zzso the only known zzso zzso in zzso suppresses zzso in zzso zzso This conservation of genetic interaction between two widely zzso zzso suggests that the zzso family zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso syndrome genes are likely to act in concert with zzso III zzso in human zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which the association of a zzso zzso and zzso III is important for zzso zzso of late stage zzso to permit faithful zzso segregation during zzso
