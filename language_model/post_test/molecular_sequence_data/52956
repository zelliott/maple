zzso zzso the product of zzso early region 4 zzso open reading frame 6, zzso viral late gene zzso viral DNA zzso zzso double strand break repair, and transformation through multiple interactions with components in infected and transformed zzso Conservation of several zzso and zzso zzso among zzso zzso sequences from a variety of zzso zzso suggests the presence of a zinc binding domain important for zzso zzso with the hypothesis that zzso zzso is a zinc zzso zinc binding by zzso zzso zzso protein was demonstrated in a zinc zzso zzso To investigate the relationship between the potential zzso region and zzso zzso function, a series of zzso genes containing single zzso acid zzso at each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso The zzso proteins were examined for the ability to complement the late protein synthetic zzso of an zzso deletion zzso to physically interact with the viral zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to destabilize the zzso zzso These analyses identified a subset of zzso and zzso zzso required for stimulation of late gene zzso physical interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that a zzso domain zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso physical complex and that the complex is required in late gene expression and for zzso zzso
