The zzso of a zzso highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso was analyzed using zzso DNA sequencing technology and primer zzso The assembled DNA sequences were further verified by restriction zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso The total length of the zzso zzso was determined to be about 124 zzso Genes zzso in the zzso zzso are most closely related to zzso of the zzso zzso including human zzso zzso and zzso monkey zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso 2 zzso and a lineage of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso has a high overall zzso content of zzso in the unique regions and zzso in the zzso repeat zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were not identified in the zzso zzso This study shows that zzso has the smallest zzso zzso characterized to zzso
