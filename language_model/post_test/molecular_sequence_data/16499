zzso zzso zzso by definition, have no close relatives, and therefore no zzso to provide a root to zzso zzso We identify and use a molecular zzso in the sole extant lineage of zzso zzso which separated from other zzso 230 million years zzso We isolated and zzso a partial nuclear copy of the zzso zzso b zzso We confirm the copy is indeed not zzso is older than all extant zzso copies in zzso zzso and is therefore useful as a molecular zzso Under zzso analysis, the nuclear copy places the root of the zzso zzso gene tree between the northern and the southern zzso zzso groups of islands of New Zealand that are the last zzso for zzso This analysis supports a previous zzso rooted zzso gene zzso The zzso DNA tree conflicts with zzso analyses which place a Cook Strait population zzso to all northern and other Cook Strait zzso This population on North Brother Island is the only natural population of extant zzso zzso thus, we suggest that the current species zzso of zzso require further zzso
