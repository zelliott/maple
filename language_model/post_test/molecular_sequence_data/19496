In this study, we have calculated distances between zzso based on our previously developed compositional zzso zzso zzso The study was conducted using zzso of 39 species of zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso we produced two different consensus zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the obtained structure using zzso alphabet with the standard zzso zzso scheme reveals substantial zzso Surprisingly, this is not the case when the same procedure is based on the zzso zzso In this situation, we also found three main zzso different from those in the zzso zzso In particular, one of the clusters includes zzso and zzso bacteria and a part of the considered zzso zzso We speculate that the key factor in the last zzso (based on the zzso zzso is related to zzso two ecological zzso temperature and zzso distinctly explain the zzso revealed by compositional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we assume that this result reflects two zzso zzso evolutionary divergence and superimposed ecological convergence of the zzso albeit another process, horizontal transfer, cannot be excluded as an important contributing zzso
