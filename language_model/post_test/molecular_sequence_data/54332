zzso zzso receptors zzso are the binding sites for zzso drugs, such as nicotine and zzso and are the molecular targets of the selectively zzso zzso In this study we report the full length zzso cloning of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When expressed in zzso zzso as hybrid receptors with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these cat flea zzso zzso formed zzso zzso zzso zzso currents of zzso were resistant to zzso while those of zzso were sensitive to this snake zzso The pharmacological profiles of zzso zzso and the chicken zzso zzso zzso for zzso two zzso and 6 zzso zzso were determined and zzso Particularly remarkable was the finding that zzso was far more sensitive to zzso nicotine and zzso zzso than either zzso or zzso for the anti flea zzso market compound zzso the respective zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso These results were confirmed for another insect species, zzso zzso where the pharmacological profile of the zzso and zzso zzso as hybrid receptors with zzso in zzso zzso expressions resulted in a similar sensitivity pattern as those identified for the zzso zzso zzso Our results show that at least in a zzso hybrid zzso setting, insect zzso zzso zzso higher sensitivity to zzso than zzso zzso which may contribute in zzso to the zzso action of this zzso zzso
