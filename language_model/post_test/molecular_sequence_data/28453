The binding of basic zzso fluorescent peptides to zzso zzso was studied in relation to their zzso zzso Four fluorescent peptides containing zzso or zzso in an zzso basic zzso zzso consisting of four repeated units of zzso zzso were found to have zzso activities against zzso bacteria and to take zzso with fairly high zzso content both in zzso solutions and zzso The zzso zzso data suggested that the zzso existed as a zzso in methanol or zzso but as an zzso in zzso solutions to form an zzso between zzso zzso Upon binding with zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso shifted to a shorter zzso indicating the change in the state of zzso from zzso environment to zzso zzso The zzso data for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso is not deeply buried in the zzso core of the zzso Based on these findings, it is suggested that the peptides may interact with zzso in such a manner that they lie parallel to the surface of the zzso zzso with their zzso regions zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso
