The gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A in zzso zzso has been identified by formation of a hybrid zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on a zzso existing between the zzso of zzso zzso A in these two zzso The sequence of the gene reveals a basic protein with an unusually high zzso content, which may account for the affinity for DNA shown by the zzso No appreciable zzso with any zzso zzso zzso or zzso factors is zzso Complete deletion of the zzso zzso gene leads to viable but slowly growing zzso zzso of the zzso gene halfway into the zzso coding region results in synthesis of a truncated zzso zzso that is incorporated into the zzso The truncated and zzso zzso compete equally for assembly in the zzso zzso although the wild type is zzso zzso
