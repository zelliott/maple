The gene structure of bovine zzso zzso a component of the zzso steroid zzso system in the adrenal cortex, was zzso When we screened a bovine zzso DNA library, using bovine zzso zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated 10 zzso clones covering a continuous 30 zzso zzso region of bovine zzso DNA in which the zzso zzso gene spanned approximately 12 zzso The zzso zzso gene consisted of 12 zzso and all the donor and zzso sites of the zzso junction followed the zzso zzso The zzso initiation site was found to be 79 bases upstream of the translation initiation site by primer extension analysis and putative zzso and zzso boxes, but no typical zzso box, were present in the zzso zzso The zzso region of this gene showed several features characteristic of promoters of zzso zzso The zzso sequence present in the zzso region of genes for zzso and the steroid zzso zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso was present 13 bases upstream from the zzso initiation zzso We analyzed the promoter activity of the zzso region of this zzso using as a reporter the zzso zzso zzso The region between position zzso to zzso was proved necessary for expression of this gene in mouse zzso tumor zzso zzso did not enhance the expression of this bovine gene in the zzso
