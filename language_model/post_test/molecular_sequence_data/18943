A major limitation in the pharmacological treatment of pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is the lack of pulmonary vascular zzso Recent studies have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which specifically homes to zzso pulmonary arteries but not to normal pulmonary vessels or other zzso Some zzso vascular zzso peptides have a unique ability to facilitate transport of zzso drugs into the targeted zzso without requiring physical zzso of the drug to the zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso would selectively enhance the pulmonary vascular effects of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso administered zzso was predominantly detected in cells of remodeled pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso but not zzso effects of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased lung tissue zzso concentration in isolated zzso lungs without increasing pulmonary vascular zzso zzso zzso was also effective in selectively enhancing the pulmonary zzso by zzso and zzso Our results suggest a new paradigm in the treatment of zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso to selectively augment pulmonary vascular effects of zzso drugs without the potentially problematic zzso zzso zzso may be particularly useful as an zzso therapy to selectively enhance the pulmonary vascular efficacy of any ongoing drug treatment in patients with zzso
