The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso and zzso Both genes have an unusual structure in that they are interrupted by a small zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso genes is discussed and compared to the structure of zzso genes of other zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to map the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso genes have a hybrid zzso they are interrupted by an intervening zzso as in replacement zzso zzso genes of higher zzso but their zzso and 3' zzso regions have the properties of zzso zzso zzso the zzso and 3' leader and trailer sequences are short, possess a zzso zzso symmetry element, and a zzso sequence is found 3' to the zzso hairpin zzso This report also provides evidence that both genes are expressed in late zzso phase as well as in S phase and that their expression is temporally coordinated and zzso similar during the cell zzso
