zzso zzso an agent of zzso zzso fever, is an example of a pathogen that can adapt to disparate conditions found when colonizing the zzso host and zzso zzso However, little is known about the genetic factors necessary during the zzso infectious cycle, therefore we developed a genetic system to transform this species of zzso We also identified a zzso gene that was zzso in zzso when zzso zzso was grown in conditions mimicking the tick zzso This 40 zzso protein was predicted to be surface localized and designated the zzso repeat protein A zzso due to the zzso of the zzso acid motif zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso from zzso zzso infected ticks and mice indicated differential regulation of zzso during the zzso infectious zzso The surface zzso was determined, and production of the protein within the zzso zzso of the tick was zzso We then applied a novel genetic system for zzso zzso to zzso zzso and examined the role of the gene product for zzso colonization and the ability to establish zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate the complexity of protein production in a population of zzso within the zzso Additionally, the development of a genetic system is important for future studies to evaluate the requirement of specific zzso zzso genes for zzso colonization and zzso
