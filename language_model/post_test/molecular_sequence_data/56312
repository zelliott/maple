We have studied the requirements for efficient zzso zzso 3' processing in nuclear extract from zzso tissue culture zzso zzso is strongly impaired by zzso in the zzso zzso element that reduce the zzso potential with zzso zzso Moreover, by exchanging the hairpin and zzso elements of two differently processed zzso zzso we find that this difference is exclusively due to the zzso zzso Finally, processing is inhibited by the addition of competitor zzso if these contain a zzso zzso zzso but not if their zzso element is zzso zzso the importance of the hairpin for zzso zzso 3' processing is highly zzso A hairpin zzso of the zzso gene is processed with almost zzso efficiency in extract from zzso mouse zzso cells but is strongly affected in zzso cell zzso whereas an identical hairpin zzso of the zzso gene is affected in both zzso The hairpin zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells can be overcome by a zzso zzso that increases the base zzso to zzso zzso Very similar results were also obtained in zzso competition zzso processing of zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso carrying a zzso hairpin element in extract from zzso but not zzso cells, whereas processing of zzso zzso can be zzso in both zzso With two additional zzso genes we obtained results that were in one case intermediate and in the other similar to those obtained with zzso These results suggest that hairpin binding zzso can zzso support the ability of zzso zzso to form an active processing complex, but zzso not directly involved in the processing zzso
