Following our recent reports of detecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso by the zzso chain reaction, we have improved and simplified the technique for use in diagnostic zzso laboratories and determined, on coded samples, the sensitivity, zzso and zzso of the modified methodology in distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using only three primer pairs for the zzso heavy chain and zzso zzso beta and gamma chain genes on zzso zzso of widely varying zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and observer consistency ranged from zzso The method requires very careful control, particularly to avoid zzso of results because of contamination and zzso amplification, but in its present form is relatively simple and zzso and gives results on single zzso sections within 24 zzso
