The zzso relationships between six zzso of zzso zzso zzso to small zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso all transmitted by zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso group and zzso zzso were analyzed using the zzso zzso gene zzso The target DNA segment was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso product was used either for direct sequencing or was zzso to the zzso II zzso for zzso The length of the zzso zzso gene of all zzso zzso involved in this study was around zzso zzso Two zzso trees were zzso based on the zzso zzso gene sequence of the Chinese zzso only, and Chinese zzso and other species of zzso available in zzso In the first tree, the zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found to be zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to small zzso was found to be composed of two separate species of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was identical to the unidentified zzso zzso described zzso is designated zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso which has not been described zzso is designated zzso zzso zzso 2) in order to avoid zzso In the second tree, zzso zzso zzso 1) was closely related to benign zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso 2) was separated from other zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso transmit at least three species of zzso two which are zzso to sheep and zzso but not zzso and one which is zzso to zzso and zzso but not to sheep and zzso
