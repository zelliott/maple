zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso is generally considered the major regulatory zzso modification in zzso zzso zzso evidence at the zzso and zzso level shows that this modification is also present and functional in zzso We have recently reported the first in-depth zzso zzso zzso from the model zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso zzso is also present on many essential bacterial zzso To test whether this modification is common in zzso here we use a recently developed zzso approach based on zzso enrichment and high accuracy zzso to analyze the zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso zzso We report 81 zzso sites on 79 zzso coli zzso with distribution of zzso zzso sites zzso Despite their zzso distance, zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso show striking similarity in size, classes of zzso zzso and distribution of zzso zzso zzso By combining the two zzso we created the largest zzso zzso database of bacterial zzso to date (available at zzso and used it to study evolutionary conservation of bacterial zzso and zzso sites across the zzso zzso We demonstrate that bacterial zzso and zzso zzso are significantly more zzso than their zzso counterparts, with a number of potential zzso sites zzso from zzso to zzso Our results establish zzso zzso as a common zzso modification in zzso present since the onset of cellular zzso
