The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in a diseased isolate of zzso zzso and sequences of the zzso DNA that overlap and flank the zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso was shown to be derived from the zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso gene and contained most of zzso 1, the whole of zzso 2, and probably the first part of zzso zzso Within zzso 1 there is an open reading frame with the potential to zzso a 323 zzso zzso which contained zzso sequences typical of zzso zzso and DNA zzso The zzso of the zzso in the zzso were located within two zzso direct imperfect repeat zzso one of which comprised the last 7 zzso of zzso 1 and the first 83 zzso of zzso 1 whilst the other comprised the last 7 zzso of zzso 2 and the first 83 zzso of zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso between these two repeats with the crossover point probably within the last 15 zzso
