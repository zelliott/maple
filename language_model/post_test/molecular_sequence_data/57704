zzso roles of untranslated sequences at the 3' ends of zzso zzso which include zzso repeat zzso were investigated in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3' zzso regions were coupled in various arrangements 3' to a zzso gene consisting of a zzso zzso zzso promoter sequence fused zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso structural zzso These genes were introduced into the zzso zzso zzso at the same location by zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso genes fused to zzso or zzso gene 3' zzso repeat sequences in their normal forward zzso accumulated zzso transcripts of a single size, whereas zzso transcripts of zzso sizes accumulated in zzso harboring the same gene lacking an zzso repeat sequence at its 3' zzso Thus, the 3' zzso regions of the zzso and zzso genes can define the location of the 3' zzso of a transcript in zzso In zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso genes fused to multiple zzso repeat sequences in their normal forward zzso only zzso transcripts accumulated that were terminated by the first zzso repeat zzso The latter data suggest that the 3' ends of these zzso are the products of either zzso termination or zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso harboring zzso genes terminated by zzso or zzso gene 3' zzso regions in reversed zzso indicate that transcript 3' end formation in zzso requires zzso sequences located outside the zzso repeat zzso zzso as zzso rates of zzso transcripts were found to be independent of the presence of a 3' zzso repeat zzso zzso stabilization does not appear to be a major in zzso function of these elements in the zzso zzso transcripts zzso
