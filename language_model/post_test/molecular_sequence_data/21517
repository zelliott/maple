The coexistence of distinct zzso within populations has long been investigated in evolutionary zzso Recent studies have identified the genetic basis of distinct zzso but it is poorly understood how the variation in candidate zzso is maintained in natural zzso In this study, we examined fitness consequences and genetic basis of variation in zzso production in a natural population of zzso zzso zzso zzso Half of the individuals in the study population produced zzso while the other half were zzso and the leaf zzso zzso zzso imposed intensive damage to both zzso The fitness of zzso and zzso plants showed no significant differences in the field during two zzso A similar result was obtained when sibling zzso and zzso plants were transplanted at the same field site, whereas a fitness cost of zzso production was detected under a weak zzso zzso Thus, equivalent fitness of zzso and zzso plants under natural zzso allows their coexistence in the contemporary zzso The pattern of zzso of the candidate zzso gene zzso zzso showed no evidence of long-term maintenance of zzso variation within the zzso Although balancing selection under fluctuating zzso environments is often proposed to explain the maintenance of defense variation, the lack of clear evidence of balancing selection in the study population suggests that other factors such as gene flow and neutral process may have played relatively large roles in shaping zzso variation at least for the single population zzso
