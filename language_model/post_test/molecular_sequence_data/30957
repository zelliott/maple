The zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of human zzso that involve the Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso 1973; zzso & zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso contain a zzso gene formed from the fusion of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1988) and zzso genes that results from the zzso zzso of segments of zzso 9 and 22 zzso et zzso zzso The product of this zzso is a 210 zzso zzso termed zzso zzso that possesses an activated zzso zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Studies using long-term zzso culture systems and zzso gene transfer have documented that zzso zzso can stimulate the growth of immature zzso precursor cell types zzso et zzso zzso Young & Witte, zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso exists in zzso complexes in association with a 53 zzso protein termed zzso zzso et zzso zzso Li et zzso zzso Similarly, zzso proteins have been found in zzso complexes containing zzso in cells lacking the zzso zzso et zzso zzso These zzso protein complexes possess an associated zzso protein zzso zzso In this same study, we found that zzso complexes zzso zzso proteins on zzso zzso in zzso zzso et zzso zzso We now present results which demonstrate that zzso zzso is tightly associated with zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso complexes from cells containing the zzso
