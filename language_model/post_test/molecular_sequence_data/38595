We have recently characterized two members of a novel family of zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed exclusively in zzso undergoing zzso Using a differential screening approach we have isolated a third family member, zzso The open reading frame of zzso encodes a protein of 275 zzso zzso consisting essentially of a zzso protein zzso domain zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso have zzso approximately 100 zzso acid zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that while zzso and zzso form zzso resistant complexes, zzso is not associated with either zzso zzso of zzso was induced at zzso persisted during adulthood and was restricted to the zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso
