Fluorescence resonance energy transfer on DNA has been studied for the zzso of distances between specific zzso Two kind of zzso donor and zzso were incorporated on zzso DNA via zzso linkage zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso stability of labeled zzso was slightly dependent on the zzso orientation of zzso however all of the duplex structures were stable under the conditions for zzso zzso The distances between donor and zzso zzso estimated from zzso energy transfer, generally agreed with the expected distance in a zzso DNA for the limiting zzso
