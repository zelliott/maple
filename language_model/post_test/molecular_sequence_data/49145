zzso specificity between zzso growth factors zzso and their receptors zzso is essential for zzso development and is regulated primarily by two alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso the second half of zzso domain 3 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activate only the b zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso portion of zzso bound to zzso zzso contacts between divergent regions in zzso and two zzso zzso in D3 reveal the structural basis by which alternative zzso provides zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso confirms the importance of the observed contacts for zzso biological zzso Interestingly, zzso binding zzso a previously zzso rotation of zzso zzso domain 2 zzso to introduce specific contacts with zzso zzso both zzso and D3 of zzso contribute to the exceptional specificity between zzso and zzso We propose that zzso zzso change in zzso may also play an important role in determining specificity for other zzso zzso
