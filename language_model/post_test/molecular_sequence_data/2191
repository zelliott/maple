The entire gene for chicken cartilage zzso protein zzso has been isolated and characterized by restriction zzso electron zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso The zzso which is present in a single copy in the chicken zzso is 18 zzso pairs long and comprises eight zzso and seven zzso It has two zzso initiation sites, 8 base pairs from each zzso A sequence very zzso to the consensus nuclear factor III zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso sequence are found in the promoter region and zzso is used as a zzso zzso The zzso sequence defines a primary translation product of 493 zzso acids which consists of a zzso acid signal zzso and two large repeated zzso connected by an zzso growth factor zzso zzso acid sequences zzso to those of the repeated zzso are present in the type A repeats of von zzso factor, complement factors B and zzso and in the alpha chains of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structure indicates that the zzso gene may have arisen by zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso The zzso zzso rule cannot be applied for the zzso of the last zzso of the zzso zzso The donor zzso site of zzso G is basically different from the consensus sequence indicating that a novel type of zzso mechanism might exist in zzso
