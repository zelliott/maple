Progressive exercise intolerance was associated with a decreased zzso rate of zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso activity in the muscle zzso of the studied patient and with a thirty zzso increase in the zzso for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sensitivity was not zzso Complex III activity was stable at 37 degrees C, but progressively decreased at 4 degrees zzso An zzso G to A zzso at position zzso of the zzso DNA, resulting in the replacement of the highly zzso zzso in zzso b by zzso was zzso zzso studies showed increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities under the zzso of type I zzso After partial extraction of zzso from the muscle, the residual zzso contained a lower percentage of the zzso than did whole muscle, suggesting that the percentage of zzso is higher in the most readily extracted zzso most probably present under the zzso In the current 8 zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso lies at the end of the sixth zzso zzso facing the zzso space and close to the presumed sites of interaction between zzso zzso the zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso Since zzso experiments showed a relative decrease in the proportions of these three zzso in the patient's zzso compared with the other complex III zzso it is probable that the complex III instability and the relative decrease in these zzso are related to the zzso The relationship between the decrease in the apparent affinity for zzso A and the instability of complex III are zzso
