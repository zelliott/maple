zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso the first step in the zzso pathways of zzso and zzso This zzso zzso the zzso zzso group of zzso and zzso to produce zzso zzso which exhibit greatly reduced biological zzso A three-dimensional zzso structure of zzso based on the crystal structures of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was generated and used for zzso study with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso among zzso family which zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have been shown to participate in the zzso zzso Based on the molecular interactions observed from zzso structure of zzso we further propose that zzso in zzso is important in properly positioning the zzso group of zzso by hydrogen bonding with the zzso oxygen atom of zzso This zzso is found to be less zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso to zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried zzso The activity of zzso zzso was not zzso whereas those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were comparable to or higher than the wild zzso This indicates that the zzso oxygen or nitrogen atom at position 148 of zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso group of zzso through hydrogen bonding for zzso zzso
