zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso and zzso are proteins of approximately zzso zzso acids each that are attached to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, a zzso releases an zzso zzso of approximately 500 zzso acids that contains a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso enters the nucleus and stimulates zzso of genes zzso the low density zzso zzso and zzso of cholesterol zzso Prior evidence indicates that the zzso are attached to zzso by virtue of an zzso segment located approximately 80 zzso acids to the zzso side of the zzso zzso This segment contains two long zzso sequences separated by a short zzso sequence of approximately 30 zzso zzso We have proposed a hairpin model in which the two zzso sequences span the zzso separated by the short zzso sequence which projects into the zzso of the zzso (the zzso zzso The model predicts that the zzso and zzso segments face the zzso To test this model, we constructed a zzso zzso human zzso with zzso tags at the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso The zzso region was zzso with a newly developed zzso zzso against this zzso zzso membrane zzso were isolated from cells expressing the zzso version of zzso zzso treatment of these zzso destroyed the zzso and zzso segments and reduced the zzso zzso to a size consistent with protection of the zzso sequence plus the two zzso zzso The zzso zzso tag contained two potential sites for zzso zzso The size of the zzso zzso was reduced by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso indicating that this segment was located in the zzso of the zzso where it was zzso These data provide strong support for the hairpin zzso
