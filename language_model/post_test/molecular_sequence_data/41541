The use of zzso methods for obtaining DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso allows genetic studies to be performed without affecting the survival of the studied zzso In this study, we compared two methods of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane or zzso in several zzso species of different size: zzso zzso zzso zzso six species of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated the integrity of the DNA extracted by sequencing fragments of zzso and nuclear genes and by generating amplified zzso length zzso markers zzso In all cases, we obtained an adequate amount of DNA zzso range zzso zzso We obtained identical DNA sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso for all zzso The differences in the coding of zzso markers between the zzso were similar to those reported for zzso of the same type of sample in similar analyses in other species of zzso In conclusion, the use of zzso zzso is a trustworthy and inexpensive method to obtain DNA for zzso and nuclear sequencing and zzso zzso Given the types of markers zzso zzso zzso may be used for zzso zzso and population genetic studies, even in small zzso zzso zzso
