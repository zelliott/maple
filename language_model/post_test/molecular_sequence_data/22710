zzso is a zzso zzso protein sharing sequence similarity to the zzso protein family of zzso zzso that are involved in bacterial cell wall zzso The zzso role of zzso is zzso In this study we have zzso the zzso of mouse zzso zzso and produced zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso When zzso was expressed as an zzso zzso fusion protein zzso full-length zzso protein was recovered by zzso affinity zzso as determined by zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as a zzso zzso fusion protein or with either an zzso or zzso zzso resulted in zzso degradation of the protein and we were not able to detect full-length zzso Analysis of zzso by zzso transform infrared zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso and turns, consistent with a zzso secondary zzso These results show that zzso can be expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli and suggest that zzso was properly zzso
