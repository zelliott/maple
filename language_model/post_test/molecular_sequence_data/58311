zzso zzso in the Kit zzso zzso zzso have been identified in both zzso and human mast cell zzso One zzso Kit zzso zzso a zzso for zzso acid at zzso zzso zzso and is frequently observed in human zzso zzso at the equivalent position in the zzso zzso zzso involving a substitution of zzso for zzso acid zzso has been described in the mouse zzso cell line zzso We have investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso by this zzso zzso of this zzso Kit zzso zzso zzso in a mast cell line led to the selective zzso zzso of a zzso protein and the degradation, through the zzso zzso pathway, of a zzso zzso The zzso protein was identified as the zzso zzso domain 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of signaling by Kit and other zzso zzso and the protein product of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso also altered the sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, this zzso activates the zzso potential of Kit by a novel mechanism involving an zzso in Kit zzso recognition and the degradation of zzso an zzso of the Kit signaling zzso
