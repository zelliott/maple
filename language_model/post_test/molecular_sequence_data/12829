The zzso and probably the zzso of folate zzso depend upon the expression of the zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso Evidence for the existence of multiple forms of this zzso and the need to define the control mechanisms zzso of expression levels in normal and zzso cells has focused attention on the zzso zzso these zzso The organization of the zzso locus for the human zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso The complete zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso region, zzso leader zzso coding region, and zzso region were distributed on 15 zzso stretching over zzso zzso of zzso zzso All of the restriction fragments found in zzso human zzso DNA could be accounted for by fragments contained on the isolated zzso zzso Likewise, Southern analysis of the zzso human zzso DNA that zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso cell line indicated that the same gene had been integrated in all of three independently derived zzso We conclude that the zzso locus that we now report appears to be the only gene zzso zzso sequences in the human zzso
