Multiple sclerosis zzso one of the most common chronic zzso diseases, is characterized by the presence of multiple plaques of zzso throughout the central nervous zzso Although the zzso of the disease has not been established, it is believed to involve zzso zzso We have examined zzso from patients with zzso for the presence of zzso to zzso from brain and zzso zzso analysis of soluble fraction of proteins from bovine brain revealed a prominent band at 45 zzso stained with zzso of zzso patients with zzso In two patients with zzso serum zzso zzso during zzso were higher compared with those when the patients were in zzso These zzso were zzso in zzso fluid of our zzso patients and additionally were absent in zzso of patients with other neurological diseases and normal control zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of the soluble fraction from bovine retinal rod outer segments revealed a prominent protein band at 48 zzso stained with zzso zzso This zzso was zzso to zzso from bovine retinal outer segments and identified as zzso Additionally, zzso from zzso patients reacted with zzso zzso 1, a zzso protein zzso to zzso that is found in various zzso Using limited zzso of zzso and a competitive zzso test with a synthetic zzso we identified the recognition zzso for zzso in zzso of zzso patients at a dominant zzso site on zzso located at the zzso region of the zzso We suggest that the presence of circulating zzso zzso with zzso or zzso may be related to the course of zzso zzso
