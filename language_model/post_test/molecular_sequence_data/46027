The zzso gene is essential for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the archetype in an zzso group of genes essential for DNA damage zzso By catalyzing the replacement of replication protein A with zzso on zzso DNA, zzso likely promotes strand invasion of a zzso DNA zzso by zzso zzso Although the sequence and in zzso functions of zzso zzso are zzso with those of zzso one difference is the presence of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We identified two novel zzso zzso from the zzso gene that are expressed in adult mouse zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in tissue culture cells zzso the frequency of zzso that uses a sister zzso zzso To characterize this dominant zzso further, the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso was truncated to model the zzso zzso zzso The same dominant sister zzso zzso zzso seen in zzso cells was also observed in zzso Furthermore, repair from a zzso zzso is reduced in zzso zzso that the choice of alternative repair pathways may be controlled by these zzso In addition, a dominant DNA repair zzso induced by one of the zzso in zzso is suppressed by zzso of zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction is zzso
