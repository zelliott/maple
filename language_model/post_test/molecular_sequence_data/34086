In previous cancer vaccine clinical trials targeting zzso induction of specific zzso zzso responses did not consistently lead to clinical zzso Considering the critical role of zzso zzso help in generating zzso zzso integration of zzso zzso zzso responses may enhance the efficacy of zzso cancer zzso Human zzso zzso zzso is emerging as an attractive zzso target zzso of zzso T zzso zzso because it is one of the most frequent zzso zzso in many ethnic zzso In this article, we aimed to zzso zzso zzso zzso responses against zzso in cancer zzso 

We generated a human zzso artificial zzso cell zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso T zzso The number, zzso zzso function, and in zzso longevity of generated zzso T cells were zzso 

We first determined previously unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso to which sustained zzso recall responses were induced in zzso by using zzso In contrast, zzso induced in zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells from cancer zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso cells were able to recognize zzso tumors in a zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso cells nor zzso cells were induced by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso immunity with sufficient functional zzso can be induced from cancer zzso The development of strategies to zzso induce both zzso and zzso zzso responses against zzso is warranted for optimal zzso cancer zzso
