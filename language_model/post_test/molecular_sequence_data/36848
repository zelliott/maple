The de zzso zzso leukemia fulfilling the zzso criteria is still an uncommonly recognized zzso of acute zzso Many studies have shown that the zzso zzso events may occur at a zzso stem cell level and clinical observations reveal that the zzso zzso are diverse zzso The zzso using zzso zzso against zzso specific surface zzso and the zzso detection of zzso zzso reaction do not provide sufficiently useful information to determine whether a zzso leukemia is zzso zzso zzso or zzso More sophisticated techniques are required to further characterize zzso zzso zzso In this review, we emphasize that zzso zzso cells can be zzso into two zzso one with the zzso zzso and the other without it, and that the expression of zzso zzso in the blasts could be a useful marker for the identification of mature zzso It seems that the patients with blasts expressing zzso zzso will have a longer survival and a better response to chemotherapy than those without zzso We further discuss the fact that the detection of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A- and zzso and zzso beta 1 in zzso zzso cells will be useful to clarify the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and zzso in the bone zzso Furthermore, we reviewed data showing that zzso zzso and mast cell lineages share the nuclear zzso factor known as zzso zzso or zzso We suggest that characterization of zzso leukemia should be performed using zzso zzso against zzso zzso and mast cell zzso
