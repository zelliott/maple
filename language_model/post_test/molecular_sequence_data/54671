zzso zzso zzso zzso a newly identified zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso The regulatory proteins involved in zzso zzso in fat tissue are not fully identified and zzso The zzso switch gene 2 zzso is an inhibitor of zzso activity by interacting with zzso through the zzso domain of zzso Here, for the first time, we have cloned the coding sequence of zzso zzso for the chicken, zzso and zzso zzso comparisons with zzso revealed that the avian zzso also have a zzso zzso zzso Avian zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso relative to other tested zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso greater in the zzso than in the zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gradually increased during differentiation of chicken zzso in culture zzso zzso zzso However, there is zzso expression in embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso before zzso that generally have an increased capacity of cell zzso which indicates it has an important role in zzso differentiation rather than zzso For a better understanding of how zzso responds to environmental zzso chickens were zzso for 24 h and then zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tissue was dramatically decreased zzso zzso zzso in the chickens and quail after a zzso zzso period, and increased to the control level after zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso expression was induced zzso zzso zzso after the zzso zzso period and rapidly returned to the control level during the zzso zzso These data indicate that changes in zzso activities of zzso tissue in zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso as an inhibitor of zzso
