zzso regulatory factor zzso 7 in zzso is known to be a key player in regulating the type I zzso zzso response to viral infection as a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes zzso In this study, a full-length zzso of Japanese flounder, zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso is zzso in zzso with an open reading frame zzso of zzso that encodes 430 zzso acid zzso The putative zzso acid sequence shows the highest zzso to fish zzso with zzso identity and possesses a zzso domain zzso an zzso association domain zzso and a zzso domain of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso cluster of zzso zzso consists of only four zzso which is a characteristic unique to all fish zzso zzso The zzso was expressed zzso in all tested zzso of healthy zzso with high levels in head zzso zzso zzso zzso and skin, and moderately expressed in zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso was proved to be capable of zzso fish type I zzso promoter in zzso zzso A quantitative real time zzso zzso was employed to monitor the gene expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso head kidney and zzso Both genes were zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso disease virus zzso though to a much lesser extent in zzso zzso Further, their zzso zzso were similar in fish zzso but different in zzso zzso These data provide insights into the functions of zzso and imply a difference in zzso signaling pathways in zzso response between cultured cells and live zzso
