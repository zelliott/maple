We have investigated miniature zzso zzso elements zzso of the zzso family and corresponding zzso master elements that could potentially facilitate their zzso in the zzso of the garden pea zzso zzso zzso The population of pea zzso zzso consists of zzso copies dispersed in the zzso Judging from a sequence analysis of 17 isolated zzso elements and their zzso zzso regions, the elements are relatively uniform in size and sequence and occur in the vicinity of genes as well as within repetitive zzso zzso zzso of several elements was detected among various zzso zzso suggesting they were still zzso active during diversification of these zzso The identification of several zzso elements zzso harboring intact open reading zzso capable of zzso a zzso further supports a recent zzso of the zzso zzso Using zzso sequences as a zzso probe, we estimated that there are about 50 zzso sequences in the pea zzso Among the 5 elements zzso 3 distinct zzso showing mutual similarities within their zzso regions, but otherwise zzso in zzso were distinguished and designated as zzso to zzso The terminal zzso repeats zzso of these zzso zzso differed in their zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso ranged from 9 zzso in zzso to 30 zzso in zzso which zzso to the complete zzso zzso zzso Based on this feature, the zzso elements are believed to be the most likely candidates for the master elements of the zzso zzso in zzso
