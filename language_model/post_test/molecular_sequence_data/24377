zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso an early zzso marker of exposure to the environmental zzso zzso zzso or zzso were investigated during zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and used to detect zzso zzso in zzso exposed to zzso (1 or 10 zzso zzso of zzso activity was dependent on age and state of zzso zzso zzso was observed by 15 zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso activity were not detected until 3 days zzso and after zzso as determined by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso In contrast to zzso zzso induction of zzso and activity was detected in juvenile zzso (3 days zzso after 6 zzso of zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso and activity during development may be a general regulatory zzso as similar zzso expression of this gene was demonstrated in mouse zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso zzso zzso during zzso Our data suggest that zzso induction of zzso activity is regulated zzso in developing and mature zzso
