The zzso of zzso zzso in the host cells of the sea zzso zzso zzso involves retention of zzso on and exclusion of zzso from the zzso One predicted consequence of this differential zzso association is the constant membrane fusion of zzso with zzso zzso in the absence of parallel membrane retrieval and the subsequent formation of spacious zzso which zzso contradicts the common zzso To solve this zzso we determined whether membrane fusion occurs between zzso and zzso zzso and whether zzso recycling is involved in zzso zzso By using the zzso detection system, we found evidence for zzso zzso zzso Cloning and characterization of zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso is associated with both the early zzso and the zzso recycling zzso and its normal function is required for the organization of the recycling zzso zzso localized zzso to the zzso zzso partially overlapping with zzso zzso zzso a treatment that impaired zzso photosynthesis also abolished zzso association of zzso Furthermore, zzso was quickly recruited to newly formed zzso but prolonged association only occurred in those harboring live zzso We propose that zzso retention on the zzso is an essential part of the mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso
