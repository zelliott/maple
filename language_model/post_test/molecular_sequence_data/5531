zzso zzso zzso resistant to several zzso agent classes including zzso have been reported with increasing frequency throughout the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 259 clinical zzso from South Africa were determined, and 166 of these 259 zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso resistance was found to be more strongly correlated with zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso than was zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes from 11 zzso zzso 64 to 512 zzso clinical zzso of zzso zzso were amplified by zzso and the zzso sequences were zzso Two main groups of zzso to the zzso zzso gene were zzso Both groups shared six zzso acid changes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first group included two extra changes zzso and zzso and the second group was characterized by six additional zzso acid changes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA from resistant zzso and cloned zzso products of the genes zzso resistant zzso zzso were capable of transforming a susceptible strain of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The inhibitor profiles of zzso zzso zzso from resistant and susceptible zzso revealed that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso more resistant zzso zzso doses zzso zzso to zzso zzso than that from susceptible strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that one zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso of zzso The resistant zzso zzso were characterized by highly zzso redundant changes in the zzso zzso suggesting that the genes zzso resistant zzso zzso may have evolved as a result of zzso or zzso zzso by zzso
