zzso of zzso proteins yields 8-11 zzso peptides that are displayed on the zzso surface as zzso class I zzso The remarkably precise zzso of zzso peptides from their precursor zzso raises the question of whether specific zzso zzso influence presentation zzso Here we addressed this question by analyzing the generation of zzso or influenza zzso complexes in zzso expressing precursors with varying zzso or zzso zzso zzso We find that T cell responses were not significantly affected by varying the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In contrast, presentation of zzso complexes was inhibited with the addition of a single zzso zzso zzso The most dramatic zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso zzso These zzso variations in presentation activity could not be accounted for by differences in the zzso activity of corresponding synthetic peptides but were zzso to the relative amounts of naturally processed peptides recovered in the cell zzso These findings suggest differences in the zzso of zzso vs zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso during zzso zzso The strong influence of specific zzso zzso zzso could be an important factor affecting the choice of peptides presented to T cells on the zzso zzso
