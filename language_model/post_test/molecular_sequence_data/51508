We have used an in zzso zzso system to determine the effects of a large number of zzso in the highly zzso zzso terminal domain of the zzso U2 zzso on zzso zzso Whereas many zzso have little or no functional consequence, base zzso in two regions were found to have drastic effects on zzso zzso A previously zzso function for the U2 zzso in the second step of zzso was found by zzso of the absolutely zzso sequence zzso upstream of the branch point recognition zzso The effects of these zzso suggest the formation of a structure involving the U2 zzso similar to the zzso site found in the zzso core of group I zzso
