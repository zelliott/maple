The sheep zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso skin zzso in zzso zzso encodes an zzso of zzso zzso that, whilst it closely resembles zzso zzso zzso % zzso acid zzso shows only 75 % zzso acid identity to human zzso zzso The zzso potential of zzso zzso in human zzso infection was investigated by examining its zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to have equivalent zzso effects on the synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but differed in their abilities to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed differences from zzso in zzso predicted to interact with zzso zzso 2 zzso whereas there were very few differences in the zzso predicted to interact with zzso These findings suggest that the partial ability of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso proliferation may be due to the absence of critical zzso that mediate the interaction with human zzso
