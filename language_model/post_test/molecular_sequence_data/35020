zzso zzso zzso are proteins found in zzso snake zzso zzso zzso and belong to a class of proteins which presents a zzso zzso scaffold but are zzso zzso These proteins (also known as zzso zzso exert a pronounced local zzso effect and are not neutralized by zzso being their study relevant in terms of medical and scientific zzso Despite of the several studies reported in the literature for this class of proteins only a partial consensus has been achieved concerning their zzso zzso In this work, we present a comprehensive structural and functional study with the zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which includes: zzso high-resolution crystal zzso zzso dynamic light scattering and zzso studies in order to confirm its biological zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies and, zzso comparative studies with other zzso These comparative analyses let us to get important insights into the role of zzso zzso acid, previously indicated as responsible for zzso zzso zzso and added important elements to establish the correct biological assembly for this class of zzso Furthermore, we show two unique sequential features of zzso (an zzso acid zzso and a zzso in comparison to all zzso zzso that lead to a distinct way of zzso binding at the zzso zzso channel and also, allowed the presence of an additional zzso zzso in this zzso These facts suggest a possible particular mode of binding for zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso channel, a feature that may directly affect the design of zzso zzso for zzso
