The complete sequence zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso of the land snail zzso zzso was zzso It contains 13 zzso two zzso and 22 zzso zzso zzso of these genes are zzso by one and 13 genes by the other zzso The gene arrangement shares almost no similarities with that of two other zzso for which the complete gene content and arrangement are known, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the protein and zzso gene order is similar to that of another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features include the zzso zzso the absence of lengthy zzso regions (there are only 141 zzso zzso zzso at different gene borders, the longest zzso sequence being 42 zzso zzso the presence of several overlapping genes zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso structures and other stem and loop structures within zzso An zzso editing system acting on zzso must necessarily be invoked for zzso extension of the overlapping zzso Due to these features, and also because of the small size of its genes zzso it contains the smallest zzso genes among the known zzso it is one of the most compact zzso zzso known to zzso
