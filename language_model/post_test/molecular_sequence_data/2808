An zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 has been constructed which carries the zzso gene from zzso coli within the coding sequence of gene zzso which is in the long unique region of the zzso In a zzso growth curve experiment this zzso (called in zzso grew as well as the zzso zzso parent virus, indicating that the zzso gene is zzso for growth in tissue zzso Analysis of in zzso DNA with restriction zzso showed no zzso changes from the zzso apart from the zzso zzso of cells infected with in zzso possessed levels of viral DNA zzso and alkaline zzso activities similar to those infected with the zzso but unlike the zzso had negligible zzso zzso activity, suggesting strongly that the product of the zzso gene is the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso gene of zzso coli was recently published, and the zzso zzso acid sequence of this shows clear similarity to that of zzso confirming our zzso
