Natural sequence variation of the zzso related anonymous protein zzso gene of zzso zzso has been investigated by DNA analysis following the zzso chain reaction amplification, and this shows the gene to be highly zzso The region containing the sequence motif zzso zzso common to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Elsewhere in the zzso over 50 zzso acid zzso are described including the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso repeating motif between zzso acid zzso 352 and zzso Only one silent zzso was zzso Most zzso changes that occur in the first two zzso positions result in conservative zzso acid zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis was used to examine inheritance of zzso in a cross between the zzso and zzso clones of zzso zzso Out of nine progeny zzso four possessed the zzso gene and five the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso to zzso zzso Previous work has shown that a zzso region of zzso 13 from the zzso parent (marked by the zzso zzso was zzso strongly in this zzso The zzso zzso however, is over 1 zzso away from this zzso region and exhibits no such linkage because of zzso zzso Five geographically separate zzso shared the same zzso sequence as well as the same zzso of the zzso region from the zzso zzso The correlation between independent markers in these zzso suggests that they have a common zzso
