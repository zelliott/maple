zzso zzso is the zzso surface zzso of zzso zzso and consists of a capped zzso of zzso repeating units attached through a zzso core to a zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso repeating unit synthesis using zzso and other zzso zzso with long zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso transferred zzso to two zzso zzso zzso the zzso core from zzso and zzso a zzso terminating in the same zzso zzso as zzso zzso The activity is zzso with respect to zzso but not with respect to zzso suggesting that more than zzso is required in the zzso zzso for optimal zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso express lower levels of zzso by zzso the addition of the repeating zzso We compared the relative activity of the initiating zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart, using zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso more active relative to the zzso zzso These results provide evidence that the initiating zzso is zzso regulated during the zzso of the zzso zzso
