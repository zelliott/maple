The mass zzso methods with a stable isotope as the internal standard in quantitative zzso have been developed quickly in recent zzso But the use of some stable isotope zzso is limited by the relative high price and synthetic zzso We have developed a new method for quantitative zzso research by using metal element zzso tags zzso coupled with mass zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso coupled to primary zzso of zzso and the zzso is then zzso to the rare earth metals Y and zzso The zzso peptides are mixed and analyzed by zzso zzso are zzso by measuring the relative signal zzso for the Y and zzso tag pairs in zzso which permits the zzso of the original proteins generating the corresponding zzso The protein is then identified by the corresponding zzso sequence from its zzso zzso The zzso method was evaluated by using standard proteins as model zzso The experimental results showed that metal zzso peptides zzso zzso successfully during the zzso zzso zzso The relative zzso results were accurate for proteins using zzso zzso modification of the zzso of peptides promoted cleaner fragmentation zzso zzso zzso in mass zzso and improved the confidence level of protein zzso The zzso strategy provides a simple, zzso and economical alternative to current mass tagging technologies zzso
