We have produced a fine restriction map around the locus zzso zzso designated zzso a probe to this zzso zzso identifies a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso tandem repeats and detects DNA zzso associated with zzso muscular zzso zzso We developed an zzso zzso which maps zzso zzso to zzso and used this to isolate a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso library and a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso contain the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso library was produced from zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso encompassing zzso and one of zzso linking zzso and zzso and extending zzso to the zzso zzso detected by zzso A fine restriction map of both these zzso has been generated, allowing the orientation of the zzso zzso rearranged in zzso to be zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the integrity of zzso and the map of this zzso zzso a probe to the zzso region of the tandem repeat zzso identified a zzso sequence zzso to zzso however, zzso does not detect this additional zzso zzso islands were identified between zzso and zzso and within each copy of the tandem zzso The probe zzso detected each copy of the repeat zzso suggesting there is zzso present in every copy of the zzso zzso
