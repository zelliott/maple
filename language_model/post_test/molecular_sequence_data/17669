We report the isolation and sequencing of zzso clones encompassing the entire zzso II gene from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso This gene is closely related to, but significant different from the zzso I gene that we have described zzso These two genes represent the entire complement of zzso sequences in this zzso and are expressed in a zzso zzso The zzso gene is present as a single copy and encodes a zzso zzso with a predicted length of 450 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso it contains two zzso which are in identical positions to those of zzso but are about one-third zzso The deduced zzso protein is very similar to zzso I zzso zzso acid zzso except for notable differences across zzso zzso In addition, unlike the great majority of zzso genes (including zzso zzso does not zzso a terminal zzso zzso Using zzso field gel zzso we demonstrate that the two zzso zzso together with the single zzso zzso are zzso all residing on different zzso We assign zzso to zzso 9, zzso to zzso 4 and zzso to zzso zzso
