zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso from the same precursor and share high levels of structural similarities with overlapping biological zzso In this study, the first zzso zzso was isolated and characterized in zzso To study this zzso using zzso zzso we have also characterized the goldfish zzso and, surprisingly, a shorter transcript lacking the zzso coding region was zzso A zzso precursor without the zzso coding sequence has never before been zzso zzso functional expression of the zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells revealed that it could be activated by human zzso zzso effective concentration zzso 43 zzso and to a lesser extent human zzso zzso 133 zzso and zzso zzso 166 zzso but not fish and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that, similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso the zzso isolated in this study is able to interact with goldfish zzso and its zzso extended form, zzso with zzso values 93 and 43 zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso brain, and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene is primarily expressed in the zzso and to a lesser extend in the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role, notably in the regulation of zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a zzso zzso indicating that the functions of zzso and zzso could be zzso by their own zzso in addition to zzso zzso
