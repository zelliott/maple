The zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso by binding to the surface zzso zzso zzso on many cell types including zzso presenting zzso Two zzso comprise the zzso zzso segment, with all zzso functions localized to the zzso domain that contains a single zzso site at zzso We have defined an important role for the zzso zzso attached to zzso of this domain in zzso zzso interactions and also characterize its zzso zzso Analysis of zzso soluble zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso substitution demonstrates that neither zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso or zzso zzso directed at native zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are the only zzso occupying zzso when soluble zzso is expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso Based on a model of human zzso secondary structure, we propose that zzso is required for stabilizing domain 1 in the human zzso Thus, zzso is essential for human zzso zzso zzso
