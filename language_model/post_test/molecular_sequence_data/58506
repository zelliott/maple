Earlier experiments in this laboratory identified a highly expressed zzso protein in both mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso Here, we demonstrate that this protein is zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso branch of the zzso pathway, based on zzso and zzso isolation and sequence analysis of mouse cornea protein and zzso samples, zzso While expressed at low levels in a number of zzso the zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a zzso higher level in the adult mouse zzso The area of most abundant expression was localized to the cornea zzso cell layer by in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed zzso protein abundance in the cornea and indicated that zzso may comprise as much as zzso of the total soluble protein of the adult mouse zzso zzso cornea extracts exhibited a zzso high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased progressively through cornea zzso as shown by Northern zzso in zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were expressed at low levels in the cornea prior to eye zzso while markedly increased levels were observed after eye zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso may be a cornea zzso and suggest that the zzso paradigm and concept of gene sharing, once thought to be restricted to the zzso apply to other transparent zzso zzso
