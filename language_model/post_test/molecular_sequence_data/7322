zzso transcription, DNA amplification, and progeny production of human zzso zzso are closely linked to zzso zzso differentiation in patient zzso Because zzso differentiated zzso have exited the cell cycle for days or weeks and because viral DNA synthesis requires the host DNA replication machinery, zzso must have a mechanism to reactivate the essential host zzso In this study, we show via acute zzso zzso infection that an intact zzso gene of either high-risk or of low-risk zzso zzso under the control of its respective native zzso induced zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso expression in the zzso cells of zzso raft cultures of primary human zzso zzso zzso The cellular differentiation program was zzso by the viral zzso it was essential for high zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, extensive host zzso DNA replication took place in differentiated cells of zzso zzso raft cultures and of patient zzso zzso caused by zzso These results indicate that the main function of the zzso protein is to reactivate host DNA replication machinery to support viral replication in zzso zzso zzso
