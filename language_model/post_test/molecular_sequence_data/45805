The zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso pathogen zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso culture using differential display reverse zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso showed a significant degree of similarity to zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was significantly enhanced by zzso heavy metals and zzso However, no significant transcript response was obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli exhibited high zzso activity with zzso and zzso zzso as zzso compared with zzso but no zzso activity was zzso zzso was zzso in zzso during the first day zzso suggesting the potential involvement of this zzso in zzso zzso mechanisms during host plant zzso
