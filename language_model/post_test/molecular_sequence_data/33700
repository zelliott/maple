To investigate zzso DNA damage response in higher plants, we used a genetic screen to isolate zzso zzso zzso that are hypersensitive to zzso zzso and isolated a zzso zzso termed zzso (for sensitive to zzso 2) that also displayed hypersensitivity to zzso and zzso This zzso is reminiscent of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was mapped to the bottom of zzso 5, and contains an zzso in an unknown gene zzso as zzso zzso analysis with specific zzso to zzso detected a transcript consisting of 12 zzso The transcript is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso acid protein that contains a zzso domain and two instances of predicted zzso target sequences within the zzso zzso Fusion proteins consisting of the predicted zzso and zzso or zzso domain of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso with each other in a zzso zzso system, suggesting that the proteins form a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso fusion protein to monitor zzso activity by zzso activity, was weaker in the zzso plant after zzso than in the zzso plants and was similar to that in the zzso plants, suggesting that the zzso zzso is defective in zzso arrest in response to DNA zzso Overall, these results suggest that the gene disrupted in the zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso
