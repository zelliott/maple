Members of the zzso zzso family are involved in zzso signaling during zzso in the zzso We identified chicken zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and examined spatial and zzso expression patterns in the chick zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso is intensely expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the limb bud at stages 20 to zzso The transcripts are confined to the zzso end of the zzso region at stages 25 to zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso limb zzso at stages 25 to 27, while zzso and zzso expressions are uniform in the limb bud at these zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso No expression signal for zzso is zzso in the zzso at stages 20 to zzso The differential expression patterns of the zzso family, together with zzso restricted expression of the zzso family members in the developing zzso suggest distinct but overlapping functions to zzso zzso signal implicated in cellular interaction during zzso
