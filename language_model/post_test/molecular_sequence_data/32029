Human influenza viruses can be isolated efficiently from clinical samples using zzso canine kidney zzso zzso However, this process is known to induce zzso in the virus as it adapts to this zzso zzso We performed a systematic study to record the pattern of zzso zzso observed across the whole influenza zzso zzso zzso clinical samples collected from zzso were included in the zzso Two full influenza zzso were obtained for each zzso one from virus obtained directly from the clinical sample and one from the matching isolate cultured in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences obtained from each of these sources showed that zzso of the 77 zzso had acquired at least one zzso zzso The presence or absence of these zzso was independent of viral load or sample origin zzso versus zzso zzso all the five zzso zzso zzso were observed at the zzso 1 domain only, particularly within or zzso to the zzso binding sites and zzso site of the zzso Furthermore, zzso of the 77 zzso had undergone a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso has been found to be associated with reduced drug sensitivity towards the zzso zzso and increased viral zzso binding efficiency to host zzso In contrast, none of the zzso sequences obtained directly from the clinical samples contained the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso may be an indicator of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso can confound the interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor resistance results when these are based on zzso zzso Such zzso are currently in routine use in the WHO influenza vaccine and zzso surveillance zzso Potential data interpretation zzso can therefore be avoided by careful exclusion of such zzso zzso after further sequence zzso
