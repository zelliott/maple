A 469 base pair zzso DNA, which encodes the mature region of a snake cardiotoxic zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the liver of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso the mature zzso region showed a high sequence zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso family as expected from the high zzso of their zzso acid zzso In contrast, both of the upper and lower zzso sequences of zzso gene and the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso precursor were quite different from those of zzso zzso These results suggest that the ancestral gene and zzso zzso of zzso are different from those of zzso
