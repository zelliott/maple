The relative importance of secondary structure interactions versus zzso interactions for zzso and guiding the folding process is a matter for zzso zzso models of protein folding assign an important role to local contacts in protein folding and zzso On the other hand, simplistic lattice simulations find that secondary structure is mainly the product of protein zzso and that zzso of folding speed seems to require small contributions of local contacts to the stability of the folded zzso To examine the extent to which secondary structure zzso influence protein folding and stability, we have designed zzso that introduce a strong non-native zzso propensity in the first 19 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins have the same three-dimensional structure as the zzso but they are less stable and have less zzso folding zzso There seems to be a relationship between the non-native zzso propensity and the zzso of the zzso zzso This suggests that in the zzso ensemble under native conditions there is a significant proportion of compact structures with non-native secondary zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso interactions can overcome strong non-native secondary structure zzso and, more important, that zzso of folding speed and zzso requires the latter to be relatively zzso
