The zzso acid zzso was zzso from rat zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso with zzso and zzso into zzso by removing the zzso from mixed zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso was zzso with respect to the protein zzso the zzso ratio and the number of passages through a single zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso zzso reaction zzso by zzso not zzso zzso zzso activity was found at pH zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly inhibited the zzso whereas the zzso acid analogue zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were efficiently zzso from outside to inside and from inside to outside the zzso as zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso from outside to zzso The zzso for zzso on the external and internal side of the zzso was zzso and 11 zzso zzso the values were not influenced by the type of the counter zzso The zzso is functionally zzso and it is zzso inserted into the zzso membrane with an orientation corresponding to that of the native zzso By a zzso kinetic analysis of the zzso zzso a random simultaneous mechanism was zzso The zzso zzso was strongly zzso by internal zzso zzso and, to a lower extent, by zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso functionally zzso to the zzso zzso
