zzso immune responses depend upon recognition by zzso of short zzso sequences bound to major zzso complex zzso zzso Since zzso zzso proteins can be presented to the immune system in this way, any zzso structure may function as a potentially zzso zzso Fusion proteins arising as a result of zzso zzso provide good candidates for novel zzso zzso recognizable by the host immune zzso Recent molecular cloning data have demonstrated the existence of zzso zzso several different potential zzso fusion proteins in both acute and chronic zzso and analysis of a number of these sequences suggests the presence of a newly defined zzso acid motif associated with zzso and T cell zzso zzso data suggest the possibility of generating in zzso zzso responses to synthetic peptides representing the zzso zzso It remains to be seen whether tumor cells themselves can be recognized by zzso in zzso and in zzso and, if so, how leukemia cells escape such immune surveillance in zzso
