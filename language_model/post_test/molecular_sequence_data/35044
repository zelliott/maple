zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso are involved in growth regulation and the innate immune zzso However, the microbial binding and zzso activities of zzso remain zzso Here, we investigate the zzso role and zzso activity of a zzso from the beet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis predicted that mature zzso consists of 24 zzso acid zzso including 2 zzso zzso During zzso zzso development, zzso is zzso expressed in the fat body during the zzso and adult stages but not in zzso zzso expression is zzso by zzso and zzso by juvenile hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso insect cells zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso expression is acutely induced in the fat body after injection with zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso zzso but not to zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso shows zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso these results provide insight into the role of zzso during the innate immune response following microbial infection, and zzso they suggest a novel function for zzso as a direct zzso agent against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso
