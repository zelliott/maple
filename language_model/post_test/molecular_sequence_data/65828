The preliminary observation of zzso of zzso transcripts during zzso zzso infection prompted us to speculate on the potential importance of zzso in the early stage of zzso To provide a framework for answering these questions, two zzso zzso of channel zzso zzso zzso were identified, zzso and zzso The complete zzso sequences of zzso A and zzso B zzso consisted of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences revealed each had one open reading frame potentially zzso zzso zzso acids with calculated molecular mass of zzso and 216 zzso acids with calculated molecular mass of zzso for zzso A and zzso B, zzso The degrees of conservation of channel zzso zzso A and zzso B zzso acid sequences to counterparts of other species ranged from 74 to zzso and 80 to zzso zzso Both zzso A and zzso B transcripts were zzso expressed in all zzso of channel zzso examined in this zzso These results provide valuable information not only for further exploring the roles of zzso in fish immune responses to infection, but also for production of zzso zzso for channel zzso zzso
