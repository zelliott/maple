In the present study, competitive zzso library screening zzso and zzso zzso analyses were employed to identify zzso expressed genes in zzso rat zzso zzso The preliminary screening of 100 zzso plaques by zzso identified zzso clones with differential zzso zzso analysis of the isolated clones verified differential expression in zzso distinct zzso Confirmation of these zzso genes was conducted by performing reverse zzso chain zzso and a total of 160 genes were confirmed after comparing six rat zzso zzso and three normal rat zzso zzso zzso of these showed lower expression in the zzso while the remaining 101 were zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing 588 known genes revealed an additional 33 zzso expressed genes in these zzso zzso most of the identified genes demonstrated relatively zzso zzso or zzso in individual zzso Many of the altered genes determined by zzso zzso analysis were zzso tumor zzso zzso or genes involved in cell cycle control and zzso zzso identified many others not previously associated with zzso zzso including a novel gene named zzso zzso studies to determine the zzso of this gene expression approach for detecting potential zzso for cancer zzso was evaluated in rat zzso tumors obtained from animals treated with zzso a potent zzso zzso When genes exhibiting differential expression as determined by zzso or zzso zzso analysis were examined in control and zzso tumors, expression of 19 genes was found to be modulated significantly in tumors treated with zzso Further investigations into these identified genes should contribute significantly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rat zzso zzso In addition, the identified genes may become useful targets for drug development and potential zzso for monitoring treatment and prevention of breast cancer in zzso
