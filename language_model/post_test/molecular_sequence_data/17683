We have developed a culture system for long-term growth of human zzso cells exhibiting an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and molecular properties of the final zzso cell populations indicated that they consist of three main zzso a) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso of all zzso genes and expressing variable amount of the zzso beta zzso and zzso sized T delta zzso b) zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso of the gamma and delta genes and expressing high levels of mature gamma and delta zzso c) zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso of all zzso genes and expressing high levels of mature alpha and beta zzso We took advantage of the high number of available zzso cells to zzso 1) the origin of the zzso delta zzso delta gene expression in zzso zzso clones and type I zzso cultures revealed six delta transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which varied in number and relative abundance in the different zzso None of the six known V delta was expressed and the delta locus was retained in its zzso zzso suggesting that the delta expression is due to a partially rearranged or zzso zzso 2) the origin of the zzso truncated T beta zzso We isolated two different clone types from a type I zzso cell zzso zzso a) zzso clones consisting of one of three J beta regions and the corresponding C beta 1 or C beta 2 zzso b) zzso and zzso zzso containing as yet unidentified zzso zzso The presence of zzso in zzso clones suggests that they derive from zzso transcribed from a promoter in the zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that only one of the isolated clones had the potential to code a short T beta zzso
