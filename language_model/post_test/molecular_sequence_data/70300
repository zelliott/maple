The assembly of zzso complexes at zzso zzso and zzso likely zzso zzso in the path of the DNA zzso We present evidence that zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso regulates the activity of the zzso promoter primarily through an effect on DNA zzso zzso binds to and zzso a phased DNA bend at three sites in this zzso By use of a truncated zzso promoter activity containing a single functional zzso site, we show that zzso zzso promoter activity but that repression does not appear to be an intrinsic property of the protein in this zzso Moreover, when the orientation of the zzso site is zzso zzso activates the same zzso zzso by zzso is also alleviated by changing the relative phasing of zzso sites on either side of zzso We conclude that the principal function of zzso in this promoter is to bend DNA to regulate contact between other zzso Thus, zzso represents a new class of zzso factors that influences promoter function by affecting promoter structure rather than by directly zzso the zzso zzso We provide evidence that the product of the male sex determination gene zzso may also belong to this class of structural zzso
