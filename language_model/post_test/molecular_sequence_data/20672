The presence of variable degrees of cognitive zzso extending from severe mental zzso to specific deficits, in patients with zzso is a zzso zzso However, molecular basis underlying mental zzso and its severity remain poorly understood and still a matter of zzso Here, we report one of the largest study based on the comparison of clinical, zzso molecular and expression data in a large cohort of 81 patients affected with zzso muscular zzso zzso and Becker muscular zzso zzso bearing zzso predicted to affect either all zzso products, including zzso or all zzso products, except zzso In addition to the consistent data defining molecular basis underlying mental zzso in zzso we show that zzso patients with MR have zzso that significantly affect zzso expression or with zzso located in zzso 75 and zzso We also show that zzso upstream to zzso 62, with zzso zzso predicted to lead to a zzso of all zzso products, except zzso zzso are zzso zzso with normal or borderline cognitive zzso Altogether, these reliable zzso correlations in combination with zzso zzso and protein expression studies, strongly indicate that zzso of all zzso products is systematically associated with severe form of zzso and zzso deficit is a factor that contributes in the severity of MR and may account for a shift of 2 zzso downward of the intelligence zzso
