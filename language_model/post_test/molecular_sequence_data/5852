The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso region, spanning the coding region for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso by the zzso is the first of three sequential zzso required for conversion of zzso zzso which is produced from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso branch of the zzso The deduced protein sequence is 484 zzso acid zzso long with a zzso of zzso The zzso has a high degree of zzso with genes zzso zzso proteins from other zzso zzso We now show that the relative position of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso is unique compared to the other zzso zzso which have a zzso branch of the zzso
