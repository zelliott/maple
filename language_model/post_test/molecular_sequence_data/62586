zzso disease is the most severe zzso progressive zzso a unique form of zzso with zzso zzso of an abnormal form of zzso and a neurodegenerative disorder exhibiting an unusual generalized zzso zzso The disease is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes two zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso having alternate zzso zzso one localized in the zzso zzso zzso and the other in the zzso To date, all documented disease zzso including the knockout mouse model zzso have been in the segment of the protein common to both zzso It is therefore not known whether dysfunction of the zzso zzso or both zzso leads to the zzso In the present work, we identify six novel zzso one of which, zzso zzso is the first zzso specific to the zzso zzso zzso implicating this zzso in disease zzso To confirm this zzso deleterious effect on zzso we studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso and function and show a drastic reduction in its zzso activity, despite maintenance of its location at the zzso zzso
