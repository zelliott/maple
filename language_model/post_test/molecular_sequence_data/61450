Chicken zzso zzso zzso the zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso a zzso not expressed by their zzso zzso zzso clones coding for the full protein are here structurally and functionally zzso We first determined that the promoter sequence markedly differs from that reported for the zzso zzso and we confirmed by zzso DNA Southern analysis the zzso of our zzso This is of relevance since we have identified another zzso gene within the region of zzso indicating thereby the existence of a zzso cluster within the same zzso zzso By transient zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso the region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was shown to be strongly active, specifically in zzso zzso and not in zzso zzso zzso elements for several potential zzso factors lay within this zzso Among those, zzso zzso zzso was shown to be involved in the regulation of the zzso gene during zzso zzso as indicated by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso site zzso and functional interference zzso
