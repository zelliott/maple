Unlike the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso preparations of the higher plant zzso zzso 60 zzso consist of roughly equal amounts of two divergent zzso alpha and zzso The functional significance of these zzso their structural organization into zzso and their interactions with the unique zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso have not been zzso Toward this goal, we have cloned the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso of pea zzso zzso expressed them individually in zzso coli, and subjected the zzso zzso to in zzso zzso zzso In the absence of other factors, neither zzso zzso or in zzso spontaneously assembles into a higher order zzso However, in the presence of zzso the beta zzso form zzso in a cooperative reaction that is zzso by zzso In contrast, alpha zzso only assemble in the presence of beta zzso Although beta and zzso zzso are indistinguishable by electron zzso and can both assist protein zzso their zzso for zzso are entirely zzso Similar to the authentic zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are functionally compatible with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the folding reaction zzso by the zzso beta zzso is only efficient with zzso zzso The ability to zzso two types of functional zzso in zzso provides a unique zzso which will allow us to investigate the mechanism of this unusual zzso zzso
