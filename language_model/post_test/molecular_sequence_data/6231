We isolated the zzso of a novel protein zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso from its zzso zzso zzso has the three zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso which are found in proteins within the zzso zzso and are responsible for zzso zzso zzso has a zzso stretch at its zzso zzso which may serve as a signal zzso and the putative zzso zzso zzso retention signal zzso at its zzso zzso indicating that zzso is an zzso resident zzso Northern blots showed that zzso is zzso expressed in cells actively zzso proteins and that the expression of zzso is zzso These results suggested that zzso has zzso activity of zzso bonds against zzso and that it acts as a catalyst of protein folding in the zzso of the zzso
