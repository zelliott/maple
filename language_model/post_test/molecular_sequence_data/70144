zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated in part by zzso protein zzso When zzso is partially zzso from illuminated spinach leaves and incubated with zzso the zzso is zzso by a zzso protein zzso In this report, zzso from zzso zzso of in zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso Three distinct zzso were zzso zzso sequencing of the major zzso (which contained zzso zzso of the total zzso identified the zzso acid sequence as zzso This sequence zzso to zzso 156 to 170 of the deduced zzso acid sequence of spinach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 190, zzso and zzso zzso Quick, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification of the zzso zzso was accomplished by manual zzso zzso The two other zzso which each contained less than zzso of the total zzso were not zzso An zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of zzso which contains the major zzso site was a zzso for the protein zzso which zzso with zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis of this zzso showed the major zzso was present but not the other zzso suggesting that other peptides are derived from a site other than zzso These results provide additional indirect evidence for the presence of multiple zzso sites in zzso
