zzso metamorphosis is often marked by dramatic zzso and zzso changes of the zzso zzso along with major shifts in diet following development from zzso to zzso Little is known about how these zzso changes impact the gut zzso of the host zzso The metamorphosis of the sea zzso zzso zzso from a sedentary zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso is characterized by major zzso and zzso changes to all organ zzso The transformation of the zzso canal includes closure of the zzso esophagus and the physical isolation of the zzso from the remainder of the gut, which results in a zzso period that can last up to 8 zzso To determine how the gut zzso is affected by zzso the microbial communities of feeding and zzso zzso and zzso sea zzso were surveyed using both zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that the gut of the zzso zzso contains a greater diversity of bacteria than that of the zzso zzso with the zzso gut being dominated by zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso from both the zzso and zzso gut revealed that at least five distinct species were zzso zzso characterization of these zzso revealed that over half were capable of sheep red blood cell zzso but all were capable of trout red blood cell zzso This suggests that the enrichment of zzso that accompanies metamorphosis is likely related to the zzso lifestyle of the zzso sea zzso
