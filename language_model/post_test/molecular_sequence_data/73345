A synthetic zzso zzso acid zzso zzso based on the zzso acid sequence of the influenza zzso fusion zzso was coupled to a zzso zzso anchor by zzso of an zzso zzso side zzso The secondary structure of zzso incorporated into zzso zzso zzso was not measurably affected by zzso but increased membrane penetration was indicated by zzso zzso At outer zzso zzso up to 10 zzso zzso formed stable zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and fusion of these zzso were demonstrated by fluorescent zzso mixing and contents leakage zzso and by zzso electron zzso zzso zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso decreasing zzso inclusion of cholesterol, and incorporation of zzso into the inner zzso as well as the outer zzso of the zzso Fusion of zzso bearing zzso with zzso ghosts was demonstrated by zzso mixing and zzso zzso
