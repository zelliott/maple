We describe a new method for the transfer of zzso zzso to zzso in which complex zzso in the form of zzso zzso acid, is removed from an available zzso zzso and reacted with a zzso via an zzso zzso zzso A family of zzso zzso zzso to the side chain of zzso was obtained from zzso by zzso zzso and zzso as previously zzso A zzso zzso group was specifically placed on these molecules by reaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Separately, the zzso group of the zzso zzso was specifically zzso by reaction with zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso at pH 8 gave in high yield the corresponding zzso whose structures were confirmed by mass zzso A zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso was also zzso by this zzso The principle advantage of this method is the efficiency of the reaction even when performed with zzso amounts of the two molecules at low zzso It should be feasible to extend this chemistry to larger zzso
