The moss zzso zzso has 11 zzso editing sites in zzso zzso We previously identified six zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso proteins as zzso editing factors for nine out of 11 zzso In this study, we identified two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso editing zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in a complete loss of zzso editing at two neighboring sites, zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To confirm this result, we further generated zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso interference zzso zzso The generated zzso lines displayed reduced levels of zzso editing at both zzso and zzso zzso Next, we characterized the function of zzso by constructing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction in the level of zzso zzso When zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso zzso zzso editing levels were restored to the zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is an editing factor for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein bound to the upstream sequence of the editing site that was created by zzso of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso editing occurs after zzso of zzso zzso Our present and previous data provide the first evidence that all 11 known editing events require at least eight zzso zzso zzso proteins in the moss zzso
