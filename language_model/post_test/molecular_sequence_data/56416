A principal zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso lies within the zzso loop of zzso the external major envelope zzso zzso loop peptides derived from two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The binding of both zzso zzso and zzso to the surfaces of zzso clone 8 cells was demonstrated by flow zzso zzso Both the peptides (more than 2 zzso bound to the cells (2 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso was specifically inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of both of the zzso zzso loop peptides was enhanced by the addition of zzso zzso In addition, the peptides were employed as zzso on affinity zzso A major zzso loop binding protein zzso was zzso from the membrane soluble fraction of zzso cells by successive application to two different zzso loop zzso zzso consisted of two major zzso (32 and 33 zzso The zzso profile of zzso did not change under zzso conditions, but only a single band was observed after analysis on native zzso The major peak of the zzso as determined by size exclusion zzso was broad and the estimated relative molecular mass was much larger than 33 zzso suggesting that zzso comprises several zzso Taken together, we confirmed that the zzso loop peptides are useful in the characterization of zzso of which they are zzso zzso
