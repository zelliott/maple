The gene germ zzso zzso plays an important role in the early differentiation of germ cells in zzso We isolated the zzso zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso showed 92, 68 and zzso overall identity to zzso human and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed stronger expression in the zzso and weaker expression in zzso brain, heart, liver and muscle zzso zzso in early zzso indicates the presence of maternal zzso By in zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be detected in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso revealed expression of zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
