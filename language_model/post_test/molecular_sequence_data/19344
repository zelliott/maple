A novel zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of Lake zzso by enrichment in opposing zzso of methane and zzso followed by traditional isolation zzso zzso zzso zzso grows on methane or methanol as its sole carbon and energy zzso It is a zzso zzso zzso zzso showing typical zzso zzso arranged in zzso zzso are zzso elliptical or zzso and occur often in zzso zzso zzso zzso grows at low oxygen zzso and in zzso of methane and zzso It can grow on medium free of bound zzso possesses the zzso gene and fixes atmospheric nitrogen at low oxygen zzso It grows at neutral pH and at temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees zzso zzso it is most closely related to the zzso zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing 94 and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene sequence of strain zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso gene sequences of zzso strains zzso % similar to zzso zzso LW 12 by deduced zzso acid sequence zzso The DNA zzso content is zzso zzso and the major cellular fatty acid is 16 : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described as the type strain of a novel species within a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
