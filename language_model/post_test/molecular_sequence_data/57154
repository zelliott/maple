zzso zzso which generates putative novel second zzso zzso is a zzso composed of regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso alpha zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 domain, a region with zzso to the product of the zzso cluster region zzso zzso and a zzso portion of the zzso which contains two zzso zzso separated by a zzso zzso In this study a panel of zzso zzso zzso was raised against zzso bovine zzso alpha to probe its zzso structure in relation to zzso These zzso were characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso for nine zzso were mapped in relation to the domain structure of zzso alpha using zzso protein fragments expressed in zzso These zzso were then used to map the sites on zzso alpha which are involved in growth factor zzso zzso Two interesting classes of functional zzso were zzso First, zzso zzso whose zzso lies within the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso blocked the interaction of zzso alpha with activated zzso zzso zzso Second, real-time binding experiments using zzso zzso showed that zzso alpha by itself could specifically bind certain zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso with zzso located in the zzso zzso region blocked the binding of lipids to this zzso The relevance of these observations to understanding the relationship of structure to function of zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso
