Using a zzso zzso zzso to determine the sites of zzso zzso in DNA we have shown that zzso sites which are accessible to zzso DNA zzso zzso in naked DNA become zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso coli or zzso zzso are bound at their recognition DNA sequences zzso operator or zzso promoter, zzso These results show that zzso can be used as zzso zzso to study specific zzso zzso
