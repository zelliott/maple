A novel method was developed for cloning the DNA from a representative of zzso zzso organisms zzso This procedure zzso random amplified zzso DNA zzso and basic zzso DNA zzso It consisted of amplification of total DNA from diseased plants using one zzso primer with arbitrary sequence and separation of zzso products in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso origin was zzso then recovered from the gel and cloned into the specifically designed zzso zzso zzso With this method, a DNA zzso of the zzso isolate of zzso zzso zzso was zzso Southern zzso zzso revealed that most of the DNA in the unique zzso band was derived from zzso zzso from zzso zzso used for screening showed that approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our approach is relatively simple, quite efficient, and not limited by the amount of diseased material zzso It does not depend on DNA sequence information for primer design and does not rely on restriction zzso for zzso In addition, it can be used directly for disease diagnosis and for differentiation of closely related zzso Our system may serve as a model for cloning zzso of other fastidious plant zzso
