Human tumor necrosis factor is initially zzso as a zzso zzso anchored by a zzso region of the leader zzso This zzso domain has been previously localized to extend from zzso to zzso based on zzso zzso To functionally determine the nature of this domain, we have generated a series of zzso zzso zzso in which either half or both halves of this zzso domain is zzso These zzso were analyzed both by the ability of their zzso to direct translation in a zzso system and by cellular zzso of their zzso zzso following zzso of zzso zzso We determined that the zzso protein with deletion of the zzso region of the zzso domain zzso to zzso was zzso into zzso and localized on the inner surface of the zzso membrane in a fashion identical to that of the parental zzso In contrast, the zzso with deletion of either the zzso aspect zzso to zzso or of virtually the entire zzso domain were not localized in the zzso zzso experiments indicated that only the zzso whose zzso products were zzso across zzso zzso gave rise to zzso zzso and matured zzso Thus, the functions of membrane targeting and orientation prior to zzso processing can be fulfilled by the sequence zzso to zzso of the zzso domain, but not by the sequence zzso to zzso
