zzso zzso zzso zzso and related strains zzso zzso possess strong zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso strain is virtually indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso generally considered to be zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify the genetic marker to distinguish between zzso zzso zzso group and zzso zzso and to provide a rapid means of identifying zzso strains belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso to identify a genetic marker to distinguish between the two zzso As a result, 300 and 500 zzso ITS regions of zzso zzso zzso were found to be almost identical with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison analysis between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the two zzso located zzso are absent in both ITS regions of zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence difference, we have designed specific zzso zzso with a minor modification to the primer sequence that can differentiate between zzso zzso zzso zzso group and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso method has been developed to identify zzso zzso zzso group, providing a rapid and sensitive means of determining the zzso ability of detected bacterial zzso 

The substitution of one zzso located at the third position to the zzso in the primer zzso enhanced the specificity of the zzso method while retaining sufficient zzso The zzso gap identified in this study appeared to serve as a useful genetic marker that can differentiate 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso group strains from its close relatives that exhibit no zzso zzso
