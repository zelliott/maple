A full-length zzso transcript zzso to zzso zzso of zzso transport growth zzso of the AAA zzso associated with a variety of cellular zzso zzso family has been identified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was induced by 200 zzso zzso or higher in cultured ice plant zzso When cultured ice plant cells were grown in a high zzso zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso expression zzso At the whole plant level, zzso expression of zzso was observed in roots, zzso leaves and floral zzso zzso of 400 zzso zzso increased the transcript level in roots and zzso The expression of zzso , a zzso gene in zzso , was down regulated by salt zzso Under salt stress, zzso was zzso expressed in the outer zzso of roots and stems and in the zzso zzso cells of zzso The zzso transcript was zzso expressed in zzso and zzso of the developing floral zzso zzso of the full-length or zzso deletion of zzso was able to complement the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso , which is defective in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif of zzso a structure required for membrane association, resulted in greatly reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso also increased the zzso ability of zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso deletion decreased the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso under high zzso environments are zzso
