zzso zzso to zzso may cause severe zzso zzso Based on recent zzso and zzso sequence information, we have developed a zzso testing methodology to determine the zzso zzso of fetuses at risk for zzso zzso disease from zzso fluid zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso testing was undertaken in a fetus at risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso had risen between zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso readings also rose slightly between zzso zzso zzso Both maternal serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided early indications that the fetus might have the zzso zzso Using zzso cells obtained at the first zzso DNA was extracted and analyzed for the zzso gene zzso The use of two primer pairs from distinct sites in the zzso zzso plus analysis of parental DNA, greatly minimized the possibility of false zzso The fetus was determined to be zzso by molecular zzso The DNA result was confirmed by zzso typing at zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso fetuses provides accurate and timely information that is useful in the management of zzso zzso
