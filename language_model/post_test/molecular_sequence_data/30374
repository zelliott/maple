The Class II major zzso molecules are implicated in the initiation of zzso zzso responses by zzso T zzso In order to study the structure and function of zzso and zzso Class II zzso strategies were developed with the intent of generating zzso forms of these molecules by in zzso zzso of the respective zzso A full length zzso zzso an zzso human zzso zzso was zzso to introduce a premature stop zzso corresponding to zzso zzso located 8 zzso acids zzso terminal to the start of the predicted zzso zzso Following zzso gene transfer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Surface expression of the zzso form of zzso was detected under the same zzso In an attempt to create a zzso form of the mouse Class II zzso zzso the zzso zzso the connecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both the alpha and beta chains were replaced by the corresponding zzso from the gene zzso a zzso Class zzso zzso zzso Transfer of these genes into mouse L cells failed to generate zzso zzso I-A zzso In view of the zzso of zzso reported in other zzso studies, it is concluded that very subtle differences in the structure of the zzso can influence the zzso zzso or transport of the zzso zzso In addition, the assembly of zzso Class II molecules may require membrane zzso of the separate chains or some other contribution from the zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso
