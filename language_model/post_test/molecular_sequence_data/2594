We describe in this report a unique zzso clone isolated from a zzso library of the human zzso cell line zzso The clone which was isolated by using a zzso B virus zzso zzso probe consists of zzso DNA sequences flanked by cellular sequences on either zzso zzso zzso sequences are zzso to a nuclear integrate of the zzso gene zzso zzso and are in zzso orientation with respect to the viral zzso The 3' sequences are zzso to the zzso sequences in the previously described zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso or clones zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso sequencing and zzso data suggest that the zzso from which the zzso was derived was spliced and could have been transcribed from one of the zzso zzso Consensus promoter sequences located on the zzso strand of the zzso zzso and predicted to lie zzso to the zzso sequences might have allowed the expression of the zzso
