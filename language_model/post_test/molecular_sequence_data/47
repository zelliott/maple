A novel zzso of 120 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso and its gene zzso was analyzed and zzso It displayed wide zzso specificity for zzso with a series of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso alcohol using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all tested zzso and showed maximum activity at pH zzso and 55 degrees zzso It was stable at pH zzso below 40 degrees zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene consists of an zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to 118 zzso zzso which indicates that zzso is a modular zzso in the zzso zzso family 2, including zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The possible zzso and zzso sites of zzso were estimated to be zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli and zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso showed similar zzso characteristics to natural zzso
