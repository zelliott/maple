Plasma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are predominantly determined by inherited sequences within or closely linked to the zzso gene zzso Much of the zzso zzso in zzso levels is likely to originate at the level of zzso gene zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso promoter is extremely weak and does not exhibit common functional variations that affect plasma zzso zzso In a search for additional zzso gene control zzso we have identified two fragments with zzso activity within the zzso pair zzso zzso region that coincide with zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso observed in liver zzso of mice expressing a human zzso zzso Neither zzso exhibits tissue zzso zzso activity was mapped to a zzso pair zzso containing nine zzso zzso elements zzso that stimulates zzso expression from the zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the ubiquitous zzso factor zzso plays a major role in the function of this zzso but no single site was indispensable for zzso zzso comprises part of the regulatory region of an inactive long zzso zzso element 1 zzso raising the possibility that zzso zzso can influence the regulation of adjacent zzso zzso zzso activity was localized to a zzso pair zzso that stimulates zzso from the zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso within an zzso site or either of two elements composed of direct repeats of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso in this sequence completely abolished zzso zzso Both nuclear hormone zzso elements were shown to bind zzso zzso receptors and other members of the nuclear zzso family, suggesting that this zzso may mediate drug and hormone zzso
