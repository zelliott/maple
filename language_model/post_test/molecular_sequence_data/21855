The solution space exponential explosion caused by the zzso of the candidate solutions maybe is the biggest obstacle in DNA zzso In the paper, a new zzso DNA computing model for graph zzso coloring problem is presented based on two zzso 1) ordering the zzso sequence for a given graph in such a way that any two consecutive labeled zzso i and zzso should be adjacent in the graph as much as zzso 2) reducing the number of zzso representing colors according to the zzso of the given zzso A graph with 12 zzso without zzso is solved and its initial solution space includes only 283 DNA zzso which is zzso of zzso (the worst zzso
