Wood harvested from trees is one of the most widely zzso natural materials on our zzso Recent environmental issues have prompted an increase in the demand for wood, especially as a cost-effective and renewable resource for industry and energy, so it is important to understand the process of wood zzso In the present study, we focused on zzso zzso zzso zzso domain protein genes which are zzso to well-known zzso zzso factors regulating the differentiation of zzso vessels and fiber zzso From zzso analysis, we isolated 16 zzso zzso domain protein zzso and named them zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that 12 zzso (also called zzso genes including both zzso and zzso groups were expressed in developing zzso tissue and zzso zzso whereas in primary zzso vessels, only zzso genes of the zzso group were zzso By using the zzso induction system of zzso zzso a master regulator of zzso vessel element zzso many zzso genes functioning in zzso vessel differentiation downstream from zzso domain protein genes were zzso zzso expression zzso showed the variation in zzso zzso activity toward downstream zzso even between duplicate gene zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso genes induced zzso secondary wall zzso in zzso leaves as well as in zzso zzso with different levels of induction efficiency according to the zzso These results suggest that wood formation in zzso is regulated by cooperative functions of the zzso domain zzso
