The chemical structural variations induced by different growth temperatures in the zzso and zzso components extracted from the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso zzso 125 are zzso The increase in zzso with the increase in growth temperature seems to be general, because it happens not only for the zzso but also for the zzso zzso variations in the zzso components of zzso A also zzso In addition, free zzso A is found at both 25 and 4 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C, which is the optimal growth temperature, suggesting a incomplete zzso of the zzso component under the first two temperature zzso
