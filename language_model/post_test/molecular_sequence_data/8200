zzso of zzso induce dramatic changes in gene expression that direct the early stages of zzso zzso This gene activity is reflected by the appearance of early and late zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the early puff genes that have been studied to date are induced by both the late zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and are expressed in many zzso target zzso raising the question of how the hormone directs the complex zzso and zzso responses associated with zzso In an effort to address this question, we have isolated and characterized the zzso gene responsible for the zzso zzso early zzso The zzso zzso displays no response to zzso in late zzso zzso zzso but is directly induced 12 zzso later by the zzso zzso pulse, identical to the response of the zzso zzso In zzso other than the zzso zzso however, zzso displays complex spatial and zzso zzso zzso spans at least 55 zzso of zzso DNA and encodes a zzso protein that has no matches in the sequence databases, but displays several characteristics of known zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts in a zzso regulatory hierarchy in the zzso zzso to direct its zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso
