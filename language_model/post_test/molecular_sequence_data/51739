A high pH zzso exchange zzso zzso system for the separation of zzso zzso products was zzso zzso this system, using Gal beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso as a zzso a Gal beta zzso alpha zzso activity was detected for the first time in human zzso This activity is expressed together with the prevalent alpha zzso Furthermore, in addition to the major alpha zzso a low but distinct activity of alpha zzso was detected in human zzso This activity could not be found by methods based on zzso analysis or high resolution zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso in combination with the use of the zzso as an zzso zzso is suited for the specific detection of minor, Gal beta zzso zzso zzso
