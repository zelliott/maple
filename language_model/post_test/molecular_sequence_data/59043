zzso zzso zzso a protein associated with zzso at cellular contact sites, has been identified as a zzso for zzso and zzso two proteins also involved in zzso dynamics and organization at these zzso Here, we report that zzso also directly binds to zzso another component of zzso zzso Competition experiments with a zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso located in the hinge region that connects zzso head and tail zzso is involved in zzso zzso The same motif is present in zzso but the interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso differ in zzso zzso this motif may be recognized by zzso in different ways when presented in distinct cellular zzso
