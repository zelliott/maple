A three-dimensional structural model of rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso modeling techniques previously developed for building and evaluating a zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso Four templates with known crystal structures including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in multiple sequence alignments and construction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The model was evaluated for its overall quality using available protein analysis programs and found to be zzso The model structure was stable at room temperature during a 140 zzso zzso full protein molecular dynamics zzso A putative zzso access channel and binding site were zzso Two different zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso zzso with pronounced product specificity were zzso into the putative binding zzso Two zzso were found for each zzso that could lead to the observed preferred zzso Using a geometric fit method three regions on the surface of the model zzso zzso structure were identified as possible sites for interaction with zzso zzso a zzso partner of zzso zzso zzso that may interact with the zzso and with zzso zzso have been identified and zzso studies are currently in zzso
