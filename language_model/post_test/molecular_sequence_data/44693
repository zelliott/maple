In this study we report the development of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso methods for the structural characterization of zzso derived from zzso Prior to analysis, zzso samples were subjected to zzso zzso with zzso and the resulting zzso were zzso by zzso A new zzso zzso was employed for the zzso zzso The results have demonstrated that zzso to zzso detection can be achieved in both positive mode and negative mode, allowing zzso determination of the molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso information from zzso zzso was obtained by further zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns in positive mode and negative mode zzso were complementary for the zzso of the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso was also incorporated with zzso mass mapping analysis for determination of zzso chain zzso patterns of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso
