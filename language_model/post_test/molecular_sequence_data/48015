A zzso inhibitor zzso as zzso was isolated and zzso from the snake serum of Taiwan zzso zzso zzso by using successive zzso which included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor was shown to be a homogeneous protein with a molecular mass of about 47 or 36 zzso in the presence or absence of a reducing agent, zzso The inhibitor decreases in molecular mass by about zzso with zzso zzso treatment, suggesting that it is a zzso Further zzso analyses indicated that this inhibitor possesses strong zzso activities toward three zzso zzso and not zzso zzso zzso previously isolated from the zzso of the same snake species with an zzso of about zzso zzso Its zzso value was approximately three orders of magnitude more effective than those of the zzso zzso we previously zzso from the crude zzso of the same snake zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor showed stronger zzso action against zzso activities of crude zzso from closely related species of Taiwan zzso than those from unrelated zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that its sequence is distinctly different from sequences of those serum zzso reported for other snake species in the zzso Based on zzso zzso and primary structures of various snake zzso zzso it is suggested that this novel inhibitor isolated from the serum of Taiwan zzso may be a unique self-defense protein factor mainly for protection against zzso from snakes of the same zzso
