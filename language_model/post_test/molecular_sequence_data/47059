A collection of zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso expression library by zzso with zzso raised against affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, included one which expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso comprised an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso of 536 zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso was modular in structure and comprised three distinct zzso The zzso domain was closely similar to a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso domain which is prevalent in zzso and zzso from three species of zzso zzso and binds to a putative scaffolding protein during assembly of the zzso zzso zzso The second domain was also not required for zzso activity and appeared to be an atypically large zzso zzso multiple tandem repeats of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso contained an zzso zzso domain that exhibited overall zzso with a small family of zzso including zzso zzso D zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso This region also contained several smaller blocks of zzso that displayed zzso with zzso tentatively identified as containing the essential zzso zzso of a larger group of zzso zzso A truncated zzso of zzso zzso the zzso domain alone zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein and was zzso to zzso zzso was active against synthetic and plant zzso zzso showed a marked preference for zzso zzso zzso linkages between zzso acid and zzso in zzso zzso and was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso acted zzso with zzso to release more than zzso of the zzso zzso acid from the zzso component of plant cell zzso Western analysis confirmed that zzso is produced by zzso zzso and is a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one, two or three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain fused to the reporter protein zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis of immobilized zzso zzso zzso complex demonstrated that each of the hybrid proteins bound to a 97 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
