Contacts between aromatic and charged zzso are often found in zzso zzso studies have shown that a zzso zzso pair can zzso a protein by more than 1 zzso zzso We have used circular zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance to study the zzso content of several peptides in which a zzso pair was placed at zzso i + 3 or zzso i + 4 in either the N to C or the C to N zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso i + 4 geometry is the most zzso one (when the zzso is zzso and gives rise to the highest zzso zzso Little preference is observed among the three other zzso The energy of the zzso zzso i + 4 interaction zzso with zzso and zzso is about 1 zzso zzso A statistical analysis of the occurrence of zzso pairs in zzso of natural proteins reveals that, although the zzso zzso i + 4 pairs are not more abundant than the others, in most of the zzso zzso i + 4 pairs the two zzso are in zzso but not in the other three zzso These results suggest that the zzso stability of proteins could be increased by means of zzso zzso zzso i + 4 zzso bridges and that these bridges could be useful to tailor the stability of zzso peptides at zzso zzso
