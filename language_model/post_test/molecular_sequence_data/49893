zzso is one of a set of genes required for the formation of zzso zzso aerial zzso during differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous analysis zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso encodes a member of the zzso function zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors and that translation from the most strongly predicted start zzso zzso would give rise to a zzso factor having an unusual zzso extension of zzso 86 zzso Here, by using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we provide evidence that all zzso translation arises from initiation at zzso and that the primary translation product is a zzso zzso that is zzso processed to a mature species zzso by removal of most of the unusual zzso zzso A time course taken during differentiation of the wild type on solid medium showed early production of zzso and the subsequent appearance of mature zzso which was zzso with aerial zzso formation and the disappearance of zzso Two genes zzso members of a family of zzso that are involved in the regulated zzso processing of zzso factors in other organisms were identified in the zzso zzso zzso but their disruption did not affect differentiation or zzso zzso
