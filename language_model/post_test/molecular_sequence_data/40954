The crude extracts from three species of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to the family zzso exhibited potent zzso to freshwater zzso zzso zzso Regardless of the species, high and low molecular weight toxins were found in gel zzso of the crude zzso Following zzso zzso of the low molecular weight toxin zzso one toxin zzso two toxins zzso and c) and one toxin zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the determined zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso (not zzso to either zzso or zzso and zzso were successfully cloned by both 3' and zzso zzso zzso In common with the three zzso the precursor is composed of a signal zzso (19 zzso acid zzso zzso (16 zzso and mature portion zzso zzso similar to those of many sea zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the three toxins are closely similar to one another, being all new members of the type 2 sea zzso sodium channel zzso toxin zzso
