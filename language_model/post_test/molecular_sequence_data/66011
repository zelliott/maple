zzso chemical zzso designed to simultaneously targeting multiple sites of protein surfaces are of interest zzso to their potential application as site specific zzso of zzso zzso A new approach toward zzso zzso of zzso type I zzso zzso I) based on module assembly for simultaneous recognition of both interior and exterior protein surfaces is zzso The zzso zzso in this study consist of two zzso linked by an zzso zzso one is the zzso zzso module for binding to the interior protein surface zzso zzso and the other is a zzso zzso zzso motif that contains three zzso groups designed to bind to the zzso charged protein exterior surface near the active zzso The compounds were screened by two distinct zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and incorporation of a zzso zzso group onto a protein zzso The zzso zzso block zzso I zzso activity with zzso values in the zzso range and are approximately one order of magnitude and more than 150 times more effective than the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso compounds 6 and 8 were shown to be competitive zzso suggesting that the zzso module anchors the whole zzso to the zzso I active site and delivers the other module to the targeting protein zzso Thus, our zzso approach resulted in simultaneous zzso recognition, and as a consequence, zzso zzso of zzso I activity, thereby providing a new approach in designing zzso zzso for targeting zzso zzso
