The wheat zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso has been zzso Its derived protein sequence shares zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with those of zzso and tobacco zzso zzso The wheat and tobacco zzso sequences lack four zzso of 6 zzso to 36 zzso that are present in the zzso zzso The wheat zzso gene is actively transcribed and is preceded by a regulatory sequence block very similar to those located upstream of the wheat zzso and zzso zzso Our observations support the view that zzso sequences zzso a functional zzso in plant zzso
