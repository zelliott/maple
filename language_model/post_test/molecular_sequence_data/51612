zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso during zzso A zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to the two separate sites of the zzso promoter region and mediates the zzso of mouse zzso gene expression by zzso zzso has been detected in mouse zzso tissue during pregnancy, but not during the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso sequence zzso bound a protein with a zzso zzso of 65 zzso from zzso nuclear extract from pregnant mice, but not that from zzso zzso In this study the hormonal regulation of binding activity of zzso and its relationship to zzso gene expression were also examined in zzso using zzso of pregnant zzso zzso rapidly reduces the circulating zzso and zzso levels and zzso zzso in the zzso tissue of pregnant zzso After zzso the binding activity of zzso in the zzso zzso was reduced to a very low level zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at 24 zzso whereas the binding activity of another nuclear zzso zzso binding factor, was not altered 24 h after the zzso zzso injection at the time of zzso inhibited the loss of zzso activity, and the level of its activity was maintained at about zzso the level of zzso pregnant animals 24 h after steroid zzso The ability of zzso to prevent the zzso decrease in zzso activity was specific, since other steroid hormones, such as estrogen, zzso or testosterone, were incapable of doing zzso In contrast to zzso zzso increased the level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and this increase was inhibited by zzso administration of zzso suggesting that the extent of zzso gene expression was zzso related to zzso activity in zzso zzso These results are consistent with the view that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso the zzso action of zzso
