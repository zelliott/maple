Many zzso species of bacteria are propelled by zzso which are rigid zzso filaments turned by rotary zzso in the cell zzso The zzso are powered by the zzso zzso of zzso or sodium zzso Although bacterial zzso contain many zzso only zzso zzso and zzso closely in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso membrane proteins that form the zzso of the zzso zzso is a component of the zzso present in about 25 copies per zzso It is composed of an zzso domain that functions in zzso assembly and a zzso domain zzso that functions specifically in motor zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Charged zzso that are important for function, and which interact with the zzso protein zzso cluster along a prominent zzso on zzso On the basis of the disposition of these zzso we present a hypothesis for the orientation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and propose a structural model for the part of the zzso that interacts with the zzso
