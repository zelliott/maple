zzso or zzso of the zzso gene have been reported to correlate with poor patient prognosis in human breast, zzso and zzso zzso Recently, the zzso gene product was found to be expressed frequently in the urinary zzso zzso In the current study, the presence of the zzso gene product in urinary zzso zzso was compared with patient outcome to evaluate whether zzso gene product could identify a subset of patients who are destined to have a poor zzso 

zzso study of the zzso gene product was done in zzso zzso tissue specimens obtained from 88 transitional cell zzso of the human urinary zzso zzso patients who underwent complete tumor zzso by total zzso (30 zzso or by zzso operations such as zzso surgery zzso zzso or partial zzso (3 zzso entered a follow-up zzso The other five patients did not enter the follow-up study because of lost follow-up (2 zzso or distant zzso at the time of zzso 

The zzso gene product was expressed in 23 of 88 patients zzso showing an increase in the expression rate corresponding to the advancement of tumor grade zzso zzso zzso and tumor stage zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso survival rate was zzso for patients with zzso negative tumors versus zzso for those with zzso positive tumors zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso survival rate was zzso for patients with zzso negative tumors versus zzso for those with zzso positive tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using Cox zzso model showed that the zzso gene product tissue status was a significant zzso factor independent of grade and stage of the zzso 

The results suggest that the zzso gene product could be a tumor marker to identify a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
