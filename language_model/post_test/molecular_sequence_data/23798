zzso and identification of zzso membrane proteins is a major challenge in zzso Identification of such sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso proteins by zzso mass zzso zzso via zzso laser zzso of flight zzso is frequently hampered by the insufficient amount of peptides being generated and their low signal zzso Using the seven zzso zzso zzso pump zzso as model zzso we demonstrate here that zzso removal from zzso proteins by zzso extraction prior to zzso zzso zzso leads to a tenfold higher sensitivity in mass zzso identification via zzso with respect to initial protein load on zzso Furthermore, parallel sequencing of the generated peptides by zzso zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso was possible without further sample zzso We also show identification of other membrane proteins by this zzso as proof of general zzso
