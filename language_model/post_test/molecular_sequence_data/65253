Replacement of zzso zzso acid zzso during evolution of proteins can lead to divergence and the formation of new families with novel functions, but is often deleterious to both protein structure and zzso Using the WW domain, we zzso examined whether and to what degree zzso zzso can compensate for the reduction of function and loss of structure that accompany substitution of a strictly zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso of the WW domain, with substitution of the most strictly zzso zzso zzso is known to lack a specific three-dimensional structure and shows reduced binding affinity in comparison to the wild zzso To obtain zzso zzso we performed a selection experiment based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding affinity using the zzso zzso as the initial zzso After selection by zzso display, we were able to select zzso that exhibited a maximum zzso higher affinity to the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso and showed an even better affinity than the wild zzso In addition, we found that the functional restoration resulted in increased binding specificity in selected zzso and the structures were more zzso with increased amounts of secondary structure, in comparison to the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the defective structure and function of the proteins caused by zzso in highly zzso zzso occurring through divergent evolution not only can be restored but can be further improved by zzso zzso
