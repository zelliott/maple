zzso zzso forms metabolically dormant zzso that upon zzso can cause lethal anthrax disease in zzso zzso zzso requires the activity of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso of the zzso and zzso cell, zzso To gain insight into the molecular basis of protein display, we used nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the structure and backbone dynamics of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The backbone and heavy atom coordinates of structurally ordered zzso acids have coordinate precision of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adopts an zzso zzso fold that contains two short zzso positioned on opposite sides of the zzso Surprisingly, the protein zzso and contains an extensive, structurally zzso surface that is positioned adjacent to the active zzso The surface is formed by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso that surround the active site zzso suggesting that they may play a key role in zzso zzso with its zzso II zzso zzso anchors proteins bearing a zzso zzso sorting zzso Modeling studies suggest that the zzso recognizes this zzso using a rigid binding pocket and reveals the presence of a zzso zzso for the zzso This first structure of a class D member of the zzso zzso unveils zzso features that may facilitate ongoing efforts to discover zzso zzso for the treatment of bacterial zzso
