The presence of an extra copy of human zzso 21 zzso zzso especially region zzso causes many zzso in Down syndrome, including mental zzso To study genes potentially responsible for some of these zzso we cloned a human candidate gene zzso from zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso that are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene required for zzso and to the rat zzso gene zzso specificity zzso zzso regulated zzso The three zzso genes are highly zzso zzso identical at the protein level over their zzso zzso open reading zzso in addition, the zzso genes are zzso identical over zzso zzso to the smaller zzso zzso zzso The predicted human zzso and zzso zzso proteins both contain a nuclear targeting signal zzso a protein zzso domain, a putative zzso zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso and regional mapping data zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that both human and zzso genes zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso libraries derived from various human and zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso are expressed both during development and in the zzso In zzso zzso of zzso to mouse zzso (13, 15, and 17 days zzso indicates a differential spatial and zzso pattern of zzso with the most abundant signal localized in brain gray matter, spinal cord, and zzso The observed expression pattern is zzso with many of the clinical findings in zzso zzso Its zzso locus zzso zzso its zzso to the zzso zzso and the in zzso zzso expression patterns of the zzso zzso combined with the fact that transgenic mice for a zzso to which zzso maps are mentally deficient suggest that zzso may be involved in the abnormal zzso found in Down zzso
