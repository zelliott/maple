We determined the complete zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso of a large zzso zzso zzso zzso to as zzso zzso previously identified as the zzso factor from strain zzso of the violet root rot zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contained a long open reading frame zzso potentially zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso mass zzso zzso with zzso motifs characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is the longest so far reported in the zzso zzso The putative zzso and zzso were shown to be related to putative zzso and zzso of members of the zzso zzso As is the case with zzso the coding zzso strand of zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso at zzso position zzso A region between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso also had an zzso acid zzso resembling zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso protein presumed to contain putative zzso zzso and zzso motifs were present at comparable positions to those in other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was assigned to the zzso zzso and here, we designate it as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This represents the first report of a zzso zzso whose complete zzso sequence has been zzso
