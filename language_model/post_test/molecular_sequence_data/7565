A putative zzso for the zzso zzso has recently been cloned zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence exists that there are two zzso and active K zzso processes in the rat zzso zzso one that is zzso sensitive and the other zzso zzso The present study used the zzso expression system to express zzso activity in insect zzso zzso zzso 9) cells and a zzso zzso zzso developed against a fusion protein produced from the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coding region of the putative zzso zzso to identify the specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in plasma zzso isolated from zzso 9 cells infected with zzso containing zzso DNA with the putative zzso zzso zzso for K for the zzso was zzso zzso The expressed zzso activity was not inhibited by zzso (1 zzso while the Ki for zzso zzso was zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with the zzso zzso identified a zzso protein in zzso zzso prepared from zzso but not zzso rat zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso localized zzso only in the zzso membrane of surface cells, while an zzso zzso against zzso localized zzso zzso of both surface and zzso cells of rat zzso zzso In conclusion, the putative zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso that is present only in the zzso membrane of surface cells of rat zzso zzso
