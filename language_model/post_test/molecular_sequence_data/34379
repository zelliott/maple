Twenty five zzso zzso were obtained from root zzso of zzso zzso zzso with soil samples collected from the zzso region and zzso Island in zzso To study their diversity and characterize them in relation to the zzso conditions of their zzso of origin, a zzso approach analyzing stress zzso symbiotic and genetic properties was zzso Stress tolerance zzso revealed marked variations in zzso pH and temperature zzso zzso originating from a zzso climate in alkaline soil zzso zzso tolerated high temperature, zzso and pH zzso Moreover, zzso recovered from a temperate climate in zzso soil zzso were sensitive to high temperature and zzso and tolerated zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and symbiotic zzso and zzso revealed 25 zzso to be closely related to zzso zzso Furthermore, the branch patterns of zzso trees constructed from different genes revealed the existence of at least two zzso zzso types in the zzso zzso These results may be relevant to programs directed towards improving crop productivity through zzso with locally adapted and genetically defined zzso
