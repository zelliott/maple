zzso of pH on zzso rate constants, k zzso degrees zzso have been determined for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For each zzso similar directional trends are zzso With zzso rate zzso over the pH zzso range first decrease, and then increase to plateau pH approximately equal to 9 k values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With zzso rate zzso increase in two separate zzso stages from pH zzso to plateau pH approximately equal to 9 k values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso From these trends, and consistent with previous zzso studies, protein zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for the three reduced zzso zzso are assigned to the buried zzso acid at position 7 on the zzso zzso Since at pH greater than 6 the trends with pH for both zzso and zzso are in the same direction, it is concluded that this zzso results in a decrease in protein reduction zzso At pH less than 6, the trends with zzso and zzso are in opposite zzso Well defined zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, are observed with zzso as zzso Upper limits only of zzso values less than zzso less than zzso and less than zzso respectively, are observed with zzso as zzso which may or may not be the same as those observed for zzso These latter zzso values are assigned to zzso zzso at or near to the binding zzso It is noted that charged zzso are zzso on the front face zzso the exposed zzso zzso of all three zzso zzso and that there are only two zzso One possibility is that the locality including both zzso defined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso serves as a binding site for both zzso and 3- zzso
