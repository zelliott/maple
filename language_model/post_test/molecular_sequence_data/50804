Basic zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso factor that has also been implicated in zzso cell and zzso zzso We now report the expression of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso cells obtained at zzso recovery in in zzso zzso zzso It was necessary to use the sensitive technique of a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso after reverse zzso zzso to detect zzso This finding in conjunction with a recent report showing the presence of transcripts for transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso in the same type of cells by zzso indicates that mechanisms are in place for controlling zzso zzso and cell zzso
