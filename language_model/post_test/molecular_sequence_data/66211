The zzso fold is one of most common structural motifs observed in zzso This zzso is found in more than 80 zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relationships have not been identified, but may zzso The challenge remains, therefore, of resolving the issue of whether the diverse distribution of the fold is accounted for by divergent evolution of function or zzso evolution of structure following multiple independent origins of zzso Since the early studies that revealed zzso similarity of zzso and other zzso the number of primary structures available for comparison has dramatically increased and new zzso approaches for analysis of sequences have been zzso It now appears that a hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for zzso zzso and zzso may be zzso The distinction between protein zzso and protein zzso is zzso The zzso fold may represent a robust system within which to examine again the issue of protein zzso versus zzso
