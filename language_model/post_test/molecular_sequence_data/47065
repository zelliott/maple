To evaluate their role in the active site of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, 12 zzso zzso either in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Anderson, zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso or in the sequences of 26 zzso zzso were submitted to zzso zzso All these zzso lay within the zzso of the active site of zzso as defined by its zzso structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso 16, zzso Fourteen zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing a zzso zzso extension were prepared and their zzso kinetic parameters zzso All had a reduced zzso activity, which in many cases was very low, but no zzso led to a total loss of zzso zzso of the specificity zzso zzso for the three zzso zzso indicated that most zzso affected both the binding of one zzso and the zzso zzso These kinetic results correlated with the assigned function of the zzso based on the X-ray zzso
