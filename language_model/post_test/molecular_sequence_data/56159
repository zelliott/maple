We have identified a new heat shock zzso designated zzso located 700 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso We cloned it and showed that it is transcribed zzso zzso the zzso coli genetic map, in the same direction as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments and Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene belongs to the classical heat shock gene family, because the zzso from its major promoter is under the positive control of the zzso gene product zzso zzso and resembles zzso E zzso zzso consensus promoter zzso This conclusion has been strengthened by the construction and analysis of a zzso promoter zzso Despite the fact that zzso zzso bacteria are viable, the expression of various E zzso 32 heat shock promoters is significantly zzso suggesting that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of the heat shock zzso zzso with this zzso overproduction of the zzso protein results in a generalized increase of the heat shock response in zzso zzso
