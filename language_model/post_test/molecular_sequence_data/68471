The zzso locus for zzso acid capsule expression in zzso coli zzso is composed of a central group of zzso zzso zzso designated region 2, flanked on either side by region 1 or region 3 zzso genes with poorly defined zzso zzso zzso with zzso and subsequent zzso analysis, zzso and in zzso protein expression studies, and zzso sequencing identified the region 1 zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suggests an zzso structure for region zzso zzso is zzso to putative zzso components previously identified in zzso zzso type b and zzso zzso group zzso An open reading frame upstream of zzso encodes a zzso zzso with zzso to zzso a putative zzso protein of unknown function zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Whether expression of the zzso zzso as the potential first gene of region 1 is required for zzso acid synthesis or zzso is presently zzso
