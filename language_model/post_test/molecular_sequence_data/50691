A family with an apparent history of zzso zzso disease presented for genetic counseling, requesting carrier detection and prenatal zzso zzso analysis using the zzso protein zzso gene probe was zzso in this zzso A prenatal diagnosis on a zzso zzso sample zzso was carried out using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso in zzso 4 of the zzso zzso The fetus was predicted to be zzso zzso of the zzso from the CVS, the zzso mother, and the zzso grandmother revealed an zzso change at zzso zzso in the two women but not in the zzso As this change results in a zzso change at zzso acid 181 in a region of the gene predicted to be part of a zzso segment, it was concluded that this was the zzso causing the disease in this zzso In addition, in a second family, an zzso 5 zzso band pattern on zzso analysis was shown by sequencing to be due to a zzso change at zzso zzso This results in a zzso change in a carrier mother and in her two affected zzso These results provide further examples of zzso in zzso that cause zzso disease and illustrate the value of zzso in genetic zzso
