zzso zzso zzso method was used to analyze the zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso gene in eight patients with acute intermittent zzso The patients had the earlier characterized zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso G zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso except the zzso zzso zzso zzso T in zzso 10, affected the zzso transcript levels of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels in zzso varied from zzso to zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso A resulted in reduction of the zzso transcript level of the zzso zzso to zzso of that of the normal zzso The two zzso zzso zzso G or zzso affecting the same zzso in zzso 12 also differed considerably in their effect on zzso zzso The transcript level of the zzso with a zzso zzso was decreased to zzso of that of the normal zzso whereas a nonsense zzso at the same position resulted in a dramatic decrease zzso in the levels of the zzso zzso Our data showed large variations between the levels of zzso transcript in zzso patients and these variations did not correlate either to zzso class, to the location of the disease causing zzso in the zzso zzso or to the clinical zzso of zzso
