Experimental conditions zzso zzso 24 h reaction, zzso ratio zzso were defined for preferential incorporation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group of zzso This strategy could be helpful in numerous applications when an entire zzso chain must remain accessible for zzso or zzso zzso We illustrate this advantage in a zzso zzso zzso designed to detect zzso specific for bovine zzso present in rabbit or human zzso This test involves synthetic peptides zzso in different positions and immobilized on a solid zzso The use of zzso interactions permitted more efficient detection of specific zzso zzso than solid zzso prepared using conventional zzso zzso The highest levels of zzso binding were measured when zzso occurred at the zzso zzso of immobilized zzso
