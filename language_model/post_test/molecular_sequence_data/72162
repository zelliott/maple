zzso a member of the zzso family, can inhibit many forms of zzso cell zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso identified a 60 zzso acid loop lacking defined zzso Although zzso acid sequence within this region is not zzso among zzso family members, structural modeling suggested that zzso also contains a large zzso zzso Compared with the full-length zzso loop deletion zzso of zzso and zzso displayed an enhanced ability to inhibit zzso Despite enhanced function, the deletion zzso did not have significant zzso in the ability to bind zzso proteins such as zzso The loop deletion zzso of zzso also displayed a qualitative difference in its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso was unable to prevent zzso cell death of the immature B cell line zzso In contrast, the zzso deletion zzso protected zzso cells from zzso zzso differences were observed in the ability of zzso cells to zzso the deletion zzso of zzso compared with full-length zzso zzso zzso was found to be dependent on the presence of an intact loop zzso These results suggest that the loop domain in zzso and zzso can suppress the zzso function of these genes and may be a target for regulatory zzso zzso
