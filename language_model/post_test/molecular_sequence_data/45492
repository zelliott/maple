Acid zzso zzso m 3) is a major zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and its availability as a zzso protein may facilitate the development of improved diagnostic tests and zzso 

One objective is the determination of the complete primary structure of zzso m 3 and to obtain zzso zzso m 3 on the basis of expression in insect zzso Another objective is the quantitative analysis of patient serum zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso m zzso 

The cloning of zzso m 3 from zzso zzso zzso and its expression as a full-length protein in zzso insect cells is zzso The zzso of serum zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients to zzso zzso m 3 was determined in an zzso zzso 

zzso amplification generated a zzso DNA zzso whose identity as the coding sequence of zzso m 3 was verified by several zzso zzso zzso m 3, expressed in zzso zzso cells, showed an expected molecular weight and zzso activity at pH zzso Analysis of zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso m 3 by mass zzso confirmed its zzso In zzso zzso zzso m 3 is specifically recognized by zzso zzso of pooled serum in Western blots and by 37% of the individual zzso of zzso zzso patients in zzso zzso 

The availability of zzso zzso m 3 provides a tool for both the development of improved diagnostic tests and the design of safer and more effective zzso approaches for zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso m 3 is a key element in the search for an zzso zzso approach to zzso zzso zzso with regard to both the development of superior diagnostic tests and the improvement of zzso zzso
