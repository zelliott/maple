Heat shock protein 90 zzso is not only involved in environmental stress but also plays roles in the zzso development in some zzso To understand its role in zzso we examined the zzso zzso for the first time in the zzso and zzso of the zzso river zzso zzso zzso and designated this protein as zzso in this zzso The zzso was cloned by the methods of zzso zzso zzso and rapid amplification of the zzso ends zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso containing a 126 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso a zzso zzso 3' zzso and an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso with predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso alignment showed that the zzso shared zzso identity with other zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso was zzso detected in all tested zzso with the highest expression in the zzso zzso the mediate in heart, muscle and zzso and the lowest in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso levels in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso reached a maximum at the stage III zzso zzso zzso and stage IV (later zzso zzso zzso respectively, and then decreased significantly in both zzso as the zzso development zzso The level of zzso expression in the zzso was higher than that in the zzso when compared with in the same zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is involved in zzso development in zzso river prawn and may play a regulatory role in zzso zzso
