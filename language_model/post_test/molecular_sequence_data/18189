We present the primary structure of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of zzso revealed that this gene shows all the characteristics of an interrupted plant gene consisting of 13 zzso and 12 zzso The promoter region of zzso contains the common promoter elements of plant genes as well as motifs which are supposed to be involved in zzso zzso There are two zzso sequences in the gene named zzso and zzso which are not present in the zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 carries a zzso element, zzso which might be responsible for downstream deletion events in which a zzso zzso might have been zzso Most of the zzso except 1, 12 and 13, are similar to each other both in length (54 zzso and sequence (up to zzso sequence zzso All zzso are interrupted by zzso in the same phase zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso based on illegitimate zzso in which the zzso motif might have played an active role, and zzso DNA zzso were the primary events in the molecular evolution of the zzso zzso
