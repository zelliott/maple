zzso zzso strain zzso which is capable of degrading zzso zzso was isolated from soil treated with zzso This zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the strain was zzso to zzso and its zzso zzso molecular mass (82 zzso and zzso properties were zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso is an zzso We then cloned the zzso zzso gene zzso from the zzso DNA of the strain and determined the zzso sequence of the zzso region containing zzso No zzso sequences were found by a database zzso search using the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso Six open reading frames including the zzso gene were found in the zzso region, and sequencing analysis shows that the zzso gene is flanked by two copies of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it makes part of a composite zzso
