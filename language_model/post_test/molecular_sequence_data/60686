To fully characterize human zzso acid zzso zzso protein zzso zzso associated with zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso clones specific to zzso protein zzso were isolated from two zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso Overlapping zzso zzso zzso recognized by both zzso or zzso zzso clones within peptides zzso and zzso were identified as sequences bounded by zzso with zzso overlapping zzso and zzso with zzso overlapping zzso respectively, using two panels of overlapping zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso restrictive elements of the zzso clones were also identified using a panel of B cell lines with different zzso zzso as targets in zzso zzso The zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso responses of zzso zzso zzso clones in the context of zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone specific to zzso was found to be restricted by zzso A3 and zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso clone specific to zzso killed zzso target cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso The observed zzso restriction of these overlapping zzso implies that a tandem of zzso and/or a tandem of zzso might zzso zzso patients to development of zzso
