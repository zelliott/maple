zzso zzso possesses export systems for various zzso acids including zzso a zzso export system for zzso and the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso A gene for a putative zzso regulator of the zzso family is transcribed zzso to the zzso zzso and is required for zzso zzso By comparing global gene expression changes due to zzso addition we revealed increased zzso expression in response to zzso in zzso zzso wild type but not in an zzso deletion zzso zzso analysis, band shift experiments and zzso footprint analysis demonstrated that zzso binds to the zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso promoters indicated that zzso zzso acids and zzso when added to the growth medium zzso zzso expression in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso was required for zzso of zzso zzso Thus, regulation of zzso by zzso ensures that zzso is zzso only if its zzso zzso acids accumulate in cells which is commensurate with its role to counteract such situations of zzso zzso
