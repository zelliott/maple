zzso zzso channels have been found in various parts of the zzso and represent a zzso group of zzso We briefly review their putative zzso zzso Renal zzso zzso zzso channels may play a role in volume regulation, calcium entry, cell zzso and sodium zzso In some zzso zzso zzso seems to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, there is evidence that a gene related to the zzso zzso channel, a zzso zzso zzso channel, is also expressed in whole rat kidney zzso In the context of these zzso we review recent findings from our own work on a zzso zzso channel in the zzso mouse cortical collecting duct cell zzso We could demonstrate that zzso cells show zzso zzso channel activity in zzso patches and express a gene related to the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso The possibility of a relation between the kidney channel and the zzso channel is zzso
