We used synthetic DNA zzso to investigate the zzso acid zzso properties of the N terminal domain of zzso delta zzso zzso We found that zzso possessed a bona fide zzso zzso zzso could distinguish subtle differences in the zzso stability of the base pairing region, and enabled DNA zzso to form a more stable duplex among competing sequences through zzso strand zzso zzso stimulating duplex conversion zzso and stabilizing the more stable zzso The property of zzso identified in this study could be applied to improve the efficiency and specificity of dot zzso zzso under conditions of low zzso
