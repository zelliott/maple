zzso cells are the only cell type that can penetrate from one generation to next zzso At the early embryonic zzso zzso germ cells originally stem from primordial germ cells, and finally differentiate into functional zzso zzso in male or zzso in female, after sexual zzso This study was conducted to investigate a large-scale expressed sequence tag zzso analysis in chicken zzso and compare the expression of the zzso zzso with that of embryonic zzso 

We constructed zzso zzso from a chicken zzso library of a collection of highly separated embryonic zzso After zzso and problematic sequences were filtered out using the chicken zzso zzso there were zzso resulting unique sequences consisting of 156 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tests of gene zzso terms in the 2nd level between zzso and embryonic zzso set showed no zzso However, digital gene expression profiling using the zzso test showed that there were 2 genes expressed significantly with higher number of transcripts in zzso compared with the embryonic zzso zzso On the other hand, 17 genes in embryonic zzso were zzso higher than those in the zzso zzso 

Our results in this study contribute to knowledge of mining novel transcripts and genes involved in zzso cell proliferation and differentiation at the early embryonic zzso
