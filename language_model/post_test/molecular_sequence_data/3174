zzso II is a large zzso complex catalyzing water zzso and initiating electron transfer processes across the zzso zzso In addition to large protein zzso many of which bind zzso zzso zzso II particles contain a number of low molecular weight zzso whose function is only poorly zzso Here we have investigated the function of one of the smallest zzso in zzso II, zzso Using a reverse zzso approach, we have zzso the zzso gene in the tobacco zzso zzso We show that, although the zzso zzso is not principally required for functional zzso electron zzso plants lacking zzso are unable to grow zzso We provide evidence that this is due to the zzso of incompletely assembled zzso complexes, which in turn causes drastically reduced zzso performance and extreme hypersensitivity to zzso Our results suggest a role of zzso for the stable assembly of the zzso complex of zzso II and, in addition, support a control of zzso I zzso through zzso II zzso
