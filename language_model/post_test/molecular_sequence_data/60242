The zzso zzso domain is zzso to zzso zzso zzso which contains two zzso clusters of zzso zzso in its zzso module that play varied roles in its electron transfer zzso To study the role of zzso zzso domain cluster 1 zzso zzso we zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso aromatic zzso zzso and investigated the effect of each zzso on zzso zzso zzso change, electron transfer zzso zzso regulation, and zzso zzso Each zzso zzso zzso binding without significantly affecting other aspects including zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso activities upon zzso zzso indicating the zzso effect was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that bound zzso was essential for reduction of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not for zzso or zzso and established that the electron transfer path in zzso is zzso to zzso to zzso to zzso zzso and zzso kinetic analysis revealed a novel role for bound zzso in suppressing zzso reduction by zzso The suppression could be relieved either by zzso removal or zzso zzso zzso binding induced a zzso change that was restricted to the zzso zzso This increased the rate of zzso reduction and triggered electron transfer to the zzso We propose that the zzso module of zzso is the key positive or negative regulator of electron transfer at all points in zzso This zzso zzso from other related zzso and helps explain the mechanism of zzso zzso
