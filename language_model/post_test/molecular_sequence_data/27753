Five different members of the zzso zzso gene family have been isolated and characterized from the zzso zzso zzso All five show identical zzso coding zzso followed by a block of T zzso associated with termination by zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso are completely zzso except for two distinct members with identical zzso zzso which may have arisen from a recent gene zzso zzso Each zzso is also flanked by zzso DNA, but the lack of zzso to each other suggests that these repetitive sequences have no common functional zzso The zzso genes do not appear to be closely linked to each other, although in zzso zzso reveals a putative zzso adjacent to one zzso Finally, there are large differences in the extent to which the five genes are transcribed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso sequences have a significant effect on zzso by zzso zzso zzso
