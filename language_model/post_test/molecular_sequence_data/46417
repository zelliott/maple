zzso is a peripheral membrane protein complex that has zzso roles in zzso membrane zzso The core of zzso possesses three zzso zzso zzso and zzso that play different roles in binding to zzso regulatory proteins and complex zzso We have performed an investigation of the thermodynamics of core zzso assembly using zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso acts as the central zzso to which zzso and zzso bind zzso Furthermore, we confirm that the zzso zzso motif of the large zzso zzso is critical for direct zzso zzso Heat capacity zzso of zzso and zzso binding to zzso indicate extensive binding zzso and suggest zzso zzso in zzso or zzso upon complex zzso zzso studies of the zzso core using zzso X-ray scattering allow us to propose a model zzso zzso forms an extended platform with zzso and zzso bound at zzso ends, with the potential for forming zzso zzso
