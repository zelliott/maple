zzso virus zzso causes dengue fever and dengue zzso zzso shock syndrome, both considered major zzso problems zzso We generated a lethal zzso strain zzso by 10 additional cycles of subcutaneous zzso of mice with zzso from zzso cells infected with the previously characterized strain zzso followed by harvesting of zzso zzso zzso mortality at zzso lower doses than zzso in mice lacking only the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or 129 backgrounds under both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the complete viral zzso revealed five zzso acid changes between zzso and zzso of which two zzso in envelope and zzso in zzso appear to account for the observed zzso differences between the zzso By causing mortality at lower doses in zzso mice lacking only the zzso zzso zzso constitutes an improved tool for study of zzso zzso as well as for testing potential vaccines and zzso drugs against zzso
