zzso determination of the zzso acid sequence of zzso from rabbit zzso disease virus is zzso by the presence of a blocked zzso Chemical zzso of zzso using zzso zzso allowed the identification and zzso of two zzso showing identical zzso acid zzso one of which had its zzso zzso zzso zzso sequential degradation of the zzso zzso zzso yielded the zzso acid sequence zzso This sequence is identical to the deduced zzso acid sequence following the first zzso zzso found at position zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data favor the hypothesis that this viral zzso is mainly produced from the zzso zzso and not from the zzso zzso by processing of the putative zzso generated from the major open reading zzso
