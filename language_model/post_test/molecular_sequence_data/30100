Human zzso growth factor II zzso has been zzso to zzso from bone which contained zzso times more zzso than zzso growth zzso zzso After extraction of zzso by zzso of human bone powder with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso was separated from zzso binding proteins by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fraction containing zzso was zzso by affinity zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind both zzso and zzso The final zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso zzso S zzso zzso in which zzso was separated from zzso Human zzso thus zzso was shown to be pure by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso From 300 g of bone, zzso zzso zzso was obtained with an overall recovery of zzso These studies demonstrate the usefulness of zzso bone as a source of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso with both zzso and zzso for affinity zzso of zzso
