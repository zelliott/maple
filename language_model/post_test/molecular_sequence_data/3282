zzso between zzso zzso zzso and its zzso is implicated in the induction of zzso and zzso immune zzso However, the molecular details of this interaction are zzso We report here a zzso analysis of zzso in zzso that are critical for zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso domain of zzso was used to map the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso This analysis identified a surface patch containing the characteristic zzso sequence and is zzso in human and mouse zzso zzso in this region of human zzso reduce or abolish zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso binding site in zzso maps to a region overlapping yet distinct from the zzso binding sites in zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso Thus, the analysis suggests that differences in zzso binding specificity between these related zzso molecules have evolved by zzso of overlapping regions with different patterns of zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso generated in the course of our studies bound zzso zzso with higher zzso than zzso zzso An zzso zzso protein of zzso blocked T cell zzso function of zzso zzso and inhibited T cell response to zzso zzso superior to zzso zzso Our studies thus identified critical zzso involving in zzso zzso interaction and provide new zzso for immune zzso
