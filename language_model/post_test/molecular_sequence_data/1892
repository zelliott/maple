The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows, besides high potency against human zzso virus type 1 zzso marked activity against zzso zzso effective zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso experiments pointed to zzso reverse zzso zzso as the target of action of zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso at 23 zzso As was also found for zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso manner with respect to zzso and zzso as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso selected for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The selected zzso strains of zzso were fully resistant to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso into which the zzso and/or zzso zzso was introduced by zzso zzso showed more than zzso resistance to zzso zzso of the resistance zzso to the zzso zzso structure zzso that zzso is located at a position equivalent to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso site of zzso zzso zzso however, is zzso to the putative zzso site in zzso zzso but close to the active site, zzso a novel molecular mode of action and mechanism of zzso Our findings have important implications for the development of new zzso with pronounced activity against a wider range of zzso
