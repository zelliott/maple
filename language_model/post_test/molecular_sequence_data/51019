Type zzso von zzso disease zzso is characterized by the loss of high and intermediate weight zzso of von zzso factor zzso from zzso The 3' end of zzso 28 in the zzso gene from four type zzso zzso patients was amplified by the zzso chain reaction, cloned and zzso zzso identified two potential zzso zzso resulting in the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the mature zzso zzso within an area of zzso where zzso in type zzso zzso have been zzso Neither of these zzso acid zzso was found in over 100 normal zzso tested by zzso specific zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified in another zzso Other areas of zzso 28 were zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and DNA from one patient demonstrated an irregular zzso pattern on the zzso end of the zzso zzso demonstrated an zzso acid substitution of an zzso for zzso at position zzso adjacent to an area of zzso where defects associated with type zzso zzso have been zzso This substitution was not found in 100 normal zzso tested by restriction zzso zzso The zzso zzso substitution eliminates an zzso zzso bridge formed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is important to maintain the zzso of zzso functional zzso that interact with zzso zzso zzso
