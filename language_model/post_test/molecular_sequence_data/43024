The conversion of zzso to zzso during the embryonic development of the zzso kidney requires zzso zzso interactions between the zzso and the responding zzso zzso The zzso gene is activated in the zzso in response to induction and is subsequently zzso in more differentiated cells derived from the zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso at least three of which zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso In order to determine the role of zzso during kidney development, we have generated a zzso zzso using zzso zzso in mouse kidney organ zzso These zzso can specifically inhibit zzso protein zzso in kidney zzso cells, where the zzso zzso are zzso The kidney organ cultures were stained with zzso and zzso zzso as markers for zzso zzso With significantly reduced zzso protein levels, kidney zzso cells fail to zzso and do not undergo the sequential zzso changes characteristic of zzso cell zzso The data demonstrate that zzso function is required for the earliest phase of zzso zzso
