zzso and its related zzso zzso exert multiple actions on normal and zzso tissue targets through a family of receptors termed zzso zzso zzso Despite the considerable advances in the knowledge on these receptors and their zzso roles, there is still evidence that additional receptors for these peptides should exist to fully explain their zzso 

The growing number of spliced zzso found in similar zzso families, often present in tumors, and results from our group obtained on zzso from other species zzso led us to explore the existence of new human zzso zzso 

A rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso approach on samples from a human zzso tumor and a cell line enabled identification of two novel alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso The sequences obtained zzso putative proteins that zzso to truncated zzso of five and four zzso zzso zzso accordingly named zzso and zzso zzso Both novel receptors show a differential expression pattern in normal zzso and are also present in zzso tumors of diverse zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso In contrast to the zzso plasma membrane zzso of full-length zzso both zzso and zzso show a zzso zzso zzso Despite their truncated nature, both receptors are functional, as shown by their ability to mediate selective, zzso rises in free zzso calcium zzso Specifically, whereas zzso is selectivity activated by zzso compared with zzso cells zzso with zzso almost exclusively respond to zzso and not to zzso 

Our results demonstrate the existence of two previously unidentified zzso spliced zzso with distinct distribution in normal zzso and zzso tumors, unique zzso signaling properties, and zzso distribution, which could contribute to zzso and zzso signaling in normal and zzso zzso
