We have cloned and characterized the rat zzso protein component 1 gene zzso which is related to the gene for zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid sequence and produces the zzso proteins zzso and zzso The zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso activity in a series of extensive zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso proteins are components of, or are closely associated with, the rat zzso A zzso experiment showed that zzso is modified to zzso in zzso zzso was the dominant form in zzso cells, suggesting that modification of the zzso protein may regulate zzso activity in zzso
