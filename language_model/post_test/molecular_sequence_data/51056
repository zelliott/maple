In order to investigate the structural properties of the sugar and zzso linkage region in zzso some zzso were zzso as a model for zzso zzso zzso which is one of the zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso in zzso and zzso conditions revealed that the zzso form an zzso hydrogen bond between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso oxygen of zzso zzso to which the zzso is zzso zzso This zzso hydrogen bond may play an important role in determining the orientation of the sugar zzso relative to the protein zzso The roles for the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso were also zzso
