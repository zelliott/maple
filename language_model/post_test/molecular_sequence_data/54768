zzso zzso cleave the viral precursor zzso zzso by open reading frame 1 zzso into multiple intermediate and mature zzso These zzso have zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are thought to act as a zzso zzso zzso general base, acid and zzso zzso However, is the zzso critical for processing the zzso In the present study, we examined these zzso acids in viruses representing the four major zzso of zzso Norwalk virus zzso zzso zzso disease virus zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using single zzso zzso we found that an zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso as well as the His and zzso in the putative zzso zzso cannot be replaced by Ala for normal processing activity of the zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, normal activity is not retained if the zzso zzso is replaced with zzso These results showed the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso formation is important for zzso zzso Our study is the first to directly compare the zzso of the four representative zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso and zzso zzso critically need the zzso zzso during zzso whereas zzso zzso occurs normally at several zzso sites in the zzso zzso without a functional acid zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso recognition mechanism may be different between the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso
