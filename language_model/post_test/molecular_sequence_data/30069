zzso zzso from zzso coli has become a model system for the study of both zzso and zzso interactions in zzso Analysis of the X-ray structures of the zzso in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso zzso has revealed sets of interactions that appear to stabilize either the zzso or the 'R' states of the zzso zzso zzso has been used to test which of these interactions are functionally zzso By combining the structural data from X-ray zzso and the functional data from zzso zzso a model is proposed for zzso zzso in zzso zzso that suggests that the zzso transition occurs in a concerted zzso
