The zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso core of several protein zzso is important for the functional integrity of these zzso The corresponding zzso of zzso protein zzso I alpha zzso zzso are zzso and/or zzso The in zzso zzso and functional role of these zzso was zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso as a zzso active and inactive zzso in zzso insect cells and in zzso coli, zzso The zzso and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso were indistinguishable from that of the zzso bovine lung zzso The zzso of zzso zzso including zzso were labeled with zzso zzso acid sequencing and mass zzso of the labeled peptides showed that zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso from zzso cells but not in that from zzso zzso The functional importance of zzso was investigated by substitution of zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso in insect cells of the zzso zzso resulted in a protein lacking zzso zzso activity, whereas the zzso zzso retained zzso zzso zzso In zzso coli, the exchange of zzso by zzso did not lead to the synthesis of a zzso active zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso is crucial for the formation of an zzso active protein zzso
