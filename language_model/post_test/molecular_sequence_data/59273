zzso and pathological degradation of cartilage zzso zzso zzso is regulated by the balance between tissue zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We examined the potential of zzso from normal bovine or human zzso zzso cartilage to express zzso for the new inhibitor zzso and studied its regulation by an zzso of zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso Freshly released zzso zzso expressed three transcripts of zzso that are induced by serum zzso In primary cultures of zzso one of these factors, zzso increased zzso zzso in a zzso fashion that required de zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso did not alter stability of the zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso confirmed increased rate of zzso gene zzso by zzso An zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and suppressed partially the zzso zzso expression in primary bovine and human zzso DNA sequencing of bovine zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of a zzso protein containing signal zzso and 12 zzso zzso The zzso protein differed from human zzso at four zzso The zzso expression and evolutionary conservation of zzso imply its important zzso zzso induction by zzso suggests the role of this factor and zzso in cartilage zzso with important implications for zzso
