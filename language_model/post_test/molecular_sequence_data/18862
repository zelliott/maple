zzso and zzso diseases have a major impact on human and animal health zzso Current control strategies rely heavily on the use of chemical zzso most of which target the zzso and with increasing resistance, new drugs are urgently zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are targets of highly successful zzso We isolated a full-length zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso library from the zzso zzso of the brown dog zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown this zzso zzso zzso to be most similar to the insect zzso zzso group and has been named zzso zzso is distributed in multiple tick zzso and is present across all zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to function as a zzso with and without the addition of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso When zzso with chicken zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso inward currents in response to zzso zzso and showed sensitivity to nicotine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was insensitive to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The unreliable expression of zzso in zzso suggests that additional zzso or zzso proteins may be required for more robust zzso This study enhances our understanding of zzso in zzso and may provide a basis for further studies on the interaction of compounds with the tick zzso as part of a discovery process for novel zzso
