Twelve zzso zzso zzso were examined for regions of sequence similarity by multiple zzso Six highly zzso sites were zzso Site 1 corresponded to a zzso loop that forms part of the zzso pocket in zzso zzso zzso zzso and site 5 corresponded to a region in zzso located on one lobe of the zzso that contains zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso zzso Site 3, consisting of the motif zzso is thought to be involved in zzso zzso site 4, which is nearby, probably zzso in this function as zzso The functions of sites 2 and 6 have not been zzso Secondary structure predictions were made by the zzso method and averaged for each position in the multiple zzso The structure predicted for all six sites was typically a short flexible region zzso or zzso at or adjacent to the site, flanked by rigid structures zzso or zzso on either zzso
