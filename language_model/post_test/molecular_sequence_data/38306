After separating by two-dimensional gel zzso an extract of total proteins from human stratum zzso two spots were extracted and analyzed for their zzso zzso The resulting internal protein sequences provided evidence for the identification of a new zzso zzso Cloning of the corresponding full-length zzso was achieved by reverse zzso chain reaction using two zzso libraries, one from zzso cultured zzso and one from differentiated zzso of reconstructed human zzso The zzso had an open reading frame zzso a new zzso protein of 146 zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso We named this new protein zzso skin protein zzso since reverse zzso chain reaction studies of zzso expression in 10 different human zzso revealed that this protein was particularly abundant in the zzso where its expression is directly related to zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso in zzso coli yielded a zzso protein which allowed its further zzso zzso is able to bind zzso and similarly to zzso exposes thereafter zzso parts which most likely interact with target zzso zzso proteins retained by zzso affinity column are zzso and zzso distinct from those of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso affinity zzso protein revealed zzso identity with zzso 3, a key zzso in terminal zzso indicating an important role of zzso in this zzso
