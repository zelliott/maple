The structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso of the suicide zzso zzso have been solved using X-ray zzso and refined with data extending to zzso zzso The distances between the zzso atoms of the inhibitor molecules and the zzso oxygen atoms of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso A, zzso clearly indicate the presence of zzso bonds between these zzso confirming the zzso role of zzso during the first stage of zzso reactions and also indicating direct involvement of zzso The factors responsible for zzso zzso remain zzso although some structural changes around zzso zzso and zzso common to both complexes, suggest that those zzso play a zzso The role of zzso as the zzso of zzso previously zzso for the closely related zzso zzso zzso is not confirmed in this study, due to the lack of interactions between these zzso in these complexes and in zzso The results reported here are consistent with previous reports that zzso of zzso coli zzso lacking zzso remain zzso active and prove the zzso roles of both zzso and zzso while still leaving open the question of the exact mechanism resulting in the unusual chemical properties of these zzso
