zzso cell zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso but a subset of patients may follow an zzso clinical zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying this biological zzso we performed zzso and/or zzso sequencing on 29 zzso cases and their respective matched normal DNA, as well as 6 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso genes were investigated by targeted sequencing in an independent cohort of zzso zzso zzso We identified 25 significantly zzso zzso including known drivers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso and the tumor zzso zzso zzso genes zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also found zzso zzso as an alternative phenomenon to zzso zzso in aggressive tumors with a dismal zzso Analysis of two simultaneous or subsequent zzso samples by zzso zzso zzso 8) or targeted zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed zzso zzso at diagnosis in samples from different zzso sites and zzso of the initial zzso profile at the progression of the zzso Some zzso were predominantly zzso or zzso indicating an early or late event in tumor evolution, zzso Our study identifies molecular mechanisms contributing to zzso zzso and offers potential targets for therapeutic zzso
