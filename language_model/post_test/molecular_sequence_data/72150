A partial zzso zzso zzso a major airway zzso zzso with novel tandem repetitive sequence has recently been cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso Gilmore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this article, we report additional new sequence derived by zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso The sequence zzso to a stop zzso zzso region of zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso tail, and represents the extreme zzso zzso of zzso A zzso construct zzso in zzso was generated by zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso into the protein fusion and expression zzso zzso was used to generate fusion protein under the control of zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein as well as synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso repeat sequence zzso were used to raise zzso zzso in zzso The zzso to the fusion protein and to the synthetic zzso reacted with the zzso major zzso zzso zzso studies using the above zzso localized the zzso protein product to zzso zzso in human zzso zzso Furthermore, the gene from which this zzso is zzso was mapped to zzso 12 using DNA from a panel of zzso zzso cell zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso was used to assign the regional zzso to zzso Since the eight known human zzso genes map to other zzso we have named this gene zzso in accordance with zzso gene zzso
