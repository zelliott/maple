zzso a recently discovered hormone that may play a crucial role in zzso diabetes, is the founding member of a novel family of zzso proteins that are zzso by specific cell zzso Three other members of this family have been described to date and were termed zzso molecules zzso Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of zzso The mouse zzso encodes a protein of 117 zzso acids that contains a signal zzso leading to zzso of the zzso By Northern zzso the zzso is zzso in bone zzso zzso and lung as well as in peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso have an increased proliferation rate compared to zzso cells and display an altered response to zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide the first experimental evidence that zzso is a zzso zzso with a restricted expression pattern that may play a role in zzso zzso
