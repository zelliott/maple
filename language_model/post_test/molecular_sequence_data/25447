zzso zzso of zzso Y have been zzso The influence of chain zzso zzso zzso and segment zzso on zzso zzso biological activity and zzso properties has been zzso zzso binding and in zzso zzso revealed biological activity already for zzso acids zzso of zzso Y zzso zzso which increased with increasing chain zzso Replacement of zzso in zzso zzso had no influence on zzso whereas zzso and zzso cannot be replaced by zzso or zzso without considerable decrease in zzso zzso The introduction of zzso constraints by the zzso acid zzso zzso in position 30 and replacing the zzso acids zzso by zzso decreased zzso zzso However, the corresponding zzso analogue and a more flexible analogue with zzso at position zzso exhibited considerable affinity for the zzso All these zzso led to a decrease in zzso zzso Strong zzso activities could be detected in a series of 10 zzso zzso which are zzso of zzso parts linked via different zzso molecules to zzso zzso One of the most active molecules was zzso Y zzso acids zzso linked to zzso acids zzso through zzso acid zzso zzso zzso
