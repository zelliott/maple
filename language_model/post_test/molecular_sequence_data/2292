A zzso zzso termed zzso mimics the zzso site of the zzso type 3 zzso zzso The second zzso determining regions of the zzso and zzso of zzso share sequence similarity with a zzso on the zzso We have used synthetic peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to probe the zzso significance of this sequence zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso or zzso zzso neutralized zzso type 3 zzso Although zzso zzso was an effective zzso by itself, free zzso zzso or zzso zzso were unable to elicit zzso unless they were linked to each other zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso response to zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso may bear an important zzso zzso As found previously for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso hypersensitivity response specific for zzso type zzso zzso type 3 specific zzso zzso specifically zzso targets coated with zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that immune zzso between an external zzso and an internal image zzso can be understood at the primary structural zzso These observations may have important implications for understanding the development of zzso network zzso and the regulation of immune zzso
