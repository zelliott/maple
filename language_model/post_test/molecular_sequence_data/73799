A novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso was identified by screening a human stomach zzso library with a probe generated by amplification by reverse zzso chain zzso The zzso were designed from publicly available database zzso sequences selected according to their zzso to the human zzso putative zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence predicts a zzso zzso acid protein possessing the region zzso to zzso zzso with all zzso crucial for zzso binding and zzso strongly suggesting that zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso It shares 56, 55 and zzso identity with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, the other human zzso proteins isolated so zzso Compared with these zzso zzso contains an additional zzso region that is rich in positively charged zzso and could indicate zzso to zzso The zzso gene has been zzso to human zzso band zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed and expressed in a zzso manner, being found at very high levels in zzso heart, liver, small zzso and skeletal muscle zzso and in low amounts in the brain and in blood zzso zzso naturally possesses the zzso substitution equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso
