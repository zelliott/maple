The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso white zzso mosaic virus zzso has been determined from a set of overlapping zzso zzso Forty of the most zzso zzso of zzso showed zzso to the zzso sequences of other zzso The zzso contained five open reading frames which coded for proteins of Mr zzso zzso Mr zzso Mr zzso Mr zzso and Mr zzso (the coat zzso The Mr zzso protein had zzso of zzso acid sequence zzso with putative zzso of other zzso zzso The Mr zzso and Mr zzso proteins had zzso with proteins of the zzso barley stripe mosaic virus zzso beta and the zzso beet zzso yellow vein virus zzso zzso A portion of the Mr zzso protein was also zzso in the zzso inclusion proteins of two zzso The Mr zzso protein had zzso with the zzso putative zzso transmission factor of zzso zzso
