Just before bud zzso a zzso zzso cell forms a ring of zzso in its cell wall; this ring remains at the base of the bud as the bud grows and ultimately forms part of the bud zzso marking the division site on the mother zzso The zzso ring seems to be formed largely or entirely by zzso zzso III, one of the three known zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso ring does not form normally in zzso zzso defective in any of four zzso a family of proteins that are constituents of the zzso zzso that lie immediately zzso to the plasma membrane in the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso interaction was found between zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso which encodes an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed no direct interaction between the zzso and zzso but identified a novel zzso zzso whose product interacts both with zzso and zzso and with one of the zzso zzso this analysis also revealed an interaction between zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has no known zzso it contains a predicted zzso domain, but no other recognizable zzso zzso of zzso is not zzso but causes zzso of zzso deposition and zzso cellular zzso zzso of zzso also causes zzso of zzso deposition and produces a cellular zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso zzso to a ring at the zzso neck that lies predominantly on the zzso side zzso to the zzso site of zzso zzso This zzso depends on the zzso but not on zzso or zzso A zzso fusion protein also zzso to a ring at the zzso neck on the zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose normal zzso is similar to that of zzso does not zzso properly in zzso zzso or zzso zzso strains or in strains that accumulate excess zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso is essentially normal in zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains and in strains that accumulate excess zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the normal zzso of zzso zzso III activity is achieved by assembly of a complex in which zzso is linked to the zzso via zzso and zzso
