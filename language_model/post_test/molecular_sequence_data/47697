zzso sequence requirements of the hairpin zzso have been partially defined by both zzso and in zzso selection zzso It was considered that the best targets were those that included the N downward zzso sequence surrounding the zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies that failed to evaluate all possible combinations of these zzso we have performed an exhaustive analysis of the zzso of 64 zzso zzso They represent all possible sequence combinations of the zzso zzso except the well established zzso No zzso was observed with 24 zzso zzso zzso showed little or no zzso whereas zzso zzso were all zzso The zzso zzso rate was obtained with the zzso zzso zzso rates of sequences zzso zzso zzso A, C, or U), zzso zzso (R zzso A or zzso zzso and zzso were up to 5 times lower than the zzso zzso This shows that other sequences besides zzso could also be considered as good zzso A second group of sequences zzso zzso zzso A or U), zzso (K zzso G or U), zzso zzso zzso A or zzso zzso and zzso were zzso between 6 and 10 times less zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequence of a zzso viral target was zzso to zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso by its zzso hairpin zzso This indicates that our conclusions may be zzso to other hairpin zzso with different zzso
