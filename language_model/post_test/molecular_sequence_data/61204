The fourth zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and, despite being surrounded by large zzso is zzso spliced into the zzso zzso of an 84 zzso sequence from this zzso strongly activated both cryptic zzso and 3' zzso sites surrounding a 78 zzso cryptic zzso The 84 zzso deletion is just upstream of the cryptic 3' zzso zzso the cryptic 3' zzso site was likely activated because the deletion created a better 3' zzso zzso However, the cryptic zzso zzso site was also required to activate the cryptic zzso zzso point zzso in either of the cryptic zzso sites that decreased their match to the consensus zzso site sequence zzso the cryptic zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of these cryptic zzso sites as a pair suggests that they are being zzso by the zzso zzso Interestingly, the large fourth zzso of the zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso protein zzso the cryptic 3' zzso site zzso with the junction between these protein zzso The cryptic zzso zzso site is located between protein zzso where an zzso is found in another gene of the zzso zzso
