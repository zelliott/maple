The recent discovery of zzso as the major zzso in mouse cartilage came as a zzso A great deal of research had focused on zzso and much less was known about the regulation, expression and activity of zzso Two years on, it is still not clear whether zzso or zzso is the major zzso in human zzso On the one hand there are in zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso that suggest a significant role for zzso in zzso On the other hand, zzso (but not zzso mice are protected from cartilage erosion in models of experimental arthritis, and zzso human zzso is substantially more active than zzso The activity of both zzso is modulated by zzso processing, which occurs naturally in zzso The most interesting finding to emerge from our comparison of zzso and zzso is that in terms of gene regulation, these two zzso are the zzso of each zzso In most cases, zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso expression is induced by zzso zzso This paper reviews the data on zzso so zzso It represents a snapshot in time of a field that is fast-moving and very zzso
