zzso muscles are zzso by zzso and zzso motor zzso that display differential physiology and have zzso distinct synaptic zzso zzso motor zzso release much more zzso per impulse and have zzso zzso whereas zzso motor zzso release less zzso and have larger terminals with prominent zzso Using an zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that enhances zzso release in zzso synaptic zzso we found that zzso zzso is prominent in many of the zzso but not zzso nerve endings of zzso motor zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso are strongly expressed in both types of zzso The zzso findings strongly suggested the presence of an zzso zzso in zzso and its differential expression indicated a possible zzso role in zzso zzso zzso we cloned the zzso sequences for the zzso and lobster zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are very similar in sequence to their zzso counterpart, and zzso regions zzso zzso are zzso The widespread occurrence of zzso molecules and their differential zzso in zzso motor zzso indicate a significant role in physiology or development of these zzso
