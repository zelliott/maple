zzso A zzso is essential for cellular chemistry in all forms of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is generated from the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is formed by zzso of zzso zzso by zzso a zzso zzso that is zzso by the cell as an inactive precursor zzso zzso of zzso into zzso occurs via a zzso event at zzso zzso which forms the zzso zzso zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso was necessary for zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso zzso which suggested that zzso zzso might be part of the mechanism of zzso Here we show that zzso lacks zzso activity and that zzso stimulates its zzso zzso of experiments with zzso zzso and genetically zzso zzso zzso support the conclusion that zzso zzso maturation does not involve an zzso transfer zzso We also show that zzso binding to zzso is needed for in zzso activity and that disruption of zzso binding prevents zzso from interacting with zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso that lost its zzso activity and evolved a new function as an zzso sensor that can trigger the maturation of zzso 

zzso zzso is increasingly being recognized as a widespread and important form of zzso regulation in zzso The zzso that catalyze these reactions are poorly characterized in zzso Based on zzso most bacterial zzso contain several zzso but the zzso roles of only a handful have been zzso zzso a subset of putative zzso lack zzso that are critical for activity in most zzso characterized zzso We show that one such putative zzso zzso (formerly zzso lacks zzso activity but functions instead as an zzso A zzso zzso This work establishes the possibility that, like zzso other putative zzso may have evolved new functions while retaining the ability to sense zzso
