G zzso is a divergent member of the G gamma zzso family considered to be a component of the zzso zzso zzso involved in bitter and sweet taste reception in taste bud zzso G zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso protein G zzso zzso zzso which zzso exclusively with G zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the functional range of G zzso assembly with G beta zzso using multiple zzso of G beta association and G beta gamma zzso zzso G zzso was observed to associate with all five G beta zzso zzso zzso upon zzso in zzso as well as function with all five G beta zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso calcium zzso Multiple G zzso zzso pairings were also functional in cellular zzso of zzso C zzso beta 2 zzso and zzso of G zzso zzso beta 1 zzso However, upon cellular zzso of G zzso with different G beta zzso only G zzso zzso G zzso zzso and G zzso zzso pairings were found to form stable zzso zzso by zzso under zzso cell zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that G zzso forms functional G beta gamma zzso with a range of G beta zzso zzso with our detection of G zzso zzso in mouse and human brain and zzso these results imply that this divergent G gamma zzso can act in signal zzso pathways other than that dedicated to taste reception in sensory zzso zzso
