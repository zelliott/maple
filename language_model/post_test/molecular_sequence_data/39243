We report the characteristics of zzso a member of the zzso zzso like zzso Its zzso structure is similar in both mouse and human, and at least four zzso exist in both zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso V like domain of zzso showed approximately zzso identity to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, mouse zzso proteins were uniquely expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that mouse zzso is localized on both zzso and zzso plasma zzso as well as on zzso zzso structures, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso using polarized zzso zzso cells showed that zzso could be zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells could take up zzso and zzso but not zzso These results suggest that zzso might play an important role in molecular traffic across the zzso zzso
