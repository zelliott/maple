We investigated the possible role of zzso zzso losses in zzso cancer zzso by carrying out an zzso imbalance study on a series of zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 49 zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso losses are associated with a significant proportion zzso of zzso zzso zzso but are not involved in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso two genes located in the common deleted region, were screened for zzso in samples with loss of zzso The absence or low frequency of zzso indicates that the zzso of these genes by deletion of one zzso and zzso of the other one plays only a minor role in zzso zzso
