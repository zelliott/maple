In tomato zzso zzso fruit, the number of zzso zzso containing seeds that are derived from zzso varies from two to up to 10 or zzso zzso number affects fruit shape and size and is controlled by several quantitative trait zzso zzso The large majority of the zzso variation is explained by two of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso number zzso that interact zzso with one zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso in the gene are described as key factors leading to the increase in fruit size in modern zzso Here, we report the zzso cloning of zzso The zzso zzso includes a zzso region that is located zzso zzso from the 3' end of zzso which encodes a zzso protein that regulates stem cell fate in zzso The molecular evolution of zzso showed a reduction of diversity in cultivated zzso with the exception of two zzso zzso These two zzso zzso were shown to be responsible for the increase in zzso zzso An evolutionary model of zzso number is proposed zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso appeared after the zzso in the zzso locus to zzso the extreme zzso zzso
