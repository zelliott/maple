Common bean zzso zzso zzso can establish symbiotic associations with several zzso zzso however, the effectiveness of most strains at fixing nitrogen under field conditions is very zzso zzso zzso is a very effective strain, usually referred to as zzso zzso and used successfully in thousands of doses of commercial zzso for the common bean crop in zzso it has shown high rates of nitrogen fixation in all areas representative of the crop in the zzso Here, we present results that indicate that zzso zzso although it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso which includes 10 zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso represents a novel zzso Several zzso traits differentiated zzso zzso from related zzso zzso were also confirmed in the analysis of zzso zzso less than zzso similarity with the other zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The novel species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to establish effective root zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
