zzso is a large zzso that is implicated in cellular processes as diverse as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso zzso mediate its cellular role by binding to the C zzso of target zzso forming zzso zzso The second zzso domain zzso binds to the C zzso of the tumor zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso however, in one zzso zzso zzso a 5 zzso zzso abrogates this zzso The insert causes distinct structural and zzso changes in the alternatively spliced zzso enlarging the zzso loop between zzso and zzso both lengthening and changing the orientation of the zzso zzso giving the base of the binding pocket less flexibility to accommodate zzso and zzso the entire zzso These changes render the binding pocket incapable of binding C zzso possibly having implications in the functional role of zzso
