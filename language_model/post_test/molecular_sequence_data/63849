The envelope zzso of zzso virus, E1 and zzso mediate cell zzso and E1 in particular plays a pivotal role in the fusion of the virus with the zzso zzso Both are the prime targets of the zzso immune zzso zzso zzso of the E1 zzso as well as E1 zzso preparations from virus zzso are commonly used to detect zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso E1 for diagnostic applications has been produced chiefly in zzso expression zzso Here, we report the high-yield overproduction of an engineered E1 zzso in the zzso coli zzso and its simple and convenient zzso into a highly soluble and zzso zzso zzso fusion to one or two units of the zzso coli zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso in zzso zzso and improves the overall zzso of zzso zzso As part of this fusion zzso the E1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso adopts an zzso fold, providing a promising tool for the sensitive and specific detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso bonds in the zzso part of the E1 zzso are sufficient to generate zzso with a high and specific zzso The zzso attached zzso zzso do not impair zzso recognition and binding of zzso E1 when assessed in a zzso zzso zzso and related folding helpers are apparently generic tools for the expression and zzso of otherwise unavailable proteins of diagnostic or medical zzso
