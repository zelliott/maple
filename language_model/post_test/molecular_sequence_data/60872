zzso one of the zzso of the zzso complex, is a zzso zzso which associates with zzso and is the zzso responsible for zzso a zzso zzso zzso muscular zzso To develop an animal model of zzso and to clarify the role of zzso in the zzso of the muscle zzso in zzso we developed zzso mice using a gene targeting zzso zzso mice zzso exhibited progressive muscular zzso with extensive zzso and zzso The zzso also exhibited muscular zzso characteristic of zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso also caused loss of all of the other zzso as well as of zzso in the zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were still present in the zzso However, the zzso complex in zzso was unstable compared with that in the zzso zzso Our data suggest that loss of the zzso complex and zzso alone is sufficient to cause muscular dystrophy, that zzso is an important protein for formation of the zzso complex associated with zzso and that the role of the zzso complex and zzso may be to strengthen the zzso axis connecting the basement membrane with the zzso
