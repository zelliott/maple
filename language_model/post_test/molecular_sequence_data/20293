The influenza virus fusion zzso zzso is the zzso domain of the viral zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso and plays a critical role in fusion between the viral and zzso zzso which is a primary step in zzso The zzso is also an important system for testing simulation methods for zzso zzso In zzso the zzso forms zzso and zzso structures at pH zzso and zzso respectively, while simulations in zzso by different groups have yielded conflicting results with some reports of a continuous zzso without a zzso In this study, zzso zzso correlation zzso were obtained for the zzso zzso and the zzso chemical shifts supported a zzso motif at both pH zzso and zzso with an alternate turn zzso at pH zzso that was absent at pH zzso The alternate zzso was correlated with zzso of the side chain of zzso in the turn and with greater fusion at pH zzso The structures are overall consistent with the hypothesis of zzso zzso membrane location of the zzso with zzso of the zzso region into the membrane and contact of the turn with the zzso zzso The positions of zzso zzso in the pH zzso structure may favor membrane zzso with zzso increased membrane zzso and fusion zzso In addition to their functional zzso these zzso structures are important reference data for simulations of the zzso zzso which can in principle detect the full zzso distribution of the zzso
