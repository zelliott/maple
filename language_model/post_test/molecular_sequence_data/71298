The zzso activity of the C zzso of zzso zzso 2A is regulated by the association with A zzso and B zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binds the C zzso of zzso zzso 2A and protein zzso zzso protein zzso such as protein zzso 4 and protein zzso zzso In the present study, we showed that zzso binds these three zzso and the association of zzso reduces the activities of these zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso binds to the C zzso of zzso zzso 2A but not to protein zzso 4 and protein zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is a common regulator of the C zzso of zzso zzso 2A and protein zzso zzso protein zzso
