Genome sequencing is making a profound impact on zzso Currently, however, only one plant pathogen zzso sequence is publicly available and no zzso project has been initiated for any species of the zzso zzso which includes several important plant zzso This paper describes a targeted sample sequencing approach to study the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso pathogen of zzso A large insert DNA zzso 115 zzso library of zzso was constructed using a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data revealed two overlapping zzso clones that span an entire zzso gene zzso Random zzso and zzso sequence coverage zzso zzso across these zzso identified 25 zzso of 28 zzso genes predicted from the zzso zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cluster contained zzso of known or putative zzso zzso from other zzso species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences similar to genes from the plant pathogen zzso zzso including zzso zzso and sequences similar to genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences showed strongest zzso similarities to genes in the closely related model zzso and animal pathogen zzso zzso However, the positions of some of these genes were different in the two zzso zzso zzso of sequences showed no significant similarity to any database zzso A physical map was made across the zzso region spanning the zzso cluster by zzso to the zzso library and to zzso zzso zzso and by zzso between sequence zzso A multiple zzso coverage zzso library and zzso sample sequencing are an effective combination for zzso useful information from important regions of the zzso zzso providing a wealth of candidate novel zzso genes for functional zzso Other zzso regions could be similarly zzso
