zzso M zzso which is produced by some zzso coli strains to kill competitor strains from the same or related species, was recently shown to inhibit cell wall zzso zzso through zzso degradation of its zzso II zzso zzso strains are protected from the toxin that they produce by zzso of a specific immunity zzso named zzso whose mode of action still remains to be zzso We report here the resolution of the crystal structure of zzso which is composed of four zzso strands and four zzso zzso This rather compact structure revealed a zzso bond between zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, these two zzso and several other zzso appeared to be zzso in the sequences of several proteins of unknown function belonging to the zzso family which exhibit 25 to zzso overall sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess the role of these zzso in the zzso zzso activity of zzso which showed that the zzso bond and zzso from the zzso zzso of the protein were functionally zzso The involvement of zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso bond is also zzso
