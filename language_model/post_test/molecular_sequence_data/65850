We studied the genetic zzso of three zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 11 field zzso zzso virus zzso from the two main citrus growing areas of Argentina, a country where the most efficient zzso of the virus, zzso zzso is present for zzso The zzso of the zzso was zzso by biological indexing, zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that most zzso contained high zzso zzso Divergent sequence zzso were detected in some zzso suggesting zzso of the field zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence zzso of each isolate revealed similar grouping of zzso for genes zzso and zzso The analysis of zzso showed two groups contained the severe zzso Our results showed a high zzso sequence zzso suggesting that zzso could contribute to the observed zzso and that the host can play an important role in the selection of the sequence zzso present in these zzso
