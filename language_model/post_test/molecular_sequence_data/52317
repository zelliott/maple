The nuclear gene zzso coding for the spinach zzso zzso protein zzso exhibits both a zzso and zzso expression zzso In contrast to other zzso genes like zzso and zzso the leaf induction of zzso expression is zzso These unique features of zzso expression provide good models to study the mechanisms regulating zzso development and differentiation in higher zzso We report on the identification of a spinach leaf nuclear factor, designated zzso interacting with the zzso zzso The zzso binding site is zzso in the promoter region of many zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso A binding activity similar to zzso was detected in nuclear extract from zzso zzso soybean suspension zzso Through zzso zzso and transient expression in soybean cell zzso we show that the zzso binding site is a negative element zzso the promoter activity of zzso A zzso zzso of zzso site was able to repress activity of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter extending the negative function of the zzso binding site on promoter zzso
