Until recently, a zzso zzso III zzso was believed to be essential for zzso zzso zzso in all zzso The zzso zzso locus zzso zzso this expectation and instead matures by direct zzso of its zzso hairpin via the zzso activity of zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso analysis to define the functional parameters of zzso zzso zzso These include zzso the requirement for zzso at most, but not all, positions within the zzso zzso zzso surprisingly little influence of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso substantial influence of zzso protein zzso on zzso zzso zzso strong influence of zzso content in the zzso stem on 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the influence of hairpin length on zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso we find that certain hairpin lengths zzso competence to mature via both zzso and zzso zzso and we show, in fact, that a conventional zzso can traverse the zzso zzso Altogether, these data inform the design of effective zzso zzso for gene zzso and reveal novel aspects of zzso handling by zzso zzso
