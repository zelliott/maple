Despite multiple control measures, zzso coli zzso zzso zzso continues to be responsible for many food borne outbreaks in North America and zzso zzso therapy may prove useful for controlling this pathogen in the host, their environment and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso common zzso types of zzso zzso and not zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso isolated from the same zzso pen from which the zzso was zzso were highly susceptible to zzso zzso rate constant and burst size were estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and 350 zzso cell, zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 160 open reading frames zzso 22 zzso genes and 32 strong promoters recognized by host zzso zzso Of 12 zzso without zzso to zzso zzso 7 predicted novel proteins while others exhibited low identity zzso to proteins in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information zzso zzso also lacked the L-shaped tail fiber protein typical of zzso but was predicted to have tail fibers comprised of 2 novel proteins with low identity zzso to tail fibers of zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso a putative side tail fiber protein of a zzso from zzso coli zzso and a zzso domain protein of zzso coli zzso The zzso tail protein zzso shared an overall identify of zzso to that of other zzso zzso with no region coding for more than 6 zzso acids in zzso zzso analysis identified 4 structural proteins corresponding to the zzso major tail, tail fiber and zzso tail tip zzso The zzso of zzso lacked regions coding for known zzso factors, zzso proteins or zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso is a unique, highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that may have considerable potential as a zzso and zzso zzso zzso
