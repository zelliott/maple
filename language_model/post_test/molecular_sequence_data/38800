zzso zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso sequences of their coding regions were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the regulatory zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high similarity to those of zzso zzso especially to the zzso ones rather than to the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that only a single species for each zzso was expressed in zzso and the expression of each zzso increased dramatically from January to March during the maturation stages of the one-year zzso The period when the maximum amount of zzso for zzso was expressed zzso to the one immediately after zzso that is, the maturation stage in which zzso of the average zzso is occupied by zzso The result is consistent with the one as to the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso A in zzso which occurs immediately after zzso This is the first report on the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and its sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso may indicate that the zzso zzso zzso appeared in evolution after the divergence of zzso from the zzso and then zzso rapidly for specific functions in zzso
