zzso zzso zzso represent a potentially valuable tool for the isolation and characterization of B cells that produce zzso An zzso zzso that binds to a subset of B cells producing zzso zzso by the zzso heavy chain 3 zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso plus a small number of zzso zzso zzso in humans has recently been zzso These zzso zzso also zzso zzso in zzso We tested whether the small, clearly defined group of B cells identified with this zzso zzso produce zzso in zzso primates mounting active immune responses to zzso zzso zzso blood B cells were sorted by flow zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso libraries were prepared from each of these sorted groups of zzso zzso zzso gene libraries were prepared from the sorted cells, and the zzso genes expressed in each of the sorted groups were identified by zzso acid zzso Our results indicate that zzso peripheral blood B cells, defined on the basis of binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso used the zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso and were zzso zzso zzso and zzso This novel zzso may be used in numerous applications including definition of zzso zzso zzso in humans and zzso primates and zzso by depletion of B cells producing zzso zzso
