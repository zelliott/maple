We report on full-length mouse type zzso collagen zzso that zzso a zzso alpha zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the mouse and previously characterized human alpha zzso chains exhibit an overall identity of zzso The highest zzso between these chains and to the structurally related type zzso collagen is observed in their zzso zzso zzso Although the mouse and human alpha zzso chains are highly zzso and similar in their overall domain structure, the mouse chain contains only seven zzso zzso whereas the human chain contains zzso Northern analysis of several mouse zzso indicated strong zzso in the case of heart and skeletal muscle zzso and moderate signals with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of type zzso collagen zzso levels at different stages of mouse embryonic development indicated a marked increase in the level between 11 and 15 days of development, which zzso with pronounced development of the muscles, heart, and vascular system in the mouse zzso The mouse gene for type zzso collagen was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to zzso 4, band zzso This result indicates that the mouse type zzso collagen gene and its human counterpart are located in the zzso segments with zzso zzso
