Gene conversion of duplicated genes can slow the divergence of zzso copies over time but can also result in other interesting evolutionary zzso Islands of genetic divergence that persist in the face of gene conversion can point to gene regions undergoing selection for new zzso Novel combinations of genetic variation that differ greatly from the original sequence can result from the transfer of genetic variation between zzso genes by rare gene conversion zzso zzso divergent populations of the zzso zzso zzso provide an excellent model to look at the patterns of divergence among zzso across multiple independent evolutionary zzso 

In this study the evolution of a set of zzso genes zzso putative zzso zzso proteins (called zzso here) are examined in populations of the zzso zzso zzso One pair of duplicated zzso zzso and zzso has regions of high divergence between the copies in the face of apparent zzso gene zzso The zzso gene also has unique zzso in two populations that appear to have resulted from a transfer of genetic variation via zzso gene zzso A second pair of duplicated genes zzso and zzso also shows evidence of gene conversion, but this gene conversion does not appear to have maintained each as a functional copy in all zzso 

The patterns of conservation and sequence divergence across this set of zzso genes among populations of zzso zzso suggest that some interesting evolutionary patterns are occurring at these zzso The results for the zzso zzso illustrate how gene conversion can factor in the creation of a mosaic pattern of regions of high divergence and low zzso When coupled with rare gene conversion events of divergent regions, this pattern can result in the formation of novel proteins differing substantially from either original zzso The evolutionary patterns across these zzso show how gene conversion can both zzso and facilitate diversification of genetic zzso
