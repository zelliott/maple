A novel human gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified from a human zzso zzso library by using the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso as an electronic zzso The gene whose full zzso length is zzso zzso containing 12 zzso and 11 zzso is located in the human zzso zzso The predicted protein zzso by this gene contains 456 zzso acids with a theoretical molecular weight of zzso zzso and zzso point of zzso It is a new member of the zzso family since its sequence possesses the highly zzso zzso domain existing in all zzso zzso Two groups, the zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso share zzso identity in the 456 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso studies show that the zzso zzso protein was localized in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was initiated in the zzso of a 13-year-old boy, and its level increased steadily along with zzso and sexual maturation of the zzso The results of heat stress experiment demonstrate that zzso expression has a relation with zzso In conclusion, our study suggests that we have cloned a novel human gene and this gene may play an important role in human zzso and sexual zzso
