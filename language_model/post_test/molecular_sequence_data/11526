A critical step in zzso cloning is the identification of candidate genes from a large, genetically defined zzso zzso gene isolation by hybrid selection, zzso sequencing, and direct zzso library screening identified 45 candidate gene fragments zzso from a 600 zzso zzso region that contains the zzso zzso These zzso define a minimum of 15 zzso six of which are newly localized to the zzso zzso We present an analysis of the efficiency and the sequences generated for each of these zzso We also compare our zzso set to those reported for the zzso region by three other groups, revealing a surprising lack of overlap among the zzso
