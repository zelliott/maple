The zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso gene has been fused to the reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and its activity zzso by zzso in two human cell zzso Progressive deletions of the zzso regulatory region from the zzso end maintain a high level of expression provided at least 1870 (in zzso zzso or 1963 (in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region are zzso A DNA zzso from zzso to zzso has zzso properties, stimulating zzso of an zzso zzso early promoter independently of orientation and zzso Internal deletions that still retain the zzso element reveal the presence of negative zzso sequences between zzso and zzso Their zzso in fact, increases zzso zzso zzso zzso of expression of the zzso fusion genes in the two cell lines are also observed, indicating the presence of zzso zzso zzso
