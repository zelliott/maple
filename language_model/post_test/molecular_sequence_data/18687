zzso receptors zzso are believed to zzso an indispensable role in insects zzso mating and zzso We obtained zzso high-quality expressed sequencing tags zzso from the zzso zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso mediator, a natural enemy of crop zzso After zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Using zzso searches, a number of zzso genes were identified, including zzso zzso for 25 zzso 14 full-length OR genes were cloned and their expression profiles in the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by real-time zzso The results indicated a diverse distribution between the zzso and zzso yet the majority of OR genes are highly expressed in zzso Three OR genes zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in female zzso eight OR genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in male zzso This is the first report on zzso expression of zzso OR zzso Our study provides a foundational knowledge to explore and understand the molecular basis of zzso reception in this zzso zzso and for the study of zzso interactions of natural zzso
