zzso wound healing depends on cell migration and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso which are necessary for zzso and restoration of the underlying zzso zzso are believed to involve the action of zzso zzso We screened zzso libraries and we found that six zzso zzso genes were highly expressed during rat skin wound zzso They were namely those of zzso 1, zzso 3, zzso 3, zzso A zzso zzso B, and membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression zzso of these zzso zzso the tissue distribution of their zzso the results of zzso experiments in zzso cells, and zzso analyses performed using zzso rat wound zzso support the possibility that during zzso wound healing zzso and zzso B are activated by zzso and zzso 1, zzso Since zzso has been demonstrated to be a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso our finding that zzso and zzso transcripts were expressed in zzso cells exhibiting a similar tissue distribution suggests that zzso activates zzso at the zzso cell zzso This possibility is further supported by our observation that the processing of zzso to its mature form correlated to the detection of zzso in cell zzso of rat zzso expressing the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso together with the detection of high levels of the mature zzso form in the zzso tissue but not in the zzso zzso suggest that zzso and zzso contribute to the restoration of zzso tissue during rat skin wound zzso
