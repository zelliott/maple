A soluble form of zzso alkaline zzso was zzso to apparent zzso from the culture media of zzso cells which had been infected with zzso zzso zzso human zzso alkaline zzso zzso To facilitate zzso an zzso consisting of 6 tandem zzso for zzso and a stop zzso was engineered into the zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso through a zzso column was estimated to be 54 zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso That of the native zzso was 90 zzso as estimated by gel zzso indicating that the zzso soluble zzso is zzso The zzso was used for production of zzso specific for human zzso zzso analysis showed a single zzso band in the cell zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso However, upon zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human origin and the soluble zzso of insect origin migrated to the same position on zzso zzso indicating that the size difference between the two zzso is ascribed to zzso zzso The zzso prepared against the zzso zzso were found to be useful also for zzso and zzso zzso
