In order to understand the relationship between zzso acid bacteria zzso species and zzso zzso a total of 65 zzso strains isolated from mixed pasture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and its badly preserved zzso were subjected to zzso and genetic zzso According to these zzso the zzso were divided into 13 groups, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first report to document that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are present in zzso forage zzso zzso zzso group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved zzso Some zzso showed a wide range of growth preferences for zzso zzso optimal growth pH and temperature in zzso indicating that they have a high growth zzso These results are useful in understanding the diversity of zzso associated with decayed zzso of zzso and zzso
