One approach in toxicity testing using zzso is to assess the zzso of light energy absorbed as a result of exposure to zzso In this study, four strains of zzso were isolated to obtain a variety of zzso for testing from sites receiving various levels of environmental zzso around zzso New zzso The strains were characterized by partially sequencing zzso a routinely used gene in plant zzso with a large existing database of zzso Based on zzso observation and gene zzso the strains were identified as Chlorella zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were exposed to the zzso zzso and the metal zzso and their responses were measured using the zzso zzso Chlorella zzso was the most zzso Two strains of zzso minor were isolated from different ponds in an zzso zzso at a sewage treatment zzso Analysis of zzso indicated that the isolate from the least contaminated pond was more sensitive to zinc (although zzso analysis did not show this zzso This suggests that the selective pressure exerted on zzso strains by a contamination zzso over short a distance is zzso by both genetic and zzso methods, with implications for sourcing appropriate indicator organisms from the zzso
