In plant genetic engineering, the identification of gene promoters leading to particular expression patterns is crucial for the development of new genetically modified plant zzso This research was conducted in order to isolate and characterize several new promoters from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso gene zzso Three promoters zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso zzso analyses showed that all of the promoters contain three zzso putative zzso elements which are located upstream of the zzso start zzso These elements are included a zzso a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, all of the promoters also have the zzso zzso but with a different zzso These promoters were constructed zzso with zzso reporter gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to build a new zzso zzso using zzso Extension zzso Cloning zzso zzso zzso expression zzso that was done by using zzso method was used to show functionality of these zzso zzso and quantitative analysis from zzso zzso showed that these promoters were functional and zzso a specific activity in tobacco zzso zzso zzso tomato fruits zzso zzso and banana fruits zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso could be zzso as a zzso promoter because it was able to drive the gene expression in all transformed tissue described in here and also comparable to zzso On the other hand, zzso drove specific expression in the aerial parts of zzso such as zzso and zzso thus zzso drove specific expression in fruit zzso The results obtained from transient analysis showed that these promoters had a distinct activity although they came from same gene zzso The DNA sequences identified here are new promoters potentially use for genetic engineering in zzso or other zzso
