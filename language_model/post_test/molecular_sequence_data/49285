Human zzso zzso replicates and zzso its zzso in the nucleus of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We wanted to understand the zzso necessary for the nuclear transport of the major coat zzso zzso which makes up about zzso of the viral zzso zzso A zzso basic zzso zzso necessary for the nuclear zzso of zzso was identified and shown to be able to import reporter proteins into the zzso The sequence is zzso among the zzso zzso region of zzso This newly identified sequence will facilitate the understanding of the replication of these zzso
