The zzso expression of the early growth response gene zzso is one molecular mechanism for both zzso zzso of the G alpha zzso gene and accelerated growth in zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso These events are dependent on an zzso area in the zzso region of the G alpha zzso gene that contains an zzso motif zzso However, acquisition of the polarized zzso in zzso cells is accompanied by loss of zzso expression and occupancy of the zzso site by nuclear binding proteins other than zzso We now demonstrate that one of these binding proteins is the zzso tumor zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells acquiring the polarized zzso zzso both G alpha zzso gene zzso and growth in these zzso These findings suggest the existence of zzso pathways in zzso cells that alternatively abrogates zzso and promotes zzso gene zzso thereby modulating a target zzso G alpha zzso that is participatory for growth and differentiation in zzso zzso These studies emphasize the usefulness of the zzso zzso cell as a model to zzso normal programs of genetic differentiation in which zzso zzso
