zzso zzso is a zzso zzso found in bone and other normal and zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso urine and zzso The present study demonstrates that bovine milk zzso is zzso at 27 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso acids were identified by a combination of zzso acid analysis, sequence analysis of zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso and one zzso were located in zzso zzso and two zzso were found in the sequence zzso These sequence motifs are identical with the recognition sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso II, zzso zzso of the zzso pattern revealed that the zzso were clustered in groups of approximately three spanned by zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso This pattern is probably of importance in the multiple functions of zzso involving interaction with zzso and zzso calcium zzso Furthermore, three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified in a zzso and zzso region of the zzso Three putative zzso sites zzso 63, zzso 85, and zzso zzso are present in bovine zzso but sequence and mass zzso analysis showed that none of these zzso were zzso in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the majority of the zzso sites in bovine zzso as well as all three zzso sites were zzso in other zzso zzso This conservation of zzso even in otherwise less zzso regions of the zzso indicates that the zzso of zzso at specific sites is essential for the function of the zzso
