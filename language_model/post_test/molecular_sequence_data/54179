The objective of this study was to analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin domain organization within the aquatic species zzso zzso as well as to study the evolution of the zzso zzso The species is subdivided into three zzso that differ in host range and geographical zzso We have found three different types zzso II, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins with common zzso (an zzso zzso zzso domain zzso an zzso domain, and a domain resembling that of the zzso protein of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso (a zzso zzso domain zzso a domain of unknown function zzso a domain resembling that of the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso domain zzso zzso 1 zzso harbor zzso toxin types I and II, zzso 2 zzso carry zzso toxin type III, and zzso 3 zzso have zzso toxin type zzso The analyzed zzso 2 zzso harbor two identical copies of zzso one zzso and the other zzso The evolutionary history of the gene demonstrates that zzso toxins are zzso zzso pieces with different evolutionary zzso some of which have been acquired by zzso or zzso horizontal gene zzso Finally, we have found evidence that the evolutionary history of the zzso gene for zzso 2 differs totally from the gene history of zzso 1 and zzso
