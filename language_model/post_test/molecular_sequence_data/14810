The human zzso zzso gene and two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and shown to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction with zzso acting as a typical zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso reaction with zzso as an zzso zzso zzso was shown to be expressed specifically in the liver and zzso and the cellular zzso of zzso protein was restricted to the zzso Interestingly, labeling using highly affinity zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was suppressed in all zzso zzso but not in other liver zzso zzso repression in zzso cells in the liver was controlled at the zzso zzso zzso is a good candidate as a novel marker of zzso zzso and may be a key zzso in the transition between differentiation and zzso of liver zzso
