The recently cloned gene zzso shows restricted expression in adult zzso with high expression being found in zzso and zzso in the pregnant zzso zzso However, both the gene and the protein product are specifically zzso in breast zzso To investigate the control of expression of the zzso zzso we have cloned and functionally zzso the zzso zzso region of the zzso which was found to contain another putative zzso Two zzso start sites of the zzso gene were mapped by zzso zzso A short zzso zzso zzso region was defined using reporter gene zzso which encompasses the major zzso start site and exhibits a strong zzso promoter activity in all cell lines zzso However, regions upstream of this sequence repress zzso more effectively in a zzso breast cell line as compared to breast cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso region is zzso and includes consensus zzso sites, zzso boxes, zzso element zzso and other putative zzso zzso analysis showed that two intact zzso zzso binding sites zzso here to bind zzso and/or zzso are critical for zzso promoter activity, while a negative role for a zzso zzso box is zzso The sequence of the core promoter is highly zzso in the mouse and zzso expression in the mouse zzso has been zzso Using zzso we therefore examined the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to control expression of a reporter gene during zzso We found that not only is the core promoter sufficient to activate zzso in zzso but that the expression of the reporter gene zzso both temporally and zzso with regions where zzso zzso is highly zzso This suggests that tissue specific controlling elements are found within the short zzso and are functional in the embryonic zzso
