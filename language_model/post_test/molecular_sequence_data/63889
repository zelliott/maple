A subset of lupus patients with severe zzso and zzso zzso produces zzso primarily against two major zzso of the zzso A (also known as zzso zzso These sequences span zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso zzso These two zzso represent structurally different regions of the zzso as both zzso are located on the surface, but the A6 zzso is functionally masked in zzso by binding between zzso A and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso with either the A3 or A6 peptides constructed on a branching zzso zzso zzso zzso with each of these peptides first developed zzso directed against the zzso of zzso With zzso the immune response of rabbits zzso with the A3 zzso spread to other common zzso regions of zzso zzso These regions of zzso A bound by A3 zzso rabbits are very similar to common zzso in human systemic lupus zzso These A3 zzso rabbits also develop zzso to common zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso as well as clinical symptoms of systemic lupus zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, rabbits zzso with the A6 zzso only develop zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso are capable of zzso native small nuclear zzso zzso zzso with the A3 zzso of zzso A (a surface zzso but not the A6 zzso zzso zzso an extensive, varied immune response against multiple small nuclear zzso zzso similar to that seen in human systemic lupus zzso
