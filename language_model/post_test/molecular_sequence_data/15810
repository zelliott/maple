zzso a protein zzso zzso tumor promoter, can zzso regulate the zzso growth factor zzso zzso through zzso of high affinity zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso of protein zzso C, zzso does not induce significant zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso does stimulate zzso of the zzso zzso at other zzso and zzso zzso We now identify zzso zzso as the major site of zzso on the zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso of zzso zzso may mediate changes in the binding and zzso state of the zzso zzso
