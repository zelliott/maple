The C2 domain is a zzso motif of approximately 130 zzso in length originally identified in the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso Single and multiple copies of C2 zzso have been identified in a growing number of zzso zzso proteins that interact with cellular zzso and mediate a broad array of critical zzso zzso including membrane trafficking, the generation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the control of protein zzso As a group, C2 zzso display the remarkable property of binding a variety of different zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this functional diversity is the fact that not all proteins containing C2 zzso are regulated by zzso suggesting that some C2 zzso may play a purely structural role or may have lost the ability to bind zzso The present review summarizes the information currently available regarding the structure and function of the C2 domain and provides a novel sequence alignment of 65 C2 domain primary zzso This alignment predicts that C2 zzso form two distinct zzso zzso illustrated by the recent crystal structures of C2 zzso from zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso The alignment highlights zzso that may be critical to the C2 domain fold or required for zzso binding and zzso
