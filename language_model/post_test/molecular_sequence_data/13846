A new zzso detection system combined with a sandwich DNA zzso reaction in zzso has been developed for the detection of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso DNA amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso First, a zzso of the zzso gag gene was zzso The amplified DNA fragments were zzso and zzso to a capture probe zzso in zzso and to a zzso detection zzso A zzso zzso zzso could then react on the zzso probe and the zzso activity detected by means of the zzso system, with production of a zzso zzso This sandwich zzso followed by a zzso reaction detected as little as 7 zzso of target zzso The zzso zzso detected 5 zzso copies generated after one round of zzso even if no band was seen on an zzso zzso The zzso was applied to the detection of zzso DNA in peripheral blood zzso cells after one round of zzso and allowed to clearly identify a positive sample as compared to zzso zzso
