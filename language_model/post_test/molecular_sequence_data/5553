We have cloned and zzso a region zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso previously zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These lie downstream of zzso and zzso which zzso the El zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, zzso Previous reports identified the zzso gene downstream of zzso zzso an zzso zzso However, we now show that this open reading frame zzso encodes a zzso zzso and since the zzso acid sequence is highly zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been renamed zzso zzso contains the highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid regions of the zzso sites of other zzso The region downstream of zzso has been zzso and has revealed zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso to those of the accessory zzso proteins zzso zzso required by zzso and various other bacterial species for the production of mature active zzso and in agreement with this, we show that both zzso and zzso are required to restore a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso stop zzso for zzso zzso the zzso site for zzso and a zzso resembling a zzso zzso is present immediately downstream from zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso lies downstream of zzso but is transcribed in the opposite direction and is predicted to share the same putative zzso zzso with zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso among many zzso are present in zzso which is highly zzso to the immune inhibitor A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso as approximately 102 zzso which is consistent with the coding capacity of the zzso The genetic organization of this region suggests that it is possibly part of a zzso island, zzso products capable of damaging host cells and/or involved in zzso acquisition by zzso zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso were attenuated in the infant mouse model, nor did they exhibit reduced colonization potential compared with wild type in competition zzso
