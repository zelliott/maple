We previously reported an efficient method for zzso zzso cloning using zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso zzso The zzso was performed by zzso between zzso of cell type B and the zzso made from zzso of cell type A using an zzso primer zzso linked to zzso particles in an zzso zzso The zzso common to both types of cells could be removed by a brief zzso In the present paper, the method was improved by using the sense strand DNA instead of zzso for zzso to zzso zzso linked to the particles to minimize zzso degradation and by zzso the zzso zzso The sense strand DNA was made from zzso by zzso zzso Using the improved method, a zzso zzso library with longer zzso zzso was successfully constructed with higher probability than the original zzso
