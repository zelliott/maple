Twenty zzso zzso strains with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from five traditional zzso made of raw milk with no added starters belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 strains each) were subjected to a series of zzso and genetic typing methods, with the aims of determining their zzso relationships and suitability as zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso with zzso and zzso proved that all strains were different except for three zzso of the zzso zzso which showed identical zzso zzso zzso sequence typing zzso analysis using internal sequences of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed considerable zzso zzso zzso although deduced zzso acid changes were zzso Analysis of the zzso data for the present strains and others from other dairy and zzso sources showed that all of them clustered into the zzso or zzso zzso group, by using both independent and combined gene zzso These two groups of strains also showed distinctive zzso zzso and zzso activity profiles, with the strains in the zzso group showing broader zzso However, the profiles of zzso to 16 antibiotics were very similar, showing no zzso resistance, except for zzso resistance in three identical zzso zzso zzso The numbers and zzso of volatile compounds produced in milk by the strains belonging to these two groups were clearly different, with the zzso zzso strains producing higher zzso of more zzso derived zzso Together, the present results support the idea that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso actually represent true zzso Some strains of the two subspecies in this study appear to be good starter zzso
