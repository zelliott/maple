zzso zzso factor, or vascular zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of about 40 zzso that promotes fluid and protein leakage from blood zzso Various human tumor cell lines and cells including fetal vascular smooth muscle cells produce zzso Since zzso zzso cells zzso are closely related to vascular smooth muscle cells, we examined whether cultured human zzso produce zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that cultured human zzso expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso also expressed zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso Although the sizes of the transcripts suggested the existence of unique molecular species of zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso as well as human zzso expressed zzso zzso and 189 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that there are no unique alternative zzso products of zzso zzso in zzso Fetal calf serum and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso expression in cultured human zzso zzso growth zzso 1 enhanced zzso zzso expression in cultured human zzso at least within 24 zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso did not change the zzso zzso The zzso depressed the zzso increase in zzso zzso expression is therefore probably a result of zzso zzso zzso protein was detected in cultured human zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso increased zzso protein levels as well as those of zzso zzso in cultured human zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
