We have designed and zzso by conventional chemical techniques a zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso This zzso assumes a randomly coiled zzso at pH zzso At pH zzso a hairpin zzso forms between its zzso zzso zzso sequence and the consecutive zzso zzso leaving the second zzso zzso as a dangling zzso 3' zzso On reducing the pH to zzso this second zzso zzso folds back onto the major groove of the hairpin zzso resulting in an zzso zzso zzso zzso We have used a variety of zzso zzso mobility, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso light and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques to characterize the different zzso their stability and the folding zzso into an zzso triple zzso The zzso properties of this zzso triple strand in 100 zzso are: zzso 71 degrees zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso those of the hairpin are: zzso 63 degrees zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso At intermediate pH values, the triplex to zzso transition breaks up into its component triplex to hairpin and hairpin to zzso transitions with zzso zzso zzso 41 degrees zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 63 degrees zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso
