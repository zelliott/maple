zzso predicting the ability of zzso peptides to bind to major zzso complex class II zzso molecules is an essential step in developing new zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence zzso of the binding affinity of zzso binding peptides is important for understanding zzso and immune zzso The task of predicting zzso binding peptides is complicated by the significant zzso in their zzso Most existing zzso methods for predicting zzso binding peptides focus on identifying a nine zzso acids core region in each binding zzso We formulate the problems of zzso and zzso predicting flexible length zzso peptides as multiple instance learning and multiple instance zzso problems, zzso Based on this zzso we introduce zzso a novel method for predicting zzso binding affinity using multiple instance zzso We present results of experiments using several benchmark data sets that show that zzso is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods for predicting zzso binding zzso An online web server that zzso the zzso method for zzso binding affinity prediction is freely accessible at zzso
