zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein that is involved in bacterial interaction with zzso and colonization of the zzso zzso The zzso mature protein is representative of a broadly important class of zzso that have remained relatively poorly characterized due to their large size and highly modular zzso zzso contains two different types of repeats zzso and zzso present in six and eight copies, respectively, and shown to be responsible for the adherence to zzso zzso Here we report the zzso resolution crystal structure of a type 2 zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso two structurally related zzso resembling the functional repeat found in a family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain bears striking structural similarity to the repeat unit of zzso L zzso from zzso zzso suggesting binding in a zzso zzso zzso A distorted zzso fold is also seen in the zzso zzso As with zzso zzso repeats were able to interact in zzso with a large repertoire of zzso zzso including zzso zzso This zzso zzso activity is consistent with the current model that zzso responses against zzso zzso are of broad specificity and low zzso
