zzso B zzso is a zzso zzso involved in many zzso including viral infections, zzso transplant zzso and zzso zzso To measure the extent of genetic variation in zzso we screened the zzso gene for zzso and defined a frequently represented zzso zzso zzso In this zzso three zzso acids of the mature protein zzso are zzso to zzso In zzso zzso T zzso zzso was expressed at similar levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso individuals, demonstrating that zzso zzso is a stable zzso Active zzso zzso expressed in zzso cell lines displayed zzso activity, but in contrast to zzso zzso it did not accumulate in the nucleus and was unable to induce Bid zzso zzso c release, or zzso zzso modeling showed that the three zzso acid zzso clustered near the zzso zzso of the zzso indicating that this region of the protein may be involved in the zzso targeting of zzso The zzso zzso zzso that we describe appears to be incapable of inducing zzso in tumor cell lines, and its presence could, therefore, influence both the prognosis of cancer patients and the success rates of zzso cellular zzso
