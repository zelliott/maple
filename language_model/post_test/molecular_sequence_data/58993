It has been proposed that zzso 6 of the human Y zzso contains the gene or genes that control zzso zzso zzso zzso We have studied this region in 33 patients with zzso or zzso using zzso amplification of the zzso zzso gene and of 13 zzso sites zzso all mapping within zzso zzso Six of the 33 patients showed no amplification of specific zzso whereas there was no failure of amplification in normal male zzso We deduce that these six patients had zzso in zzso 6 of the Y zzso that correlated with the zzso or zzso of these zzso On biopsy of the zzso two of these patients showed a low number of germ cells, and four showed arrest with zzso We conclude that zzso amplification of zzso regions is a powerful and very sensitive tool for screening zzso zzso
