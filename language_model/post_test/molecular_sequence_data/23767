zzso presumably zzso as a consequence of a shortfall in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by zzso T regulatory cells zzso However, the mechanism underlying the functional impairment of zzso remains largely zzso In this study a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed on an zzso to enhance zzso function, and the resulting zzso expanded zzso in both young and older zzso zzso diabetic zzso mice, but delayed zzso diabetes only in the zzso Interestingly, zzso induced at 4 zzso of age had significant active zzso zzso zzso and sustained protection against diabetes, whereas zzso expanded during zzso had minimal zzso and could not protect against zzso The zzso probably operate zzso function through zzso because zzso blockade of zzso zzso protection against zzso Surprisingly, young zzso that modulated zzso T cells maintained stable frequency over time in the protected animals, but decreased their zzso at the age of 8 zzso More zzso these zzso zzso zzso which were previously zzso became unable to zzso resistance against zzso Thus, a zzso decline in active zzso zzso zzso function, leading to a break in tolerance and the onset of zzso
