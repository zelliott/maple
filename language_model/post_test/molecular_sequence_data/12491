We have selected zzso zzso that exhibit a zzso active zzso zzso in the absence of the beta zzso of the zzso G zzso zzso analysis of one such zzso revealed that it contained zzso zzso in two distinct zzso both of which contributed to the zzso zzso One zzso identifies the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein with zzso to GAP zzso and to zzso zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate the zzso in strains lacking the G beta zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso deletion of zzso increases signaling in the zzso pathway, whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso functions as a negative regulator of the zzso response zzso The second zzso present in the original zzso proved to be an zzso of a known zzso zzso which encodes a putative protein zzso that functions in the high zzso stress zzso The zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso but by itself did not activate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicate that an important target of zzso is zzso a zzso zzso required for polarity establishment and bud zzso This finding coupled with recent experiments with zzso and zzso cells indicating that zzso can interact with and activate zzso a protein zzso that operates in the zzso pathway, leads us to suggest that zzso controls the activity of zzso which in turn controls the magnitude of signaling in the zzso zzso via zzso
