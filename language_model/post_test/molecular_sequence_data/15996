The zzso zzso and zzso undergo zzso of the zzso zzso at pH zzso at similar zzso However, they form different zzso The zzso zzso gave a zzso ratio of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gave no zzso amounts of these products but rather gave a zzso zzso formed from the zzso displacement of the zzso side chain zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso This compound was slowly zzso at carbon 2 of the zzso zzso At pH values above zzso the zzso zzso also underwent zzso to form zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso show that below pH zzso they have very different preferred zzso and it is these different zzso which result in the different mechanisms of zzso Above pH zzso both peptides have similar zzso and zzso by the same mechanism to give equivalent zzso Neither mechanism of zzso was subject to general base zzso by the zzso These results suggest that zzso rates of the zzso sequence in proteins will vary according to the zzso of the zzso backbone of each respective zzso The results also show that zzso zzso which are penultimate to the zzso zzso can react to form an zzso zzso zzso
