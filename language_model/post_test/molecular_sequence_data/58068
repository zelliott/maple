To develop a molecular tool for zzso targeting of gene expression in immature and differentiated zzso cells of the small and large zzso zzso we have isolated the zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso This region contains numerous short sequences that are zzso among other zzso promoters of genes expressed in differentiated zzso This DNA zzso promotes the zzso and expression of the zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines but not in a zzso zzso cell zzso The pattern of expression zzso that of the zzso zzso indicating that this sequence can direct zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cell line, expression of the reporter gene is already zzso in zzso cells, and dramatically increases when terminal differentiation is zzso Thus, as previously reported for the zzso gene the isolated zzso region of the zzso gene responds positively to conditions known to stimulate terminal differentiation of these cultured zzso zzso zzso The reported results indicate that this zzso zzso contains sufficient regulatory elements to zzso the expression pattern of the zzso promoter during zzso zzso
