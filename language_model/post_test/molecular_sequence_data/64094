The zzso full-length mouse zzso zzso zzso a defective zzso protein zzso zzso was cloned by reverse zzso of mouse liver zzso The mouse zzso zzso showed zzso identity to human zzso The mouse zzso gene consists of 20 zzso and has exactly the same zzso structure as the human zzso zzso Mouse zzso was shown to be zzso neither by itself nor by other protein zzso zzso In addition, its expression did not affect the zzso level of cellular proteins in zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso was expressed at high levels in lung and zzso zzso among adult zzso and in the tail, zzso zzso gut, and zzso regions among embryonic zzso These data suggest that mouse zzso an zzso of human zzso plays multiple roles in embryonic zzso
