Two species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form stable zzso with zzso zzso Both zzso promote the persistence of their zzso associations by producing specialized zzso which facilitate the simultaneous zzso of the host and its zzso zzso Here the genetic diversity of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is zzso The results indicate that the primary zzso of both zzso are closely related and belong to a specific group of symbiotic zzso zzso Related strains have previously been reported from zzso and zzso and from many zzso zzso The evolutionary origins of all these zzso may trace back to zzso zzso While the laboratory strain zzso zzso zzso zzso has been widely used in experimental studies of zzso associations, zzso zzso have not yet been identified from zzso zzso in the zzso
