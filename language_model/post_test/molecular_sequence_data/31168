There is evidence that certain zzso at the zzso locus are correlated with zzso to zzso diabetes zzso zzso and in particular that zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acid at position 57 are zzso The availability of a large group of patients with zzso enabled us to assess the role of zzso zzso in zzso to the disease in order to confirm and extend recent observations derived from studies of smaller numbers of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and the zzso chain reaction, we studied zzso unrelated patients with zzso and zzso unrelated normal subjects for eight zzso zzso zzso Two major findings emerged from these zzso First, the presence of an zzso zzso was zzso Only 6 of the zzso patients with zzso zzso percent) were positive for zzso as compared with 74 of the zzso normal subjects zzso percent; P less than zzso Thus, persons with the zzso zzso which is one of the zzso forms of the beta chain of the zzso zzso rarely had zzso no matter which other zzso zzso zzso they inherited zzso zzso Second, the presence of the zzso zzso increased the risk of zzso The relative risk of zzso was zzso in persons zzso for zzso and it was similar in persons with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the relative risk of zzso in persons who had the zzso zzso was zzso demonstrating that the protective effect of zzso predominated over the effect of zzso We conclude that the presence of the zzso Class II zzso zzso is strongly protective against the development of zzso and that complete zzso typing is necessary for accurate assessment of zzso to zzso
