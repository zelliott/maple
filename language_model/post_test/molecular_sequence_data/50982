zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize and clone zzso IV, a new zzso zzso in the zzso and to study its function during growth cone zzso zzso IV is zzso expressed on a subset of zzso pathways in the developing zzso and on zzso bands of zzso cells in developing limb zzso One of these bands zzso to the location where the growth cones of the zzso pioneer zzso make a characteristic turn while extending toward the zzso zzso cultured in the zzso zzso or zzso exhibit zzso formation of this zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis suggests that zzso IV has a signal zzso long zzso zzso and short zzso zzso and shows no zzso with any protein in the available data zzso Thus, zzso IV appears to be a novel integral membrane protein that functions in growth cone zzso
