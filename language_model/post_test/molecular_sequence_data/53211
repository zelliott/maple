zzso overgrowth in the stomach may occur under conditions of diminished or absent acid zzso Under these conditions, zzso of the hormone zzso is zzso zzso bacterial factors may directly stimulate zzso zzso with this hypothesis, we found that mice zzso for 2 months with a mixed bacterial culture of opportunistic pathogens showed an increase in serum zzso To examine regulation of gene expression by bacterial zzso stable zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso promoters were zzso with live zzso Both zzso zzso and a zzso fraction were also zzso with the zzso A level of zzso organisms per zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins prepared from these bacterial zzso zzso the promoter significantly more than the live zzso or unheated zzso A zzso zzso protein stimulating the zzso and zzso promoters was cloned and found to be an zzso zzso zzso using zzso to the zzso protein identified an zzso zzso as the bacterial species that expressed this protein and zzso the mouse zzso Moreover, zzso of mice with a pure culture of the zzso zzso caused zzso We conclude that bacterial colonization of the stomach may increase serum zzso levels in part through the ability of the bacteria to produce zzso proteins that directly stimulate zzso and zzso gene zzso These results zzso zzso bacteria in the zzso of zzso gene expression and raise the possibility that a variety of organisms may contribute to the increase in serum zzso and subsequent zzso cell proliferation in the zzso zzso
