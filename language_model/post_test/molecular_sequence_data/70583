The zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso A highly zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso which are located near the zzso zzso of the zzso were systematically modulated by zzso zzso Large structural change was not detected on the zzso and circular zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso properties were not observed, but the apparent zzso value for soluble form of zzso liver zzso zzso zzso was affected by the zzso of zzso with zzso acid and with zzso deletion of zzso zzso and addition of zzso The values of the zzso constant zzso were obviously decreased by the substitution of zzso with zzso acid or the addition of zzso In these two zzso the rate for reduction of zzso was zzso and the rate for zzso of reduced zzso was zzso These results showed that zzso and zzso zzso group in zzso are not critical for the electron transfer to zzso but the zzso environmental changes at these positions could affect the recognition of zzso and zzso the zzso function of the zzso by changing the stability of reduced zzso
