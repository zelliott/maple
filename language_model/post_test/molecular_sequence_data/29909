The entire zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein gene sequences and deduced zzso acid sequences for 18 selected zzso zzso virus zzso representative of the natural genetic diversity within the New Jersey zzso are zzso zzso analysis of the data using maximum zzso allowed construction of evolutionary trees for the individual genes and the combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of these zzso Virtually identical rates of zzso zzso were found for each zzso indicating that evolution of these genes occurs at essentially the same zzso Although up to 19 and zzso sequence differences were evident in the P and N zzso respectively, no variation in gene length or evidence of zzso zzso was zzso However, striking evolutionary differences were observed among the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso virus New Jersey zzso zzso and G zzso The N protein zzso acid sequence was the most highly zzso among the different zzso indicating strong functional and structural zzso zzso the P protein zzso acid sequences were highly zzso indicating considerably fewer constraints or greater evolutionary pressure on the P zzso Much of the remarkable zzso acid zzso of the P protein resided in a zzso domain located between zzso acids 153 and zzso The zzso within this region would be consistent with it playing a structural role as a zzso to maintain correct zzso presentation of the separate active zzso of this zzso zzso In marked contrast, the adjacent domain I of the P protein zzso thought to be under little evolutionary zzso contained a highly zzso zzso The zzso of a short, potentially functional overlapping open reading frame to this region may explain this apparent zzso
