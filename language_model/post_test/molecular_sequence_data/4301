The she gene of zzso zzso zzso which also harbors the internal zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from an avian zzso zzso coli, an zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso 5, and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the possibility that this locus was carried on a larger zzso element, the zzso zzso zzso zzso she gene was zzso disrupted by zzso exchange using a zzso zzso zzso Then, to detect loss of the she zzso the zzso zzso was zzso onto zzso acid medium to select for zzso zzso which were observed to arise at a frequency of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso analysis confirmed loss of the zzso locus in six independent zzso zzso Sample sequencing over a zzso region zzso she identified four zzso zzso zzso the group II zzso sequence zzso and the 3' end of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso lying zzso zzso downstream and in an orientation zzso with respect to zzso The deletion was mapped to zzso zzso zzso A and determined to have a size of 51 zzso zzso with zzso zzso confirmed that at least zzso zzso of the zzso zzso element was unique to the seven zzso strains investigated, supporting the conclusion that she lay within a large zzso zzso The method described in this study, termed island zzso provides a useful tool to further the study of zzso islands in zzso zzso this approach could also be of value in constructing safer live attenuated bacterial zzso
