We have systematically compared structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been determined by zzso or zzso zzso All the known zzso zzso are very zzso The core of these structures consists of two zzso in the zzso zzso associated with one or two other zzso The structures can be classified according to either additional structural compositions or the zzso of the zzso Many zzso whose structures are currently unknown, have sequences which resemble those of known structures, permitting outlines of the new structures to be zzso
