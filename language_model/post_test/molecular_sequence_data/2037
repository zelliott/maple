A system for the analysis of independent zzso transfer events from zzso to plants is zzso The complete zzso except for the 25 zzso border sequences was replaced by one zzso of a plant virus so that upon transfer to the plant, a viable zzso is produced by zzso zzso of virus from such infected plants allowed analysis of DNA sequences at or close to the ends of zzso zzso A rather zzso right border remnant of three zzso was found, whereas the sequences remaining at the left end were more zzso A point deletion in the left 25 zzso sequence results in even less precise processing at the left zzso In addition, many rescued zzso molecules carry small direct repeats between the joined zzso ends; linear zzso molecules are therefore transported to the zzso
