zzso zzso zzso is a unique zzso zzso that plays a key role in the energy metabolism of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes several proteins of unknown function with high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso Here we report on the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso that contains a zzso related to the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso as deduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the primary zzso It is composed of four different zzso zzso by a putative zzso unit zzso zzso A fifth protein zzso zzso by this zzso unit could not be detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso and zzso encodes a second integral membrane zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso and zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso with three zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso show high sequence similarity to proteins zzso by the zzso locus of zzso zzso and to zzso of the zzso complex from zzso zzso The zzso groups of the zzso are rapidly reduced by reduced zzso zzso which indicates that the zzso functions as a zzso zzso The zzso electron zzso has not yet been zzso zzso zzso monitored by zzso zzso were carried out to characterize the zzso clusters of the zzso In addition to zzso signals due to zzso zzso signals of an unusual zzso species with g values of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso species could be reduced in a zzso transfer reaction, but could not be further zzso and shows zzso properties similar to those of a zzso species recently identified in zzso In zzso this zzso species is specifically induced by the zzso of the zzso and is thought to be an intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso not only share sequence zzso but may also have a similar active site and a similar zzso zzso
