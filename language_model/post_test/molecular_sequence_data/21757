Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso is characterized by senile plaques in the brain and evidence of zzso zzso zzso stress may zzso plaque formation in zzso however, the link between zzso damage and plaque formation remains zzso zzso are zzso proteins in which zzso lead to accelerated plaque formation and zzso familial Alzheimer's zzso zzso physically interact with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso The functional consequences of these interactions are zzso In the current study we expressed a zzso zzso in zzso wing and sensory organ precursors of the zzso This caused zzso typical of zzso signaling zzso zzso We found that while expression of zzso or zzso alone produced no zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso led to an enhanced zzso zzso zzso This zzso was more severe and more zzso than that caused by the expression of zzso zzso In order to determine whether these zzso were indeed affecting zzso zzso this experiment was performed in a genetic background carrying an activated zzso zzso zzso The zzso were almost completely rescued by this activated zzso zzso These results link zzso with the in zzso function of zzso which ultimately connects two key zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso activity and plaque formation, and raises the possibility of a role for zzso family members in Alzheimer's zzso
