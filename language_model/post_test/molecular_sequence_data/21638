Two strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso purple zzso bacteria designated zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso sample collected from a brown zzso zzso zzso was designated as the type strain, while strain zzso as an additional strain has similar characteristics to the type zzso zzso zzso was zzso and grew zzso with a number of organic compounds serving as carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso zzso a and zzso of the zzso series were present as the major zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso extract for zzso zzso zzso has an zzso requirement for zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were the zzso components of cellular fatty zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clustered with species of the zzso zzso of the family zzso and is most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that strain zzso should be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso of the family zzso with the species name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of the species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
