Members of the zzso family of putative cargo receptors are proposed to contain retrograde and zzso trafficking signals in their zzso domain to facilitate coat protein binding and cycling in the zzso zzso We have analyzed the role of the zzso domain zzso of a zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells and analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and transit of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso complex involved a zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso of the zzso to the zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exit required the zzso zzso and was further facilitated by a pair of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins may mediate the interaction with integral membrane proteins of the zzso budding machinery to ensure zzso packaging into transport zzso
