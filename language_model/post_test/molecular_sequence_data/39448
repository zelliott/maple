zzso technologies provide a promising means by which desirable traits can be introduced into cultured fish species within a single generation thus accelerating the production of genetically superior zzso for zzso However, before such fish are allowed to be marketed as food they must receive government regulatory zzso Two pivotal regulatory requirements are: zzso complete characterization of the zzso integrated zzso and, zzso demonstration that the zzso remains stable over multiple zzso We have generated a stable line of growth hormone zzso transgenic Atlantic salmon zzso zzso using an zzso zzso gene construct zzso containing a growth hormone zzso from zzso salmon whose expression is regulated by the zzso promoter and 3' termination regions derived from an ocean pout zzso protein zzso zzso In this study we show that a reorganized form of the zzso construct zzso zzso integrated as a single functional copy into a 35 zzso repeat region of the zzso zzso zzso based mapping revealed that the linear sequence of the zzso zzso was organized as zzso base pairs zzso of the ocean pout promoter region followed by the intact zzso salmon zzso zzso the complete ocean pout zzso 3' region, and the first 1678 zzso of the ocean pout zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions in zzso and zzso generation salmon revealed that they were zzso In addition, apart from the disruption at the integration sites, the consensus sequences of the zzso in these two generations of salmon were identical to the sequence of the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso codes for the zzso salmon zzso and that the zzso and the integration site have remained stable over multiple zzso
