In this study a second zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso that is capable of zzso within zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso site in a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that a complete copy of the previously unidentified IS element, designated zzso had inserted into zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length with zzso imperfect terminal zzso repeats, and zzso resulted in a duplicated zzso target zzso zzso of Southern zzso of zzso DNA isolated from several zzso zzso strains with a zzso probe demonstrated that the number of copies of zzso per zzso varies among different zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis of the putative zzso zzso by zzso revealed strong zzso to the products zzso by zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso
