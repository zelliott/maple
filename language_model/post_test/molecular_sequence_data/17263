A pig zzso model in which zzso is zzso induced in the zzso zzso (a tongue of the zzso zzso zzso that extends into the pig zzso by zzso duct zzso zzso was used in this study to determine whether zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor in the zzso of this zzso The infection with zzso and its relationship to zzso and zzso integrity was zzso 

We microscopically investigated the occurrence of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso in 33 pigs from a local zzso and 5 pigs nurtured in pens in our surgical laboratory zzso Further groups of 5 and 6 zzso pigs underwent a sham operation and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso and zzso zzso was characterized by gel zzso 

Ten of 33 and 2 of 5 of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were positive for zzso by zzso zzso Three of the 33 zzso pigs showed zzso in the zzso zzso and none of these was zzso All six of the zzso zzso pigs showed zzso in the zzso but only 2 of these were zzso Only 8 of 33 of the zzso pigs had zzso or zzso large zzso zzso that was zzso in the zzso volume of a zzso zzso zzso 

There was no consistent correlation between an infection of the pig zzso by zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant difference between the percentage of zzso zzso from the zzso pigs and that of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso the zzso group vs zzso pigs zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso pigs zzso zzso zzso but there appeared to be no association between the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
