The zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that regulates cellular responses to environmental zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is believed to reside in an inactive zzso complex that zzso to the nucleus and zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes after zzso by zzso 

We conducted an zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene targets in mouse zzso cells and determined whether zzso regulatory functions may take place in the absence of an zzso zzso 

The network of zzso targets in the mouse zzso was mapped through a multipronged approach involving zzso zzso and global gene expression zzso The findings were integrated into a prior functional knowledge base from Gene zzso interaction networks, zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso sequence motif analysis, and literature molecular zzso 

We found the zzso zzso in zzso cells bound to an extensive array of gene clusters with functions in regulation of gene zzso zzso and pattern zzso connecting multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso displaced the zzso from some of these targets toward sites in the promoters of zzso metabolism zzso 

The zzso zzso appears to possess zzso regulatory functions that may be potential targets of environmental zzso
