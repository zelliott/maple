A few zzso discovered mainly in tropical zzso have a distinct sweet zzso These proteins have played an important role towards a molecular understanding of the mechanisms of zzso zzso to the huge difference in size, between most zzso and sweet zzso it was believed that they must interact with a different zzso from that of small molecular weight zzso Recent zzso studies have shown that the single sweet taste zzso has multiple active sites and that the mechanism of interaction of sweet proteins is zzso different from that of small zzso Small molecular weight zzso occupy small zzso cavities inside two zzso of the zzso whereas sweet proteins can interact with the sweet zzso according to a mechanism called the zzso zzso in which they bind to a large external zzso This review describes these mechanisms and outlines a history of sweet zzso
