zzso gel zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso were successfully used for determination of a zzso site of zzso induced by heat stress to zzso cells of a human T zzso cell zzso The cells were incubated for 30 zzso at 41 degrees C up to 45 degrees C in a serum free zzso acid zzso zzso culture zzso The zzso soluble proteins were separated by zzso and some of the proteins increased their abundance by heat zzso Those proteins were identified to be zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso capping protein zzso by zzso mass zzso zzso with zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso On the contrary, protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controlled tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation initiation factors zzso and 3A zzso 2, zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso were decreased their zzso A protein spot of zzso 18,000 and zzso zzso was markedly increased at temperatures higher than 43 degrees C at which the cells were led to zzso The spot was identified to be zzso of a signal relay protein which has a function of zzso zzso zzso zzso trap zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso specific for a zzso site of zzso showed that the spot was a zzso zzso at zzso 37 zzso zzso The zzso was suppressed by treatment of cells with zzso of an inhibitor specific for zzso dependent zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that heat stress activates zzso which zzso zzso 37 on the zzso zzso The zzso may cause the functional loss of zzso for dynamic zzso assembly and leads zzso cells to cell cycle arrest and zzso
