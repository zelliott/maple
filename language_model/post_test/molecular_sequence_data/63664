During the zzso replication cycle, viral transcription, DNA zzso formation of zzso and DNA packaging occur in the zzso The subsequent nuclear zzso of newly zzso zzso is performed by budding of the inner leaflet of the nuclear zzso which creates the primary zzso Although products of two genes zzso throughout the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso have previously been shown to be involved in the execution of this process, the molecular basis of their activity is not zzso Here we present results of protein structure prediction for the zzso domain of zzso The applied methodology suggests that this protein adopts a zzso zzso zzso fold to perform its zzso A detailed inspection of the zzso binding site strongly supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso can recognize zzso Since previous works suggest that zzso of zzso gene product result in a drastic impairment of primary zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in the nucleus, the presented data may lead to the development of novel zzso therapeutic strategies where zzso of zzso are zzso
