BD is prevalent in the area of the zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso are involved in the T cell zzso in patients with BD in the zzso where this disease has developed zzso We have thus examined whether the T cell response to the zzso peptides may be induced in patients with BD in Japan, an east pole of the zzso zzso As with patients in the zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso also yielded vigorous proliferation of T cells in Japanese patients with zzso but neither in normal subjects nor in patients with zzso arthritis zzso there was significant association between proliferation by this zzso and the presence of zzso zzso but not any other symptoms of zzso To clarify whether the zzso stimulates T cells as a zzso zzso a specific zzso or a zzso substance, we zzso T cell zzso zzso usage of responding T cells by means of zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that T cells with certain zzso zzso zzso (including zzso 8, zzso 18, zzso were increased in circulation and responded to the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso products of freshly isolated T cells of patients with BD formed several bands in the zzso zzso some of them became prominent after stimulation with the zzso This suggests that T cells in patients with this disease have already been expanded zzso in zzso which may be a result of stimulation by triggering zzso including the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso stimulation induced zzso zzso zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso cells, including zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso in eight out of eight patients zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso not only in the area of the zzso zzso but also outside the zzso Route zzso
