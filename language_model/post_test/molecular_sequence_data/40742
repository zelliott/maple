The zzso gene sequences were determined for 121 strains of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mean zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso between species in each zzso except for the zzso zzso that comprises one species, was significantly less than that of the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Only zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso of the zzso zzso was higher than that of the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Each zzso formed a distinct zzso in the zzso analysis of the zzso gene sequence as well as the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso analysis indicated a higher evolutionary rate for the zzso gene sequence than the zzso zzso gene zzso especially in the zzso zzso and zzso This study suggests that the zzso gene is a useful alternative zzso marker for the identification and zzso of a broad range of zzso zzso zzso
