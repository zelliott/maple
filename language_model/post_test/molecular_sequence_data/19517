Using a chemical zzso approach, we efficiently enriched for the generally low abundant zzso signaling zzso and their zzso directly from mouse zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins was diminished using a tailored sequential zzso zzso Through further zzso of this affinity zzso and zzso zzso we were able to detect all known protein zzso A regulatory zzso zzso Furthermore, 11 different zzso zzso proteins zzso were zzso A proposed fusion protein of zzso 2 and zzso could be decisively established as a novel zzso at the protein level in zzso zzso When comparing this zzso of zzso zzso proteins with earlier data obtained with immobilized zzso from rat zzso zzso we observe a large overlap in the retained proteins but also some clear zzso Furthermore, zzso of an in-depth analysis of in zzso zzso sites on zzso revealed the presence of several zzso zzso zzso zzso This illustrates yet another layer of functional regulation in zzso zzso zzso In general, our improved chemical zzso screen offers a zzso but detailed, view on nature's complex diversity in zzso zzso signaling zzso Possibly different zzso may direct zzso zzso zzso zzso to different cellular zzso providing a multifaceted platform for just this zzso
