For the majority of microbial zzso zzso zzso there is no clearly superior species concept that is consistently zzso In the absence of a practical biological species concept, most species and zzso level zzso have historically been based on zzso which may lead to an underestimate of the diversity of microbial zzso Indeed, a growing body of molecular evidence, such as zzso surveys, is beginning to support the conclusion that significant cryptic species diversity zzso This underestimate of diversity appears to be due to a combination of using zzso as the sole basis for assessing diversity and our inability to culture the vast majority of microbial zzso Here we have used molecular markers to assess the species zzso in two related but zzso distinct zzso of zzso zzso found in the zzso of zzso 

Using zzso isolation and environmental zzso we have used a zzso approach to characterize the diversity of zzso and zzso zzso in four species of zzso termites, which were also examined using scanning electron zzso and light zzso Despite the fact that these zzso are significantly different in zzso complexity and structural zzso we find they are two life history stages of the same zzso At the same time, we show that the zzso from different zzso hosts show an equal or greater level of sequence diversity than do the zzso despite the fact that the zzso are all classified as one zzso 

The zzso information used to describe the diversity of these microbial zzso is misleading at both the zzso and species levels, and led to an underestimate of species level diversity as well as an overestimate of zzso level zzso The zzso zzso is invalid and appears to be a life history stage of zzso while the single recognized species of zzso zzso inhabiting these four termites is better described as four distinct zzso
