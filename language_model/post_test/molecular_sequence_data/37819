We have recently identified the zzso zzso zzso protein as a bona fide zzso for the nuclear export zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso with high affinity via a zzso nuclear export signal located in the extreme N zzso zzso is a member of the DEAD box family of zzso zzso which unwind zzso zzso zzso unwinding is coupled to zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso and the zzso activity of several zzso is greatly zzso by various zzso Here we report that zzso zzso by zzso is zzso approximately zzso by total zzso from zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso fails to enhance zzso suggesting the existence of a specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso analysis reveals that a zzso within the zzso DEAD box motif reduces the rate of zzso zzso by approximately zzso In accordance with this, the DEAD box zzso is unable to unwind zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DEAD box zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a significantly lower export rate as compared with zzso zzso zzso This is not because the zzso has lower affinity toward zzso nor is it due to altered zzso binding zzso This suggests that nuclear export of zzso protein by zzso is coupled to zzso zzso zzso
