The zzso zzso are ubiquitous zzso which catalyze a crucial step of the cell life, the specific attachment of zzso acids to their zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of three zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso both belonging to the group of zzso and from zzso zzso of the group of zzso were aligned with other zzso and zzso available zzso zzso In an attempt to identify some features of adaptation to extreme environments of these organisms, zzso acid composition and zzso acid zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In addition, universal zzso trees of zzso including the three known zzso zzso rooted by the zzso zzso were zzso zzso acid analyses of the zzso revealed two ways of adaptation to zzso environments between the zzso and the zzso most of the usually described zzso acid zzso were zzso in the case of zzso zzso zzso and most zzso acid composition biases seemed to be linked to the zzso zzso content zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso showed the zzso to be zzso zzso zzso emerging with the zzso zzso zzso zzso being near the root of the tree, and zzso zzso branching with zzso
