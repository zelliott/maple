Two zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, strains zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso of zzso zzso collected off the coast of Florida, USA, and zzso was isolated from a zzso of zzso zzso collected off the coast of zzso zzso Analysis of the nearly full-length zzso zzso gene sequences showed that these novel strains were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were far below the zzso zzso with all values for duplicate zzso being less than zzso Both zzso and zzso required zzso for growth and showed optimal growth at zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso summed feature 8 zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso was zzso zzso and that of zzso was zzso zzso In addition to the zzso differences observed between the two novel strains and related type zzso zzso and zzso experiments also revealed differences between zzso Thus, strains zzso and zzso represent novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, are zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also provided to zzso differences observed in the results of zzso zzso and zzso tests compared from the original and amended zzso zzso
