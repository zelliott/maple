The zzso organization of the gene zzso rat zzso zzso zzso a class II zzso zzso zzso was zzso A single active gene and several zzso were isolated from a rat zzso DNA library and zzso The active zzso gene zzso the rat zzso spans approximately 60 zzso and is divided into 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso are clustered in the zzso of the zzso whereas zzso 3, 4, and 5, zzso the zzso domain are separated by large zzso (up to 15 zzso containing LINE zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso has a zzso sequence zzso identical to that of the complete zzso sequence of rat zzso but several stop zzso interrupt the coding zzso thus identifying zzso zzso to an inactive processed zzso Two repetitive elements from the LINE family are inserted into zzso zzso zzso of zzso substitution rates suggests that zzso zzso sequences arose approximately 27 zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso should be more zzso Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zzso gene family is composed of only one active zzso The availability of the gene structure of zzso could help to clarify molecular evolution of class II zzso
