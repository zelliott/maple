We have examined the expression of zzso A, zzso and C in human zzso and cancer cell lines and the function of the zzso zzso and B1 gene promoters in zzso zzso Northern analysis and zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and protein were not zzso in some human cell lines whereas zzso B1 was always zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso B1 genes zzso to the translation initiation sites showed that they did not contain typical zzso boxes near the zzso start zzso The zzso B1 and zzso zzso promoter regions were transcribed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines even if the cells did not contain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso These results show that, similar to most zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso regulatory elements in the promoters of the human nuclear zzso zzso and B1 genes do not control their cell zzso expression in culture zzso
