The zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at position 118 is required for full activity of the zzso zzso function 1 zzso This zzso is zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso and in cells treated with zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso both of which activate zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso but not that of a zzso zzso with an zzso in place of zzso Thus, the activity of the zzso zzso of the zzso is modulated by the zzso of zzso through the zzso cascade of the growth factor signaling zzso
