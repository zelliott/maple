zzso bacterial infection is accompanied by fever, zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple organ failure leading to death in zzso of zzso These classical symptoms of septic shock are caused by potent zzso that are produced in response to zzso released from zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso to block zzso or zzso zzso have given mixed results in clinical zzso High density zzso zzso is a natural component of plasma that is known to neutralize zzso in zzso We report here that raising the plasma HDL concentration protects mice against zzso in zzso zzso mice with zzso plasma HDL levels had more zzso bound to zzso lower plasma zzso levels, and improved survival rates compared with zzso zzso zzso infusion of HDL also protected mice, but only when given as zzso HDL prepared from zzso and either HDL zzso or an zzso acid zzso zzso to mimic the structure of zzso zzso of zzso zzso plasma HDL was mildly toxic, and HDL zzso was zzso The effectiveness of the zzso zzso renders very unlikely any significant contribution to protection by trace proteins in zzso These data suggest a simple leaflet zzso model for binding and zzso of zzso by zzso on the surface of zzso Plasma HDL may normally act to protect against zzso this protection may be zzso by administration of zzso HDL or zzso zzso
