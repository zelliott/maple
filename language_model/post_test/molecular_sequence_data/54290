zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso Here, we have cloned two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso structures showed that the two zzso named zzso and zzso were generated from a single gene by alternative usage of zzso The zzso and zzso were predicted to zzso almost the same zzso acid zzso except that the latter had additional ten zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli cell zzso were roughly similar to each other in zzso zzso which did not show large difference from those of zzso zzso by using tissue zzso zzso zzso experiments and tissue distribution analyses of zzso activity indicated that the zzso gene is expressed in the male zzso zzso especially in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from which it is zzso to the seminal fluid and transferred to the female during zzso whereas the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso and adult zzso zzso including the fat body and muscle, where the produced zzso proteins are considered to stay in the zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso zzso may have a difference in whether or not the product is zzso out of the cells in which it is zzso
