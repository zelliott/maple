A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was amplified by zzso and zzso from individual adult zzso of the zzso zzso which were sampled from central and southern zzso and identified using an explicit set of zzso zzso zzso analyses placed the zzso zzso in three zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter species was the most abundant and zzso and it was characterized by two zzso zzso each of which predominated only north or south of the zzso el zzso a seasonally flooded saline depression that divides zzso zzso The divergence of the two zzso lineages was dated by zzso molecular zzso indicating that the formation of the zzso el zzso is unlikely to have been the barrier generating the zzso evolution of the two lineages of zzso zzso although it may have zzso their mixing following secondary zzso Both regional zzso lineages were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that these two zzso forms are neither zzso nor geographically isolated and, therefore, should not be treated as species or zzso It is recommended that no subspecies of zzso zzso should be recognized in North Africa and zzso should cease the zzso error of referring to a species zzso zzso zzso The zzso form zzso has no proven association with an increased risk of zzso compared with zzso However, it might be prudent to produce zzso in zzso by using both zzso forms of zzso zzso collected each side of the zzso el zzso because of the evidence for regional variation in zzso The highest risk for scorpion stings occurs in the central region, where the new diagnostic markers should be used to discover any association between zzso species and zzso
