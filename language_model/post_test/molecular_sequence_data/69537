The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso are zzso zzso with 281 base pairs separating their termination zzso zzso mapping revealed at least 111 base pairs within the zzso zzso region are transcribed in both zzso zzso experiments showed distinct sequences of 70 zzso for zzso and 179 zzso for zzso were sufficient for normal zzso 3' end zzso The zzso signal functioned in either orientation, although relatively zzso in the non-native zzso This element contains a zzso sequence essential for 3' end formation in both zzso zzso or zzso 3' end formation was not affected by overproduction or elimination of the zzso natural zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of a strong promoter that extended zzso transcripts beyond their normal 3' ends zzso either zzso or zzso These data suggest that transcript termination in the compact zzso zzso can be important to prevent zzso of downstream genes as a result of zzso zzso
