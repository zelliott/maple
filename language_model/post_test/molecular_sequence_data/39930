zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized from the crude extract of zzso coli, in which the gene for zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso The results of zzso gel zzso and gel zzso on zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso was a zzso zzso consisted of identical zzso zzso The optimum pH and temperature of the zzso activity were pH zzso and zzso degrees C, zzso The zzso did not require zzso zzso for the expression of the activity, and zzso and zzso zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso An zzso experiment by zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso site of this zzso The zzso was strictly specific for the zzso of zzso and exhibited high activity for the zzso of zzso with the values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso could not cleave the ring structure of derivatives of zzso zzso and zzso tested, except for zzso and zzso These results show that the zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso the zzso bond in a ring structure of zzso to produce zzso
