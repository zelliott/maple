The E6 zzso of human zzso type 16 zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso zzso and is zzso to form two zzso zzso structures in the zzso and zzso halves, which mediate degradation of zzso and binding to zzso zzso We constructed a series of E6 zzso with zzso zzso in these finger regions zzso zzso and zzso and examined their transforming function for human embryonic kidney zzso cells in conjunction with zzso 16 zzso and their interaction with human zzso in zzso The zzso with substitution of L for zzso G for zzso S for zzso and P for zzso which did not transform zzso cells, showed markedly lowered activity to direct degradation of zzso The zzso with zzso of G for zzso G for zzso G for zzso L for zzso and G for zzso lost the transforming function, but they could mediate degradation of zzso at levels comparable to the activities of the zzso and transforming zzso Like the wild type, all of the E6 zzso were localized by zzso to the zzso of human zzso cells or monkey zzso cells, except for the E6 zzso with substitution of G for zzso whose expression was zzso The levels of E6 zzso metabolically labeled in zzso cells were comparable to those of the transforming zzso The data indicate that zzso degradation of zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso transformation of of zzso zzso
