zzso zzso signaling protein zzso is an essential component of zzso signaling pathways that induce protective zzso zzso Its zzso to the outer zzso membrane suggests an important yet unexplained role for zzso in innate zzso Here, we show that zzso A virus zzso a zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso responses by targeting the zzso precursor of its zzso zzso zzso to zzso where it zzso with and zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso requires both the zzso activity of zzso and a zzso domain in 3A that directs zzso to zzso zzso this domain, mature zzso zzso is incapable of zzso zzso zzso thus zzso host signaling by a mechanism that parallels that of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso C virus, but differs in its use of a stable, zzso active zzso processing zzso The unique requirement for zzso zzso of zzso underscores the importance of zzso to host control of virus infections within the zzso
