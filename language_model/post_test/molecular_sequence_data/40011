We have zzso the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso at rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso We observed no difference in the zzso levels of zzso produced by zzso when it was either zzso or zzso with zzso The zzso values for zzso acting at zzso zzso receptors were, as expected, dependent on the zzso concentration used to evoke responses, being 31 zzso 2 zzso (with zzso at its zzso zzso and 214 zzso 10 zzso (at 10 times the zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the antagonism produced by zzso at zzso zzso receptors was competitive and gave an estimate of its equilibrium constant zzso of 15 zzso 2 zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of an zzso zzso carrying a zzso point zzso in the zzso zzso binding site indicated that zzso still acted in a competitive manner but with its zzso increased by around zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed reduced zzso An zzso value of 215 zzso 13 zzso was obtained in the presence of the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso whereas a value of zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained with higher (15 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis gave a zzso for zzso at zzso receptors of 78 zzso 3 zzso Finally, using a kinetic scheme to model zzso zzso of zzso zzso we show that the difference in the equilibrium zzso for zzso is not sufficient to discriminate between zzso or zzso zzso zzso
