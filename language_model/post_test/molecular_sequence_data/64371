To zzso the genetic system that establishes zzso zzso pairing in zzso plants, we have isolated an zzso zzso of rice, designated zzso zzso pairing aberration in rice zzso zzso in which 24 completely zzso zzso are observed at zzso and zzso The zzso was caused by an zzso of the zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso of the zzso by transformation with the corresponding zzso zzso The gene in which the element was inserted is zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso and the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso were found to be highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and lower expression was also detected in zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso incorporation experiments revealed that zzso expression is specifically enhanced in male and female zzso but not in those at zzso S phase or in the zzso maturation zzso The results obtained in this study suggest that the zzso gene is essential for zzso zzso pairing in zzso as in the case of the genes zzso and zzso The study also suggested the possibility that a highly zzso copy of the zzso gene located on a different zzso is in fact a zzso
