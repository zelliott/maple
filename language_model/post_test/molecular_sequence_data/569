zzso regulate the expression and function of zzso zzso zzso zzso and it has been proposed that an zzso site is present in zzso alpha in its C1 domain, which consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso mouse showed a significant decrease in alcohol consumption compared with the zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an zzso site could be present in zzso zzso Here we show that ethanol inhibited zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner with an zzso zzso zzso concentration at zzso zzso of 43 zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the binding affinity of a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner with zzso values of 78 zzso 8 zzso and 340 zzso respectively, suggesting the presence of an zzso zzso site in this zzso To identify this site, zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the preferred site for zzso zzso of the model structure of zzso zzso zzso reveals that these zzso are zzso A (1 zzso zzso apart from each other and form a groove where zzso is zzso and zzso is buried zzso When these zzso were replaced by zzso it significantly decreased alcohol binding in terms of both zzso and zzso zzso binding in the zzso zzso Whereas zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso The present results provide direct evidence for the presence of an zzso zzso site on protein zzso C zzso and underscore the role of zzso and zzso zzso in alcohol zzso
