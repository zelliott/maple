Iris yellow spot virus zzso a tentative virus species in the zzso zzso and family zzso is considered a rapidly emerging threat to onion production in the western United States zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the sequence diversity of zzso zzso from infected onion plants grown in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and zzso Using zzso derived from the small zzso of zzso the complete sequence of the zzso zzso gene of each isolate was determined and the sequences zzso In addition, a zzso isolate of zzso from Washington was included in the zzso The US zzso of zzso shared a high degree of sequence identity (95 to zzso with one another and to previously reported zzso zzso analyses showed that with the exception of one isolate from central Oregon and one isolate from California, all the onion and zzso zzso from the western US clustered zzso This cluster also included onion and zzso zzso from zzso A second distinct cluster consisted of zzso from Australia zzso Brazil zzso Israel zzso Japan zzso The Netherlands zzso and Slovenia zzso The zzso zzso evaluated in this study appear to represent two distinct groups, one of which largely represents zzso from the western zzso zzso of the population structure of zzso would potentially provide insights into the molecular epidemiology of this zzso
