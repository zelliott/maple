Although the full sequence of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso has been known for more than a decade, effective genetic zzso have yet to be zzso Here we show that, of 22 regions zzso one highly zzso sequence zzso near the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso region, zzso viral zzso zzso 4 to 8 and a zzso zzso motif of zzso protein in two different reading zzso can be successfully targeted by an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso named zzso A disrupted translation of zzso zzso induced at the zzso site resulted in a decreased synthesis of zzso zzso hence the viral zzso a zzso expression of zzso devoid of a fully functional zzso zzso and the excessive zzso zzso of zzso precursor zzso hindering the processes of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso abolished zzso production by up to zzso in chronically zzso zzso cells and in peripheral blood zzso cells infected with clinical zzso zzso with the zzso zzso This particular segment of the zzso zzso gene appears to offer a distinctive advantage over other regions in invading viral structural genes and restraining zzso replication in infected cells and may potentially be exploited as a novel zzso genetic zzso
