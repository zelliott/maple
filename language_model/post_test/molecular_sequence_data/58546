We analyzed the zzso gene in 17 unrelated families with putative zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso was amplified in one step, and after a second amplification, four overlapping segments were directly zzso We zzso in five families that did not meet the complete Amsterdam criteria, five zzso including a zzso change resulting in a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso affecting the zzso 4 zzso zzso site, a zzso deletion at zzso zzso a zzso deletion at zzso zzso and a deletion of zzso zzso The latter zzso was shown to result from a zzso zzso deletion due to a zzso zzso between zzso repeats located in zzso 12 and zzso The detection of five zzso zzso zzso in five families that only partially fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria shows that these criteria do not allow the identification of all familial zzso zzso due to zzso of the mismatch repair zzso The numerous zzso repeats present within the zzso gene and the observation of large zzso deletions suggest that zzso zzso deletions might frequently be involved in zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso analysis, which allows the amplification of the entire coding region of the zzso gene in one step, might be the most appropriate method for the detection of zzso zzso
