As zzso and zzso measures, zzso zzso contain information about both protein structure and zzso This work represents a zzso study to extract such information for membrane proteins from zzso zzso zzso solid-state zzso chemical shift zzso and zzso zzso and solution zzso residual zzso zzso We have performed zzso molecular dynamics simulations to refine the structure of the zzso form of zzso coat protein in explicit zzso zzso using the recently measured chemical shift zzso zzso zzso and residual zzso zzso zzso From the simulations, we have characterized detailed zzso interactions and explored the zzso All simulations are stable and the zzso restraints are well zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso finds its optimal position in the membrane quickly zzso 6 zzso illustrating efficient zzso of TM zzso in explicit zzso zzso Such rapid convergence also leads to zzso interaction patterns between the TM zzso and the zzso which clearly show the interactions of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso For the zzso zzso zzso of zzso we identify a stable, albeit zzso zzso orientation parallel to the membrane surface that zzso the zzso nature of the zzso in an explicit zzso zzso Such detailed information cannot be obtained solely from zzso zzso zzso the present simulations illustrate the usefulness of zzso MD refinement of membrane protein structure in explicit zzso
