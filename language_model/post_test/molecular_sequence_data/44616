The zzso tuberculosis zzso 10 protein and fragments corresponding to sequences zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by the zzso methodology using a double zzso protocol and without the aid of capping zzso After the final acid zzso using the low zzso zzso protocol the zzso were zzso by either the zzso exchange zzso combination or the zzso separation carried out in solution and followed by zzso zzso zzso of the results obtained through the two approaches indicated that in general the zzso combination was superior both in terms of recovery of final material and its zzso The advantages found were as zzso zzso Unlike zzso exchange zzso no tailoring of the separation conditions is required, zzso Several consecutive zzso can be carried out in progressively zzso pH zzso This increases the separation resolution without the need of changing other separation zzso zzso Very little manipulation is needed, and each focusing requires zzso zzso Full zzso with zzso zzso such as 8 M zzso This increases zzso so that using the zzso instrument described here zzso zzso crude zzso can be processed zzso Thus the zzso focusing technique carried out in solution is a valid and inexpensive alternative to zzso exchange zzso
