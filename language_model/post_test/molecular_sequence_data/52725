The zzso domain, a highly zzso zzso portion at the zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso is responsible for driving and regulating the zzso of the zzso Here we report the identification of a set of zzso in the zzso domain that alter the gating properties of the zzso zzso Two zzso produce a zzso shift in the zzso curve and slow the channel closing rate while a third zzso produces a rightward shift in the zzso curve and speeds the channel closing zzso We have determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso containing these zzso Both of the zzso shifting zzso produce similar zzso changes in the putative membrane facing surface of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the structure of the zzso domain in this region is tightly coupled to the channel's gating zzso
