We have used a zzso approach to identify sites of zzso in the structural proteins of the zzso type 2 zzso This protein modification might play an important role during zzso zzso from highly zzso virus were enriched for zzso and analyzed by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso were identified in 11 structural peptides and 29 zzso zzso sites were zzso assigned to specific zzso zzso An unexpected result was the finding of zzso in two of the viral zzso The most highly zzso protein was zzso with 12 identified zzso zzso An identified preference for zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso sites downstream suggests that cellular zzso are involved in many of the zzso zzso modeling showed that one site in the zzso is located on the outer side of the virus and could be of importance for the virus when attaching and entering zzso
