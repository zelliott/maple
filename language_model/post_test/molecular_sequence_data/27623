Human tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at high levels zzso than zzso of the soluble zzso by placing the zzso zzso under the control of regulatory sequences derived from the alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures at cell zzso of 50 and 85 g dry cell zzso contained approximately 6 X zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso productivity of zzso g zzso zzso was obtained in the continuous mode on zzso and zzso feed at 25 g dry cell zzso cell zzso zzso contained in the zzso cell zzso was zzso displayed full zzso activity, and was recognized by zzso prepared against zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to greater than zzso purity with greater than zzso recovery by using three sequential zzso steps with a coordinated zzso buffer scheme which allowed one zzso to also serve as the loading buffer for the succeeding zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso point, and minimal molecular weight determined for zzso zzso those properties predicted from the zzso zzso zzso data indicated that zzso in the native form is a compact zzso held by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resemble those of proteins with high beta zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity on mouse zzso cells at about the same zzso as the zzso activity toward mouse zzso zzso In the criteria zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso closely resembles zzso derived from zzso zzso coli and human zzso zzso
