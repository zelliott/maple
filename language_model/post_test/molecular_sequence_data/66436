Three classes of signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso play crucial roles in axis formation in the chick zzso Although zzso and zzso signals have a pivotal function in inducing the primitive streak and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso their action is zzso by that of zzso zzso that protect the prospective zzso tissue from the zzso influence of zzso zzso from the zzso We have previously reported that a zzso factor, chick zzso zzso is expressed in the primitive streak and zzso zzso where it works as a zzso zzso Here, we describe a new crucial function for zzso in promoting formation of the primitive streak and zzso zzso by positively regulating zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso directly binds zzso in zzso and that zzso and zzso functionally interact in axis formation, as shown by biological zzso performed in chick and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that alternative zzso of zzso zzso leads to the formation of two zzso zzso originally designated as zzso and zzso that differ in their zzso zzso zzso and biological zzso indicate that zzso is a much weaker zzso zzso than zzso although both zzso efficiently interact with zzso zzso although both zzso and zzso are expressed throughout the early extending primitive streak, their expression patterns diverge during zzso zzso expression concentrates in zzso zzso a well-known source of zzso signals, whereas zzso accumulates in the middle primitive streak zzso a region known to work as a zzso center where zzso expression is also specifically zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso but not zzso function is required in the zzso for induction of zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso play a crucial role in chick axis formation by locally modulating zzso and zzso activities during zzso
