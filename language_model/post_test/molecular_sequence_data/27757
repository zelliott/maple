A zzso gene coding for zzso was assembled from chemically zzso zzso and cloned into a variety of zzso coli expression zzso We observed loss of zzso when the zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli either as the native precursor or fused at the C zzso of the first zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso signal zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The level of maintenance for the different zzso zzso correlated with the level of expression detected by zzso zzso expression of the beta zzso fusion generated zzso zzso in a zzso zzso coli zzso The fusion protein was easily zzso to near zzso by differential zzso of the zzso
