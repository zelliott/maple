An zzso zzso zzso produced by an isolated strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited moderate to high zzso in the kinetic resolution of several zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and halo zzso The zzso named as zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso purity with a specific activity of zzso zzso protein and zzso overall zzso The zzso zzso is approximately 52 zzso zzso zzso activity at 37 degrees C and pH zzso and fairly stable up to 55 degrees zzso The zzso does not exhibit the phenomenon of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso beyond the zzso zzso The zzso showed preference for zzso and zzso of zzso with short chain fatty zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases the activity of zzso by approximately zzso but its presence does not have any influence on the zzso of the zzso The zzso is not a zzso and belongs to the family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso determined, as zzso revealed similarity with the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso of zzso zzso
