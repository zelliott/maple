The composition of zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in the North East Pacific and the Arctic Ocean with special emphasis on the zzso Sea during the zzso cruise in summer zzso zzso populations were sorted using flow zzso based on their size and zzso zzso Diversity of the sorted zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso length zzso analysis and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dominated by zzso a class of small green algae previously included in the zzso in the North East Pacific, the contribution of an Arctic zzso zzso increased steadily zzso becoming the only zzso occurring at most stations throughout the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was more zzso North Pacific stations were dominated by zzso zzso whereas those in the zzso Sea were dominated by two distinct zzso species as well as by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study confirms the importance of Arctic zzso within zzso throughout the zzso Sea and demonstrates that the zzso zzso community in the Arctic is much less diverse than at lower zzso Moreover, in contrast to what occurs in warmer waters, most of the key zzso and zzso species found in the zzso Sea could be successfully established in zzso
