zzso a member of the zzso cassette zzso has been identified as a protective pump against zzso and zzso toxic zzso zzso was shown to be expressed at high levels in stem cells and zzso regulated during cell zzso Here we demonstrate that functional zzso is expressed in human zzso zzso cells by the zzso of a nuclear hormone zzso zzso We identified and characterized a zzso pair long zzso zzso region, containing three functional zzso response elements zzso upstream of the human zzso zzso We confirmed the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to this zzso region, suggesting that zzso directly regulates the zzso of zzso zzso with these results, elevated expression of zzso zzso was coupled to enhanced protein production, resulting in increased zzso zzso capacity via zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso instructed zzso cells showed increased zzso dye zzso and resistance to zzso zzso these results uncovered a mechanism by which zzso of functional zzso expression can be achieved via zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor, zzso The increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso can significantly modify the zzso and drug resistance of human zzso zzso zzso
