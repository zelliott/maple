We have studied the human gamma delta zzso response to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which causes zzso and, particularly in human zzso zzso zzso individuals, zzso arthritis zzso A marked proliferation of that zzso gamma delta T cells is seen when zzso zzso cell lines or fixed intact zzso are added to cultures of zzso cells derived from the zzso fluid of zzso patients or from the peripheral blood of healthy zzso In contrast, zzso zzso fail to stimulate the gamma delta zzso zzso The gamma delta zzso lines generated killed both zzso and zzso infected cell zzso Interestingly, a zzso line generated from zzso fluid zzso cells zzso killed infected zzso cell lines and a cell line matched for zzso less well than infected zzso target zzso gamma delta zzso clones isolated from this line were found to express V gamma zzso delta 2 zzso zzso zzso and also killed infected mismatched cells more efficiently than zzso zzso Moreover, from experiments using major zzso complex zzso cell lines, it was apparent that target cell recognition was zzso zzso Our results suggest that gamma delta T cells can be involved in immunity to zzso zzso and should be taken into account when considering zzso mechanisms leading to zzso zzso
