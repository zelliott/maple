We have previously shown that zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso zzso possess zzso zzso The zzso zzso activities in these cells are different from those described in skin zzso and very little is known about their regulation by zzso zzso zzso In order to study this regulation, we zzso the effects of zzso on the levels of expression of the zzso gene and on zzso activity, using primary cultures of zzso zzso of the cells with zzso increases zzso gene transcription, within the first 24 h of zzso To gain insight into the zzso mechanism involved in the cell response to the hormone, zzso in culture were incubated with zzso or zzso These agents mimic the effects of zzso on zzso by increasing the zzso level of zzso The experimental results showed that while the hormonal treatment always activated the zzso zzso system, treatment with zzso or zzso never zzso zzso in zzso the zzso action of zzso was not zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels in cells zzso with zzso demonstrated that the hormone does not produce significant increases in zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso produced significant increases in zzso starting from 30 zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso induction by zzso in zzso is not zzso by the zzso pathway, and highlight the existence of substantial differences in the hormone signal zzso mechanisms between zzso zzso and zzso or melanoma zzso
