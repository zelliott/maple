The zzso zzso zzso exists in zzso form in zzso coli strains containing the optional zzso zzso The zzso is a result of a masking interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Type zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso elicits zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso base, yielding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso has been implicated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in recognition and zzso of zzso were searched for at the zzso Random zzso of the zzso portion zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed, followed by selection for loss of zzso zzso zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso This process yielded a cluster of zzso zzso mapping to a region highly zzso between zzso and two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso This cluster included two adjacent members that relaxed the inherent zzso zzso zzso We also describe another mode of relaxed zzso due to mere zzso of zzso This mode was shared by zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso The additional zzso zzso under the zzso conditions had, in general, zzso resembling that of zzso Taken together, the data suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso identity elements and implicates a zzso region in zzso in their zzso
