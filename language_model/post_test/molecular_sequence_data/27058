The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a model fungus used to investigate the secondary metabolism and zzso zzso zzso sequencing reveals the presence of at least 18 genes zzso putative zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the transcripts of zzso could be detected under the zzso and zzso conditions as well as amended with zzso The zzso zzso exhibits broad zzso activity toward several zzso zzso including zzso oxide, zzso and zzso but with different zzso Using zzso zzso oxide as the zzso the optimal pH and temperature are pH zzso and 40 degrees C, zzso The zzso is not sensitive to zzso and is inhibited by zzso and several metal zzso including zzso zzso and zzso at various zzso Several organic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethanol at zzso zzso cause slight or no zzso of the zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso displays distinct zzso preference to several zzso zzso The zzso showed good zzso toward zzso zzso oxide with preferential zzso of zzso zzso is likely a novel soluble zzso based on the sequence analysis and zzso properties, and is a great potential zzso for the preparation of zzso zzso oxide in zzso kinetic zzso
