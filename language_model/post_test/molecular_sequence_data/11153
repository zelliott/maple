zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso in zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This putative processing zzso of the zzso family of zzso exhibits a significant degree of similarity to zzso and two zzso processing zzso zzso and zzso We report the cloning of two human zzso zzso species zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas the zzso transcript zzso zzso is equivalent to the previously characterized rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso novel forms containing a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso This zzso which is inserted zzso of the zzso site, zzso is contained within the most zzso region among the zzso family zzso Analysis of the deduced primary sequences revealed zzso identity between rat and human zzso The human gene zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso is mostly expressed in zzso and in 24 cell lines, low zzso levels were detected in most of the 27 other zzso zzso
