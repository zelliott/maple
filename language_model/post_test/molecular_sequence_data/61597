Human zzso zzso unique short region 3 zzso zzso a type I membrane zzso prevents maturation of class I major zzso complex zzso molecules by retaining them in the zzso zzso zzso and thus helps inhibit zzso presentation to zzso T zzso zzso molecules bind to class I zzso molecules in a transient fashion but retain them very efficiently in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain is responsible for zzso retention of zzso itself, while both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are necessary for retaining class I zzso in the zzso We have expressed the zzso domain of zzso zzso in zzso coli and analyzed its secondary structure by using nuclear magnetic zzso We then predicted the zzso zzso structure by modeling it based on the zzso zzso Unlike the zzso domain of zzso the zzso zzso domain does not obviously interact with class I zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and full-length zzso molecules associate with each other in zzso We present a model depicting how dynamic zzso of zzso may enhance its ability to retain class I molecules within the zzso
