zzso zzso zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso known as zzso are zzso and potential drug zzso Available data suggest that zzso zzso require zzso for correct folding into functional zzso However, in prior studies of zzso an zzso zzso construct containing only a small portion of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso differs in this regard from other zzso zzso To better characterize the zzso of folding for zzso we expressed multiple zzso and mature zzso of the zzso in zzso coli and assessed their abilities to zzso zzso zzso zzso into active zzso with very similar properties to those of proteins resulting from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso acid zzso segment of the mature zzso yielded a construct incapable of correct zzso but inclusion of this segment in trans allowed folding to active zzso The zzso was a zzso competitive, and zzso inhibitor of mature zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results identify a zzso function of an zzso segment of mature zzso and suggest that zzso zzso but not the mediation of zzso is a principal function of the zzso zzso
