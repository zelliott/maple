zzso zzso with an average length between 16 zzso and 26 zzso are small zzso zzso that can repress gene expression on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most important nonhuman zzso animal models, is widely used in basic and applied zzso research, especially in studies that involve zzso and zzso However, due to the lack of a complete zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso have not been completely zzso In this study, 86 putative zzso zzso zzso were identified using a strategy of our zzso The expression of some of these zzso in the tissue was confirmed by zzso The function and zzso of their targeted genes were analyzed to reveal the potential relevance of zzso regulation on diseases and zzso zzso The current study provides insight into potential zzso and forms a useful knowledge base for the future understanding of the function of zzso in zzso zzso
