The organic zzso transporting zzso zzso of the zzso zzso membrane mediates zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso from zzso blood zzso To investigate the mechanisms controlling zzso zzso the zzso region of the human zzso gene was isolated from a zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter showed a number of consensus binding sites for both ubiquitous and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a series of zzso zzso zzso identified the minimal promoter region within 91 base pairs relative to the zzso initiation zzso A putative zzso element was localized in the zzso zzso The minimal promoter was also active in Chang liver, zzso canine zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso promoter function is independent of zzso regulatory zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso inhibited zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and testosterone had no significant zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed an increase in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of four patients with chronic zzso liver disease compared with three zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression by zzso could serve to enhance the zzso zzso of toxic zzso compounds during chronic zzso
