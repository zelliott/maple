zzso is one of the most intriguing early zzso genes that is known to be induced very early in response to interaction of zzso plants with symbiotic zzso bacteria, but its function in the zzso process is still not zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso is abundantly induced in very early stages of bacterial infection or zzso factor application, whereas zzso is abundantly expressed only in mature zzso We generated transgenic lines of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso construct that expresses hairpin zzso zzso for zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso In the transgenic plants, expression of both zzso and zzso was significantly reduced, and no zzso of zzso transcripts was detected upon zzso zzso zzso The transgenic plants exhibited very poor zzso zzso 0-2 zzso per zzso and could not grow well without additional nitrogen zzso Analysis of segregation in the zzso progeny indicated that the suppression of zzso is perfectly linked with the presence of the zzso zzso observation of the infection process using zzso zzso zzso together with expression analysis of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso did not inhibit the initiation of the bacterial infection zzso In contrast, zzso zzso initiation and subsequent zzso development were significantly suppressed in the transgenic zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso is required for zzso initiation and subsequent zzso but is not involved in early infection zzso
