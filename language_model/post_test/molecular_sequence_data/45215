zzso peptides zzso play an important role in the innate immunity of zzso In zzso 17 additional immune induced molecules zzso were found in the zzso of adult flies upon septic zzso Previous studies using zzso mass zzso combined with zzso degradation, detected zzso and zzso of a predominantly large zzso By means of zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso were identified in this study from the zzso of zzso third zzso larvae zzso after challenge with a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most peptides were derived from known zzso or zzso zzso but only four peptides were zzso and identified zzso The majority of the peptides that we detected were smaller in zzso Interestingly, two previously unknown zzso precursors were found and hereby related to immune zzso These include zzso and zzso Many of the identified peptides are zzso modified by an zzso zzso acid and/or a zzso zzso zzso of control larvae was treated in the same way and revealed only one zzso
