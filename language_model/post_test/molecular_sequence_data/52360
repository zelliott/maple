The outgrowth of zzso zzso cells onto a zzso zzso is expected to be the primary event in the zzso of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso buttons (5 zzso were punched from excised rabbit zzso and placed onto bare zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso Cell outgrowth areas were measured after zzso the buttons for 4 days in zzso zzso zzso zzso to the materials was measured from pure and zzso solutions with zzso zzso A zzso thought to be related to the binding strength of zzso to zzso zzso was measured in parallel experiments by partial zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso Following pure solution zzso zzso a range of outgrowth areas was measured (from zzso zzso zzso zzso for glass to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso On all of the materials tested cell outgrowth areas increased following zzso zzso and decreased following zzso zzso relative to bare surfaces zzso less than zzso Following zzso with zzso protein zzso cell outgrowth areas increased with zzso zzso however, the outgrowth areas were not determined solely by the concentration of zzso zzso onto the zzso This result suggested that the biological efficiency of the zzso zzso was zzso When the cell outgrowth data were zzso against zzso retention following zzso zzso the outgrowth areas were found to increase along with increases in zzso zzso Based on these data we suggest that zzso cell outgrowth may be partially governed by the tightness of binding between the zzso molecules and the underlying zzso
