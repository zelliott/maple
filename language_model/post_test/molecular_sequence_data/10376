A zzso for effective expression of zzso DNA zzso a hybrid protein composed of the zzso targeting zzso of zzso IV of zzso zzso c zzso preceding the mature zzso chain of bovine zzso zzso zzso in zzso has been zzso It has been shown that this zzso when zzso in zzso cells, in imported into zzso and zzso zzso processing, thus yielding a product of molecular mass corresponding to that of mature zzso zzso However, only insignificant portion of the imported protein proves to be inserted into the inner membrane of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibits cholesterol zzso activity towards zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This fact indicates that the foreign protein is correctly folded and oriented in the zzso Thus, zzso into the inner membrane is a limiting step of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas its import into zzso and zzso processing proceed without significant zzso
