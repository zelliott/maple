zzso containing human genes for three orphan G zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated using their rat zzso as zzso Previous studies of the mouse and rat zzso have shown the receptors to be expressed primarily in brain but have failed to identify their zzso The three zzso proteins of zzso zzso and 330 zzso zzso respectively, are zzso by a single zzso in each zzso Excluding the divergent sequences preceding the first zzso domain, they have approximately zzso zzso acid identity with each zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso localized these three genes to human zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso
