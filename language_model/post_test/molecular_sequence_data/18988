zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso proteins present on rubber zzso and probably involved in the zzso of zzso Their function is zzso but we previously discovered that zzso had zzso properties, which could be of particular interest during the zzso zzso First, we confirmed that zzso and zzso zzso and principal proteins in zzso zzso are not zzso In this work, we investigated various aspects of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that both proteins are zzso into different zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso rich in zzso and forms quickly large zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso in solution into stable zzso of a more zzso zzso Both proteins are however able to interact together, and zzso may inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso is also able to interact with the zzso of zzso and zzso leading to their zzso In addition, we also showed that both zzso and zzso did not have zzso activity, whereas their activity on zzso has been clearly zzso We may suspect that these zzso properties, even though they are clearly different, may occur during zzso when the membrane is zzso The interaction of proteins with zzso could help in the zzso stability of zzso whereas the zzso interactions would contribute to the zzso process, by bringing rubber particles together or eventually zzso the particle zzso
