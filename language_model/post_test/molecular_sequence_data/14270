During development, zzso is expressed in zzso zzso such as hair and zzso Thus far, the evidence that zzso plays a crucial role in tooth development comes from reports showing that zzso dominant zzso in zzso result in severe zzso and zzso defects leading to zzso and zzso However, the normal function of zzso in zzso remains zzso Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that the absence of zzso in the neural crest results in major impairment of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso mice develop brittle teeth with zzso zzso and zzso with an enlarged pulp chamber and zzso zzso Using this mouse model, we found that zzso zzso zzso a major component of the zzso zzso is strongly zzso in zzso lacking zzso Using zzso we further demonstrate the direct binding of zzso to the zzso promoter in zzso zzso reporter zzso determined that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso This establishes a regulatory zzso where the zzso factor zzso is essential in zzso formation by directly regulating a crucial zzso zzso
