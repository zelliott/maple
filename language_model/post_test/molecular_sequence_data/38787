zzso of oral zzso and zzso zzso are zzso of medical and zzso interest that zzso zzso They can also zzso zzso in the presence of a sugar zzso Previous reports have identified an zzso acid zzso that may affect the structure of the zzso zzso therefore, random zzso of the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso I zzso was used to further understanding of its involvement in the zzso mechanism and to evaluate how different zzso acids can zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained where zzso was replaced by each of the different possible classes of zzso zzso These were expressed in zzso coli and zzso by means of a zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso acid in position zzso influences the structure of the zzso and the size of the zzso produced by zzso The results suggest that the zzso acid occupying this position is more likely to interact with the zzso molecules zzso or zzso zzso zzso than to be directly involved in zzso transfer from zzso Engineering of the equivalent position in zzso thus appears to be a good target to expand the range of zzso zzso
