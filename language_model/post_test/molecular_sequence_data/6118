We present here the zzso sequence of the tail fiber genes of zzso zzso zzso rescue was used to associate an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with the previously known tail gene zzso A downstream ORF, zzso a zzso product, was designated zzso zzso Comparative studies suggested that K encodes the tail fiber protein and that zzso 45 encodes an assembly zzso K protein contains a succession of short zzso acid sequences zzso that are zzso with sequences from the tail fiber proteins of unrelated zzso The fact that these sequence motifs are variously present in the tail fiber proteins of unrelated zzso has been advanced as evidence for horizontal transfer in the evolution of the associated tail fiber zzso However, the fact that the order of the various motifs in the proteins is zzso emphasizes the probability that independent divergence from a common zzso also played a major role in the evolution of the tail fiber zzso
