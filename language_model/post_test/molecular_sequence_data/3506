The activity and zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso family members are controlled by zzso at three highly zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso In the case of the novel zzso zzso these are zzso in the zzso loop, zzso in the turn motif and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso the contribution of the zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso activity in controlling the zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso migrated as a single band, and stimulation with zzso growth factor resulted in the appearance of a second band with a slower zzso mobility, zzso with an increase in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with an active zzso zzso also resulted in increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas an active zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso at these zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were not zzso at zzso in cells, and zzso of this site leads to zzso of the zzso zzso an effect which can be reversed with either zzso acid or zzso with active zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of mixed zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso with an increase in zzso zzso These studies reveal that the mechanism of zzso of a novel zzso is the same as that for conventional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso loop triggers zzso of the zzso zzso However, the regulation of this zzso is different for novel and conventional zzso Specifically, the zzso of novel zzso is regulated rather than zzso
