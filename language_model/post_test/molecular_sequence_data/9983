zzso bypass zzso and zzso circulatory arrest zzso are important components of zzso cardiac zzso zzso injury and inflammatory cascade zzso result in zzso damage and vascular leak which are clinically zzso as pulmonary zzso and low cardiac output zzso zzso are particularly zzso zzso cloning is a useful method of zzso induced genes and can be applied to zzso 

We used a newborn lamb model replicating infant zzso with zzso to obtain zzso during various periods of zzso We zzso zzso cloning to identify zzso induced in lung following zzso and zzso zzso protection was used to zzso zzso zzso 

We isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso screen comparing control lung with lung exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels increased zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso and 6 zzso of zzso No induction was observed immediately following bypass or after 3 zzso of zzso We found no significant induction of zzso zzso following zzso arrest, and zzso in other zzso surveyed, including zzso atrium, skeletal muscle, zzso brain, and zzso 

Our finding that zzso zzso is zzso induced in lung following zzso with 6 zzso of zzso suggests an important role for the water channel in the setting of pulmonary zzso zzso of zzso is late compared with other inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso Further studies are needed to determine if zzso contributes to the disease process or if it is part of the recovery zzso
