zzso disease is a zzso linked zzso disorder associated with copper metabolism zzso We have recently mapped two zzso zzso related to this disease in a 1 zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso at zzso We now report the construction of a zzso zzso and the isolation of candidate partial zzso for the zzso disease zzso The candidate gene expresses an 8 zzso message in all investigated zzso and deletions were detected in zzso of 100 unrelated zzso zzso The deduced partial protein sequence shared the zzso motif with bacterial metal resistance zzso suggesting a potential heavy metal binding zzso These findings should lead to more accurate prenatal diagnosis of this severe disease and a better understanding of the cellular zzso of essential heavy zzso
