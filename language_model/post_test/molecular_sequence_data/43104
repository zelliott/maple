The zzso zzso zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso contains three genes related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although one of these zzso appears not to be zzso zzso analysis suggests that the genes are more highly zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso and zzso are more similar to their zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than to each zzso Studies in which zzso zzso are used show that both zzso and zzso are induced during symbiotic root zzso development, although not zzso zzso is the most highly expressed zzso gene in zzso but is also expressed to lower zzso in a variety of other zzso zzso shows higher levels of expression in roots and the zzso zzso of zzso than in zzso or other zzso In roots, both genes are expressed in the absence of an zzso nitrogen zzso However the addition of nitrate leads to a zzso zzso to zzso increase in the abundance of both zzso and the addition of ammonium leads to a zzso increase in zzso zzso The nitrogen supply, therefore, influences the expression of the two genes in roots, but it is clearly not the major zzso of their zzso In the discussion section, the expression of the zzso gene family of the model zzso zzso zzso is compared to those of other zzso zzso
