The zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso complex, a member of the zzso family of adhesive receptors involved in zzso and zzso zzso contains binding sites for zzso von zzso factor, zzso and zzso zzso or defects of this zzso result in the zzso bleeding disorder zzso zzso In this report, we describe the isolation of zzso DNA coding for the entire mature zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by 14 zzso which range in length from 90 to zzso base pairs, which are contained within an approximately zzso zzso stretch of zzso DNA on zzso zzso All of the zzso junctions were found to conform to the consensus zzso donor and zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso gene is identical with the previously described zzso sequence except for three silent zzso One substitution creates a zzso site which may be the site of a known zzso zzso A second substitution eliminates a zzso zzso Aside from the start of the first zzso zzso which begins at the second base of the first zzso of the mature zzso there is no correlation between the organization of the zzso in this gene and proposed functional zzso of the protein based on analysis of the primary zzso acid zzso The less frequently used zzso signal zzso was present at the zzso of the major zzso zzso Recently, an alternatively processed zzso transcript has been zzso We demonstrate that this transcript results from zzso of the final zzso The description of the zzso gene organization should be of importance in understanding the evolution of the zzso family of receptors and should be useful in the molecular biology analysis of zzso patients who have a zzso in the zzso zzso
