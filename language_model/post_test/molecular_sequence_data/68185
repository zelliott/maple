zzso type 2 zzso is a rare zzso dominant disease, characterized by the development of bilateral zzso zzso The zzso gene has been assigned to zzso zzso zzso and other eye abnormalities are frequently seen in zzso zzso The specific association of eye abnormalities and zzso might be caused by a genetic change on zzso 22 that affects both the zzso gene and a physically linked zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we regionally localized the known zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to an extended panel of human zzso zzso zzso cell hybrids containing various portions of zzso zzso It was found that all zzso genes map to a very small region on zzso 22 that is physically separate from the zzso gene region by at least 160 zzso of zzso In addition, we found that the beta B zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso are clustered on a 300 zzso zzso zzso and that the beta A4 zzso gene zzso is not part of this zzso We conclude that the zzso manifestations in many zzso patients are probably not the primary consequence of zzso on zzso 22 that involve both the zzso gene and a nearby beta zzso zzso
