A zzso zzso is of major interest because it is consistently zzso in cancer cells in correlation with their invasive and zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso presents intriguing zzso properties because it has been characterized as the precursor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso zzso The isolation of the zzso gene is a prerequisite for identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the constant zzso of the zzso expression in cancer zzso To date, the active zzso gene has never been identified in any species due to the existence of multiple zzso in most zzso zzso In this study, we report for the first time the gene structure and potential regulatory sequences of the 37 zzso zzso The chicken zzso was selected to undergo this characterization because it is the only known zzso that bears a single 37 zzso gene zzso The 37 zzso active gene is composed of 7 zzso and 6 zzso and bears features characteristic of a zzso protein zzso It does not bear a classical zzso box and it exhibits several zzso initiation sites as demonstrated by zzso protection zzso and primer zzso Analysis of potential regulatory regions suggests that gene expression is driven not only by the zzso zzso region but also by the zzso untranslated and zzso 1 zzso On the basis of gene structure and extensive protein evolutionary study, we found that the zzso domain of the protein is a zzso zzso zzso domain that could be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso whereas the central core of the protein would be responsible for the zzso associated zzso The first identification of the active zzso gene presented in this study is a critical step toward the isolation of the corresponding human gene and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso of its expression during tumor invasion and zzso
