We investigated a Danish cohort of 31 unrelated patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso to assess the role that zzso in zzso protein genes play in zzso Patients were genetically screened by zzso zzso single strand zzso zzso and subsequently by zzso DNA sequencing of zzso in the coding regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Eight zzso carried zzso genetic zzso zzso In zzso three novel zzso were zzso in zzso one novel zzso and two known zzso were zzso and in zzso a known zzso was zzso One zzso was double zzso We find evidence of zzso zzso three zzso described earlier as zzso causing were found in four cases of IDC, with no history of a zzso zzso Furthermore, one pedigree presented with several cases of classic zzso as well as one case with left zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were found in about one-quarter of zzso patients, and seem to play an important role in the causation of the zzso The zzso is as complex as seen in zzso Thus, our data suggest that a genetic zzso should include screening of the most prominent zzso genes even in the absence of a family history of the zzso
