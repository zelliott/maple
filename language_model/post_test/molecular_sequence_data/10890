An zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to produce a 10 to 50 times baseline enhancement of the presentation of specific zzso peptides to zzso T cell zzso by cell surface zzso class II zzso In order to define zzso relationships in zzso zzso were zzso with the following systematic zzso 1) zzso and zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3) zzso with 13 natural zzso acids in each position of the zzso fully active zzso and then with an additional 12 zzso zzso acids at certain zzso positions, 4) zzso with zzso acids and zzso and 5) cyclical zzso More than 160 zzso were tested for effects on zzso presentation by the zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso For some compounds, zzso specificity between zzso and zzso exceeded zzso zzso acid and/or zzso zzso were accepted at some zzso positions, leading to peptides with relatively long zzso in mouse serum and low zzso in zzso An zzso zzso inhibited in zzso presentation of an internally processed zzso egg zzso zzso to a specific T zzso The best compounds can be tested in zzso for therapeutic zzso 1) zzso upon release of zzso zzso and 2) vaccination or zzso upon zzso of a second zzso zzso
