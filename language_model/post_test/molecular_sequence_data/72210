We have cloned and determined the structure of the zzso region of the mouse zzso gene located on the zzso end of mouse zzso zzso This gene encodes an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is important for maintaining the zzso activity of natural killer zzso The region of the zzso gene cloned in this study spans 25 zzso and contains the promoter, eight zzso and a single alternative zzso The boundaries of zzso zzso and the alternate zzso events in this region are identical to those previously described for the human zzso zzso The zzso promoter region has features that are typical of a zzso zzso including high G + C content, high frequency of zzso zzso and a lack of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso reporter zzso was equivalent in zzso and zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso protein expression is regulated by zzso zzso In support of this hypothesis, two levels of zzso control have been identified within the zzso zzso A zzso zzso was found to remain in zzso produced in bone zzso and an alternative zzso capable of interrupting the zzso open reading frame was found in immature zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence has been identified that may be important for the regulation of the zzso gene by zzso zzso
