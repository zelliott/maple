We screened a total of 87 unrelated patients with zzso type 1 zzso for zzso in zzso 11, zzso and zzso of the zzso gene using temperature zzso gel zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994 to 1998 is predicted to lead to a truncated protein product lacking three quarters of its zzso sequence including the entire zzso zzso zzso This zzso is associated with a reduction by 50% of the zzso amount of zzso found in this zzso Despite the reduced level of zzso cellular GAP activity was normal, which suggests that defects in other functions of the zzso zzso may be important in the zzso of zzso
