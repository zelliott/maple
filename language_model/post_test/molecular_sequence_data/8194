An association between the zzso I 1-1 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 72 zzso and lung cancer has previously been reported by zzso et zzso A zzso of the data by zzso et zzso revealed no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to zzso zzso and the increased frequency of zzso I 1-1 zzso was mostly zzso to a zzso from the zzso zzso In an attempt to replicate the results by zzso et zzso we have studied three zzso zzso zzso I and zzso I zzso in zzso 4 and zzso 6 respectively and a 16 zzso zzso in zzso 3) and their zzso in Swedish lung cancer patients and zzso The results concerning the zzso 72 zzso were largely zzso Thus there was no significant association between lung cancer and the zzso I 1-1 type, and only a marginal difference zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso I zzso frequency when lung cancer patients were compared with patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso However, when the analysis was based on zzso zzso larger differences appeared and it was found that only zzso I 1 zzso zzso linked to 16 zzso 1 zzso were associated with lung zzso Pro zzso linked to the 16 zzso zzso appeared instead to zzso some protection against zzso Thus the zzso 72 zzso need not be functionally involved in lung cancer, but may rather be markers in linkage zzso with other cancer zzso sites on zzso
