The zzso zzso family consists of zzso surface proteins with a molecular mass of about 15 zzso Seven members of the zzso family have been zzso and from five of these the genes have been zzso Three members of the human family have been zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso or zzso zzso Most of the genes are expressed on zzso but some are expressed on other zzso as zzso The mapped genes of the zzso zzso zzso as well as of zzso were shown to have a highly zzso structure, each consisting of four zzso The human zzso zzso was originally identified as a target zzso for zzso of patients with zzso cell zzso The zzso is expressed on zzso but evidently not on zzso zzso cloning of the zzso zzso the zzso revealed that this zzso is most likely the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we describe that, in contrast to all other zzso zzso the gene zzso the human zzso zzso consists of only three zzso zzso at the zzso end of the zzso start site were shown to drive zzso zzso These data suggest that the functional elimination of an ancestral zzso zzso 1 switched the expression from zzso toward zzso
