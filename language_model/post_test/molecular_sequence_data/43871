zzso is a novel zzso protein that protects cells against both zzso and tumor necrosis zzso cell zzso zzso recognizing the N zzso of zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso band zzso and multiple high molecular mass zzso Because zzso possesses the zzso zzso zzso near the C zzso it is likely that these additional bands represent zzso of zzso to other proteins in a manner that is similar to the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso C zzso is zzso which allows it to be zzso to other proteins via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso is localized predominantly to the zzso However, zzso and the majority of zzso proteins appeared to be localized to the zzso When the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were changed to zzso only zzso zzso and zzso but not the high molecular mass bands were zzso Thus, zzso generation appears to be required for the formation of high molecular mass bands in the zzso Taken together, zzso represents a novel zzso for nuclear protein zzso which is distinct from zzso
