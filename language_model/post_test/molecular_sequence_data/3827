zzso acid zzso is a zzso for zzso synthesis in some bacteria, and this zzso has been zzso for zzso production in zzso We cloned a DNA zzso containing the genes involved in the conversion of zzso to zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The introduction of this DNA zzso into zzso coli cells enabled them to convert zzso to zzso via zzso zzso as an zzso The smallest zzso zzso designated zzso contained a zzso insert DNA zzso that has zzso synthetic zzso The zzso sequence of the insert DNA revealed that two open reading frames zzso zzso proteins with molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso were involved in the zzso synthesis from zzso These zzso were designated zzso and zzso respectively, and their gene products were identified by overproduction of proteins zzso in each zzso and by the zzso zzso The functions of these gene products were examined using extracts of zzso coli cells carrying deletion derivatives of zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in the conversion of zzso to zzso and the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was first identified as a gene zzso an zzso that zzso zzso ring zzso zzso is highly zzso with zzso Since both zzso can only catalyze the zzso conversion from zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso it is thought that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
