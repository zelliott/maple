A zzso yellow pigmented zzso designated strain zzso that reduced zzso to zzso red zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso gene sequence alignment identified the isolate as a novel zzso species with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as its closest zzso zzso alignments show that the zzso zzso gene of strain zzso differed from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content was zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso reported for zzso zzso but slightly higher than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and significantly higher than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids present in the zzso strain were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The cellular fatty acid profile, zzso content, zzso properties, and zzso characteristics were consistent with its placement within the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso is proposed for these zzso
