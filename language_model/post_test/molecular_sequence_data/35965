The major protein zzso that zzso zzso zzso was zzso from chicken gizzard zzso and shown to be composed of three zzso with apparent molecular masses of zzso 37 and 20 zzso the most likely structure being a zzso The zzso component was the zzso zzso while the zzso and zzso components formed a regulatory complex that enhanced zzso zzso activity towards heavy zzso or the isolated zzso P light chain from smooth muscle and suppressed its activity towards zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as the beta zzso of protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The distinctive properties of smooth and skeletal muscle zzso zzso are explained by interaction of zzso beta with different proteins and (in conjunction with earlier analysis of the zzso zzso establish that the specificity and zzso location of zzso is determined by its interaction with a number of specific zzso zzso
