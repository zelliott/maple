Isolation and characterization of genes specifically expressed in zzso are necessary for understanding sex differentiation and zzso development processes in the giant tiger shrimp, zzso zzso In this study, a transcript that significantly matched the zzso precursor was further characterized by zzso The sequence obtained was zzso zzso in length and contained a coding region of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso This transcript was only expressed in zzso but not in zzso of zzso (N zzso 10) and zzso (N zzso zzso of zzso zzso A tissue distribution analysis further confirmed zzso expression of this transcript (called zzso zzso zzso transcript 1, zzso in female zzso zzso levels of zzso 1 in zzso of juvenile zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso body zzso were significantly higher at zzso hours post zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso that zzso was comparably expressed throughout zzso development in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the expression level of zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was clearly localized in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a functionally Important role in promoting the development of female germ cells and zzso in zzso zzso
