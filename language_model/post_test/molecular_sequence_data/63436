The zzso zzso variable zzso zzso zzso is endowed with high intrinsic zzso stability and can be functionally expressed in the reducing environment of both zzso and zzso zzso The stability and zzso functionality of this zzso can be ascribed mostly to its framework regions and are essentially independent of the specific sequence and structure of the supported zzso zzso zzso the zzso represents a suitable scaffold to construct stable zzso zzso molecules against different zzso by in zzso evolution or zzso site zzso Thanks to the zzso zzso properties associated to a high zzso stability of zzso fragments, such zzso zzso may be exploited for a wide range of biomedical applications, from in zzso diagnosis to therapy, as well as to interfere with the function of zzso proteins and zzso and for functional zzso zzso However, the potential zzso of the zzso framework regions represents a limitation for their exploitation in therapeutic zzso To overcome this zzso we humanized a zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso which is endowed with even higher zzso stability than the parent zzso The zzso was carried out by substituting the framework zzso differing from closely related zzso and zzso zzso of human origin with their human zzso zzso zzso generated the fully humanized product and four intermediate zzso which were analyzed for protein expression and zzso zzso We found that the substitution zzso zzso in the zzso domain dramatically reduced the bacterial expression of all zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso led to the final humanized zzso named zzso This zzso comprises humanized zzso and zzso framework regions and is endowed with zzso zzso stability in human serum and functionality under reducing conditions comparable to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the humanized zzso represents a suitable scaffold onto which new zzso towards zzso of therapeutic interest can be engineered for biomedical zzso
