The increase of zzso complexity in early zzso evolution is zzso with the advent and diversification of zzso These small zzso guide animal development by regulating zzso transitions in gene expression involved in cell fate choices and transitions between zzso and zzso One of the two known zzso whose origins date back before the zzso zzso is zzso In zzso it appears zzso associated in zzso transcripts with zzso and zzso two key regulators of zzso In zzso these three zzso families have expanded to form a complex system of zzso zzso In this contribution, we zzso the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso which was restructured independently in zzso zzso and zzso The foundation of a second zzso locus in the common zzso of zzso and zzso predates the zzso zzso zzso which then caused a rapid expansion of the zzso zzso
