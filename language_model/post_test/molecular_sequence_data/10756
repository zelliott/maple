A zzso zzso zzso including the replication and origin of transfer regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The isolated replication region was sufficient for stable maintenance of the zzso and shares zzso with zzso zzso zzso was highest with the replication region of the zzso zzso zzso experiments, however, determined that zzso is compatible with zzso a zzso harboring the zzso zzso zzso in their zzso I zzso sequences may account for their zzso A zzso origin was also found in the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that although zzso the zzso clone including the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be mobilized in the presence of the helper zzso zzso
