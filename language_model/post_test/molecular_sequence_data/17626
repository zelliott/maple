The role of zzso of zzso upon translation of zzso zzso has been studied using an artificial zzso It has been found that the levels of zzso of zzso zzso + 1 out of two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso + 1) zzso in addition to earlier described effects of mutual arrangement of initiation and termination signals, also on efficiency of translation of the zzso zzso zzso The results obtained lead to the conclusion that in zzso systems the levels of translation of zzso zzso + 1 can be regulated by zzso of zzso resulted from translation of the zzso zzso zzso
