The zzso zzso activity in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso active zzso that can be resolved by zzso zzso zzso acid sequences from one form of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso have been zzso to design zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso analysis of multiple zzso clones indicates that there are at least two types of zzso in rat zzso These zzso differ primarily by the absence zzso zzso or the presence zzso zzso of a zzso internal zzso Additional zzso in the 3' coding regions of the different zzso has also been zzso Both types of zzso predict primary translation products that are zzso which must be zzso processed at both their zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso peak III protein from rat zzso demonstrates that the type A zzso encodes this zzso zzso This analysis also provides support for the assignment of the zzso processing zzso In addition, data are presented which demonstrate that type B zzso is also zzso The implications of the internal and zzso zzso are zzso
