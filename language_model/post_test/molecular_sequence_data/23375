Our discovery that the major coat protein of zzso zzso resembles that of human zzso raised the unexpected possibility that viruses infecting bacteria could be related by evolution to those infecting animal zzso We first review the development of this zzso We then describe how we have used zzso modeling to show that several other viruses with no zzso sequence similarity are likely to have coats constructed from similar zzso zzso zzso There is evidence that the group includes a diversity of viruses infecting very different hosts in all three zzso of life: zzso zzso and zzso that zzso billions of years zzso The current zzso of viruses obscures such zzso We propose that the occurrence of a zzso zzso coat protein in an zzso zzso virus with large zzso irrespective of its host, is a very strong indicator of its membership in a lineage of viruses with a common zzso
