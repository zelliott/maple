zzso genetic or zzso knockout approaches have contributed significantly to the success of model organisms for fundamental and biomedical zzso Although various technologies are available for zzso zzso none of them scale very well for zzso zzso To address this, we implemented a zzso knockout approach that is based on random chemical zzso and detection of single zzso zzso in genes of interest using zzso zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso worms was established and screened, resulting in the identification of zzso induced zzso in 109 zzso which translates into an average spacing between zzso zzso in the library of only 17 zzso We covered zzso of the open reading frames of 32 genes and identified one or more zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of our results indicates that nonsense zzso for zzso of all zzso zzso genes are present in the zzso To identify all of these zzso one only needs to inspect those positions zzso the known specificity of the zzso result in the introduction of a stop zzso We define these positions as nonsense introducing zzso zzso The zzso collection of possible zzso can be calculated for any zzso with a zzso zzso and reduces the screening complexity by zzso to zzso depending on the zzso and zzso For zzso zzso zzso there are only approximately 500,000 zzso We show that a zzso zzso approach employing zzso zzso can, in principle, be used for the zzso identification of zzso zzso zzso
