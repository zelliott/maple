We identified a novel zzso in the zzso gene of a Japanese patient with zzso zzso A combination of in zzso amplification of the zzso with single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested the presence of a zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the amplified DNA revealed a single base zzso zzso which was between zzso T zzso and G zzso within the zzso zzso This zzso caused a shift in the reading frame of nine zzso acids and introduced a premature termination signal that would be expected to lack about two-thirds of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso may interfere with type IV collagen assembly leading to increased zzso and play a zzso role in the zzso basement membrane zzso of this patient with typical zzso zzso Gene tracking by restriction zzso zzso zzso revealed that the patient's mother is zzso whereas the patient's brother and one sister are normal, albeit they have zzso and zzso Without gene analysis, they would have been zzso We propose that the diagnosis of zzso syndrome should be made on the basis of both clinical zzso and molecular zzso
