We report the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso derived from a sea zzso zzso clone containing part of a zzso protein 70 zzso zzso This fragment, named zzso gene II, contains zzso zzso of the zzso region and zzso zzso of structural gene sequence interrupted by five zzso and zzso the zzso 371 zzso acids zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso region contains a putative zzso element, two zzso boxes, four zzso consensus sequence elements zzso and one consensus sequence for binding of zzso zzso zzso were observed for deduced zzso sequence and zzso organization between zzso gene II and rat zzso zzso
