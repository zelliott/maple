zzso zzso zzso has been extensively studied as a model of human zzso zzso since it was first described by zzso in zzso zzso was induced in active form by the zzso of rats with zzso derived from the zzso zzso brush border, resulting in zzso zzso immune zzso zzso was also induced passively by the injection of zzso border zzso into normal zzso A breakthrough in the understanding of the zzso of zzso was made in the 1970s, when it was established that the disease was due to the binding of circulating zzso to zzso zzso This in turn led to a search to identify the zzso zzso In 1982, zzso (now called zzso a zzso located in zzso pits of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified as a target zzso In 1990, a second protein (44 zzso now known as zzso (for zzso associated zzso that binds to zzso was also shown to be a target zzso Both molecules have been cloned and zzso and their role in normal zzso cells has been zzso It has come to light that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso gene family and functions as a zzso zzso for the zzso of a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor complexes, zzso zzso very zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso associates with zzso and appears to function as a zzso assisting in the folding of zzso in the zzso zzso and its transport to the cell zzso This review considers what is now known about the structure, function, and trafficking of zzso and zzso and the role of these two molecules in the zzso of zzso
