Resident membrane proteins of the zzso network zzso of zzso zzso are selectively retrieved from a zzso zzso zzso Proper cycling of the zzso Y zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso compartment depends on zzso a zzso peripheral membrane zzso In this study we use a zzso zzso zzso to show that loss of zzso function rapidly leads to zzso of zzso a model zzso membrane zzso to the zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso transport of both zzso and zzso This was demonstrated by zzso analysis of zzso zzso strains expressing zzso zzso lacking either the retrieval or zzso retention signals and by an zzso for zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso was identified that was defective for retrieval of zzso but functional for retrieval of zzso Moreover, several other zzso zzso were identified with the opposite zzso they were defective for zzso retrieval but near normal for zzso zzso These data suggest a model in which distinct structural features within zzso are required for zzso with the zzso zzso of each cargo protein during the retrieval zzso
