It has been suggested that zzso plays an important role in several aspects of zzso metabolism and is a zzso factor in the main zzso zzso In this investigation, we studied genes zzso for this protein in the fast-growing opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso sequences of two different zzso genes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso They show only zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso identity at the zzso acid level, and they are more similar to zzso from different bacteria, including zzso than to each zzso Both proteins were found to be expressed in actively growing zzso zzso and both could also be expressed when transformed into zzso coli and zzso zzso We detected the presence of a copy of zzso in the neighboring region of a zzso gene in the zzso zzso strain in which this element was identified zzso zzso The influence of each zzso gene on zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso was checked by using the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso Resistance to zzso was induced when zzso was transformed into zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso contributes to the natural resistance of zzso zzso to the zzso This is the first report showing two different genes zzso same zzso activity which are actively expressed within the same zzso zzso
