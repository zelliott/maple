The zzso zzso is one of the zzso fatty acid zzso synthesis pathways for zzso zzso It was previously noted that this zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of a 30 zzso zzso upstream zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to a significant decrease in zzso transcription, suggesting positive regulation by an unknown positive regulatory zzso 

Here, genetic and zzso approaches were employed to identify a potential zzso zzso zzso of candidate genes such as zzso or zzso was performed to determine if any of these gene products act as a zzso zzso However, none of these genes were involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Use of zzso random zzso to screen for zzso zzso showed that several genes zzso unknown functions, zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso regulation, but probably via indirect zzso zzso attempts performed did fail to isolate an zzso of zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso expression might not be regulated by zzso but by a distinct mechanism such as a regulatory zzso zzso
