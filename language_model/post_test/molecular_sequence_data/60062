The zzso zzso is composed of zzso bacteria often specialized for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has relied primarily upon zzso criteria: a strain that visually appeared to be a member of the zzso has generally been called one without zzso A zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso sequencing, profiling restriction fragments of zzso zzso zzso regions, zzso analysis, zzso profiling and salt tolerance zzso was used to clarify the zzso of 76 strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The described species of the zzso zzso formed a zzso group with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso The zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso are different from these two zzso and form the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso zzso was observed to cluster with species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is synonymous with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is synonymous with zzso zzso as determined by these analyses and zzso zzso zzso discerning these different zzso were zzso The necessary zzso have been proposed and a description of zzso is zzso
