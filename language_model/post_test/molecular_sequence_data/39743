zzso zzso zzso zzso via a combination of specialized structures and zzso zzso zzso zzso are accepted as key factors for the host penetration step and include zzso The characterization of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso gene is interrupted by two short zzso and is zzso long, coding a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids with a stretch of 19 zzso acid zzso displaying characteristics of signal zzso The predicted zzso molecular mass is 44 zzso with a mature protein of 42 zzso and a theoretical zzso of zzso The comparison of the zzso predicted protein to zzso zzso revealed similarity to the zzso family 18 and a zzso analysis was zzso The zzso gene is zzso by zzso as a carbon source and in conditions of fungus zzso and is zzso by zzso This regulation is consistent with the presence of putative zzso carbon zzso zzso binding zzso on the regulatory zzso
