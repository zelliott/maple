The sequence of mouse zzso zzso 3 zzso was obtained from several clones isolated from a mouse liver zzso zzso The zzso sequence of mouse zzso was 2020 bases in length containing 37 bases in the zzso zzso region, zzso in the coding region, and zzso in the 3' zzso zzso The derived protein sequence consisted of zzso zzso acids including the putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding sites zzso of zzso zzso starting at positions 9 and zzso zzso The mouse zzso protein sequence was 79 and zzso identical to the human and rabbit zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso was expressed in zzso coli and compared to zzso coli expressed human zzso The zzso proteins migrated with the same mobility ( approximately 58 zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso The expressed zzso zzso zzso and human zzso were sensitive to heat and reacted in a similar manner toward metal zzso and zzso zzso activities of mouse and human zzso were high toward the zzso zzso however, in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by both zzso was reduced by greater than zzso Other zzso which inhibited zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and to a lesser degree zzso When zzso with mouse zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso samples from female mice, but not in samples from zzso zzso was detected in zzso samples from male and female mouse zzso but zzso message was not detected in mouse kidney sample from either zzso zzso of zzso confirmed the zzso and zzso expression of mouse zzso
