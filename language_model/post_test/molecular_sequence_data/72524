Mice whose zzso zzso are engineered to zzso two distinct zzso heavy zzso chains generate a zzso B cell compartment in which most cells zzso express the two heavy zzso This demonstrates that zzso of zzso H chain expression and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso do not significantly contribute to zzso exclusion at the zzso zzso zzso the stability of the various engineered zzso zzso during B cell development in the bone zzso differed substantially from each zzso
