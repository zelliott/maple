zzso is a zzso zzso of a member of an zzso family of relatively homogeneous repetitive DNA elements from soybean zzso zzso The zzso was originally amplified from soybean DNA by the zzso chain reaction using a single zzso zzso and consequently zzso in an zzso zzso The elements defined by zzso are at least zzso zzso in length and constitute a family of zzso members per zzso zzso The family has been designated zzso zzso zzso repetitive element zzso Overlapping regions of zzso exhibit suggestive DNA sequence similarity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, there are no similarities at the zzso acid level, and the regions of similarity are not functionally zzso
