Seven new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in a reduced zzso bond were zzso by solid phase methods and evaluated zzso The reduced bond in four zzso zzso zzso was formed by reductive zzso at the zzso zzso In the case of three zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso with reduced bond was reacted with zzso to form the corresponding zzso zzso These zzso zzso have a new reduced bond which is structurally more zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso binding to Swiss zzso cells with zzso values of 2-4 zzso compared to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also more potent than zzso zzso zzso in growth zzso studies using Swiss zzso zzso The two best zzso zzso of this series, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth of Swiss zzso cells with zzso values less than 1 zzso zzso was also active in zzso suppressing zzso serum zzso zzso in zzso zzso antagonists, such as zzso containing the new reduced bond zzso reported zzso are very zzso
