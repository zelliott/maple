The zzso protein of zzso coli and its zzso in other organisms, are integral components of the cellular protein zzso zzso zzso zzso that alter zzso (the zzso zzso broaden the specificity of this machinery and allow zzso of precursor proteins with defective signal zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso have been zzso These zzso zzso were found to cluster in regions corresponding to three distinct zzso zzso of zzso Based on the nature and position of the zzso zzso we propose that zzso domain 7 of zzso functions in signal sequence zzso zzso suggest that this interaction may involve a right-handed zzso of zzso zzso zzso that alter this domain appear to prevent signal sequence recognition, and this novel mechanism of suppression suggests a zzso function for zzso We propose that zzso zzso that alter a second domain of zzso zzso zzso 10, also affect this zzso function, but zzso Based on the synthetic zzso exhibited by double zzso we propose that these zzso strengthen the interaction with another component of the zzso machinery, zzso zzso zzso were also found to cluster in a region corresponding to an zzso zzso zzso zzso explanations for this unexpected finding are zzso
