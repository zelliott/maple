The nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso of zzso zzso characterized by an zzso zzso acid zzso is compared with zzso sequences of other zzso zzso The high degree of similarity to the zzso sequences indicates a zzso zzso This could be a first direct demonstration of an zzso zzso a gene transfer from an original zzso zzso to the nucleus of its host, one of the most important demands of the zzso Theory, an evolutionary mechanism leading to the origin of a new zzso
