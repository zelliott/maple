zzso zzso essential for replication of zzso zzso was found to bind in zzso immediately upstream of the zzso promoter in studies with zzso derivatives with deletions in the upstream region of zzso We constructed another series of zzso zzso that would zzso zzso derivatives containing zzso zzso in place of the zzso six zzso zzso These modified zzso proteins could not activate zzso zzso at all and showed various degrees of zzso or no zzso toward a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso six (or zzso zzso acids of zzso are important for exerting replication and zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso which showed an evident zzso without initiating zzso was examined for its ability to repress the zzso zzso
