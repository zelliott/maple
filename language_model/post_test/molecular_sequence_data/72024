A novel zzso protein was isolated by zzso zzso screening of a zzso library made from zzso mouse zzso B cells, using the zzso zzso promoter zzso element as a zzso The novel zzso protein was most closely related to zzso and zzso within the DNA binding zzso domain and was therefore named zzso However, zzso may represent a novel zzso within the zzso protein family, as it differed significantly from zzso and zzso within zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso gene that was mapped to zzso 10, region zzso zzso zzso with DNA similarly to zzso as judged by zzso zzso zzso and site selection analysis, and activated zzso of a zzso element reporter gene upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in mature B zzso and at lower levels in zzso Furthermore, zzso cell and plasma cell lines were zzso suggesting that zzso might be a regulatory zzso during a specific phase of B zzso zzso
