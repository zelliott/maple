DNA stretching in zzso may facilitate its zzso and influence site recognition by nuclear zzso In zzso stretching has been estimated to occur at the equivalent of one to two zzso zzso per zzso We have determined the crystal structure of a zzso core particle containing 145 zzso of DNA zzso Compared to the structure with 147 zzso the zzso displays two zzso of stretching one to two zzso turns from the particle zzso zzso The stretching illustrates clearly a mechanism for shifting DNA position by displacement of a single zzso while maintaining nearly identical zzso zzso Increased DNA twist localized to a short section between adjacent zzso binding sites advances the zzso setting, while a zzso component involves DNA zzso at a zzso region that zzso zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, one stretched region of the zzso displays an extraordinary 55 degrees zzso into the minor groove situated zzso zzso turns from the particle zzso zzso a hot spot for gene zzso by zzso which prefers highly distorted zzso This suggests that zzso position and context within zzso could promote extreme DNA zzso that may influence zzso zzso
