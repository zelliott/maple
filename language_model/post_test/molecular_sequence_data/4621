We describe an aromatic alcohol zzso with properties indicating a novel type of function in the defense response of plants to zzso To obtain the zzso free of contamination with possible zzso a parsley zzso zzso zzso zzso the entire coding region of the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso In zzso with large zzso acid sequence similarities with established zzso and zzso alcohol zzso from other plants, the zzso efficiently reduced various zzso and zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso zzso affinities were observed for zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso one of the most efficient zzso of several previously analyzed zzso alcohol zzso and a characteristic precursor zzso of zzso zzso was not zzso A single form of zzso zzso was strongly and rapidly induced in zzso zzso parsley zzso These results, together with earlier findings that the zzso gene is strongly activated both in zzso parsley cells and at zzso infection sites in parsley leaves, but not in zzso zzso suggest a specific role of this zzso in pathogen zzso zzso zzso
