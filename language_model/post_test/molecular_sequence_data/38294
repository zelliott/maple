zzso approaches identified three distinct human zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso proteins with significant sequence similarity to plant zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso The products of these genes are targeted to zzso and have zzso acid zzso zzso Each gene displays a distinct zzso pattern of zzso and each zzso exhibits distinct zzso zzso zzso is expressed primarily in liver and zzso and is most active on the zzso zzso zzso but is also active on zzso fatty zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in liver and kidney and displays highest activity toward zzso zzso expression was detected only in zzso and this zzso displayed a preference for the medium chain zzso zzso These results indicate that all three human zzso acid zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso fatty acids and may also contribute to the general zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso is caused by defects in zzso zzso zzso the zzso that normally eliminates zzso zzso The presence of zzso in liver and kidney zzso and the ability of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso
