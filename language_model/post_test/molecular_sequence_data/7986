A novel extremely zzso zzso was isolated from the Dead zzso This isolate is rod shaped and, like zzso zzso requires a relatively low level of sodium zzso for growth and a very high level of zzso optimal growth occurs in the presence of zzso to zzso M zzso The new strain resembles members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso group in many zzso zzso However, the polar zzso composition of this zzso is characteristic of representatives of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is present, and the zzso zzso analog of zzso is zzso The zzso content of the DNA is 70 zzso We found that on the basis of zzso zzso sequence data our new isolate occupies a position intermediate between the position of the zzso zzso group and the position of the zzso zzso and is sufficiently different from the previously described members of the zzso to justify zzso in a new species and a new zzso We propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso the type strain is strain zzso zzso
