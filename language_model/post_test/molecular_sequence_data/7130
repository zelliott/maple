We previously reported that a zzso with extra zzso acid zzso exists in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso Either of the two zzso named zzso and zzso for the zzso with and without the inserted zzso respectively, generated zzso zzso current when expressed in zzso zzso We zzso report that these two zzso are produced by the alternative zzso of the zzso skipping zzso When examined during the course of zzso development, the major zzso zzso zzso was observed to switch from zzso to zzso in the rat zzso and the cerebral zzso We also investigated two cell lines that could be differentiated into zzso cells in zzso Whereas the zzso zzso was hardly zzso in either zzso or differentiated zzso cells, the relative amounts of the two zzso zzso changed after the induction of differentiation in the zzso zzso An zzso application of zzso on the zzso zzso cells induced zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that the cells could express functional zzso coupled to zzso C and other components that could mediate the signal zzso zzso This cell line may thus provide a model system for studying both zzso expression and other zzso phenomena at the molecular zzso
