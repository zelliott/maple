The absolute zzso zzso strategy provides a means to determine the precise protein or modified protein levels directly from cells or zzso The technique is based on two major zzso stable isotope dilution theory and the use of synthetic peptides containing such stable zzso to exactly mimic native counterparts after zzso These peptides can be zzso with modifications such as zzso zzso and zzso to allow for the zzso quantitative analysis of zzso modified zzso In this chapter, we discuss the development of an zzso method and demonstrate its usefulness in the measurement of zzso levels of the human protein zzso at a functionally relevant zzso site, zzso zzso
