Despite the presence on band zzso of zzso 11 of a number of genes zzso individuals to various human diseases, most of this zzso region remains loosely zzso Moreover, there is a relative dearth of zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso are zzso distributed over this zzso region and have not been arranged into zzso We have thus undertaken zzso mapping of a zzso region flanked by zzso and zzso Since this region has demonstrated a high degree of zzso instability, we have established a framework zzso by zzso zzso and zzso into a high-resolution physical map based on zzso in zzso zzso and long-range restriction zzso The zzso area studied includes the boundaries of regions thought to contain genes zzso individuals to zzso syndrome and zzso diabetes zzso as well as genes driving amplification events in human zzso Another feature of this zzso area is that it zzso to zzso regions of the zzso In addition, it spans the region where zzso conservation with mouse zzso 19 ends, making clones that we have anchored there valuable tools in understanding zzso zzso
