Previously, it was reported that like land plants, the green zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso during cold zzso zzso et zzso Plant Cell zzso zzso zzso suggesting that synthesis of zzso could enhance the freezing tolerance of this zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso in plants, we analyzed the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso to clarify its role in zzso zzso As determined from its deduced zzso acid zzso zzso contains the zzso domain that is characteristic of the zzso family of zzso (the HAD zzso zzso However, it lacks the extensive zzso domain found in zzso of land zzso Database searches revealed that the zzso in zzso also lack the zzso zzso In addition, the green zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are closely related to land plants, have zzso zzso while Chlorella zzso has a land zzso zzso These results demonstrate that even zzso zzso zzso as a recent zzso of land plants, has the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze sequential reactions in zzso synthesis in green plant cells and the lack of the zzso domain in zzso is predicted to decrease its activity, the interaction between decreased zzso activity and zzso activity may alter zzso synthesis during cold zzso in zzso zzso
