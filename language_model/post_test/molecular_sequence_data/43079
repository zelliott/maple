The zzso and expression of zzso gene in human zzso cancer zzso were investigated by zzso sequencing and Northern zzso zzso In zzso amplification analysis, in one of 20 zzso cases of zzso was found to have zzso gene deletion in zzso 17 and zzso in one of 6 cases of the adjacent zzso tissue was found to have deletion in zzso zzso zzso zzso of human fetus induced by zzso had zzso gene deletion in zzso 17 and 21 zzso In zzso sequencing analysis, four of 10 zzso zzso were found to contain zzso gene zzso in zzso 17 and zzso In northern zzso analysis, seven of 12 zzso zzso exhibited abnormal zzso gene zzso including zzso in 6 zzso expression in zzso The results suggest that zzso tumor zzso gene might play an important role in zzso of zzso The mechanisms of zzso gene zzso deletion or abnormal expression related to zzso zzso in the environment need further zzso
