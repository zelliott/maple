zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso first zzso is a gene specifically expressed in germ cells at zzso zzso The protein first appears in round zzso accumulates in the zzso region of zzso zzso and is maintained in zzso The zzso expression pattern is consistent with a role for this zzso protein in the zzso zzso In this study, we used two experimental models, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to explore the role of zzso during zzso with a focus on zzso Mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of unknown identity, produce zzso cells characterized by a missing zzso In zzso zzso zzso detection of high levels of zzso protein coincided with the appearance of zzso germ cells during the annual sexual zzso zzso elimination of the zzso and zzso zzso through zzso administration at low temperature, abolished the zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, when zzso germ cells appeared for the first time, zzso zzso and protein were observed in zzso zzso but were barely zzso in zzso zzso In adult zzso reduced zzso protein levels were observed in both zzso and zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso Similarly, numbers of zzso that stained by zzso for zzso appeared to be progressively reduced in adult zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso status of zzso zzso revealed reduced transcript levels of zzso zzso alpha and reduced zzso zzso zzso However, zzso treatment did not affect zzso protein levels in either frogs or zzso In conclusion, our data in zzso zzso and the zzso mouse demonstrate a tight correlation between zzso protein expression and zzso zzso In particular, the findings in the zzso zzso suggest a role for this protein in zzso
