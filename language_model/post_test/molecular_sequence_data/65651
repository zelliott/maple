The widespread occurrence and diversity of zzso zzso zzso suggests their contribution to the nitrogen cycle is of global zzso Their distribution appeared limited to low- and zzso environments until the recent finding of a diagnostic membrane zzso zzso in zzso hot zzso We report here the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso growing up to 74 degrees C by zzso zzso zzso The major core zzso of this zzso growing at 72 degrees C is zzso providing the first direct evidence for its synthesis by a zzso These findings greatly extend the upper temperature limit of zzso and document that the capacity for zzso zzso is broadly distributed among the zzso
