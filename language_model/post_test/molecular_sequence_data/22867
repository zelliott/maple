zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a series of synthetic derivatives against the food pathogen zzso coli zzso were investigated under extreme incubation zzso The zzso analog zzso zzso displayed an zzso of 8 zzso and rapid zzso zzso under standard culture zzso zzso zzso properties were maintained at high salt zzso under zzso or basic conditions, and at extreme zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso displayed higher potency zzso 4 zzso but only within a narrow range of incubation conditions, pointing to the importance of the zzso domain of zzso The potency range was zzso upon zzso of zzso acid to zzso The resulting zzso was even more potent zzso 2 zzso and affected bacterial viability under most of the conditions tested, including in commercial apple zzso The zzso implications of zzso zzso charge, structure, and binding to an idealized membrane were zzso and are discussed zzso zzso the data indicate interest in simple zzso compounds for design of zzso that affect pathogens under a variable range of incubation zzso
