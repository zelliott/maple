We have identified zzso groups of the zzso zzso backbone which are required for zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso To screen the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso spanning the zzso central domain, synthetic zzso zzso were constructed with zzso incorporated site zzso Only four individual zzso zzso blocked zzso activity: zzso (in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso (both in the loop of the 3' zzso zzso Native gel analysis revealed that these zzso zzso zzso were competent for assembly of zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not inhibit zzso activity, indicating that the essential zzso groups at these positions in zzso act as hydrogen bond zzso or neutral coordinated zzso The requisite zzso at zzso zzso and zzso show both similarities and differences relative to the positions of essential zzso of zzso domain V of group II zzso The identification of the essential zzso at positions 62, 70 and 72 corroborates that the 3' zzso zzso in zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso
