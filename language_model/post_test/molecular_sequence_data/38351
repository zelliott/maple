The zzso sequence zzso was previously investigated as a site for efficient, specific zzso of a fusion protein by zzso zzso using a humanized zzso zzso as a model zzso Here we show that conservative zzso to three of the zzso in the introduced zzso site resulted in zzso sites that were significantly zzso They were zzso more efficiently by zzso such that zzso reactions could be zzso of lower pH or at a lower zzso Some were even found to be measurably zzso by zzso Use of these new zzso sequences along with zzso zzso may provide a more rapid and less harsh method for zzso large-scale zzso zzso of fusion proteins and zzso
