The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is organized in two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are respectively responsible for zzso assembly and stable zzso of zzso on the B block of zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that the removal of zzso by mild zzso zzso the residual zzso complexes at high zzso Focusing on the well zzso zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso domain, we found that the zzso zzso has long distance effects on the stability of zzso complexes and start site zzso zzso zzso complexes presented a shift in their zzso border, generated zzso zzso complexes upon stripping zzso by zzso or heat treatment, and allowed initiation at downstream zzso In addition, zzso zzso complexes were highly unstable at high zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso with zzso via its contacts with zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso serves as a scaffold critical for zzso spatial zzso and zzso zzso
