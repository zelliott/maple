A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from indoor wall zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was clearly shown to belong to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso zzso acids were zzso The major zzso was zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of zzso zzso zzso two unknown zzso and one unknown zzso The major fatty acids of zzso zzso and zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso test results allowed a clear zzso differentiation of strain zzso from all other species of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso can be regarded as a representative of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
