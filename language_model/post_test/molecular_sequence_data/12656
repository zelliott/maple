zzso analysis of the zzso complex zzso the central role of zzso in this zzso complex, as it binds to the zzso domain of zzso and to zzso zzso may also function in zzso zzso given its zzso to the gene product of the zzso segment polarity gene zzso which is known to be involved in the wingless zzso zzso To study the function of zzso during mouse development, gene zzso experiments were performed in embryonic stem cells and transgenic mice were zzso zzso zzso zzso formed zzso implanted and developed into zzso zzso At day 7 post zzso the development of the embryonic zzso was affected in zzso zzso zzso detached from the zzso cell layer and were dispersed into the zzso zzso No zzso formation was observed in zzso zzso The development of zzso structures appeared less dramatically or not at all zzso Our results demonstrate that, although zzso is expressed rather zzso it is specifically required in the zzso cell zzso
