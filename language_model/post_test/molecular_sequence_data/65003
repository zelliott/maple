zzso is a zzso protein essential for the zzso transport driven by zzso motor zzso The zzso zzso in zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is thought to participate in interactions with zzso zzso We used sequence and structure prediction analysis to study zzso zzso and zzso Here we present evidence that strongly supports that zzso zzso and zzso contain the zzso motif and adopt the left-handed parallel zzso zzso The structural models we obtained could contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions that zzso are able to establish with cargo zzso zzso or other zzso zzso
