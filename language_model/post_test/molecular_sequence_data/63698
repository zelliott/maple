zzso zzso plant viruses not only code for viral proteins within their zzso zzso they often maintain elaborate zzso secondary zzso These structures can be integral to a variety of viral zzso such as viral translation, zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso zzso zzso secondary structures may function to recruit and bind zzso protein factors, or may become part of higher order zzso zzso structures, which themselves may be functionally zzso To fully understand such viral zzso elements and their mechanisms of action, it is necessary to first determine their secondary zzso modeling based on free energy minimizing principles is generally used as an initial approach to predict potential zzso secondary structures in a zzso The most popular program is zzso which is available for free to the public at zzso zzso Though useful starting points, the zzso structures must be confirmed by more direct experimental zzso zzso structure probing of zzso is a commonly zzso technique that provides information regarding the secondary structure of an zzso primary sequence in zzso This process involves treating the zzso of interest with zzso or chemicals that modify zzso zzso based on its secondary zzso The modified sites, at either zzso or zzso regions, can be subsequently identified by primer extension and gel zzso Data from solution structure probing experiments can be superimposed onto a zzso structure to further help confirm or refine the predicted zzso secondary structure zzso
