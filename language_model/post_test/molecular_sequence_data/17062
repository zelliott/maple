zzso zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso zzso peptides comprise a new family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The discovery of zzso and zzso peptides stems from studies of cellular mechanisms underlying a form of zzso zzso caused by enteric zzso zzso zzso and microbial ST peptides activate a common zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso that elicits large increases in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso via the zzso second messenger, zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso These peptides are zzso zzso hormones that zzso regulate zzso signaling proteins in target zzso zzso roles for these peptides include the regulation of zzso cell balance in the zzso zzso and zzso of sodium balance through actions in the zzso The zzso peptides are candidate therapeutic agents targeting receptors in the zzso zzso and other zzso For example, zzso has zzso actions in an animal model for human colon zzso The ST peptides can be used as diagnostic agents to detect secondary colon zzso by single zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, thus zzso zzso forms of colon zzso Other examples of potential therapeutic applications for the zzso family of zzso zzso are: zzso the irritable zzso syndrome zzso with zzso zzso zzso forms of high blood pressure, zzso liver zzso and repair, and zzso respiratory diseases such as zzso Competitive pharmacological zzso of bacterial ST peptides offer a means for treating the zzso caused by zzso strains of enteric zzso
