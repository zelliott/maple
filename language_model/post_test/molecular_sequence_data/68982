A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed in which zzso of the zzso gene was driven by the zzso zzso repetitive protein zzso zzso The untranslated regions surrounding the zzso gene were derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the resulting transcripts occurred as expected, but the site of 3' zzso was upstream of the position zzso The nature of the zzso region was crucial to the level of expression in zzso zzso
