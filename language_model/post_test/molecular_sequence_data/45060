The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 47 zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso The function of zzso relies on its specific interaction with correctly folded zzso regions comprised of zzso repeats, and zzso zzso at zzso positions have been shown to be important for this zzso The zzso acid at the zzso position zzso in the zzso zzso containing the critical zzso zzso as zzso was also suggested to be directly recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this finding, we examined the relationship between the structure of zzso and zzso binding using synthetic zzso zzso The results obtained indicated that the structure of zzso determined the binding affinity for zzso zzso binding was observed when zzso was zzso Moreover, the required relative spatial arrangement of these key zzso in the triple zzso was analyzed by taking advantage of zzso zzso zzso each of which contains one zzso and one zzso The results revealed that zzso recognizes the zzso and zzso zzso only when they are on the same zzso zzso Taken together, the data obtained led us to define the zzso structural zzso in the collagen triple zzso and also define the zzso motif in the primary zzso A motif search against human protein database predicted candidate clients for this molecular zzso The search result indicated that not all collagen family proteins require the zzso by zzso
