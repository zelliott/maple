zzso affecting the zzso state of zzso zzso have been previously identified from analysis of suppression and enhancement of position effect zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso and an zzso zzso zzso which both show suppression of zzso in the zzso state, have point zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a protein zzso 1 zzso zzso located at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in all known protein zzso zzso in the same gene family, and its substitution decreases zzso zzso We conclude that protein zzso by zzso zzso regulates the zzso state of zzso during zzso
