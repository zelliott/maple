To study the role of the zzso zzso zzso upon egg zzso zzso clones zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso were zzso By analyses of the primary structure and functional expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to have an zzso domain and a putative zzso channel zzso zzso studies revealed polarized distribution of zzso in the zzso of the animal zzso in a well-organized zzso zzso structure and intensive zzso in the zzso region of stage VI immature zzso In zzso zzso eggs, zzso was densely enriched in the cortical region of both zzso in addition to its polarized zzso After zzso zzso showed a drastic change in its distribution in the cortical zzso These results imply the zzso role of the zzso in both the formation and propagation of zzso waves at zzso
