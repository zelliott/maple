zzso analysis revealed the existence of two types of zzso in human red cell zzso zzso The two zzso have the same zzso region consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso but their zzso regions are different in size and zzso The minor zzso can be fully zzso by the zzso zzso zzso but the zzso region of the major zzso zzso The zzso and the gene for the zzso region of the major zzso were cloned and zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that the gene for the zzso region is on zzso 6, not on the X zzso Northern zzso zzso demonstrated an existence of two separate zzso zzso one for the zzso region and the other for the zzso zzso Two separate structural zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso must be zzso for zzso the single chain zzso Either zzso of two zzso or zzso or some other mechanism must be involved in the synthesis of human red cell zzso
