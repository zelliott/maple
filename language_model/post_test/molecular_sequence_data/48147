zzso is an zzso zzso expressed on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is believed to play an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso filtered through the zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso and to identify its zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso function in mice genetically deficient for the zzso We demonstrate that zzso mice exhibit a zzso zzso zzso and zzso low molecular weight plasma proteins in the urine zzso molecular weight zzso zzso zzso include small plasma proteins that carry zzso compounds including vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds these proteins and mediates their cellular zzso zzso loss of carrier proteins in zzso mice results in zzso loss of zzso vitamins bound to the zzso Similar to zzso knockout mice, patients with low molecular weight zzso as in zzso syndrome are also shown to zzso zzso zzso Thus, these results identify a crucial role of the zzso zzso in retrieval of filtered zzso complexes and the central role played by zzso in this zzso
