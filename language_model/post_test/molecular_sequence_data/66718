zzso protein zzso is a highly zzso modular protein implicated in the regulation of zzso filament dynamics and a variety of zzso and zzso zzso The protein exists as a high molecular weight complex in cell extracts and zzso protein possesses a high tendency to aggregate, a major obstacle for zzso Using a zzso approach, we show that two structural features zzso the mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso charged clusters on the surface of the zzso zzso domain are involved in zzso interactions with the N or zzso zzso zzso these interactions mainly renders zzso due to a domain swap feature in the extreme zzso region of the protein that was previously zzso Based on earlier studies with zzso zzso we also generated zzso with zzso in the extreme zzso region of zzso zzso that did not show significantly altered zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the earlier identified zzso interaction interface on the zzso domain of zzso could not be expressed as soluble zzso Assessment of the soluble proteins indicates that the zzso did not affect their overall zzso Further studies point to the correlation between stability of full-length zzso with its zzso zzso where zzso formation leads to a more stable zzso
