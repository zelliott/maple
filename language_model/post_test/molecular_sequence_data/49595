zzso zzso release a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso enhanced the adherence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to cultured respiratory zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on the adherence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso enhanced the adherence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whilst the adherence of the zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was not or only moderately zzso by zzso zzso The adherence of the zzso zzso LOS negative zzso zzso was not enhanced by zzso These findings suggested that the secondary fatty acids of zzso A were involved in the zzso zzso LOS from strain zzso or zzso complexes did not affect or stimulate the adherence of zzso zzso although the zzso adherence is specific for certain bacterial species having LOS in their outer zzso These results indicated that LOS is involved in the zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso and LOS interact with zzso cells to promote bacterial adherence remains to be zzso
