zzso a major zzso zzso forms a specific complex with the zzso (a zzso DNA zzso of minus zzso of zzso zzso in zzso By means of zzso zzso experiments, we mapped the binding site to a zzso motif within the zzso zzso unit, referred to as zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competitive gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso probing showed that zzso folds into a secondary structure, in agreement with a zzso zzso zzso The whole zzso may be necessary for the interaction with zzso as suggested by the failure of zzso zzso to bind the protein and by the zzso zzso zzso The present work extends the previously reported ability of zzso to form a specific complex with zzso zzso to a defined DNA zzso Considering the zzso of zzso DNA replication for host cell zzso these data raise the possibility that zzso may contribute to the regulation of the zzso zzso
