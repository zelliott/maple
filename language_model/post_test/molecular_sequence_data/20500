zzso zzso zzso zzso binds the complement regulatory protein factor H zzso and additional unidentified serum zzso The goals of this study were to assess the zzso binding capability of zzso zzso derived from an extensive panel of human zzso disease zzso and to further define the molecular basis of the interaction between FH and zzso While most zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed bound zzso specific, naturally occurring zzso most of which clustered in a specific loop domain of zzso prevented FH binding in some zzso zzso analyses also revealed the existence of zzso zzso groups that correlate with FH binding and with the relationships zzso from zzso zzso types zzso zzso type 1 zzso and type 3 zzso strains bind zzso while zzso type 2 zzso strains do zzso zzso responses to zzso were also zzso zzso zzso were detected in mice by week 2 of infection, indicating that there was expression during zzso zzso zzso of zzso collected from infected mice suggested that zzso production continued over the course of long-term infection as the zzso zzso increased over zzso While zzso to zzso was detected in several human zzso disease serum samples, the response was not universal, and the zzso were generally zzso zzso studies with mice demonstrated that while zzso is zzso it does not elicit an zzso that is protective or that zzso zzso The data presented here provide significant new insight into the interaction between zzso and FH and suggest that there is a correlation between zzso production and zzso However, in spite of its possible zzso role in zzso the zzso analyses indicated that zzso is likely to have limited potential as a diagnostic marker and vaccine candidate for zzso zzso
