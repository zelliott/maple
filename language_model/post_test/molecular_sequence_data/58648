zzso zzso make a key contribution to the enormous structural and functional potential of zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso modifications in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso P from zzso coli that interfere with zzso zzso This was accomplished by modification interference employing pools of zzso P zzso that carried a low level of zzso zzso ) modifications randomly distributed over its 380 zzso A gel zzso zzso allowed us to separate zzso P zzso pools into zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the intensity of zzso zzso zzso patterns of the two zzso zzso revealed positions where the zzso modification interferes with zzso zzso A comparison with interference patterns obtained for the zzso modification alone has identified some 20 positions in the backbone of zzso coli zzso P zzso where the functional zzso caused by the zzso double modification is attributable to the zzso modification (or possibly the zzso zzso group in the case of U zzso because we used zzso for partial substitution of zzso Most of the corresponding zzso functions were localized in regions that have been reported to zzso to zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso are located along the zzso binding interface of zzso coli zzso P zzso Our results indicate that the modification interference approach applied here will be useful generally to identify structurally and functionally important zzso in large zzso and zzso
