We have investigated the genetic evolution of three functionally distinct regions of the zzso infectious anemia virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and long terminal zzso during recurring zzso episodes in a pony zzso infected with a zzso reference biological clone designated zzso zzso populations present in the plasma of an zzso pony during sequential zzso episodes zzso 34, 80, zzso and 337 days zzso were amplified from viral zzso zzso and compared to the zzso zzso The comparison of the viral zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso were all represented during the first zzso episode, but entirely replaced at the time of the second zzso episode, and that new zzso zzso were associated with each subsequent cycle of zzso One of the more surprising results was the in zzso generation of large deletion (up to 15 zzso zzso in the principal zzso domain zzso of zzso during the third zzso zzso This deletion did not alter the competence for in zzso replication as shown by the analysis of a zzso zzso clone with a partially deleted zzso and did not altered the fitness of the virus in zzso since this partially deleted envelope became the major population during the fourth zzso zzso Finally, we showed that the zzso acid zzso were not randomly distributed but delineated eight variables regions, zzso to zzso with zzso containing the zzso zzso These studies provide the first detailed description of the evolution of zzso zzso zzso during persistent infection and reveal new insights into the zzso and potential mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
