Development of the zzso zzso strategy for the regulation of gene expression in zzso poses several problems: the stability of zzso toward zzso zzso labeling of zzso with high specific zzso improvements of penetration of zzso into living cells, and enhancement of zzso action by zzso of chemically active zzso In the present paper synthesis of highly zzso labeled zzso and zzso derivatives is described starting from both natural zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso suitable for zzso of various zzso base zzso and zzso forms were zzso The stability of the zzso bond under in zzso experimental conditions was zzso The methods of terminal zzso chemical zzso and terminal zzso zzso were applied to zzso zzso equipped with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso a series of new zzso zzso derivatives bearing a free zzso zzso group was zzso
