The effect of zzso on the zzso and unfolding of zzso from shark salt zzso was studied and compared with that of zzso from pig kidney by using differential scanning zzso zzso and activity zzso In 1 zzso zzso at pH 7, the shark zzso zzso rapidly at 20 degrees C, as does the kidney zzso at 42 degrees C (but not at 20 degrees zzso zzso zzso strength by addition of 20 zzso zzso or of 1 zzso zzso or zzso protects both zzso against this rapid zzso As detected by zzso the shark zzso zzso zzso unfolding at lower temperature zzso approximately 45 degrees zzso than does the kidney zzso zzso approximately 55 degrees zzso Both zzso zzso indicate zzso zzso probably associated with different cooperative zzso Whereas the overall heat of unfolding is similar for the kidney zzso in either 1 zzso or 20 zzso zzso components with high zzso temperatures are lost from the unfolding transition of the shark zzso in 1 zzso zzso relative to that in 20 zzso zzso This is attributed to partial unfolding of the zzso due to a high zzso pressure during zzso of zzso samples at low zzso strength, which zzso with zzso zzso zzso of 10 zzso zzso to shark zzso in 1 zzso zzso protects against zzso during zzso of the zzso sample, but incubation for 1 h at 20 degrees C prior to addition of zzso results in loss of components with lower zzso temperatures within the unfolding zzso zzso at zzso concentration therefore afford at least two distinct modes of stabilization, likely affecting separate cooperative zzso The different zzso zzso and zzso temperatures of the two zzso correlate with the respective zzso temperatures, and may be attributed to the different zzso zzso
