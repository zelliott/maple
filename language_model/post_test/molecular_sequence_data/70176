A zzso was isolated from a human kidney zzso zzso library using the rat zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids that was designated zzso zzso et zzso 1993) and exhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso similarities to rat zzso rat zzso rabbit zzso and human zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso agreed with the zzso zzso acid sequence of a major zzso protein zzso from human zzso zzso A second zzso form of zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from the same library and had a deletion of a single zzso zzso thereby extending the reading frame and resulting in a protein of 591 zzso zzso zzso is probably zzso by a rare zzso zzso of zzso since no zzso zzso were uncovered in 15 normal individuals, as determined by a zzso chain reaction zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso yielded a zzso protein having a zzso max of zzso zzso when reduced and zzso with carbon zzso The expressed zzso efficiently zzso zzso of zzso zzso No zzso activity was uncovered toward zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be unstable and not to efficiently metabolize zzso acid, as assessed by both zzso and monkey kidney zzso cell zzso expression zzso These studies indicate that zzso is a major fatty zzso zzso that is expressed in human zzso
