zzso zzso zzso at 500 zzso of two zzso zzso substance P zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso have been obtained in zzso zzso and for zzso also in zzso zzso zzso Complete chemical shift assignments for these peptides were made based on two-dimensional zzso zzso techniques, correlated zzso and total zzso J zzso measurement and nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso were then used to determine the zzso of these peptides in the various zzso Based on the J zzso zzso zzso and temperature zzso of the zzso zzso it is concluded that these two peptides exist in zzso at room temperature as a mixture of zzso that are primarily zzso For zzso in zzso with high zzso content, however, zzso structures are found to be present, and they become quite clear at temperatures between zzso and 280 zzso The variation of the zzso chemical shifts of the C alpha (the secondary zzso with zzso contents corroborates this zzso The zzso and C alpha shifts show that the main zzso region for zzso lies between zzso and zzso The zzso segment zzso is found to be quite flexible, which appears to be quite common for zzso selective zzso
