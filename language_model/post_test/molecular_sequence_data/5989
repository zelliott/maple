V delta 3 usage and zzso expression of V gamma and V delta regions was studied on peripheral T cells with a novel V delta zzso zzso zzso generated against a soluble V gamma zzso delta 3 zzso V delta zzso cells represented the vast majority of V delta zzso delta zzso gamma delta T cells within peripheral blood and zzso zzso No preferential V gamma region expression was noted within V delta zzso cells, but the frequency of V gamma zzso cells was significantly lower among V delta zzso than among V delta zzso or V delta zzso zzso zzso analysis of cultured V delta zzso cells sorted with zzso zzso revealed the presence of T zzso with unusual zzso First, cells carrying two distinct surface zzso zzso recognized by both V delta zzso and V delta zzso zzso were detected in most T cell lines, though at zzso much lower than that of dual gamma zzso indicating that zzso exclusion of delta genes is more tightly regulated than that of gamma zzso Moreover, a significant fraction of V delta zzso cells were recognized by C zzso but not C zzso zzso zzso analysis of V delta zzso zzso clones revealed the presence of V delta zzso alpha C alpha transcripts in all of zzso Given the peculiar location of the V delta 3 gene between the delta zzso J alpha zzso those observations formally demonstrate that zzso of zzso with J alpha elements is not necessarily preceded by a delta zzso J zzso deletion of the delta locus on the same zzso
