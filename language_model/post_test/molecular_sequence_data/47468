We identified a novel human long fatty zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso as a new zzso fusion partner gene in a zzso zzso zzso in a patient with zzso anemia with excess blasts zzso with zzso a patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso and a patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso is expressed in the brain and bone zzso and is highly zzso in man and zzso The resulting zzso fusion transcripts showed an zzso fusion of zzso 1 of zzso to zzso 1 of zzso in the zzso case, an zzso fusion of zzso 1 of zzso to zzso 11 of zzso in the zzso case, and a short zzso fusion of zzso zzso 1 to the 3' untranslated region of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were identified in two of the zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso cases involved the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso of the zzso case involved the 3' portion of the zzso zzso None of the resulting zzso transcripts except for the zzso transcript in the zzso case led to a fusion zzso zzso of the second zzso zzso by zzso was detected in the zzso case by FISH zzso These observations suggest that the disruption of zzso and/or zzso may lead to the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso
