To study the structural basis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a strategy has been developed to generate zzso T cells that are deficient in zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, that express zzso zzso and zzso zzso were treated with low doses of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso This treatment resulted in isolation of a zzso zzso that was unable to express zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso beta zzso led to surface expression of zzso beta and zzso zzso as well as the ability to zzso zzso This finding indicates that the absence of the beta zzso was the sole zzso in zzso responsible for its failure to zzso zzso By zzso zzso with zzso beta zzso several zzso zzso were produced that expressed a zzso that lacked all zzso acids of the zzso zzso These zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a rate comparable to cells expressing zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso is independent of any signals contained in the zzso tail of the beta zzso and raise the possibility that such signals may be entirely contained within the gamma zzso
