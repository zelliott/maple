We have previously demonstrated that the onset of zzso alpha gene zzso is mainly restricted to the J zzso gene in fetal day zzso zzso zzso Now, J zzso zzso from fetal zzso zzso and from day zzso fetal zzso have been isolated and zzso We demonstrate that J zzso is rearranged to the rearranged zzso zzso gene zzso This indicates that the zzso alpha zzso process is initiated in fetal zzso far earlier than previously zzso These zzso have their delta genes still accessible for zzso and therefore, are controlled by the zzso delta zzso zzso zzso another zzso delta specific zzso zzso Our results further suggest that both zzso and the zzso alpha zzso zzso are active at the onset of alpha zzso or zzso the initial zzso of the J alpha locus is controlled by zzso In addition, zzso zzso J zzso gene segments are replaced by secondary alpha zzso indicating that zzso with the early alpha zzso are committed to the zzso zzso
