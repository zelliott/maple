zzso animals, and several branches of zzso zzso use programmed cell death zzso for defense or zzso zzso This argues for a common ancestral zzso system in zzso However, at the molecular level, very few regulatory proteins or protein zzso have been identified as zzso across all zzso zzso zzso A very important goal is to determine which molecular components may be used in the execution of zzso in plants, which have been zzso during evolution, and which are zzso Using zzso zzso we have shown that zzso radiation can induce zzso changes at the cellular level and that a zzso experimental system is relevant to the study of zzso in zzso We report here that zzso induction of zzso required light and that a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced within 30 zzso and peaked at 1 zzso This zzso appears to be related to animal zzso at the zzso level, being insensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso were able to suppress DNA fragmentation and cell zzso These results suggest that a zzso activity and an zzso zzso activity possibly mediate DNA fragmentation during plant zzso induced by zzso zzso We also report that zzso and zzso the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso against zzso zzso could suppress the onset of DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso supporting an involvement of the zzso zzso in this form of the plant zzso zzso
