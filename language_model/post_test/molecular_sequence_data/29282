The zzso finger provides a model for studies of protein structure and zzso Its core contains a zzso zzso zzso adjoining three architectural zzso a zzso an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the consensus zzso is not required for zzso zzso binding but contributes to the zzso of a precise zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso permits zzso zzso Although a zzso structure is zzso structural fluctuations lead to zzso of selected nuclear zzso enhancements and accelerated zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso affinity is maintained by zzso compensation zzso a hidden zzso penalty zzso zzso is balanced by enhanced zzso of association zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso Because the zzso is less well ordered than the zzso domain, the net change in zzso is opposite to the apparent change in zzso zzso By zzso to the thermodynamics of zzso zzso we propose that zzso arises from differences in zzso zzso zzso of zzso among biological sequences suggests an evolutionary constraint on the dynamics of a zzso zzso
