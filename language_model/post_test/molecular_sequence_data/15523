zzso zzso as identified so far, are zzso proteins of zzso that specifically bind and degrade the zzso zzso acid zzso capsules of their zzso The crystal structure solved for the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso revealed a functional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from the folded protein zzso kinetic stability to zzso In zzso zzso the replacement of zzso 911 by zzso prevents zzso and generates an zzso that varies in activity from wild zzso Using soluble zzso as zzso a zzso higher activity was detected while evaluation with immobilized zzso revealed a zzso reduced zzso zzso activity of zzso did not differ from wild type with zzso zzso acid, the minimal zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the presence of the zzso domain in zzso zzso binding to zzso in a similar way as did selective disruption of a zzso binding site in the stalk zzso The improved zzso efficiency toward soluble zzso observed in these zzso can be explained by higher zzso and association zzso whereas zzso an impaired zzso was zzso The fact that zzso is a zzso zzso introduces a new molecular basis to explain capsule degradation by zzso which until now has been regarded as a result of cooperative interaction of zzso zzso Moreover, knowing that release of the zzso domain zzso kinetic stability and zzso conservation of the zzso process can be explained by its importance in zzso zzso
