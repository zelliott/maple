zzso and zzso are members of a family of zzso basic zzso zzso proteins that are fundamental for zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we report that elevated levels of the zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso genes by the zzso regulators zzso and zzso The repression is directed at the basic zzso domain and is zzso through the zzso DNA consensus motif to which these proteins zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso does not affect their ability to bind to zzso zzso specifically zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso but not of other zzso zzso such as the zzso expressed zzso gene products zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso mediates the zzso zzso of muscle cell differentiation by zzso the activity of zzso and zzso The zzso by zzso occurs zzso and presumably affects the zzso process at a step following zzso The regulation of zzso and zzso function by a zzso zzso may partly explain how external signals generated by serum and certain zzso growth factors can be zzso to the nucleus and inhibit zzso factors that are responsible for zzso zzso
