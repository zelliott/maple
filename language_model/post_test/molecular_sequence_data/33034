The zzso import of zzso zzso into zzso occurs through zzso zzso in the outer zzso and inner zzso zzso The high zzso of the protein import process is maintained by specific recognition of the transit zzso of zzso by the coordinate activities of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that zzso of the zzso receptors functions as a component of the mechanism to control access of zzso to the membrane zzso channel of the zzso We show that specific zzso that disrupted zzso zzso in zzso reduced the rate of protein import in transgenic zzso compared with the wild type zzso The zzso did not affect the zzso activities of the zzso Interestingly, these zzso did not decrease the initial zzso binding at the zzso but they reduced the efficiency of the transition from zzso binding to membrane zzso These data indicate that zzso of receptors has a direct role in protein import and support a hypothesis in which zzso interactions participate in the initiation of membrane zzso of zzso zzso as part of the molecular mechanism of zzso protein zzso
