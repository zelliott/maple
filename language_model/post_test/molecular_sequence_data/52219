zzso alpha zzso beta 3 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso involved in cellular adhesive zzso As part of a zzso analysis of this zzso we constructed a zzso designated alpha zzso beta 3 zzso zzso by replacing 6 zzso acids within a putative zzso binding domain of the beta 3 zzso with sequences derived from beta zzso The zzso did not affect the capacity of beta zzso zzso to combine with zzso alpha zzso nor did it cause it to combine with zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso was in a zzso state on Chinese zzso zzso cells as judged by minimal binding of an zzso zzso zzso beta 3, zzso Nevertheless, cells expressing alpha zzso beta zzso zzso spontaneously bound zzso with low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso greater than zzso binding to activated wild type alpha zzso beta 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso also bound zzso zzso zzso zzso with enhanced affinity as measured by the zzso zzso zzso This indicates that the increased affinity for zzso was caused by enhanced interaction of alpha zzso beta zzso zzso with known recognition sequences in zzso Thus, this gain of function zzso zzso zzso binding function, supporting a role for this region of the beta zzso in zzso binding to zzso
