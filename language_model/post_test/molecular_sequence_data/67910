The zzso for activated C zzso zzso zzso of second-generation zzso of zzso zzso was cloned using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and rapid amplification of zzso ends, compared with other species, and then successfully expressed using the zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the full length of the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals the presence of seven zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and nucleus in second-generation zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence has been submitted to the zzso Database with zzso number zzso zzso shared zzso zzso with the published sequence of a zzso protein from zzso zzso at the zzso acid level zzso zzso zzso protein expression was induced using 1 zzso of zzso zzso in zzso at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis showed that the zzso fusion protein existed in zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis showed that compared with the control group, the level of zzso zzso expression in the treatment group was zzso by zzso by zzso zzso The high similarity of zzso to previously described zzso of other organisms, as well as its zzso expression in second-generation zzso induced by zzso suggests that it could play a key role in the signaling event that precedes protein zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso expression also zzso studies on the mechanism of action of zzso on zzso zzso
