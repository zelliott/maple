A new methodology has been developed to assess zzso zzso expression in two South Atlantic Spanish fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso used as pollution zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify by reverse zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso used subsequently to design specific zzso to get the full zzso by rapid amplification of zzso zzso A new zzso has been developed to zzso zzso expression by zzso in an automated DNA zzso The effect of zzso inducing zzso has been used to compare three distinct pollution zzso zzso activity, zzso determination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or Western zzso was inconsistent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity yielded satisfactory results; the higher induction was observed by zzso of zzso to zzso detected with strain zzso of zzso zzso in agreement with the high sensitivity previously described for this zzso The present paper summarizes the current status of our zzso
