Host zzso factors, including human zzso virus zzso zzso T zzso zzso are thought to contribute to the control of zzso type 1 zzso replication and thus delay disease progression in infected zzso Host zzso factors are also likely to influence zzso transmission of zzso from infected mother to zzso In this study, the potential role of zzso in modulating zzso transmission from mother to infant was examined in 11 zzso mothers, 3 of whom transmitted virus to their zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso class zzso zzso responses and viral zzso zzso acid sequence variation were determined in the mothers and their infected zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were derived from each of the zzso pregnant zzso zzso acid zzso within the targeted zzso zzso were more frequently identified in zzso mothers than in zzso mothers, and immune escape from zzso recognition was detected in all three zzso mothers but in only one of eight zzso zzso The majority of viral sequences obtained from the zzso infant blood samples were susceptible to maternal zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso acid sequence variation and escape from zzso recognition occur more frequently in mothers that transmit zzso to their infants than in those who do zzso However, the transmitted virus can be a zzso susceptible form, suggesting inadequate in zzso immune zzso
