To identify the elements that regulate zzso of the mouse gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso we zzso monkey kidney zzso or zzso cells with zzso bearing progressive zzso deletions or an internal deletion in zzso I and measured their transient expression by zzso zzso protection zzso When the zzso genes were tested in the zzso zzso zzso which contains a short segment of the zzso of zzso virus 40, maximum expression was observed with as little as 36 base pairs of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso bearing the zzso I deletion was expressed very zzso However, when the genes were tested in a simple zzso zzso zzso the expression was increased 3- to zzso by sequences between zzso and zzso and the zzso I segment was absolutely required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso interference analyses revealed that a nuclear factor specifically binds to a zzso sequence within this zzso I zzso These results, taken together with other recent findings, indicate that the elements involved in zzso regulation of the zzso gene are distributed over a zzso region that spans the cap zzso The contributions of some of these elements are apparently masked in the presence of zzso virus 40 zzso zzso
