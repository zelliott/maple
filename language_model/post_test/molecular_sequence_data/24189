zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step of nicotine zzso converting zzso into zzso A variety of chemical, zzso and zzso cues have been implicated in its zzso Here we have examined the differential expression of zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso regulatory sequences of four distinct members of the zzso gene family from tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cultures expressing various zzso zzso zzso were examined for their response to treatment with various combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All four zzso gene promoters examined were zzso by zzso although the extent of the induction varied dramatically, with the zzso promoter being the most zzso High zzso levels in the cell growth media zzso zzso zzso expression and inhibited their zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso alone did not result in a significant zzso in zzso zzso However, similar to zzso zzso treatment led to the suppression of zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis of the zzso gene promoter showed that as little as 111 zzso upstream of the zzso start site were sufficient to zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso element zzso at zzso to zzso zzso completely abolished zzso Further zzso studies revealed that in addition to a functional zzso zzso of the zzso promoter also required a zzso region and a zzso zzso located at zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso relative to the start site, zzso A synthetic zzso zzso (4 X zzso zzso fused to a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso the zzso region, zzso and zzso displayed a zzso induction by zzso treatment, whereas when the 4 X zzso zzso was fused to a minimal zzso zzso promoter zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso no induction by zzso treatment was zzso Our results indicate that multiple zzso signal zzso pathways and different zzso regulatory factors are involved in zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso
