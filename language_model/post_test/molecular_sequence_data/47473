The zzso family of zinc finger proteins are zzso regulators with critical functions in lineage differentiation and embryonic zzso Based on structural and expression pattern zzso the zzso proteins have been subdivided into two zzso The first zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso which are all highly expressed in the zzso system, whereas zzso zzso and zzso are present essentially in the heart and zzso We have isolated and functionally characterized the rat zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein with zzso zzso and zzso zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that rat zzso is expressed in a dynamic pattern during embryonic and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso transcripts are most abundant in the heart and decrease dramatically in the zzso zzso in contrast, zzso expression is zzso in the lung and gut during zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins show that zzso has preferential affinity for a subset of zzso elements found on cardiac promoters and zzso activate cardiac gene zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of an zzso domain within the zzso terminal region of zzso that is essential for zzso regulation of target zzso zzso analysis localized zzso to zzso mouse zzso zzso 2 in a zzso linkage group with genes localized to rat zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may have specific downstream targets and that zzso zzso and zzso can only partially substitute for each other in zzso Thus, zzso probably plays a specialized evolutionary zzso role in cardiac zzso
