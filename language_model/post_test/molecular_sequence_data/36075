We have isolated and characterized a gene zzso a novel zzso protein of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the cloned zzso has approximately zzso overall zzso to zzso proteins and approximately zzso zzso to the zzso nuclear proteins zzso ran and zzso zzso zzso to zzso expressed zzso protein detect a zzso zzso zzso in extracts of adult zzso zzso and mature zzso which is absent from immature zzso Increased expression of the native zzso protein occurs when worms are cultured in the presence of zzso growth zzso
