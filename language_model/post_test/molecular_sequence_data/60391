The zzso zzso system zzso zzso receptors to receive and discriminate thousands of different chemical zzso An understanding of how these receptors zzso information about an zzso molecular structure requires a characterization of their zzso zzso We employed an expression cloning strategy to identify a goldfish zzso zzso that is activated by zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso is zzso tuned to recognize basic zzso zzso The zzso is a member of a zzso family of G zzso zzso sharing sequence similarities with the calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso class of zzso zzso The zzso tuning properties of the goldfish zzso acid zzso zzso provide information for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
