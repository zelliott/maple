zzso of the zzso acid sequence of growth zzso hormone zzso with zzso zzso or zzso in position 29 have been zzso by the zzso method, zzso and tested in zzso Except for one zzso all zzso contained zzso zzso in position zzso All contained zzso in order to avoid zzso of zzso Some peptides contained one or more additional zzso or zzso acid zzso in positions 2, 12, 15, 21, 27 and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso times more potent in zzso respectively, than zzso However, if we compare the zzso of peptides II and III zzso of the bovine zzso with those of the zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, the zzso potency was decreased by 50% and zzso respectively, by the incorporation of zzso Our studies indicate that zzso at the zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in position 15 are zzso but potent zzso zzso can result from the combination of zzso in position 29 with other zzso
