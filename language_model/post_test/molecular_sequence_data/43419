The genetic relationships between type 1 zzso circulating in sub-Saharan Africa during the past decade have been investigated by partial zzso sequencing across the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso templates were generated by zzso reverse zzso zzso amplification of the viral zzso using zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso circulating in different geographical regions during different zzso were zzso zzso genetic variation was exhibited by strains within several of these zzso indicative of sustained endemic transmission within individual zzso Two zzso appear to be circulating in Africa at zzso one major zzso which has been in circulation since at least 1980, covers a wide geographical region and includes countries in zzso central and southern zzso Within this zzso are several smaller zzso possibly representing strains in the process of evolving into new zzso The second zzso presently in circulation has been found only in Tanzania and zzso to date, associated with a relatively small number of zzso zzso zzso introduced from the Middle East and the Indian zzso have also recently been in circulation in eastern and central zzso In South Africa, three zzso one unique to the country and the others imported from west Africa and the Middle East, zzso zzso between 1980 and zzso A fourth zzso introduced from countries to the north, displaced the endemic strains and continued to circulate until zzso This study has generated a meaningful overview of the endemic circulation and regional transmission of type 1 zzso throughout sub-Saharan zzso
