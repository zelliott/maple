We screened a zzso zzso zzso expression library with human and rabbit zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso clones that zzso zzso containing zzso arranged repeats which are 6 to 34 zzso acids in zzso The zzso repeats zzso by these zzso varied markedly in zzso copy number, and location relative to the zzso site of the zzso from which they were zzso The repeats were specific for zzso zzso but in each case the sizes of the corresponding zzso and the total number of repeat copies zzso varied considerably among different zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso repeats was not stage zzso One of the zzso repeats occurred in a protein with an Mr of greater than 200,000 and one was in a protein of Mr 75,000 to zzso The frequent occurrence and diversity of these zzso repeats suggested that they may play a role in the ability of the zzso to evade immune destruction in its zzso and zzso zzso but the primary roles of these zzso may be unrelated to the zzso zzso
