We have employed a zzso approach to determine the zzso sequences of the coding region in the last two coding zzso of the zzso group zzso genes from one zzso and one zzso zzso Compared with A1 zzso the zzso zzso has a single zzso substitution zzso at zzso zzso resulting in an zzso acid substitution zzso at zzso acid zzso Compared with B zzso the zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso at zzso 657 and zzso at zzso zzso resulting in an zzso acid substitution zzso at zzso zzso The zzso acid substitution resulting from this zzso zzso is located at the second of the four zzso acid zzso which discriminate human A and B zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso is identical to that of A zzso suggesting the involvement of this zzso acid or its surrounding area for the recognition and/or binding of the donor zzso zzso
