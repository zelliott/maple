We determined the complete zzso sequence of the passion fruit zzso virus zzso isolate zzso from Australia and compared it with that of zzso another Australian isolate of zzso The zzso shared high sequence identity in both the complete zzso sequence and the zzso zzso acid zzso All of the zzso sites of each protein were identical to those of zzso and the sequence identity for the individual proteins ranged from zzso to zzso However, the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso isolate shared only zzso sequence identity with that of zzso and was 177 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso revealed that the zzso end of the original sequence includes an artifact generated by deep zzso
