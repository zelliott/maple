A survey of symbiotic bacteria from zzso grown in high zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to produce a collection of zzso which could be well adapted to the environmental conditions of this region and be used for restoration zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso of 11 zzso species (of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Based on their growth on zzso media, the zzso were classified into three zzso zzso The minimum zzso zzso zzso and the effective zzso that produce 50% mortality identified the patterns of mercury tolerance and showed that 15 zzso were zzso The dynamics of cell growth during incubation with mercury showed that five zzso were unaffected by exposure to zzso zzso under the zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene assigned ten strains to zzso zzso six to zzso zzso two to zzso zzso and one to zzso zzso zzso of host plants and analysis of the zzso genes revealed that most of them were zzso zzso Finally, three zzso were selected for zzso processes with restoration purposes on the basis of their levels of zzso zzso their response to high zzso of this heavy metal, and their genetic affiliation and zzso zzso
