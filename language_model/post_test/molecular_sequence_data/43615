In order to examine whether the viral population is affected by zzso transmission, we analyzed the viral zzso first detected in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso after zzso zzso before virus zzso were zzso and compared them with those in the zzso Three female zzso zzso were zzso zzso and a fourth was zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso The zzso zzso which first appeared in zzso were zzso in the zzso to V2 region of the zzso envelope zzso A comparison of the sequences obtained from each monkey revealed a homogeneous or zzso viral population depending on the infection zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the viral population was zzso and was similar to that in the virus zzso On the other hand, in the zzso zzso zzso single zzso (in two zzso and one zzso with a slight variation (in one zzso were found, but they were different from each other, having no characteristic sequences in the zzso to V2 region in zzso None of the zzso found in the zzso were major zzso in the virus zzso These results suggest that some selective zzso which differs among individuals, restricts the viral population during zzso zzso
