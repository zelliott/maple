Buried water molecules zzso no contact with bulk zzso in 30 zzso zzso zzso protein structures were zzso The average amount of buried water in zzso TM proteins is about the same as for all zzso zzso zzso but it is greater than the average for zzso zzso zzso Buried waters in TM proteins make more polar zzso and are more frequently found zzso zzso than in zzso zzso The distribution of the buried water binding sites across the membrane profile shows that the sites to some extent reflect protein zzso There is also evidence for asymmetry of the sites, with more in the zzso half of the zzso Many of the buried water contact sites are zzso across families of zzso including family members having different zzso This suggests that at least some buried waters play a role in structural zzso zzso zzso which are known to result in zzso TM zzso occur at buried water contact sites at a higher than random frequency, which also supports a stabilizing role for buried water zzso
