Two zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B of the 24 zzso soybean zzso and containing 5 zzso and 1 zzso respectively, of promoter zzso were inserted separately into zzso zzso zzso seeds from five independent transgenic lines, three expressing zzso A and two expressing zzso B, each containing one or two copies of the zzso were zzso in zzso In all five lines, the soybean zzso exhibited the same patterns of zzso and protein zzso as the resident zzso zzso zzso their expression was absolutely zzso and peaked at the zzso stages of zzso zzso The 24 zzso soybean zzso was targeted to and zzso integrated into oil bodies, despite the absence of a soybean partner zzso The soybean protein accumulated in young zzso mainly as a 23 zzso zzso whereas a 24 zzso protein predominated later in zzso The ratio of zzso zzso in the transgenic plants was about zzso to zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso of these relatively high levels of soybean zzso protein did not affect the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that about zzso of the zzso soybean 24 zzso zzso (and the zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso was targeted to oil bodies, with the remainder associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso were associated with a membrane fraction of buoyant density zzso g zzso which partially overlapped with several zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso associated with oil bodies, none of the zzso zzso could be zzso in the presence of protein zzso indicating a possible zzso difference between the two pools of zzso zzso electron zzso studies of transgenic zzso revealed that all oil bodies examined could be zzso with both the soybean or zzso zzso zzso indicating that each oil body contained a mixed population of soybean and zzso zzso A small but significant proportion of both soybean and zzso zzso was located on zzso zzso in the vicinity of oil bodies, but none were detected on the bulk zzso zzso This is the first report of apparent targeting of zzso via zzso to oil bodies in zzso and of possible associated zzso changes in the zzso Although zzso formation per zzso can occur independently of zzso it is proposed that the relative net amounts of zzso and oil accumulated during the course of seed development are a major zzso of zzso size in zzso zzso
