We have zzso a DNA zzso of zzso zzso which includes part of the left zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have identified 19 open reading frames zzso six zzso to known zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nine have similarity with other genes and four exhibit no significant similarity with any known zzso The average size of these zzso seems to be related to their location, the eight zzso nearest the zzso being shorter than the 11 zzso These two groups of genes are separated by a region of zzso zzso devoid of significant zzso One ORF, zzso is a new member of the zzso family, represented once in all zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
