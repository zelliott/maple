zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that functions at an important point of integration for cell death signaling zzso zzso has a structurally unique zzso architecture, including a zzso positioned death domain zzso that is a positive regulator of zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso was observed to zzso readily and could not be prepared in sufficient yield for structural zzso However, zzso could be obtained as a soluble protein in the form of a zzso fusion protein with the B1 domain of zzso protein zzso In contrast to other zzso that adopt the zzso six zzso zzso arranged in a compact fold, the zzso was found to possess surprisingly low regular secondary structure content and an absence of a stable zzso fold, as determined by circular zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we measured the in zzso interaction between zzso zzso zzso and various zzso zzso zzso Despite the low level of structural order, the zzso zzso retained the ability to interact with zzso in a zzso ratio with a K d in the low zzso zzso Only the full-length zzso could bind zzso indicating that the apparent zzso located in the putative sixth zzso of zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso CD analysis revealed that binding of zzso to zzso is not accompanied by a significant change in secondary zzso Taken together our data argue that the zzso when expressed in isolation, does not adopt a classical zzso fold, yet in this state retains the capacity to interact with at least one of its binding zzso The lack of a stable zzso structure for the zzso may reflect either that its folding would be supported by interactions absent in our experimental zzso or a limitation in the structural zzso assignment of the three-dimensional zzso
