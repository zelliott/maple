Cystic zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso The most frequent zzso is the deletion of zzso in the first zzso binding fold zzso It zzso a zzso in the folding of zzso which zzso zzso maturation of zzso zzso of the three-dimensional structure of zzso would help to understand this zzso We present a novel model for zzso built from the crystal structure of bovine zzso zzso zzso This model gives a reasonable interpretation of the effect of zzso on the maturation of the protein and, in agreement with the CD data, leads to reconsideration of the limits of zzso within zzso
