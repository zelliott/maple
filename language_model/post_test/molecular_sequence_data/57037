We have isolated and mapped by zzso in zzso zzso 80 new zzso on the short arm of zzso zzso These markers were isolated from a zzso hybrid, zzso made from a cell line that was zzso for human zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in zzso zzso experiments in which zzso chain reaction products, generated by an zzso zzso primer from zzso DNA, were used for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso map between zzso and zzso while 24 other zzso cluster around bands zzso Three zzso that appeared to map close to the zzso 3 region bearing a zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso cell zzso were analyzed by zzso mapping techniques and zzso to zzso spreads from the zzso cell zzso These 80 zzso will be useful in the zzso of genetic zzso associated with diseases such as small cell lung zzso zzso cell zzso and von zzso zzso
