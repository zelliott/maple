A recently developed concentration and zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso De zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso for the analysis of diluted zzso samples by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso is compared with conventional zzso sample preparation zzso In the procedure developed, zzso zzso beads are added to diluted zzso solutions and act as a zzso zzso zzso concentrated on the added beads are subsequently zzso transferred to the zzso disc and efficiently on target zzso from the beads in a very small volume of an zzso mixture containing the aromatic zzso zzso Using this zzso we show that it is possible to use the totality of in gel protein zzso without negative interference of buffers and zzso that may be present in the zzso zzso This method links zzso zzso analysis more efficiently to zzso gel zzso in the concept of zzso zzso The procedure is illustrated by the identification of a class of zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso of human zzso upon zzso zzso
