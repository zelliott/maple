zzso sensing zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso regulates the expression of the locus of zzso zzso zzso The LEE contains five major zzso named zzso through zzso zzso was previously shown to be activated through zzso and to activate the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso encodes zzso the zzso zzso of all other LEE zzso and has two zzso a zzso promoter zzso and a zzso promoter zzso We have previously reported that zzso acts on zzso and not zzso To identify the minimal region of zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso of the zzso promoter fused to a zzso reporter were constructed in both the zzso and zzso coli K-12 zzso In an zzso background, zzso zzso of zzso can be observed for the entire regulatory region zzso at zzso zzso and ending at zzso zzso In contrast to what occurred in zzso in K-12 there was no zzso zzso of zzso zzso between base pairs zzso and zzso These data indicate that a zzso zzso regulator is required for the zzso of zzso in this zzso We also observed zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso in zzso similar to results of the zzso analysis performed with zzso zzso mobility shift zzso established that zzso directly binds to the region of zzso from zzso zzso to zzso and not to the region from zzso zzso to zzso These studies suggest that zzso activates the zzso of zzso by directly binding upstream of its zzso promoter zzso
