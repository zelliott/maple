The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, contributes to DNA protection during zzso stress and plays a central role in zzso zzso during stationary phase in zzso zzso Genome searches revealed the presence of three zzso zzso within the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes resulted in irregular zzso of spore zzso in a zzso zzso These irregularities are correlated with changes to the spacing between zzso zzso This is the first example of these proteins playing a role in bacterial cell zzso zzso zzso provided evidence for both zzso control of zzso and zzso expression and their zzso to zzso compartments of aerial zzso In addition, various stress conditions induced expression of the zzso proteins in a zzso manner in zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso protective functions in addition to their role during zzso cell zzso Unlike in other bacteria, the zzso zzso zzso proteins are not induced in response to zzso zzso
