zzso belonging to the zzso family play important cellular roles and the key zzso acids zzso in the zzso domain are zzso However, zzso domain zzso are highly variable and demonstrate distinct differences in zzso To address a functional role for the zzso domain, progressive deletions were generated in zzso interacting factor zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso N from zzso coli zzso zzso activity was partially reduced in zzso lacking 4 zzso zzso zzso whereas it was greatly reduced in zzso lacking 10 zzso zzso zzso or zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso increased its ability to resist nutritional and high temperature stress, demonstrating zzso zzso zzso zzso deleted proteins demonstrated greater sensitivity to zzso and bound stronger to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso revealing greater numbers of surface exposed zzso zzso Also, zzso or zzso containing large zzso deletions in the zzso but not smaller zzso were present in high amounts in the zzso fraction of cell extracts probably due to reduced protein zzso Modeling studies, using the crystal structure of zzso coli zzso demonstrated increase in zzso surface area and change in accessibility of several zzso from buried to exposed upon deletion of zzso zzso Together, these studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso repress the surface exposure of zzso zzso enhance protein zzso and zzso activity in two soluble and distinct members of the zzso zzso
