The development of immune tolerance is dependent on the expression of zzso in the zzso and bone zzso during zzso zzso However, not all zzso are expressed in the zzso particularly for proteins that become zzso modified during other biological processes in a zzso We have found that one such zzso zzso the spontaneous conversion of an zzso acid to zzso acid zzso causes ignored zzso to become zzso In order to determine the mechanism for this zzso response, pigeon zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with and without an zzso zzso Each form was zzso with zzso D, an zzso involved in zzso zzso The products of zzso zzso were dramatically different between the two forms of zzso suggesting that cryptic zzso may be revealed to the immune system by natural modifications to zzso This observation also held true if whole zzso protein contained zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso Additionally, AND transgenic zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso proliferated to a greater extent in response to zzso zzso as compared to the normal form of zzso These finding demonstrate the importance of zzso modifications in shaping zzso responses in and the development of tolerance to zzso
