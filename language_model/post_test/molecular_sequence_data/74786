To analyze the potential of zzso interference zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso we delivered zzso zzso zzso of zzso to various life stages of the zzso Three different methods were examined for their potential zzso First, feeding of zzso bacteria that expressed zzso did neither result in zzso changes of zzso zzso nor in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, feeding of such bacteria to zzso zzso zzso the expected zzso zzso of bacteria zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso larvae zzso revealed that the zzso worms took up only a fraction of the bacteria zzso by zzso zzso Second, zzso of zzso failed to transport zzso through the zzso and was lethal to the zzso However, the zzso of adult worms was penetrated by zzso zzso but no systemic spreading was zzso Third, soaking of adult zzso zzso in zzso zzso led to a higher proportion of worms showing symptoms of zzso such as a disintegrated gut and zzso but did not induce reduction of zzso zzso zzso Database analysis revealed that zzso proteins involved in zzso and zzso spread in zzso zzso are missing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas proteins responsible for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Thus, our data indicate that the study of gene function by zzso in zzso zzso is zzso possibly due to deficiencies of genes involved in zzso and zzso
