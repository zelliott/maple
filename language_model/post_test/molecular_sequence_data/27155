Natural grass zzso zzso exhibit a wide variety of zzso zzso characterization of such zzso is essential to improve diagnosis and design appropriate zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso vaccine production is a prerequisite for product safety and zzso Both qualitative and quantitative zzso methods are thus required to monitor and control the huge natural zzso of zzso as well as final product zzso A zzso approach has been set up to investigate in depth the structural zzso of five group 1 zzso originating from distinct grass species zzso o 1, zzso g 1, zzso p 1, zzso p 1, and zzso p zzso Whereas group 1 is the most zzso grass zzso zzso great variations were shown between the various zzso found in these five species using mass zzso with many zzso acid exchanges, as well as variations in zzso zzso level and in main zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated, with up to three consecutive units on the first zzso of zzso o zzso In addition, zzso peptides were identified that might be used for product zzso or individual zzso zzso Lastly, natural or zzso modifications zzso zzso zzso were zzso which might constitute useful indicators of product zzso
