The zzso locus of zzso consists of a zzso gene complex that contains at least two genes required for the recognition and zzso of zzso by the zzso when zzso Here, we report the identification of a third S zzso gene from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso which we designated zzso (for S zzso zzso is a novel gene with an unusual zzso zzso is transcribed from two promoters to produce two complementary zzso zzso one spliced and the other zzso that accumulate in an zzso manner in developing zzso and zzso The sequence of the spliced transcript showed the presence of two open reading frames that predict proteins of 10 and zzso zzso Neither transcript was produced in a zzso zzso zzso strain carrying an zzso zzso indicating that the zzso gene in this strain is zzso Interestingly, sequences related to zzso were not detected in DNA or zzso from plants carrying S zzso other than zzso The zzso specificity of zzso its zzso zzso and its physical linkage to the S locus are properties expected for a gene that encodes a zzso of zzso specificity in zzso
