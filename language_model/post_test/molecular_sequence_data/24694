A search for new members of the zzso zzso repeat zzso family has been done over the coding regions of human zzso from zzso Only 254 zzso sequences contained zzso in coding regions, of which 45 zzso copies were unknown before, including 17 that occurred in translated gene zzso The program developed by the authors has been demonstrated to surpass the zzso program in the search zzso The evolution of the zzso copies located in translated regions of human zzso is zzso
