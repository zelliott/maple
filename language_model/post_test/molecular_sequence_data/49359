zzso is a 50 zzso linear zzso in zzso zzso that contains short (44 zzso terminal zzso repeats and zzso bound terminal zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence is identical to that of the host zzso including the zzso sequence at the border, which is interrupted by an zzso sequence zzso element in zzso zzso of the zzso target sequences of zzso suggests a previous zzso event zzso The 43 putative protein coding sequences contained many involved in replication (including two terminal protein zzso zzso zzso transfer and zzso zzso The terminally located zzso gene zzso was necessary for zzso zzso The two zzso diverge significantly in primary zzso while preserving similar secondary zzso zzso plasmids containing these zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso terminal zzso In addition, two zzso sequences are present near the left zzso The zzso content and zzso or AT skew profiles exhibit complex zzso zzso plus the zzso zzso at the right arm, indicate that zzso has evolved through rounds of exchanges involving at least three zzso
