Earlier studies have demonstrated in zzso mice highly susceptible to zzso disease protective immunity against lethal zzso zzso infection zzso by vaccination with an open reading frame zzso expressed by zzso In our experiments, we used this mouse model to search for other zzso zzso with a similar zzso Fourteen zzso previously determined to be expressed in this zzso stage were individually inserted into a zzso expression zzso containing a zzso sequence that zzso a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso with 13 of the 14 zzso induced specific zzso which recognized the zzso Three of those immune zzso also reacted with zzso and zzso After a lethal challenge with Y strain zzso the vast majority of zzso mice succumbed to zzso In some cases, a significant delay in mortality was zzso Only two of these zzso provided protective immunity against the otherwise lethal infection caused by zzso of the Y or Colombia zzso These zzso zzso members of the zzso family of surface zzso related to the previously described protective zzso zzso surface protein 2 zzso Nevertheless, at the level of zzso recognition, no zzso was observed between the zzso and the previously described zzso from the Y zzso In zzso zzso we observed the presence of zzso related to both proteins expressed by zzso of seven different zzso In conclusion, our approach allowed us to successfully identify two novel protective zzso which we consider interesting for future studies on the immune response to zzso zzso
