A cell culture system that supports the differentiation of male germ cells through zzso is zzso It takes advantage of the properties of a cell line, zzso established from zzso cells of transgenic mice that express the large T protein of zzso virus in the zzso zzso This line exhibits features characteristics of zzso cells, including zzso of the zzso tumor zzso and Steel zzso zzso of the zzso type support the zzso and zzso differentiation in zzso of zzso zzso germ cells into zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso When zzso with zzso cells, zzso cells zzso from immature zzso animals, before the onset of the first zzso generated zzso of zzso cells with the zzso of round zzso and initiated zzso zzso
