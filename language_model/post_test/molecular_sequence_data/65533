zzso a zzso regulator in zzso coli, affects functions such as zzso resistance zzso and zzso Usually an zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso and other acid resistance zzso We found that, in zzso cells grown in LB medium at pH zzso or pH zzso repression of zzso by zzso occurred only in stationary phase and was reduced in the absence of zzso and zzso the main regulators of zzso Moreover, repression of zzso by zzso was greater in the absence of zzso or zzso in exponential phase at pH zzso and in the absence of zzso or zzso in stationary phase at pH zzso In turn, zzso enhanced repression of zzso by zzso and hindered zzso by zzso in stationary phase and also reduced the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso under some zzso As a result of its direct and indirect effects, zzso of zzso prevented most of the induction of zzso expression as cells entered stationary phase and made the cells zzso more sensitive to acid challenge at pH zzso These findings show that repression of zzso by zzso depends on zzso growth phase, and other regulators of zzso and is associated with reduced resistance to acid zzso
