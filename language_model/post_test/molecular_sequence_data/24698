In our previous study, zzso a zzso zzso was found to be an inhibitor of zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso In this work, zzso and seven zzso derivatives were used to zzso the relationship between the structure of these compounds and their zzso of zzso zzso zzso Three of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were found to have an ability to inhibit the zzso zzso activity of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso was 8 zzso for zzso 19 zzso for zzso and 25 zzso for zzso The structural zzso of these zzso suggest that the zzso at C4 and zzso of these molecules may be required for them to act as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was also observed in human zzso zzso zzso cells, while zzso and zzso were inactive at the doses zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso into the zzso binding pocket of zzso zzso bonds and zzso interaction appear to be important in the binding of these zzso to zzso
