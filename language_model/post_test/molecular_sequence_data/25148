Recent studies of colon zzso in humans and zzso induced zzso tumors in zzso have demonstrated selective zzso in the level of zzso in these zzso zzso The exact relationship of these zzso in zzso zzso levels to the zzso transformation process, however, remains zzso In order to clarify this issue, rats were given zzso injections of zzso zzso 20 zzso body zzso or zzso for up to 26 zzso After 10 weeks of zzso treatment, one-half of the animals in each group were also zzso given zzso injections of zzso zzso (20 zzso body zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso until they were zzso Animals were killed after 15 weeks of zzso treatment and zzso levels as well as the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured and compared in rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso of each zzso zzso levels were also assessed in each of these groups after 26 weeks of treatment with this zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, in view of recent studies that have indicated that zzso may influence certain zzso in human zzso zzso cells, tumors from zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso The results of these experiments demonstrated for the first time that: zzso zzso zzso was a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of this agent with zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso and significantly reduced the mean zzso tumor burden, as assessed by total tumor area per zzso produced by this zzso alone; zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed a similar zzso zzso in zzso for both groups zzso zzso zzso zzso however, analysis of the zzso and zzso tumors revealed that in both zzso groups zzso zzso zzso tumors with such zzso were smaller than their counterparts without such genetic zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reduced the average size of tumors, with and without such zzso to a similar zzso
