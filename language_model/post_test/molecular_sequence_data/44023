We report here the zzso and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso associated with DNA zzso alpha from the zzso zzso zzso Earlier, we identified a zzso zzso 3' zzso activity that zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso in a zzso complex zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso 47 zzso zzso was carried out, and the zzso sequence was found to be identical to the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which is also known as zzso zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso The native zzso also had strong zzso zzso activity similar to that observed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso During our studies, we have discovered certain unique features of the mechanism of action of the native zzso zzso Studies presented here indicated that the zzso had specific pause sites during its zzso zzso zzso zzso These pause sites were easily detected with long zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso by the formation of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have further analyzed the mechanism of generation of the pause sites, as they could occur through a number of different zzso zzso of the pause sites with the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso indicated that the pause sites were dependent on the zzso zzso Our analysis revealed that zzso zzso pauses predominantly at zzso rich zzso With zzso as zzso the zzso products formed a continuous zzso with no evidence of zzso The zzso rich DNA sequences are zzso more stable than the zzso rich zzso which may be in part responsible for pausing of the zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso at these zzso
