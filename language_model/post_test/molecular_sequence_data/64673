Alzheimer's disease zzso and Parkinson's disease zzso are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases that occur either in relatively rare, familial forms or in common, sporadic zzso The genetic defects underlying several zzso familial forms of zzso and zzso have recently been identified, however, the causes of other zzso and zzso cases, particularly sporadic cases, remain zzso To gain insights into the zzso mechanisms involved in zzso and zzso we used a zzso approach to identify proteins with altered expression levels and/or zzso modifications in idiopathic zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report that the protein level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso has been linked to an zzso familial zzso is zzso in idiopathic zzso as well as zzso zzso By using a combination of two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso we have identified three human brain zzso zzso a full-length form and two zzso truncated zzso Our zzso analyses reveal that the full-length zzso is a major target of zzso damage in zzso and zzso zzso which is extensively modified by zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies show that prominent zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and that the level of soluble zzso protein is zzso zzso to the number of zzso in zzso zzso Together, these results provide evidence supporting a direct link between zzso damage to the zzso zzso machinery and the zzso of sporadic zzso and zzso
