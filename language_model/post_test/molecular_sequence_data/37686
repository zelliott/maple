zzso zzso zzso was zzso from cell extracts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso has an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso as estimated by gel zzso and consists of two identical zzso of 46 zzso as deduced by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and the gene zzso The zzso displayed a broader zzso specificity than zzso from zzso sources and exhibited significant activity with zzso zzso and zzso with either zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso zzso activity was found in the pH range of zzso 5 to zzso and at a temperature of over 95 degrees zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was determined and enabled the identification of the gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso was zzso The pH and temperature zzso molecular mass, and kinetic parameters of the zzso were indistinguishable from those of the native zzso from zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso formation were 41 and 33 zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that the zzso is not biased toward either the formation of zzso or zzso Northern analysis identified a single zzso transcript for the zzso zzso In addition, both the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso transcripts appear to be zzso at the zzso level, because the expression of both genes was induced when the cells were grown on zzso The coordinated control found for the zzso and zzso genes is in good agreement with these zzso acting in a concerted manner to form an electron sink in zzso zzso
