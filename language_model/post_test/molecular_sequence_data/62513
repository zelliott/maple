The zzso pathogen zzso zzso is zzso resistant to zzso antibiotics due to the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is therefore structurally zzso to proteins that catalyze zzso transfer to diverse zzso zzso This study reports the investigation of several potential zzso zzso that are present in the zzso active site and also zzso in many zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with characterization of the zzso site zzso gave valuable information about the roles of these zzso acids in zzso transfer zzso More specifically, zzso kinetic analysis of protein activity, zzso zzso effects, pH studies, and zzso resistance profiles were all used to assess the roles of zzso and zzso as potential active site zzso zzso as a general acid, and the importance of the zzso zzso group of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is not involved in general base zzso but is instead critical for the proper positioning and orientation of zzso zzso in the active zzso Similarly, zzso is also not acting as the active site base, with pH studies revealing that this zzso must be zzso for optimal zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found not to affect the chemical step of zzso and our results were not consistent with this zzso acting as a general zzso zzso the zzso zzso group of zzso is implicated in important interactions with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the work described here provides important information regarding the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso that allows us to contrast our findings with those of other zzso proteins and to demonstrate that these zzso use a variety of chemical mechanisms to accelerate zzso zzso
