In prion diseases, zzso a widely expressed zzso is transformed into a zzso form called zzso which is in itself zzso zzso directed against zzso have been shown to inhibit zzso to zzso conversion in zzso and protect in zzso from zzso Other zzso with potential to eliminate zzso cells are zzso T cells directed against zzso peptides but their ability to protect or to induce deleterious zzso reactions is not zzso The natural tolerance to zzso makes difficult to raise efficient zzso zzso To break zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso or control Ad were administered to zzso mice by direct injection or by transfer of zzso zzso cells zzso Control zzso zzso from zzso mice zzso zzso were also used for zzso zzso but not direct administration of zzso zzso zzso that bound to zzso native zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells were low and in zzso zzso activity only targeted cells strongly expressing zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso T cell zzso was similar in the brain of vaccinated and zzso zzso mice suggesting the absence of zzso zzso Early zzso zzso replication was strongly inhibited ten weeks post infection and mean survival time prolonged from 209 days in zzso zzso mice to 246 days in mice vaccinated with zzso expressing the zzso The efficacy appeared to be associated with zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso
