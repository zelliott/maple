zzso manage the adaptation to zzso pH through the zzso zzso factor, a key component of the pH regulatory zzso zzso regulates the production of various secondary zzso in zzso zzso In the important cereal pathogen zzso zzso the production of zzso is induced only under zzso pH zzso Here, we examined the role of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso on the regulation of zzso zzso An zzso deletion zzso was constructed in zzso zzso which showed a reduced development under neutral and alkaline zzso increased sensitivity to zzso and an earlier zzso gene induction and toxin zzso at zzso zzso A strain expressing the zzso zzso active form of zzso exhibited a strongly zzso zzso gene expression and reduced toxin zzso at zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso regulates zzso gene expression and toxin production in zzso zzso
