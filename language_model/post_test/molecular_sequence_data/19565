zzso zzso differ from zzso in their fat deposition and zzso The gene for zzso fatty zzso protein zzso or zzso has not been identified thus far in zzso We have determined the zzso sequence and defined the structure of a fatty zzso protein gene zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso by zzso zzso showed highest identity to the zzso or zzso from Antarctic zzso and the putative zzso from other zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis clustered the zzso zzso with all Antarctic fish zzso and putative zzso from other zzso in a single zzso and then with the zzso zzso in an extended zzso zzso zzso was assigned to linkage group 19 at a distinct locus from zzso A number of closely linked zzso genes surrounding the zzso zzso locus were found to be zzso with human zzso The zzso zzso transcripts showed sequential distribution in the developing eye, zzso and brain vascular system, from the middle zzso stage to 48 h zzso whereas zzso zzso was located widely in the embryonic and/or zzso central nervous system, zzso zzso zzso and liver from middle zzso to 5 days zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso suggests distinct functions for these two zzso genes in zzso zzso
