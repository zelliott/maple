zzso zzso zzso comprise the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso reaction is essential for the zzso of zzso which are necessary for production of cellular zzso This is the most widely distributed zzso being present in all biological zzso From one kingdom to another the primary zzso acid sequence identity usually ranges between 30 and zzso In this zzso we describe the conservation of specific zzso acids and the various zzso zzso and indicate the roles that they may play in the zzso of this zzso The prediction of the roles of different zzso acids in zzso is based on high resolution zzso structures of these zzso which set the stage for detailed understanding of the zzso reaction and its selective, zzso zzso which is crucial for the design of potent zzso for treatment of infection by zzso zzso
