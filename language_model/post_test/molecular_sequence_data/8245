zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the visual zzso zzso zzso activates the protein for zzso of the G protein zzso Three of these zzso have been shown to cause two different human zzso zzso of zzso and zzso results in complete night blindness, and zzso of zzso results in the degenerative disease zzso zzso We show here that the zzso not only zzso activate zzso but are also zzso activated for zzso by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso are shown to bind tightly to the zzso protein zzso in a reaction that zzso the activity toward zzso Thus the same zzso that result in zzso zzso of zzso also result in zzso zzso by zzso zzso and binding of zzso to inhibit the zzso This implies that the same zzso change may be responsible for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso It also suggests that zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso results indirectly from the activated state of the zzso perhaps as a consequence of zzso and persistent binding of zzso
