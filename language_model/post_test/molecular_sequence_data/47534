Sexual reproduction is a salient aspect of plants, and elaborate structures, such as the flowers of zzso have evolved that aid in this zzso Within the flower the corresponding sex zzso the zzso and the zzso form the male and female zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, despite their central role for sexual reproduction little is known about the mechanisms that control the establishment of these important zzso Here we present the identification and molecular characterization of the zzso zzso gene in the flowering plant zzso zzso In several zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso fail to zzso It indicates that zzso plays an early and central role in the development of both types of zzso and that the mechanisms controlling these processes share a crucial zzso In addition, zzso may have an early function during male and female zzso as zzso The evolutionary aspects of these findings are zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of unknown zzso However, based on sequence analysis we speculate that zzso is a nuclear protein and possibly a zzso zzso
