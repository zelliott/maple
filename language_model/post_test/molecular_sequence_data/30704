DNA zzso from zzso and zzso which bear zzso and zzso repeats respectively, can support zzso formation in zzso zzso by serving as zzso for the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, we showed that linear plasmids with 108 base pairs of zzso DNA zzso efficiently acquired zzso whereas plasmids containing zzso base pairs of zzso DNA also promoted zzso formation, but with reduced zzso Although many of the zzso zzso on these plasmids underwent zzso with a zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso was not zzso We now report the sequence of the zzso ends from the linear zzso The results provide strong evidence for a novel zzso process involving a gene conversion event that requires little zzso occurs at or near the boundary of zzso and zzso DNA, and resembles the zzso process involved in zzso T4 DNA zzso
