zzso zzso involves the participation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso zzso has the hallmarks of an zzso protein that binds to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas two forms of zzso at 120 and 130 zzso have been identified zzso a zzso zzso only the lower molecular weight zzso has been cloned zzso zzso or zzso In this study, we report the isolation of an alternative zzso of zzso with a molecular mass of 130 zzso zzso that has the same structure as zzso except for an zzso of 46 zzso acids toward the zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso share an ability to bind to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to act as zzso for zzso and to be expressed in the zzso and nucleus of zzso zzso were noted between the zzso in the efficiency of binding to zzso and in the preferential expression of zzso in mature zzso When zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso caused a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso in zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso gene to human zzso 5 at position zzso zzso therefore represents a novel zzso of zzso protein that can zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 production in mature zzso
