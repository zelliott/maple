The New World zzso zzso virus zzso is the zzso agent of Argentine zzso fever zzso which is associated with high morbidity and significant zzso Several zzso strains of zzso have been zzso and a highly attenuated vaccine strain zzso zzso was generated and used to zzso the human population at zzso The identification and functional characterization of viral genetic zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso would contribute to the zzso of the mechanisms contributing to zzso and the development of better vaccines and zzso To this end, we used reverse zzso to rescue the zzso Romero and the attenuated zzso zzso strains of zzso from cloned zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Romero zzso had the same growth properties and zzso features in cultured cells and in zzso as their corresponding parental zzso zzso with zzso caused zzso zzso in guinea zzso whereas zzso zzso infection was zzso and provided protection against a lethal challenge with zzso zzso Romero and zzso zzso zzso zzso L and zzso required for virus zzso replication and gene expression were zzso in a zzso rescue zzso These findings support the feasibility of studies aimed at determining the contribution of each viral gene to zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we rescued zzso zzso viruses with three segments that efficiently expressed foreign genes introduced into their zzso This finding opens the way for the development of a safe zzso zzso zzso
