The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a target of the zzso zzso immunity and thus a malaria vaccine zzso Although variation in the zzso domain is limited among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associations between the zzso domain and other parts of zzso are suggested to be involved in immune evasion by allowing competitive binding of protective and zzso zzso directed to their zzso which are zzso in close proximity but separated at the primary zzso Since zzso zzso can account for the major zzso of the zzso zzso we examined whether linkage zzso occurs between zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso the latter zzso the zzso zzso From 184 Thai field zzso we selected 69 zzso with a single zzso type in six variable blocks of zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso All the zzso showed no evidence of zzso in blocks 6 to 16, whereas zzso was apparent in blocks 2 to zzso zzso of the zzso revealed two potential zzso sites in block zzso Strong linkage zzso was seen between zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso The strength of this zzso did not correlate with distance between zzso We discuss the possible role of zzso selection on particular association types zzso of zzso
