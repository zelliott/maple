The human zzso blood group system currently contains 35 zzso determined by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso Type II zzso zzso The zzso zzso was initially cloned through screening of a zzso zzso however, direct zzso acid sequencing of most of the zzso zzso has not been zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso contains two potential zzso start sites, which result in differences in the zzso zzso 

zzso extracts were isolated from human red blood cell zzso and were zzso with zzso The resulting peptides were subjected to liquid zzso mass zzso allowing resolution of peptides from the zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso were isolated and zzso that zzso to the upstream zzso start site predicted by the full zzso zzso No evidence of internal translation initiation at zzso 20 was zzso 

These findings identify the zzso start site and define the full zzso tail of the human zzso zzso
