A zzso zzso long DNA fragment, zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library and was found to contain regions specific for this bacterial zzso For detection and identification of zzso zzso two zzso derived from the zzso sequence were used as zzso in zzso chain reaction tests on zzso zzso from 38 zzso and from 10 zzso zzso A specific, zzso zzso long DNA zzso was amplified only when zzso zzso DNA was used as a zzso The detection limit of the amplification reaction was as low as zzso zzso DNA, which is the equivalent of one zzso zzso zzso
