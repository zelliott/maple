The zzso zzso current zzso which zzso spike frequency adaptation in cortical zzso cells, can be modulated by multiple zzso and probably contributes to state control of the zzso by ascending zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso of this current by zzso zzso and zzso is zzso by protein zzso A in zzso zzso zzso Two specific protein zzso A zzso zzso and Walsh zzso suppressed the effects of these zzso on zzso and spike frequency zzso The effects of the zzso zzso analog zzso were also zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had full zzso zzso application of protein zzso A zzso zzso or a zzso inhibitor zzso the effects of zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso by protein zzso
