The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli is involved in all aspects of DNA zzso zzso repair, and zzso In solution, the protein exists as a zzso of zzso zzso As it binds tightly and zzso to zzso DNA, it has become a zzso model protein for studying zzso acid zzso The sequences of the gene and protein are known, and the functional zzso of zzso interaction, DNA zzso and zzso interactions have been zzso by zzso analyses of various zzso The zzso gene has three zzso one of which is zzso because it lies only two zzso from the zzso site of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response, however, does not lead to significant increases in zzso zzso The binding protein has several functions in DNA zzso including enhancement of zzso zzso by DNA zzso prevention of zzso of the single strands and protection from zzso zzso organization and stabilization of replication origins, zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement of replication zzso enhancement of zzso zzso and promotion of zzso binding to the zzso zzso coli zzso is required for zzso mismatch repair, induction of the zzso response, and zzso zzso During zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso to find Chi sites, promotes binding of zzso zzso and promotes strand zzso
