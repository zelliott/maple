Global brain zzso causes cell death in the zzso region of the zzso 3-5 days after zzso The biological zzso leading to such delayed zzso damage has not been zzso By using differential display analysis, we examined expression levels of zzso zzso isolated from zzso extracts prepared from rats exposed to global zzso and found an zzso transcript, clone zzso Northern zzso analysis of clone zzso showed an approximately zzso increase in the zzso brain at 24 h after zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends of clone zzso revealed a family of genes zzso base zzso that had the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that the elevated expression of this gene was localized predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso The level of expression in the zzso region decreased dramatically between 24 and 72 h after zzso The elevated expression of clone zzso was not observed in zzso zzso rats treated with the compound zzso an zzso known to exert zzso in rats subjected to global zzso Since delayed zzso death has the characteristics of zzso we speculate that clone zzso may be involved in zzso We examined the expression level of clone zzso in in zzso models of zzso using zzso zzso zzso that were subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment and found that clone zzso transcripts were induced in zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso stimulation but not zzso zzso
