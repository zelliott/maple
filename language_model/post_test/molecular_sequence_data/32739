Recently, common zzso on human zzso zzso were found to be associated with prostate cancer zzso While conducting a zzso association study in the Cancer zzso zzso of zzso project with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso study zzso cases and zzso controls of European zzso we identified a new association at zzso with an independent effect on prostate cancer zzso The most significant signal is 70 zzso zzso to the previously reported zzso zzso but shows little evidence of linkage zzso with zzso A combined analysis with four additional studies zzso zzso cases and zzso zzso confirms association with prostate cancer for zzso in the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso remained significant in a joint analysis after adjusting for the other zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso combined with compelling evidence for a zzso hotspot between the two zzso indicate the presence of at least two independent zzso within zzso that contribute to prostate cancer in men of European zzso We estimate that the population attributable risk of the new zzso marked by zzso is higher than the locus marked by zzso zzso versus zzso
