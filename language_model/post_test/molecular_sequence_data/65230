zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is expressed primarily in colon zzso where it may function in host defense and growth zzso We investigated factors responsible for its zzso regulation in zzso and its expression in zzso Analysis of promoter zzso in the zzso cell line identified a complex element between zzso and zzso critical for promoter zzso This element contained four sites that bound zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with varied zzso One site also bound the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso whereas another also bound zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also bound to this region in the intact zzso of zzso zzso These factors demonstrated zzso when zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in human colon zzso cells along the zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso expression was seen in the zzso of normal as well as zzso mice, with significantly higher levels in zzso compared with zzso zzso The expression zzso of zzso zzso in the colon paralleled those of zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso factors play a key role in zzso regulation in zzso
