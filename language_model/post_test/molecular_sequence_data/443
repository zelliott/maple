zzso transmission depends on the efficient loading of zzso into synaptic zzso by zzso neurotransmitter zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for loading zzso into zzso and maintaining normal zzso In an effort to understand the regulatory mechanisms associated with zzso we have embarked upon a systematic search for interacting zzso zzso pull-down zzso combined with mass zzso led to the identification of the zzso heat shock zzso protein zzso as a zzso interacting zzso zzso experiments in brain tissue and zzso cells confirmed this zzso A direct binding was observed between the zzso zzso and the third zzso loop of zzso as well as, a region containing the zzso binding and the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso with zzso synaptic zzso obtained from a zzso zzso suggesting that this interaction occurs at the synaptic zzso zzso The functional significance of this novel zzso interaction was examined by performing zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso synaptic zzso from brain zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso This effect was zzso by the closely related zzso zzso In contrast, zzso activity was not altered in the presence of previously zzso zzso or zzso as well as the unrelated zzso zzso confirming the specificity of the zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso was sufficient to inhibit zzso activity in synaptic zzso Our results suggest an important role for zzso in zzso function and zzso
