The zzso zzso factor zzso has been zzso by zzso and DNA affinity zzso and its DNA binding and zzso properties have been zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to two distinct zzso sites within the zzso promoter zzso One binding site consists of zzso motifs 2 and 3 within the zzso repeats zzso zzso and the other consists of sequences centered 44 zzso upstream of the major late initiation site, zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso within the zzso site, when zzso strongly interfere with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso but not the zzso between the two directly repeated zzso motifs dramatically reduces the binding affinity of zzso for the zzso Thus, zzso appears to recognize directly repeated zzso zzso when their zzso distance is 10 zzso The zzso and zzso sites share limited sequence zzso Only half of the zzso site contains a short zzso sequence zzso to the zzso zzso However, the binding affinity of zzso to the two sites is zzso zzso activates zzso from the zzso late promoter in zzso from initiation site zzso via its binding to the template zzso
