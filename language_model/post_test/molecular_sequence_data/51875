The zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso controls cell fates and pattern formation in the zzso nervous system and zzso of zzso zzso Its expression is controlled at the levels of transcription, alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso units extend over 103 zzso and produce zzso different zzso We have compared the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine which structural features are zzso and therefore may be important to the zzso zzso The overall gene structures are zzso There are many zzso sequence blocks throughout the large zzso at least 15 zzso upstream of the first promoter, and at least 3 zzso downstream of the last zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence conservation around alternative zzso sites indicates that alternative protein coding forms may also be zzso zzso coding potential is perfectly zzso around the zzso zzso well zzso in the zzso region, and more variable in the zzso The large size of the zzso gene may reflect a large number of control elements necessary for appropriate zzso protein zzso The conservation of transcript complexity suggests functional requirements for the different protein zzso
