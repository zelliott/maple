We exploited the mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso to develop a novel screening method to identify zzso zzso The zzso zzso is activated by limited zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso this domain to zzso a new zzso zzso which then functions as a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso to the body of the zzso to trigger zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can also donate the zzso zzso zzso to activate nearby zzso zzso We zzso this ability by zzso a zzso zzso zzso which displayed the zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing random zzso in place of the native zzso zzso together with target receptors in zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso of the target zzso were isolated by zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso itself zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Surprisingly, the latter zzso was quite active at the zzso zzso zzso even without zzso and its zzso form, zzso was more potent than the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to identifying novel zzso zzso for targets of pharmacological interest, this method might be used to discover zzso for orphan zzso It also suggests a possible evolutionary path from zzso to zzso zzso
