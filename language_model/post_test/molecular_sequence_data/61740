Using more than one approach to characterizing functions of unknown zzso we now present in zzso zzso some level of function information for zzso of zzso coli K-12 zzso A new approach that has yielded new information zzso assigning content of structural zzso and their functions to zzso zzso In addition, some earlier methods have been further refined to provide more meaningful zzso The process of identifying and separating zzso or fused proteins into component zzso has been zzso As a result, groups of zzso zzso proteins have been zzso Experimental information from recent literature on previously unknown genes has been zzso We now use a rich system of characterizing cell roles which accents the fact that many proteins play more than one cellular role and therefore carry more than one designation from our detailed catalog of roles, zzso
