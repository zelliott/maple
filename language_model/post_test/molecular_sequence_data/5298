In the developing nervous system of zzso cells in each zzso cluster choose between neural and zzso cell zzso The zzso genes mediate the zzso communication process zzso one cell adopts the neural cell fate and prevents other cells in the cluster from becoming zzso In the absence of zzso gene function, most, if not all of the cells become zzso big brain is a zzso gene that encodes a protein with sequence similarity to known channel zzso It is unique among the zzso genes in that previous genetic studies have not revealed any interaction between big brain and the other zzso zzso Furthermore, the neural zzso in big brain zzso zzso is less severe than that in zzso zzso for other zzso zzso In this paper, we show by zzso zzso that zzso is expressed in zzso that give rise to neural precursors and in other zzso that are affected by loss of zzso gene zzso By zzso zzso we found that zzso is associated with the plasma membrane and concentrated in zzso zzso junctions as well as in small zzso zzso Using mosaic analysis in the adult, we demonstrate that big brain activity is required autonomously in zzso precursors to prevent neural zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso expressed big brain acts zzso with zzso expressed Delta and zzso providing the first evidence that big brain may function by zzso the activity of the zzso zzso These results are consistent with zzso acting as a channel protein in zzso cluster cells that adopt the zzso cell fate, and serving a necessary function in the response of these cells to the lateral zzso zzso
