zzso factor producing zzso zzso are fusion proteins consisting of a zzso functionality in the zzso and a zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso It was shown that they are responsible for the production of oxidized fatty acids that play a pivotal role in the control of zzso colonization of plant and zzso zzso The similarity of the primary structure of the single zzso to various zzso zzso zzso and functional conservation of these zzso activities was the basis for prediction of the zzso zzso of the single zzso of a zzso zzso zzso We were able to predict a putative zzso binding pocket in the zzso domain of the zzso and support this finding by zzso zzso With the proposed zzso binding mode all known zzso of oxygen zzso are in a reasonable spatial arrangement for zzso Additionally, we could identify an zzso and show its involvement in zzso binding by kinetic analysis of the respective zzso While zzso position in the zzso domain is well zzso our results indicate that the zzso binding to the zzso domain is rather zzso zzso an zzso zzso within the zzso is shown to be involved in zzso and promotes a shortcut of the typical zzso reaction zzso Taken together, the results presented here exemplify that fatty acids are oxidized in all zzso of life by structural and functional highly zzso zzso
