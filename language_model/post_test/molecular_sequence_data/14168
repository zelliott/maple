The groundwater contaminant zzso zzso is transformed by several zzso zzso but only a few of these, including zzso zzso strain zzso can metabolize the compound as a sole carbon and energy zzso However, nothing is yet known about the genetic basis of zzso zzso In this study, we used a zzso to study differential expression of genes in strain zzso grown on zzso zzso (a previously identified intermediate of zzso zzso or zzso Of eight zzso zzso gene clusters carried by the strain zzso zzso only the zzso gene cluster located on zzso zzso was zzso with zzso relative to zzso zzso genes for putative zzso zzso an zzso zzso and an alcohol zzso were also induced during growth with zzso With both zzso and zzso a zzso gene cluster zzso a putative zzso zzso was zzso as were zzso genes related to zzso metabolism through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in cell extracts from cells zzso with zzso and in zzso zzso strain zzso cells expressing the putative strain zzso zzso zzso gene further demonstrated the role of zzso metabolism in the degradation of zzso Finally, we used zzso zzso zzso acid zzso analysis to provide additional evidence that zzso of zzso enter central metabolism as zzso compounds, likely as zzso The zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso helps to explain how zzso is zzso as a sole carbon and energy source for strain zzso
