zzso transfer particle zzso is a zzso very zzso zzso known to catalyze the transfer of lipids between a variety of zzso including both insects and zzso zzso the zzso and regulation pathways of zzso in detail has not been possible due to a lack of information regarding the zzso Here, we zzso the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences for three zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The three zzso proteins of the zzso are coded by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to be generated by zzso zzso of the precursor zzso zzso zzso of zzso secondary structure within zzso are similar to Homo sapiens zzso B zzso and insect zzso The zzso gene is a novel member of the zzso zzso transfer protein gene zzso zzso has a putative zzso juvenile zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes was synchronized and both genes were primarily expressed in the fat body at the stage corresponding to increased zzso transport zzso We are now in a position to study in detail the zzso role of zzso and its zzso and zzso
