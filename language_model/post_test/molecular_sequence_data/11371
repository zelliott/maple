A zzso proximity zzso zzso has been developed to measure binding of alpha 5 beta 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso This zzso zzso an zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso to simultaneously capture alpha 5 beta 1 from a cellular zzso and couple the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso beads for detection of zzso zzso The zzso does not require prior zzso of alpha 5 beta 1 nor physical separation of bound and free zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso human alpha 5 zzso zzso zzso were used as a source of alpha 5 beta 1 zzso zzso Using the zzso beta 1 zzso zzso zzso to capture alpha 5 beta 1 from a zzso cell zzso this zzso zzso allowed measurement of specific zzso binding as defined by displacement by the zzso containing zzso zzso or the zzso alpha 5 zzso zzso zzso values for displacement of zzso binding by zzso and the novel zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to alpha 5 beta 1 from zzso human melanoma cells was also measured using zzso beta 1 zzso This method should be generally useful to measure zzso zzso binding to receptors that are difficult to zzso
