To establish a low-cost, convenient and accurate multiplex quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso technique to detect the five common zzso in Chinese patients with zzso 

zzso and zzso for 5 common zzso of deafness zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso were designed and zzso The technique for those zzso was established, and the reliability of the technique was tested in 98 patients with impaired hearing and 30 children with normal hearing, who were randomly selected from the zzso in Children's Hospital of zzso zzso The subjects were detected by zzso and direct DNA sequencing of zzso products, following a zzso zzso Finally the results from the two methods were zzso 

The results revealed 48 cases carried two zzso 31 cases carried zzso zzso in the 98 deaf children, and 3 had zzso zzso in 30 normal zzso These results were consistent with that from DNA zzso No false positive and false negative result was zzso 

The zzso technique established in this study is of low-cost, zzso zzso high sensitivity and high zzso It is suitable for large-scale detection and preventive diagnosis of zzso in zzso
