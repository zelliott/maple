The zzso zzso includes numerous species with varied host associations, including several that zzso zzso Development of a molecular diagnostic method capable of detecting the diverse repertoire of zzso species while maintaining zzso specificity has been a zzso We developed a novel real-time zzso zzso targeting a zzso region of the zzso gene of zzso and demonstrated specific amplification in over 30 zzso species, subspecies, and zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences was sufficient to discriminate zzso species and provided zzso data consistent with that of zzso a commonly used gene for zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we identified zzso DNA in zzso and zzso of blood specimens from elk in Wyoming and cattle in the Republic of Georgia, zzso zzso analysis of a subset of zzso from elk specimens revealed a cluster most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso from cattle were identified as zzso zzso both zzso species commonly found in wild and domestic zzso Considering the widespread geographic distribution and zzso potential to a variety of zzso this zzso may be an effective diagnostic method for identification of zzso infections in humans and have utility in zzso surveillance zzso
