The amounts of lens zzso derived from the delta zzso and delta zzso genes of the chicken were determined by primer extension experiments using zzso synthetic zzso The primer extended products were zzso to establish the identity of the resulting zzso The results indicated that most of the zzso zzso in the zzso embryonic lens contained transcripts derived from the delta 1 zzso zzso however, about zzso of the extended products were derived from delta 2 zzso Although not zzso the primer extension experiments suggested that the delta zzso 2 zzso ratio may differ in the lens fiber cells during development between 6 days of zzso and 3 weeks after zzso These data provide the first demonstration for the presence of delta zzso zzso in the chicken lens and raise the possibility that the two linked, extremely similar zzso genes are zzso regulated during zzso
