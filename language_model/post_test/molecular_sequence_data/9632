zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso gene expression requires specific cellular factors in addition to the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso element zzso We developed a functional zzso based on zzso zzso in zzso to identify these cellular zzso Here, we describe the zzso and molecular cloning of zzso a nuclear protein that is associated with the human zzso zzso II zzso and is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso contains an extensive zzso and zzso repeat that is found in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso trans zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso of a zzso zzso protein specifically and dramatically decreased zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso strongly suggesting a role for zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that both zzso and zzso associate with the zzso zzso II zzso Furthermore, we found that functional zzso associates with the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso do zzso Thus, we propose that zzso action is zzso via an zzso zzso II zzso that contains zzso
