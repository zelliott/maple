Fetal liver zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that was identified in zzso cells and populations of cells enriched in zzso zzso To characterize the interaction of zzso with potential zzso the zzso zzso domain was genetically fused to an alkaline zzso (AP) zzso A soluble zzso for zzso was identified in the zzso of numerous zzso cell lines by zzso with the zzso fusion zzso This zzso was shown by zzso sequencing to be vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso fusion proteins can thus be used to identify soluble zzso as well as zzso zzso and this approach is therefore likely to be widely zzso to many types of orphan zzso The zzso soluble zzso was also found to bind to cell surfaces, showing two apparent classes of binding site with different zzso This interaction could be reconstructed by introducing a zzso expression zzso into zzso These results indicate that zzso presented at the cell surface can bind to the zzso zzso and could mediate a direct zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein was also found to bind zzso zzso that zzso binding by the zzso zzso may involve a three way interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell surface zzso
