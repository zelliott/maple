We report the cloning of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso gene belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso proteins and shows the highest degree of sequence similarity to the mouse and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso is transcribed in the zzso after mid zzso transition zzso and three transcripts of 3, 4 and 6 zzso are detected throughout zzso zzso zzso is localized in the animal pole of the late zzso stage and higher levels of zzso transcripts are detected in the marginal zone at the onset of zzso In later zzso zzso transcripts are found in neural crest cells, eyes, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso can be zzso by zzso and zzso in animal and vegetal cap zzso zzso of the dominant negative zzso zzso zzso in animal caps and zzso blocks zzso transcription, arguing that the expression of this zzso gene requires active zzso zzso The spatial overlap of zzso and zzso expression zzso supports the idea that zzso zzso could be a marker for regions with active zzso signaling in the zzso
