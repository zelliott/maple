We have studied two related proteins that contain a repeated zzso acid motif zzso to the zzso type 1 repeats of zzso zzso Complete sequence analysis revealed no other similarities with zzso but identified unique signal zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We named these proteins zzso and zzso due to the novel combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence identity between zzso and zzso is zzso zzso yet transcript distribution revealed zzso patterns of expression in zzso and cultured cell zzso To characterize these proteins zzso we isolated full-length zzso produced zzso zzso and generated zzso to the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso represent single copy zzso which zzso zzso and zzso processed zzso zzso proteins suppressed zzso growth zzso zzso in the cornea pocket zzso and inhibited vascular zzso growth zzso zzso in the zzso membrane zzso zzso of vessel growth in both zzso was considerably greater than that zzso by either zzso or zzso on a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso specific response, zzso and zzso were shown to inhibit zzso cell zzso but not zzso or smooth muscle zzso We propose that zzso and zzso represent a new family of proteins with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The distinct distribution of each gene product suggests that each has evolved distinct regulatory mechanisms that potentially allow for fine control of activity during distinct zzso and pathological zzso
