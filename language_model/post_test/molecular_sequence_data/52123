zzso acid zzso in variable regions of the zzso zzso zzso can alter zzso zzso however, relatively little is known about the extent of zzso variation in human zzso coding zzso In the present studies, coding region variation in the human zzso V beta zzso gene was examined in zzso Virtually the entire V beta zzso coding region was screened for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Four zzso were identified in a sample population of 90 unrelated people from diverse genetic zzso Three of the zzso were common, with estimated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that variation between the zzso was confined to three zzso differences in zzso 24, 31, and 45; none of these changes altered the zzso acid zzso No evidence for other coding region differences in this gene were zzso This analysis suggests that coding region variation in V beta zzso is zzso and zzso acid sequence is highly zzso
