In an effort to explore the role of zzso clusters on the cold adaptation of zzso we designed point zzso aiming to alter the distribution of zzso zzso close to the active site of the zzso alkaline zzso from the Antarctic strain zzso The zzso targets were zzso zzso and zzso The replacement of zzso by Ala resulted in an inactive zzso zzso of zzso by Ala resulted to an zzso with lower stability and increased energy of zzso The double zzso zzso designed on the basis of zzso packing criteria from a zzso structure of the zzso resulted in restoration of the energy of zzso to the levels of the native zzso and in an increased stability compared to the zzso zzso It seems therefore, that the zzso cluster in combination with its structural environment plays a significant role in the cold adaptation of the zzso
