We demonstrate that horizontal spread of zzso zzso similar to worldwide spread of zzso genes in medically important bacteria occurred in bacteria found in zzso zzso and zzso The spread was zzso by different zzso and zzso Some of the spreading zzso were damaged in different ways but this did not prevent their further zzso Certain zzso are mosaics composed of segments belonging to distinct sequence zzso These mosaics arose as a result of zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso environmental bacteria can be considered as a worldwide population composed of a relatively small number of distinct zzso clones shared, at least zzso by environmental and clinical zzso
