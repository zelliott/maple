A full-length gene zzso a zzso of the small zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been used extensively for the commercial production of zzso Using a screening system designed to isolate genes involved in electron zzso zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of this zzso identified a gene zzso zzso with a predicted approximately zzso product, which was associated with reductive zzso of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence was not typical of electron transport zzso but rather shared striking zzso to the small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and other beta zzso zzso and was thus designated zzso Although all the functional zzso typical of zzso beta zzso were zzso in this zzso zzso certain sequence features were not zzso Furthermore, it was independently zzso did not lie adjacent to a zzso large zzso zzso domain, and its expression was not regulated by nitrogen zzso These results provide additional support for current theories on the evolutionary relationships of zzso beta zzso zzso in bacteria, and suggest that zzso belongs to a more general family of zzso which is used in a context other than zzso zzso to transfer electrons to a currently unknown protein zzso
