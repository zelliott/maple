Nowadays, the occurrence of zzso syndrome, which is characterized by obesity and clinical disorders, has been increasing rapidly over the zzso It zzso several serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, zzso zzso zzso disease, hypertension, zzso sleep zzso stroke, and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso which have three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are key regulators of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and are potential drug targets for treating zzso zzso The traditional Chinese medicine zzso compounds from zzso zzso ( zzso ) were employed to virtually screen for potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso models were generated to identify the key interactions for each zzso zzso In addition, molecular dynamics zzso simulation was performed to evaluate the stability of the zzso complexes in a dynamic zzso zzso and zzso which have higher zzso zzso than controls, form stable interactions during MD, and are further supported by the zzso zzso models in each zzso zzso Key features include stable zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso we propose the top two zzso candidates as potential lead compounds in developing zzso targeting zzso protein for treating zzso zzso
