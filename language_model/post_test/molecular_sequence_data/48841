The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the root of a pepper plant grown in a field in zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso zzso and molecular genetic zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso was most closely related to members of the zzso zzso and that the strain exhibited the highest similarities with type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values between strain zzso and type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso is zzso zzso The zzso respiratory zzso of zzso was zzso zzso major cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0, summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : 0 zzso On the basis of these zzso and zzso zzso the strain significantly differed from representative strains belonging to the zzso zzso Thus, we propose that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
