To understand more directly the tissue zzso in osteogenesis imperfecta zzso bone zzso was analyzed from an infant with lethal zzso zzso zzso of defined zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso chains and derived zzso migrated more slowly on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso compared with normal human zzso The zzso alpha zzso predicted to contain the zzso site, ran as a retarded zzso band and was zzso by high performance liquid zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Two peptides with zzso sequences beginning at zzso zzso of the alpha zzso chain were zzso One had the normal zzso The other differed in that zzso acid replaced zzso at zzso 580 as predicted from zzso analysis, and in having an zzso zzso at zzso zzso From yields on zzso and the relative zzso of the two forms of alpha zzso on zzso gel zzso the ratio of zzso to normal alpha zzso chains in the zzso bone zzso was zzso Although the effects of an efficient incorporation of zzso chains on the properties of the bone zzso are unknown, it may be that in this zzso case the tissue abnormalities result more from the presence of zzso protein than from an zzso of zzso
