zzso of the zzso specific gene zzso was used to monitor zzso zzso in zzso arrested and in zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso however, in two species of sea urchins zzso zzso is still zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso lineage has taken place in these zzso arrested zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso at the zzso stage unless they are zzso shortly after the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso after the zzso stage also results in a lack of zzso zzso zzso is unable to rescue zzso expression in these zzso zzso These results indicate that early signaling events zzso by zzso contact are required for the initial zzso and maintenance of the zzso in the developing zzso
