During the study on the mechanisms of abdominal leg development in the zzso zzso zzso we found that a high molecular mass protein zzso was expressed specifically in abdominal leg cells during early embryonic stages and disappeared by a late embryonic zzso zzso consists of two zzso with molecular masses of 260 and zzso zzso We have established a zzso procedure for zzso and have raised an zzso against zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (new additional zzso zzso which lack the zzso zzso gene and therefore do not express abdominal legs, demonstrated that the two zzso lacked zzso zzso we speculate that the expression of zzso may be regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing demonstrated that zzso and zzso have structures similar to that of rat zzso zzso which zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso for zzso synthesis were well zzso in the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were less zzso to that of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso can transfer zzso to zzso zzso of synthetic peptides in zzso We propose that zzso may be involved in protein zzso and may function in abdominal leg zzso
