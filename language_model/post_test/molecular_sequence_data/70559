In the present study, we described the interaction of zzso human serum zzso zzso a zzso charged zzso active zzso with zzso zzso and in detail with the third variable domain of zzso zzso zzso To this end, different zzso formats were tested in which zzso and zzso peptides were presented in various zzso in order to investigate the effect of the zzso structure of the zzso loop on the interaction with zzso charged zzso When zzso presented via a zzso was used, it was observed that zzso bound to native zzso The binding site appeared to be located at or near the zzso zzso site zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso since the zzso of the loop resulted in decreased binding of zzso In addition, zzso was able to protect the zzso region of zzso from zzso with zzso In contrast, significant binding of zzso to zzso loop or zzso peptides was not observed when both were presented in a fluid phase system, suggesting the involvement of a zzso affinity binding of zzso Using overlapping peptides zzso the whole zzso loop immobilized to zzso we noticed that the interaction of the zzso loop with zzso was predominantly induced by zzso interactions between positively charged zzso zzso fragments and zzso and was positively influenced by the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso loop fragments as zzso Moreover, the highest affinity site was located at sites near the zzso zzso These observations add to the evidence, collected earlier, that zzso interferes at the level of virus entry, independent of interaction with the zzso zzso Since the recently discovered zzso receptors are zzso charged, we can zzso that zzso is able to prevent the positively charged zzso loop from interacting with these types of zzso thereby zzso virus zzso
