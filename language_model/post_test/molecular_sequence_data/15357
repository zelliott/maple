zzso protein zzso is a cellular zzso protein zzso that mediates zzso and degradation of zzso in conjunction with the high-risk human zzso E6 zzso However, the zzso functions of zzso are poorly zzso To identify a novel biological function of zzso we screened for binding partners of zzso using zzso pull-down and mass zzso Here we identified zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced the degradation of zzso A1 in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso with zzso A1 and induced its zzso in a zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso revealed that the zzso repeat domain III of zzso A1 is important for the zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso A1 is a novel zzso for zzso zzso Our findings raise the possibility that zzso may play a role in controlling the diverse functions of zzso A1 through the zzso zzso
