Cellular responses to zzso zzso are regulated at multiple levels, both zzso and zzso zzso the presence of these growth factors is not an accurate indicator of zzso signaling zzso While a common approach to detect zzso signaling activity is to determine the presence of zzso forms of zzso 5 and 8 by zzso this approach is time consuming and not zzso In order to provide a simpler zzso system to examine the presence of zzso signaling in developing animals, we developed zzso mouse embryonic stem cells and a transgenic mouse line that specifically respond to zzso zzso zzso Our reporter identifies specific zzso responses that are zzso by zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso factor complex binding to a zzso zzso zzso zzso originally identified among zzso zzso and human zzso zzso Our zzso zzso cells specifically respond to zzso zzso at zzso as low as 5 zzso and zzso reporter mice, derived from the zzso zzso cells, show dynamic activity in many cellular sites, including zzso structures and zzso zzso thereby making this a useful scientific zzso
