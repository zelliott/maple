zzso virus can zzso a broad range of insect and zzso cell zzso The ability to restrict tissue zzso and target virus infection to specific cell types would expand the usefulness of engineered zzso as gene expression zzso In this study, virus pools derived from libraries of full-length zzso virus zzso clones containing random zzso zzso in the zzso or E1 zzso zzso gene were screened for zzso defective for binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso were depleted by serial zzso to chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 degrees C, and the remaining population was amplified by zzso infection of zzso zzso From the zzso libraries, 12 candidate zzso showing reduced zzso effects on zzso zzso were isolated and three representative zzso zzso zzso and zzso were characterized in zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were found near the zzso zzso site, whereas the zzso in zzso occurred between zzso 69 and 74 of zzso Although zzso assembly and release occurred normally for all three zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso or partially zzso blocked for the zzso with insertions near the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were defective for binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and partially restored binding to zzso Besides defective zzso zzso also exhibited slower zzso penetration zzso zzso with previous work, these results zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso portion of zzso as important zzso of zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which exhibit normal particle zzso release, and zzso may be useful for future efforts to target zzso virus zzso
