A zzso zzso to short zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang province, zzso China, and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso The strain was zzso and grew at pH zzso zzso growth at pH zzso zzso degrees C zzso growth at 37 degrees zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso optimal growth at zzso zzso zzso 10 was detected as the major respiratory zzso The cellular fatty acid profile had zzso zzso of the total) as the major zzso similar to those of members of the zzso zzso The nearest zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso was the type strain of zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso gene sequence analysis zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso zzso was zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso data and its zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso AB zzso zzso is proposed as the type strain of a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
