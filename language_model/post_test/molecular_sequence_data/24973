zzso zzso is one of the precursors in the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso and other neuroendocrine zzso zzso and other zzso precursors are elevated in the serum of many conditions leading to systemic inflammatory response zzso The measurement of zzso in patients suffering from severe bacterial infections is a useful tool for the diagnosis of zzso Furthermore, therapeutic decisions are often based on the increase or decline of serum zzso zzso zzso was reported to have 116 zzso zzso The aim of our study was the determination of the primary structure of serum zzso from septic zzso zzso containing high zzso zzso zzso were collected from 22 patients with severe zzso and were pooled for further zzso zzso zzso total concentration of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on a CT zzso column, further zzso by reversed phase zzso and the resulting pure zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed that the first two zzso acids zzso of the proposed zzso were zzso Further analyses by zzso mass zzso resulted in a distinct mass signal of zzso Da zzso zzso which is in zzso with the theoretical molecular weight of the zzso truncated form zzso zzso As opposed to previous suggestions, we could not detect any chemical modifications of zzso In zzso we could demonstrate that zzso in the serum of septic patients is a zzso of only 114 zzso zzso instead of the predicted 116 zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso This information on the primary structure of zzso might help in further studies on the zzso role of zzso during zzso
