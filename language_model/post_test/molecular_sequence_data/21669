Plants represent an important source of zzso in the human zzso Recently, zzso has been identified as a transport protein responsible for zzso import in zzso zzso zzso however, the function of the zzso protein zzso has not been zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis indicated a zzso location of this carrier zzso By site directed zzso at the zzso end of zzso we identified a zzso motif that is essential for driving the protein into the zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso showed that this zzso serves as an important zzso store in zzso zzso When grown on soil, leaves from zzso zzso zzso contained more zzso whereas zzso seeds contained significantly less zzso than corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in zzso leaves and zzso leaves from plants that had finished their life cycle had zzso higher zzso levels than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene led to a zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso exhibit impaired zzso zzso zzso As total zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its precursor zzso zzso with leaf zzso levels, we present novel evidence for an adjustment of zzso zzso in response to cellular zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is important for zzso zzso export, an zzso zzso motif is critical for correct zzso zzso of zzso and activity of this carrier is required for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a novel element in zzso zzso of an essential metal zzso
