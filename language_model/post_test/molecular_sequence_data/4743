zzso zzso molecules prove generally unsatisfactory for in zzso zzso Most biological systems are indeed zzso either zzso zzso different zzso or zzso when zzso by their zzso zzso natural molecules for immune intervention implies the need for zzso systems to create zzso molecules capable of interfering with zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso protein has been designed by reconstructing the zzso binding site of a human zzso zzso zzso as a single chain zzso mini zzso then zzso it by inserting at its zzso end the zzso part of the C4 binding protein zzso alpha chain, which is responsible for the zzso zzso of that zzso This soluble zzso zzso zzso was functional, bound red blood cells zzso zzso them, and did not activate zzso This demonstration model opens the way for future in zzso use of zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso and other functional molecules for cell zzso imaging, or removal of cells such as zzso zzso for preventing zzso zzso
