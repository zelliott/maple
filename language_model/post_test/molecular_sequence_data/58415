As part of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing project, we have determined a 283 zzso zzso sequence from 210 degrees to 232 degrees of the zzso zzso zzso This region contains the 48 zzso skin element which is excised during zzso by a zzso zzso In this region, 310 complete zzso and one zzso gene were zzso 66 zzso have been zzso and characterized previously by other workers, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso many zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The products of 84 zzso were found to display significant similarity to proteins with known function in data banks, zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid transport (ABC zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso system, the zzso regulatory system, cell wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the functions of more than half of the zzso zzso 160 zzso are still zzso In the skin element containing 60 zzso 32 zzso zzso zzso proteins which have significant zzso to gene products of the zzso zzso temperate zzso zzso 105 and/or the defective zzso zzso
