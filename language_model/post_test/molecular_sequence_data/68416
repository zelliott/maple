zzso zzso zzso of calcium channel zzso was studied in zzso and in zzso in preparations from dog zzso zzso channels in native cardiac zzso were zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso and subsequently zzso using a zzso zzso generated against the deduced zzso sequence of the cardiac beta zzso A 62 zzso protein was identified as the major zzso in the zzso In the intact zzso this putative beta zzso was found to be zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso of a protein with an zzso mobility similar to the alpha 1 zzso was zzso although zzso zzso sites were recovered in the zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso zzso of the beta zzso is the major mechanism for zzso regulation of cardiac zzso calcium channel zzso
