The zzso proteins regulate a number of cellular and zzso activities and zzso of zzso gene expression are associated with several human zzso For example, zzso is zzso in zzso skin, implicating a link with zzso a chronic inflammatory zzso We zzso human zzso and determined its protein sequence by tandem mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a sequence comparison of zzso with all known human zzso proteins showed that zzso is the most divergent of all zzso zzso
