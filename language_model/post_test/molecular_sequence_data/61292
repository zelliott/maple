The zzso zzso a zzso complex, is the primary zzso of the zzso zzso system in zzso We have recently characterized zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso complex that has affinity for zzso chains in zzso and as a result may function as a zzso for zzso zzso To define the role of zzso further, we analyzed its function in zzso zzso by generating zzso gene disruptions using zzso zzso zzso which is 50 to zzso similar to zzso from other zzso is present in the zzso zzso complex and has a similar affinity for zzso zzso using a zzso zzso domain within the zzso half of the zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso which grow zzso zzso zzso zzso strains are viable but are under zzso arrest, generating abnormal zzso that are unable to form buds and zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso restored bud formation and subsequent partial development of zzso zzso of a zzso strain with zzso versions of zzso revealed that the zzso chain binding site is not essential for the zzso zzso These results show that zzso has an important function in the zzso zzso of higher order zzso in addition to its ability to bind zzso zzso and they provide further support for a role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in plant zzso processes triggered by zzso
