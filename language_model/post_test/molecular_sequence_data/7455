A member of the zzso gene family was identified here for the first time in two marine fish, the zzso zzso zzso and the red zzso zzso zzso After zzso the partial sequence of zzso gene zzso 1 and 2) has been cloned and zzso from normal zzso At the zzso acid level, a very high extent of zzso with the human zzso genes is observed zzso to zzso and a perfect zzso is observed at the zzso acid zzso The high conservation of the zzso region of the zzso gene suggest that the zzso protein has identical function in higher and lower zzso The identification of zzso gene should be a first step in understanding the molecular basis of zzso in these zzso
