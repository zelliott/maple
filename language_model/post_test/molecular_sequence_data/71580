zzso zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso In response to this zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is zzso enabling downstream zzso zzso by members of the zzso zzso One of the target genes for zzso encodes zzso explaining why zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can lead to cancer, particularly in the zzso Most colon zzso arise from zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso coli zzso a protein required for zzso degradation of zzso but a small percentage of colon and some other zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated zzso are predisposed to developing skin zzso resembling zzso Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de zzso zzso zzso we wondered whether human zzso might originate from hair zzso cells and whether they might possess zzso zzso Here, we explore the cell origin and zzso of this common human skin zzso We found nuclear zzso in the dividing zzso cells, providing zzso evidence that zzso are derived from hair zzso zzso At least zzso of these zzso possess zzso affecting the zzso segment, normally involved in zzso zzso degradation of the zzso This percentage of zzso zzso is greater than in all other human zzso examined thus far, and directly implicates zzso zzso as the major cause of hair zzso cell zzso in zzso
