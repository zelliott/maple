zzso function as negative regulators of basic zzso zzso factors and their expression is rapidly induced by serum stimulation in various cell zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of zzso expression of the mouse zzso gene in zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor of bone zzso protein zzso type I zzso zzso blocked the serum induction of zzso zzso The chemical compound and several zzso proteins specific for zzso signaling suppressed the zzso zzso of the zzso construct with the mouse zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso serum stimulation evoked rapid zzso of zzso and significant zzso of the reporter zzso containing the recently identified zzso element zzso of the mouse zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the binding sites for zzso proteins in the zzso zzso were critical for serum response of the zzso whole zzso zzso shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Finally, a zzso experiment revealed the functional importance of zzso in the serum induction of zzso zzso Thus, we concluded that zzso signaling is primarily responsible for the zzso zzso zzso Our results also suggest that some of the cellular effects caused by serum are zzso through zzso zzso
