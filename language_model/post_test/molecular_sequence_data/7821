DNA recognition is a critical property of many zzso factors, some of which play important roles in human zzso zzso of this recognition may profoundly influence the biology of these zzso One such factor, the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso motif to recognize the DNA target zzso As discussed here, this recognition appears to occur through recognition by one face of a basic region alpha zzso utilizing zzso acid side chains highly zzso among zzso binding zzso This basic domain alpha zzso however, requires DNA binding for zzso To circumvent this energetic requirement, zzso were produced that introduce multiple zzso displaying substantially increased spontaneous alpha zzso and significantly enhanced DNA zzso These studies simplify our understanding of the structural constraints for DNA recognition by this family and may serve as a template for the design of small zzso zzso zzso
