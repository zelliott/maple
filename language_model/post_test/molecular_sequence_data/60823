A zzso patient with zzso reacting simultaneously to human zzso virus type 1 zzso group zzso and group zzso zzso peptides was zzso In order to confirm that this patient was zzso with both zzso zzso with zzso and zzso discriminating zzso corresponding to different regions of the zzso were carried out with both primary zzso DNA and the corresponding viral strains isolated from three consecutive patient zzso The zzso data suggested that this patient is zzso with a group M virus and a zzso zzso zzso Indeed, only type M gag sequences could be zzso while for the zzso region, both type M and O sequences were zzso from plasma or from DNA extracted from primary zzso zzso analysis of a complete zzso zzso isolated from the second sample zzso virus zzso revealed two intergroup zzso one in the zzso gene and the second in the long terminal repeat region around the zzso zzso zzso of the type M sequences shared by the group M and the zzso zzso viruses showed that these sequences were closely zzso with only zzso genetic distance, suggesting that the M virus was one of the parental zzso In this report we describe for the first time a zzso event in zzso between viruses belonging to two different groups, leading to a zzso zzso zzso between strains with such distant lineages zzso overall zzso may contribute substantially to the emergence of new zzso zzso We documented that this virus replicates well and became zzso in zzso At this time, group O viruses represent a minority of the strains responsible for the zzso zzso If such zzso intergroup viruses gained better zzso inducing changes in their biological properties compared to the parental group O virus, the zzso of group O sequences could increase zzso This will have important implications for diagnosis of zzso infections by zzso and molecular tests, as well as for zzso zzso
