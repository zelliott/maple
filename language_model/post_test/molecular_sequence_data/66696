zzso zzso zzso the first step in the zzso zzso for the formation of the major membrane zzso zzso zzso In this work, the predicted zzso zzso was established as a soluble protein with zzso zzso activity that was most highly expressed in zzso Mice with an zzso zzso gene were zzso and its absence reduced the rate of zzso synthesis from zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a major precursor to zzso in zzso however, zzso mice did not have reduced amounts of either zzso or zzso or an altered zzso molecular species zzso The zzso animals were able to adapt to a zzso zzso The zzso mice exhibited a zzso zzso growth zzso zzso that resulted in a zzso reduction in litter size and frequent zzso zzso zzso analysis of pregnant zzso females showed that fetal development failed at the late stage of pregnancy in a significant percentage of zzso because of the appearance of extensive zzso zzso These results illustrate a zzso role for zzso expression in regulating zzso zzso
