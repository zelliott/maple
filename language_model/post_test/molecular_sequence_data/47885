A pair of zzso zzso was used for amplification and cloning of an internal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of highly zzso motifs within protein sequences predicted for zzso genes from several zzso Using the amplified zzso as a probe, we finally cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene and an incomplete open reading frame zzso similar to zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso in which the gene encodes a zzso of the signal recognition zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso CBS zzso were selected on media containing zzso acid and used as recipients in transformation experiments using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso marker, thereby proving functionality of the cloned zzso
