The solution zzso of human big zzso a zzso zzso which serves as the putative precursor to the potent zzso zzso has been examined by zzso zzso zzso were zzso as distance restraints in the distance geometry program zzso to generate initial zzso Further refinement of these structures was accomplished through molecular zzso dynamics in an zzso process involving the incorporation of zzso assignments of zzso centers and the use of zzso of zzso zzso A family of structures consisting of a type II zzso for zzso 5-8 and an zzso extending from zzso zzso constitute a zzso region, as reflected by the atomic zzso zzso difference of zzso A about the mean coordinate positions of the backbone atoms zzso C, C alpha and zzso This core region zzso zzso is very similar to the core zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While the evidence from zzso and zzso constant data suggests that the zzso region, zzso zzso is not a mixture of randomly distributed chain zzso it is also not consistent with a single chain zzso Under the conditions zzso zzso zzso in human big zzso in water at pH zzso between zzso degrees C appear to be represented by a series of zzso in dynamic zzso
