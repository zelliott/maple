zzso as well as zzso zzso can induce the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso acid analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso predominantly occurs at zzso zzso of the zzso The findings obtained with zzso zzso in which portions of the zzso were truncated or deleted indicated that a region of 21 zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso including seven zzso contains the main zzso sites involved in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso To identify the zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso regulation of the zzso two different strategies were adopted, the seven zzso were either zzso with zzso or reintroduced into a zzso lacking all of zzso Our findings indicate that zzso and zzso were zzso following zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C, whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso upon stimulation of the zzso with zzso The observation that zzso of G zzso zzso 2 zzso could increase zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso strongly suggests that these zzso are the zzso sites of the zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This study provides zzso about the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso and zzso zzso of G zzso receptors linked to the zzso of zzso zzso
