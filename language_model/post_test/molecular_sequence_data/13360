We report that expression of the zzso gene in pancreatic zzso and in zzso cells is zzso regulated by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso decreases zzso gene promoter activity zzso by an upstream zzso in the zzso zzso line zzso but not in the zzso zzso line zzso whereas zzso zzso gene zzso both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso both zzso and zzso independently inhibit zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that both zzso and zzso bind similar nuclear protein complexes in zzso and zzso cells zzso and 130 zzso zzso also binds a zzso protein present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso bind three zzso proteins zzso 43 and 45 zzso These observations support a direct involvement of both positive and negative zzso control mechanisms in the regulation of the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso
