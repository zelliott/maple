The product of the zzso zzso odd Oz zzso zzso zzso gene consists of eight zzso growth factor zzso repeats followed by a novel zzso zzso acid zzso stretch unique to proteins of the zzso zzso The structure and membrane orientation of this large enigmatic protein was characterized by raising and employing zzso directed against discrete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane were used in concert with the battery of zzso to demonstrate that zzso is a type I zzso protein with the vast zzso portion in the zzso space, and with the zzso repeats deployed zzso The zzso was shown to undergo multiple zzso at discrete zzso and zzso sites, and its extreme zzso was shown to undergo either processing at a very large number of sites or programmed zzso The zzso is presented at the cell surface with additional zzso zzso and as two zzso of previously zzso zzso joined by zzso zzso bridges maintaining their zzso The model derived for the zzso protein is discussed in light of other models proposed for proteins of the zzso family, and in terms of functional zzso
