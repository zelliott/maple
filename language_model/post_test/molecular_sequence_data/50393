We have zzso a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso that can be used for mapping cloned DNA sequences in the zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso analysis of sequences that are potentially less subject to conservation zzso zzso and 3' untranslated zzso is a relatively efficient means of detecting zzso between zzso zzso Fifty percent of the tested primer pairs were zzso between zzso strains and zzso were zzso between mouse species, which is a frequency comparable to that found for zzso repeat zzso We have found that this technique can be readily used to determine the strain distribution pattern in a zzso zzso series and is a simple and rapid means to obtain a map position for cloned zzso When this strategy was tested on a number of previously mapped cloned zzso the strain distribution patterns obtained were consistent with that to be expected on the basis of the known map zzso We also tested the utility of this approach for characterizing genes that have not been previously zzso zzso the mouse zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso were found to map to zzso zzso These results were confirmed using zzso zzso zzso analysis of an zzso zzso
