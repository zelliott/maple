The zzso behavior of zzso peptides of the zzso acid sequence zzso has been investigated through the combined use of molecular simulation methods and zzso experiments to find models for zzso turns of zzso Both oxidized zzso peptides and reduced zzso forms were zzso At least zzso of the zzso peptides show a zzso zzso of the zzso bond in solution in zzso or water, whereas all other zzso bonds are zzso Furthermore, we observed a hydrogen bond between the zzso group of zzso zzso and the C zzso O group of zzso zzso Both properties are indicative of zzso zzso After reduction of the zzso bridge, the zzso form of the zzso bonds zzso
