zzso cellular zzso inducing a zzso zzso effect is the therapeutic mainstay of zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso for high-risk zzso zzso zzso using vaccines or adoptive transfer of ex zzso zzso are clinically explored in patients with various cancer zzso Main reason for failure of zzso and cancer zzso is progression of the underlying zzso which is more prevalent in patients with advanced zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms contributing to immune escape will help to develop strategies for the improvement of zzso cancer zzso To this end, we have undertaken functional screening and expression cloning of factors zzso resistance to zzso zzso T zzso zzso We have identified zzso a zzso regulating zzso dynamics and growth factor signaling that is highly expressed in invasive zzso as zzso of cancer cell zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso transferred immune zzso in zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso via zzso protein zzso zzso signaling and zzso stabilization of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overcomes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling contributes to immune escape of zzso zzso zzso may improve the efficacy of cancer zzso
