The nature of the initial interaction of dengue virus with target cells and the extent to which this interaction defines zzso are zzso zzso of some cells may involve zzso zzso immune adherence to cells bearing zzso zzso zzso however, this mechanism does not explain primary infection or the infection of cells without zzso zzso We hypothesized that dengue virus envelope protein mediates initial binding to target zzso To test this hypothesis, a zzso zzso form of dengue type 2 virus envelope protein was used as a probe to investigate binding to the surfaces of potential target zzso zzso protein was expressed zzso terminal to the zzso constant region of human zzso G containing the zzso zzso binding zzso the binding zzso by envelope zzso was distinguishable from the binding zzso by zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells through envelope protein zzso and to zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso The highest level of binding was to zzso zzso binding was dose and time dependent and zzso zzso of zzso zzso envelope proteins indicated that the binding motif was expressed between zzso acids 281 and zzso zzso envelope protein inhibited infection of zzso cells by dengue virus, indicating the functional significance of the interaction of envelope protein and target cells in zzso These results suggest that envelope protein binding to a zzso zzso could explain the cell and tissue zzso of primary dengue virus zzso
