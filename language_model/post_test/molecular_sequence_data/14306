Despite the fact that zzso zzso zzso strains emerge rapidly zzso J, et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to be useful in controlling these bacteria zzso zzso zzso K, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the complete zzso sequences of only five zzso zzso (four zzso and one zzso can be found in zzso In this paper, we report on the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso With a zzso size of zzso zzso this is the second largest zzso and the largest zzso zzso zzso to zzso This zzso differs substantially from other zzso since 411 out of zzso zzso open reading frames have no known functions and lack any reliable database zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso sequence of zzso suggests that this zzso forms a distinct zzso branch within the family zzso of zzso zzso
