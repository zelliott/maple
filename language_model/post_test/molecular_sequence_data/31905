The zzso of marine cone snails is a rich source of zzso compounds with striking target specificity and functional zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins are the most well characterized active compounds in cone snail zzso However, reports on the presence of larger zzso have recently zzso The majority of these studies have focused on the content of the dissected zzso zzso rather than the injected zzso zzso Recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of protein and zzso sequencing techniques allow for the exploration of the zzso diversity of injected zzso Using mass zzso analysis of injected zzso of the two zzso cone snails zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso converting zzso zzso zzso that activate potent zzso zzso zzso activity was confirmed in the zzso of zzso zzso and was significantly reduced in zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that these zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso of other cone snail species with different prey zzso These findings strongly suggest that cone snails employ compounds that cause disruption of cardiovascular function as part of their complex zzso strategy, leading to the enhancement of zzso zzso toxin zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the presence of zzso and zzso in the zzso of cone zzso Identification of these zzso zzso zzso in the injected zzso of two zzso cone snails highlights their role in zzso and enhances our understanding of the complex hunting strategies zzso by these marine zzso Our findings on the expression of these zzso in other cone snail species suggests an important biological role of zzso and zzso in these animals and points towards recruitment into zzso from general zzso zzso
