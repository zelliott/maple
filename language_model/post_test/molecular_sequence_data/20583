Human zzso zzso zzso a zzso mechanism for DNA zzso One of the metal zzso zzso is believed to make a critical interaction with the zzso atom of the zzso zzso while the other zzso is believed to interact with a zzso oxygen of the zzso zzso Based on structural and zzso studies of zzso zzso acid zzso it has been proposed that the active site zzso metal zzso interact with type II zzso through a series of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso in human zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso To address the zzso of these assignments and to delineate interactions between individual zzso acids and zzso and zzso we individually zzso each of these zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso displayed a marked loss of zzso and DNA zzso activity as well as a reduced affinity for zzso metal zzso Additional experiments determined the ability of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to cleave an zzso zzso that contained a sulfur atom in place of the zzso oxygen of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso On the basis of the results of these studies, we conclude that the four zzso zzso acid zzso interact with metal zzso in the DNA zzso active site of zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso interacts with zzso and zzso
