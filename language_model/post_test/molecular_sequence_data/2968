The zzso proteins are a recently described novel protein family, whose members interact with zzso zzso that function in zzso zzso To date, five such proteins have been described in humans, all of which interact with zzso and one zzso also interacts with zzso Here, we zzso several of these proteins with respect to their ability to interact with zzso as well as their ability to zzso and to interact with each zzso We now demonstrate that two of the family zzso and zzso do not bind zzso and show that several members of the family can zzso and interact with each zzso These interactions primarily involve their zzso end which includes the zzso binding domain zzso that is contained within a predicted zzso or zzso zzso We identify a new zzso member of the protein family, which we propose to name zzso and report the family evolutionary complexity and zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that the ability of these proteins to bind each other will be important in zzso membrane trafficking events by forming protein zzso regulated by zzso and/or zzso zzso
