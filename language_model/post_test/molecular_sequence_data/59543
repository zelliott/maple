We report a new method for in zzso zzso of DNA sequences that allows excellent preservation of nuclear and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 256 direct repeats of the zzso operator were added to zzso zzso used for zzso and served as a tag for labeling by zzso zzso This system was first characterized by zzso of zzso zzso zzso regions zzso produced by gene amplification using a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso with zzso zzso Using electron zzso most zzso showed approximately zzso zzso as described previously for the bulk, large-scale zzso organization in these cells, and by light zzso zzso large-scale zzso fibers could be traced in zzso up to 5 zzso in zzso zzso experiments demonstrated the potential for more general applications of this labeling zzso Single and multiple copies of the integrated zzso could be detected in living zzso cells before gene amplification, and detection of a single 256 zzso operator repeat and its stability during zzso was demonstrated by its targeted zzso into budding zzso cells by zzso zzso In both zzso cells and zzso use of the green fluorescent zzso zzso protein allowed extended, in zzso observations of the zzso zzso zzso Future applications of this technology should facilitate zzso functional, and genetic analysis of zzso organization, zzso zzso and nuclear zzso
