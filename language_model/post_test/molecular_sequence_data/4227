The effects of native and non-native zzso substitution on the binding of zzso proteins to human zzso zzso were investigated to determine if the zzso site was a likely target for the zzso effects of the zzso drug zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso binding site of human zzso zzso was prepared by in zzso transcription, and zzso protein binding was assessed using gel mobility shift zzso The zzso zzso complex was identified by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso substitution were assessed by including zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso The effects of native zzso substitution were assessed by zzso zzso zzso were used to assess the relative importance of the two zzso that flank the zzso binding site for protein zzso Point zzso zzso to the zzso in the zzso site reduced zzso protein binding while similar point zzso to the zzso had a lesser zzso zzso zzso of all zzso in the zzso site completely inhibited zzso protein zzso The central zzso contributed significantly to zzso protein complex formation but the 3' zzso had little zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso protein zzso but reduced the stability of the resulting zzso The results indicate that zzso or other zzso zzso are unlikely to exert zzso effects through zzso of zzso protein zzso
