The extreme zzso sequences of the zzso virus zzso G virus zzso containing elements essential for regulation of viral gene expression and zzso have not been zzso By using a zzso zzso zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the extreme zzso sequences of the viral zzso from the serum of three Taiwanese zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region in alignment with one West African and two American zzso showed that zzso a consensus zzso sequence was zzso zzso about zzso of sequences were zzso among the three Taiwan zzso and also between the two American zzso whereas about zzso of sequences were zzso among the zzso from the three different geographic zzso zzso the sequence zzso related to geographic separation is confined mainly to three zzso and zzso a potential hairpin structure, resembling the hairpin structure found in the zzso end of zzso C virus zzso was detected in the zzso end of the zzso zzso Our data support the hypotheses that zzso the extreme zzso end of the zzso zzso viral zzso has been zzso zzso there are different zzso correlated with geographic zzso and zzso the viral translation and replication mechanisms may be similar to that of zzso C virus and zzso Our data have not only shed light on the viral replication mechanism but also offer information for selection of optimal primer sequences for the detection and zzso of the zzso zzso virus by zzso zzso
