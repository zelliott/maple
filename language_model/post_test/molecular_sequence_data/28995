zzso zzso generated by the low levels of zzso expressed zzso induce high levels of zzso that can help zzso zzso to penetrate into the host through the zzso whose major structural zzso is zzso We cloned three highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of zzso and zzso matched with that of the peptides from zzso 1 and zzso 2, respectively, isolated from zzso zzso zzso grown on zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso of zzso gene fused to the promoters of the zzso integrated into zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso is zzso expressed and induced under zzso whereas zzso is highly induced by zzso zzso A zzso binding protein zzso previously cloned binds only to zzso 1 of zzso promoter but not zzso 1 of zzso which contains two base zzso zzso is thought to interfere with the binding of zzso zzso the zzso factor involved in zzso to zzso promoter and thus keep zzso gene zzso until induced by zzso zzso Because zzso cannot bind zzso 1 of zzso this gene is not zzso zzso alpha does not zzso zzso zzso A new zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso that binds zzso 2 was cloned and zzso In zzso zzso beta zzso zzso promoter but not zzso promoter unless its zzso 1 is zzso unlike zzso alpha which zzso zzso Thus, zzso beta is involved in the zzso expression of zzso that causes production of low levels of zzso zzso that strongly induce zzso using zzso alpha as the zzso zzso
