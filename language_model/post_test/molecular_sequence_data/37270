zzso is a common, zzso disorder characterized by reduced zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, elevated blood pressure, and zzso The zzso of this zzso disorder is incompletely zzso but it has a familial zzso which suggests that one or more common zzso may act as zzso zzso We hypothesized that, in a founder population, the genetic background of zzso might also show reduced zzso and we have performed a zzso scan in 15 multiplex families recruited predominantly in the zzso province in central eastern zzso We found two zzso that exceeded the threshold for significant zzso zzso zzso near marker zzso zzso linkage zzso score zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso near marker zzso zzso score zzso zzso at zzso zzso In addition, there was a locus showing suggestive linkage at zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso score zzso zzso at zzso zzso In the present study the zzso locus on zzso zzso is clearly different zzso zzso from the locus at zzso found in an zzso study zzso zzso and the locus at zzso zzso zzso found in an zzso Zealand zzso The locus at zzso has been shown to be a candidate region for type 2 diabetes in two recently published zzso scans from Finland and zzso The regions on zzso zzso and zzso may harbor zzso genes for zzso
