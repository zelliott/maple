The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso network of zzso zzso Although all zzso cell types require low to moderate levels of zzso some zzso cells express amplified levels for use in specialized membrane zzso To characterize genetic elements required for this heightened zzso we studied zzso and stability of zzso zzso the zzso c zzso in a low expressing zzso cell line zzso zzso and a high expressing zzso cell line zzso zzso Isolation of the promoter and mapping of the zzso start site indicated that the c zzso promoter is zzso and zzso zzso at a single zzso zzso activity was regulated through the same zzso factor binding sites in both cell types, which showed no discernible difference in rates of c zzso zzso In contrast, c zzso transcripts showed markedly greater stability in zzso cells than in zzso cells, as did other zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso Only the B and zzso zzso which are expressed in multiple zzso were not regulated solely by zzso zzso These results suggest that overall expression levels of the zzso are set primarily by regulation of zzso stability and that zzso mechanisms determine zzso composition in varying cell zzso
