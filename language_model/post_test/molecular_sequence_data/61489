Here, we report that a significant increase in zzso fusion zzso expression can be accomplished by adjusting the zzso sequence to conform to certain zzso pairing zzso We investigated the expression of a protein in which a single chain zzso specific for zzso with zzso and zzso joined by a flexible zzso zzso was linked to the zzso of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy chain with the same flexible zzso zzso In initial experiments we failed to achieve significant expression of this zzso However, when we made a single zzso change in each zzso zzso we were able to achieve expression The change of one zzso within each zzso did not alter either the zzso acid sequence or the frequency score of these zzso zzso usage in zzso zzso Instead they removed two zzso pairs predicted to be zzso to zzso In a transient zzso zzso we find that this change results in an over zzso increase in expression that is not the result of an increase in the level of accumulated zzso In addition, the changes made it possible to isolate zzso zzso zzso cell clones producing high levels of fusion zzso which had not been possible using the original zzso
