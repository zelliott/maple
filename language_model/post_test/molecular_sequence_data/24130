Short peptides can be expressed in plants using synthetic genes zzso multiple copies of the zzso spaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso A synthetic gene zzso an array of repeated copies of zzso a very well characterized insect zzso zzso spaced by zzso zzso was zzso and expressed in tobacco zzso The successful production of zzso zzso from the precursor in transgenic plants was demonstrated by zzso zzso mass zzso and a zzso based on the contraction of isolated zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso as in animals and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family may be involved in precursor zzso
