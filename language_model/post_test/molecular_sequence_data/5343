Ran is a nuclear zzso implicated in zzso zzso the maintenance of nuclear structure, zzso processing, and cell cycle zzso By zzso interaction in zzso we have identified a zzso zzso of zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso interacts specifically with the zzso form of Ran and forms complexes in zzso egg extracts with zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or other zzso These complexes may play roles in the recycling of Ran and zzso during zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso an interaction between Ran and zzso in egg zzso zzso the exchange activity of zzso towards zzso Under these conditions, the assembly of zzso from zzso is dramatically zzso the zzso do not assemble a zzso and become very small with zzso condensed zzso They fail to actively import proteins and do not undergo DNA zzso By field zzso zzso scanning electron zzso we show that these zzso have an intact nuclear envelope containing pore complexes, but the envelope is highly zzso However, zzso does not directly inhibit nuclear protein import in assembled zzso These results suggest that zzso and/or Ran have a function early in nuclear assembly that is disrupted by zzso
