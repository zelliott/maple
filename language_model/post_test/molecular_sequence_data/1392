U2 small nuclear zzso auxiliary factor small zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso gene designated zzso Here we provide evidence for the existence of alternative zzso transcripts zzso different zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced by alternative zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso contains a premature stop zzso that targets the resulting zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the previously described zzso zzso in 7 zzso acids located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso with zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso which has been highly zzso from fish to man, maintains the ability to interact with zzso stimulates zzso binding to a zzso and promotes zzso zzso activity in zzso Real time, quantitative zzso analysis indicates that zzso is the most abundant zzso expressed in zzso zzso although the ratio between zzso and zzso varies from zzso in the brain to zzso in skeletal zzso We propose that zzso regulation of zzso gene expression may provide a mechanism by which the relative cellular concentration and availability of zzso protein zzso are zzso thus contributing to the finely tuned control of zzso events in different zzso
