Type X zzso a zzso of alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed by zzso zzso in regions of cartilage undergoing zzso zzso We have previously characterized a zzso clone containing the major part of the mouse type X collagen gene zzso and assigned the locus for zzso to mouse zzso 10 zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, through additional characterization of zzso and zzso zzso we describe the complete organization of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso in size and, as in the zzso zzso gene transcripts are generated from only three zzso zzso 1 encodes only the zzso untranslated zzso zzso region of the zzso and is separated from zzso 2 by an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso encodes 15 zzso of zzso zzso message, the translation start plus zzso acid zzso of the putative signal zzso and 33 1/3 zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso domain of type X zzso zzso 3 is zzso zzso in size and encodes 4 2/3 zzso of the zzso domain, the entire zzso domain of 463 zzso zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso acid zzso and the entire zzso zzso 3' untranslated zzso zzso sequence of the zzso Two zzso boxes are present in tandem in the zzso zzso Both zzso boxes are active in transcription, generating two populations of transcripts with different zzso the longer transcript is of low abundance and is zzso only by zzso in newborn zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso box as well as other consensus sequence elements required for binding of potential zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene provides data essential for studies of the regulation of type X collagen expression during zzso zzso bone growth and zzso zzso of the complete structure of the mouse type X collagen gene will also be useful for the investigation of type X collagen gene abnormalities in zzso zzso and for the generation of transgenic zzso
