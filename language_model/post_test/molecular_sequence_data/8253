We report on the determination of the solution structure of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been obtained by using a combined approach of zzso two-dimensional zzso including zzso and zzso experiments, zzso restrained molecular mechanics performed with sugar phase angle, backbone zzso angle, and zzso distances as zzso and zzso zzso refinements against the zzso zzso at various mixing zzso The two zzso adopt the zzso structure with, however, noticeable differences centered on their core sequence and especially the zzso zzso Due to the zzso of its zzso zzso the zzso step zzso its twist values and backbone zzso value; globally, the zzso step appears more flexible within the zzso zzso than zzso The solution structure of zzso differs from the previously reported X-ray structure, which was found to be zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso On the other hand, in the X-ray structure of zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the structure of the zzso sequence is similar to that found in solution zzso Similarly, the central zzso zzso of zzso presents a solution structure analogous to that observed on the X-ray structures of both zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the end we discuss the possible biological significance of the particular structures exhibited by the zzso and zzso zzso
