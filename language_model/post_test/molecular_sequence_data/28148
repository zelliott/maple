The zzso zzso have multiple genes zzso proteins that bind zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of a zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein with a consensus zzso processing site, an zzso domain containing the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain with extensive similarity to the sequences of zzso from other zzso In the current study, we showed that the product of the cloned gene could be zzso with zzso acid, that it was subject to zzso processing, and that it was zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso All zzso species tested, both pathogens and zzso produced a protein recognized by zzso zzso Southern blots with zzso zzso specific for the zzso domain of the gene showed that it was present in a single copy in the zzso it was highly zzso in zzso and zzso and less zzso in zzso zzso zzso
