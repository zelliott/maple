For analysis of zzso zzso using zzso gel zzso two zzso fragments derived from the heavy chain of mouse zzso were produced during incubation of the zzso in zzso reducing sample buffer at 100 degrees C for 5 zzso The zzso sites were identified by zzso terminal zzso zzso indicate that the final pH of the mixture is critical for the production of the fragments which are generated when the pH is approximately zzso At pH zzso no fragments are zzso The relevance of this finding to those working with zzso zzso is zzso
