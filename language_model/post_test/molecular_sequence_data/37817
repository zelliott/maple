The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso of an zzso protein known as the zzso zzso zzso This zzso which was previously identified only in higher zzso is normally bound to small zzso known as Y zzso We show that the zzso protein zzso zzso contributes to the resistance of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso binds several small zzso zzso upstream of zzso that accumulate following zzso zzso One of these zzso resembles a Y zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could similarly contribute to the recovery of higher cells following zzso zzso
