The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is implicated in zzso zzso We have determined the germ line organization of the zzso zzso gene and have isolated and characterized a rearranged zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso The overall zzso organization of the normal zzso gene is almost identical to that of avian zzso In zzso DNA, an internally rearranged zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso is zzso between two distinct promoters that normally generate zzso transcripts differing only in zzso untranslated zzso The zzso appears to have been selected to permit zzso of transcripts that initiate from the zzso virus promoter to an zzso site located within the first zzso 3' to the downstream promoter, thus generating an zzso zzso with a novel zzso untranslated region that may be more efficiently zzso
