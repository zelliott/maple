zzso is one of the zzso protein modifications regulating cellular zzso zzso nitrogen zzso in zzso Several bacterial toxins zzso and zzso specific proteins in their animal zzso Recently, two zzso zzso cell surface zzso with similar activities were cloned zzso zzso and zzso We have now identified six related expressed sequence tags zzso in the public database and cloned the two novel human genes from which these are derived zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the predicted gene products show zzso sequence identity to one another and zzso identity vs the muscle and T cell zzso They contain signal zzso sequences characteristic of zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso analyses suggest the presence of related genes in other zzso zzso By zzso screening of zzso cell hybrids and by in zzso zzso we have mapped the two genes to human zzso zzso and zzso Northern zzso analyses show that these genes are specifically expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sequences reveals a zzso zzso structure, with an unusually large zzso zzso the predicted mature membrane zzso Secondary structure prediction analyses indicate zzso motifs and zzso acid zzso consistent with a common ancestry of this emerging zzso zzso family and bacterial zzso It is possible that the four human gene family members identified so far represent the zzso of an zzso zzso a larger family of zzso that influences the function of target proteins via zzso
