We have used reverse zzso to identify genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso We obtained the sequences of 20 putative zzso factors from previously reported large-scale zzso zzso The zzso factors were classified according to their DNA binding zzso and patterns of expression during the zzso zzso We identified two zzso of zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein and has been shown to play a role in zzso The functions of the remaining genes in the zzso process have not been zzso Seven genes were found to zzso proteins with zzso zzso six of which were similar to proteins that have been implicated in zzso and/or zzso acid signal zzso and defense gene regulation in zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso that is most similar to zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso and zzso acid and activates downstream defense zzso zzso showed the same pattern of zzso in roots as zzso zzso The zzso zzso of roots that zzso zzso or inhibited zzso expression using an zzso interference construct indicated that this gene functions as a positive regulator of zzso We propose that zzso functions as a key regulator of successful infection of zzso zzso by zzso zzso
