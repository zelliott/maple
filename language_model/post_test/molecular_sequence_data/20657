zzso is a type I zzso protein with zzso zzso It removes zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of protein zzso Recently we have shown that zzso exerts no zzso on seven human cell zzso However, the combination of zzso with a special mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rendered zzso to a potent zzso comparable to zzso a highly toxic type II zzso zzso In this study we investigated whether the enhancement of the zzso by zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso or impaired degradation processes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso For this purpose zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso of the toxin alone and in combination with zzso zzso was zzso The transport and degradation processes of zzso were not different in zzso zzso and control zzso However, after zzso of a zzso zzso the amount of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cells than in cells, which were only incubated with zzso This indicates a zzso zzso zzso escape of zzso
