zzso interactions are likely to occur between the highly zzso zzso zzso motif zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso coat protein zzso and each of three zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso during in zzso zzso To characterize these zzso three independent deletions were engineered into a biologically active clone of zzso zzso zzso such that the matured zzso of each B3 zzso precisely lacks either the entire zzso zzso or two consecutive zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso for each B3 zzso recovered from symptomatic leaves of zzso zzso revealed that the interactions between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and each of three zzso zzso is zzso Northern zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the deleted zzso region specifically affected the stability of zzso containing zzso An abundant truncated zzso species zzso found in the zzso of zzso was identified to be a zzso of zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso Additional Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso region contains crucial zzso acids required for zzso packaging, independent of zzso zzso The significance of these observations in relation to zzso zzso interactions during zzso assembly is zzso
