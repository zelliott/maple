zzso zzso zzso is the fourth zzso in the de zzso zzso zzso zzso and is essential in zzso zzso the zzso zzso causing zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso have different zzso properties, including the electron zzso capacities and cellular zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso may be a potential zzso target against zzso zzso Here, we report zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes and the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain possesses three zzso zzso and zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster on an 800 and a 1000 zzso zzso DNA, respectively, and zzso located on an 800 zzso zzso The open reading frames of all three zzso genes are comprised of zzso zzso and zzso proteins of 314 zzso zzso The three zzso genes differ by 26 zzso resulting in replacement of 8 zzso acid zzso In contrast, all zzso critical for zzso the active site are zzso among the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli possess similar zzso properties, including optimal zzso optimal temperature, zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso had a higher zzso and zzso for both zzso zzso competitively inhibited all three zzso zzso to a comparable zzso These results suggest that, despite their genetic variations, kinetic properties of the three zzso zzso are zzso Our findings facilitate further exploitation of zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso agents against zzso zzso
