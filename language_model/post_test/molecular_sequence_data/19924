Two zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso of pH 2 were successfully used as zzso to enrich cultures growing on zzso and zzso at different zzso including pH zzso zzso zzso cultures obtained at pH 3, pH 5, and pH 7 were further zzso All showed rapid zzso zzso at pH 3 and pH 5 and grew on zzso at pH values ranging from 2 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and sequencing indicated that the cultures were dominated by a single zzso closely related to zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a culture enriched on zzso at pH 7 from a slightly alkaline soil sampled at the same site was dominated by zzso zzso and a fast-growing zzso zzso The zzso zzso species dominating the zzso cultures enriched from the zzso zzso was also the dominant zzso species in the zzso zzso Our data indicate that a zzso zzso species is involved in zzso degradation in that culture and show that bacteria able to degrade zzso zzso at low pH are present in zzso zzso zzso
