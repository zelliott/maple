The human zzso zzso B2 zzso is often linked to several infections, from mild respiratory diseases to more severe illnesses such as zzso In this study, we report the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso sequence was determined from reverse transcribed viral zzso amplified with long distance zzso and used for zzso zzso The full length zzso zzso were used for in zzso zzso and the obtained zzso was zzso onto green monkey kidney cells, in order to confirm that the zzso generated sequence reflects a viable virus zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows a typical zzso zzso organization with a total length of zzso zzso zzso analysis, using the zzso zzso in comparison with other zzso zzso clearly shows that zzso clusters with the zzso zzso zzso and is more related to zzso B4 zzso than any other published zzso zzso The grouping of zzso and zzso as one zzso has earlier been reported in connection with zzso usage and ability to replicate in different cell zzso The exposed viral zzso proteins of zzso zzso show high similarity to other zzso zzso except in regions that are likely to be surface zzso
