Human zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a common protein zzso zzso by zzso focusing zzso due to a single base substitution at zzso 360 which replaces the frequently occurring zzso zzso zzso 1) with zzso zzso zzso Recently, sequence analysis of the zzso zzso coding region has revealed another common zzso substitution at zzso 347 which converts the commonly present zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the extent of genetic variation at zzso zzso we screened DNA samples from 192 unrelated individuals using a zzso chain reaction based zzso The zzso of the two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, with average zzso zzso zzso screening of the corresponding 192 plasma samples by zzso gave zzso of zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at zzso 360 with average zzso zzso zzso data at the two zzso sites were used to assign unequivocal zzso to all the zzso zzso Of the expected four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only three were observed and their zzso were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso with average zzso zzso Although our data indicate significant linkage zzso between the two sites zzso 21 zzso zzso P zzso zzso standardized zzso constant zzso zzso zzso the degree of zzso association varied between zzso at the two zzso Based upon zzso frequency data and variable linkage zzso between zzso we propose that the zzso and zzso zzso may have evolved from the parental A1 zzso by two independent zzso
