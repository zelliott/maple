The surfaces of core zzso in zzso are exposed as required for factor recognition, or buried for zzso and zzso zzso To understand the mechanisms by which zzso structure and function are zzso altered in zzso zzso it is essential to define the roles of both exposed and buried zzso and their functional zzso For this purpose, we developed zzso zzso Analysis of zzso by Point zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of Mutual interaction surfaces of zzso protein complex by Point zzso strategies, both of which are comprehensive analyses by point zzso of exposed and buried zzso in zzso zzso Four distinct zzso reactions evaluated by Ty suppression (the zzso zzso and sensitivities to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso require common and different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the interface between zzso zzso and zzso mainly affect the zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, among the zzso zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso some equally affect the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso sensitivities, whereas others zzso affect the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Based on these and other results, the functional relationships among zzso factors and zzso and zzso zzso provide insights into zzso zzso processes in zzso zzso
