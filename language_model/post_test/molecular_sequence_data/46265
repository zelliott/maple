Cell penetrating peptides zzso are peptides displaying the ability to cross cell zzso and transport cargo molecules inside zzso Several zzso mechanisms zzso or direct zzso through the zzso are being considered, but the interaction between the zzso and the cell membrane is certainly a preliminary key point to the entry of the zzso into the zzso In this study, we used three basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso and zzso were zzso into wild type Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells, at zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso into zzso zzso To better understand the differences between zzso zzso and zzso in terms of zzso we studied the interaction of these peptides with model zzso zzso The effect of the three peptides on the zzso phase zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso was investigated with differential scanning zzso zzso The presence of negative charges on the zzso zzso appeared to be essential to trigger the zzso zzso zzso and zzso disturbed the main phase transition of zzso whereas zzso did not induce significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed us to study the binding of these peptides to large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proved to have about ten fold more affinity for zzso zzso than zzso With circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso the secondary structure of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso buffer or zzso conditions was zzso Additionally, we tested the zzso activity of these peptides against zzso coli and zzso zzso as zzso and zzso peptides are known to share several common zzso Only zzso was found to be mildly zzso against zzso zzso These studies helped us to get a better understanding as to why zzso and zzso are able to cross the cell membrane while zzso remains bound to the surface without entering the zzso
