The zzso zzso containing a highly zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the development of the zzso head throughout zzso zzso regulation of the zzso and spatial expression of zzso is likely to be crucial for proper head zzso However, regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression remain largely zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of the zzso fish zzso zzso which has been proposed as a model zzso zzso to its highly compact zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso zzso smaller in size than those of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed after zzso and expressed in the zzso head region throughout the zzso and zzso periods of zzso zzso zzso To zzso regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso the expression of zzso reporter genes nearly covering the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by generating transgenic zzso zzso seven independent zzso were identified over an expanse of 60 zzso these regulators are involved in the mediation of zzso distinct zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, these expression zzso appear to coincide with local signaling centers and developing sense zzso Interestingly, most zzso do not overlap with one another, which implies that zzso for redundant expression may be abolished exclusively in the zzso so as to reduce its zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso were also able to direct expression in zzso zzso equivalent to that observed in transgenic zzso Further comparative sequence analysis of mouse and zzso zzso regions revealed eight highly zzso elements within these zzso zzso we propose that, in zzso evolution, the zzso promoter acquires zzso zzso specific zzso in order to precisely control highly coordinated processes in head zzso
