zzso transport zzso proteins are zzso zzso throughout all zzso organisms and are essential for the assembly and maintenance of zzso zzso a component of the zzso complex, was linked recently to a human zzso disorder, zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here identification and characterization of a human zzso long zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of which shares the protein sequence of zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is likely an zzso merged product of genes zzso and zzso a zzso finger gene we reported zzso zzso analysis of zzso demonstrates that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso By using the nerve growth zzso cell differentiation zzso we reveal that zzso is highly expressed in the rapidly zzso cells but not in differentiated cells, which withdraw from the cell zzso Our findings suggest that zzso like other zzso zzso plays an important role in cell proliferation and zzso
