The zzso zzso domain is present in numerous proteins with diverse zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso able to promote zzso zzso Here we provide experimental evidence that the zzso domain is a zzso binding site of zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain forms zzso in solution and binds to the zzso zzso at the cell zzso The presence of two zzso bridges in the zzso zzso was evidenced and their integrity was found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso Our data also indicate that zzso zzso forms zzso and mediates the cellular zzso even in the absence of zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to interact zzso in the absence of zzso trans zzso The zzso domain therefore contains independent zzso and trans interaction sites and we predict that its main role is to promote lateral zzso of zzso at the cell zzso This finding contributes to the understanding of the signal zzso mechanism in zzso zzso
