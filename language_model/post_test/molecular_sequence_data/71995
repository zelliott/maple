Two novel type I zzso proteins zzso were found in the storage roots of zzso zzso an zzso Andean root zzso The two zzso named zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and C4 zzso zzso The two proteins were found to be similar in size (27 and zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and their zzso points were determined to be greater than pH zzso zzso acid zzso sequencing revealed that both zzso and zzso had zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso acid composition and zzso analysis further suggested a structural similarity between zzso and zzso zzso showed high similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a type I zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso demonstrated their zzso zzso Because these two proteins were isolated from roots, their zzso activity was tested against zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso were active against several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and an additive zzso effect of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso activity of both zzso and zzso was observed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
