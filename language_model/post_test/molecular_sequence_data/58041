zzso II zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of bovine zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso When viewed by two-dimensional zzso this zzso consists of two zzso upper zzso and lower zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso and zzso revealed sequence similarity with zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso which was supported by sequence data of peptides from zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso probe was used to isolate a zzso clone zzso the zzso sequence of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shares a zzso identity with the human zzso type zzso which belongs to a highly zzso group of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso whose function is still zzso The zzso region of zzso was identical to the zzso region of lamp zzso This zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be essential for the zzso targeting of lamp proteins to zzso A synthetic zzso zzso to the zzso region of zzso was used to show that this region is present on zzso zzso zzso and not zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso and zzso data confirm zzso as the zzso zzso counterpart of lamp proteins and raise some questions regarding zzso targeting between zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso
