zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that recognizes zzso zzso We prepared a zzso zzso probe carrying this zzso and characterized the binding activity of zzso on native rat zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso higher activity than those from the zzso The zzso values of the probe binding to zzso of the two zzso were indistinguishable zzso zzso whereas the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso was markedly higher than that of zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the quantity of zzso present in zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher than in zzso zzso High cell surface expression of zzso on zzso zzso zzso was also shown by flow zzso To examine the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso we treated zzso with zzso before measuring the probe zzso After zzso treatment, the binding activity of zzso zzso increased zzso whereas that of zzso zzso zzso did not zzso In conclusion, we have identified zzso expressing high levels of unmasked zzso in zzso zzso The unmasked forms on these zzso are available for zzso adhesive functions, unlike the masked forms on the majority of zzso zzso
