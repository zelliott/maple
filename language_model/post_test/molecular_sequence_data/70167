A computer evaluation of zzso data for the title zzso based on the zzso and zzso analysis data led to the structure of the repeating unit of the zzso zzso as well as to several probable structures of the zzso zzso of which the correct one was zzso by means of a single zzso zzso The analysis of the spectrum of the zzso zzso was zzso due to the presence in its structure of the zzso zzso with the terminal zzso whose spectral data could not be calculated by additive schemes using only zzso zzso However in zzso of the zzso spectral data by taking into account the zzso from zzso of the chemical shifts values in zzso of the related zzso to reveal the most probable structure of the zzso repeating zzso zzso see zzso
