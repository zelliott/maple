zzso and zzso zzso of zzso regulate the expression of zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have isolated an upstream element of about 1 zzso in zzso This DNA zzso contains a zzso box zzso 48 zzso upstream of the zzso start site and includes zzso factor binding sites for zzso and zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso promoter zzso can drive the zzso of a reporter gene when zzso into the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which zzso express zzso zzso analyses of the promoter indicate that zzso zzso zzso sequence directs the highest level of reporter gene zzso There are one and possibly two sites of zzso zzso
