A group of zzso zzso species belonging to the zzso zzso are known for their capacity to accumulate up to zzso of their zzso dry weight as zzso with most of this zzso being in the form of zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of the gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso compare it with an authentic zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso a related species that lives within the same native zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows a high degree of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso but lacks the zzso zzso activity in zzso explaining why little or no zzso levels of zzso zzso are observed in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso on the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso to better resemble zzso that originate from zzso zzso species results in increased zzso zzso activity, but these zzso were not sufficient to fully gain the activity observed in the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is localized predominantly within the zzso in zzso the principal site of zzso zzso in zzso By using a zzso zzso approach, we show that an Ala to zzso zzso acid zzso at the predicted active site of zzso results in a new zzso capacity to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso higher capacity to zzso zzso thereby establishing the evolutionary relationship of zzso and homocysteine zzso zzso in zzso
