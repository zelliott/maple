A zzso zzso containing a zzso insert was isolated from a zzso library of chicken zzso zzso by screening with an zzso zzso probe for a putative zzso zzso of chicken zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibits about zzso identity to those of zzso zzso and about zzso to those of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis for total zzso preparations from several chicken zzso revealed that transcripts detected with zzso were present exclusively in zzso and zzso In a chicken zzso the transcripts were detected in zzso but not in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso for the human zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso containing the insert of zzso demonstrated the production of a zzso which showed about zzso higher affinity for chicken zzso than for chicken zzso The affinity for chicken zzso was significantly higher than for human zzso In consistency with the zzso specificity of the zzso a significantly higher level of zzso zzso of zzso was detected when the zzso cells were treated with chicken zzso than with chicken zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso is a zzso clone for the chicken zzso
