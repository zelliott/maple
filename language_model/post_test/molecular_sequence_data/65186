The human nuclear zzso zzso zzso binding zzso replication protein A zzso is a zzso consisting of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso interaction is zzso by several zzso zzso zzso two major (A and B, also known as zzso and zzso and several minor zzso and D, also known as zzso and zzso and, presumably, by zzso Here, using zzso experiments, we investigated an interaction of zzso deletion zzso containing a subset of the zzso with partial DNA duplexes containing zzso zzso tails of 10, 20 and 30 zzso The zzso were generated using either a zzso zzso group zzso embedded in the 3' end of the DNA zzso or a group connected to the 3' end by a lengthy zzso zzso zzso In the absence of two major zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso core zzso was capable of correctly recognizing the zzso template junction and adopting an orientation similar to that in native zzso Both zzso and zzso contributed to this zzso However, the domain contribution differed depending on the size of the zzso In contrast with the zzso core, the zzso zzso core zzso was incapable of zzso recognizing the zzso junction structures, suggesting an orchestrating role for zzso in this zzso
