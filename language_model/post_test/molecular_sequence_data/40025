During study of a zzso aromatic zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso which is a fast-growing strain related to zzso zzso a DNA segment with very high similarities to the zzso element of zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequence zzso was discovered for the first time in 1994 during a study of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This element had thus far been detected in most human, zzso and environmental zzso zzso zzso but not in other zzso species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the present paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of zzso an zzso element present in several copies in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that this element is commonly found in fast-growing zzso zzso Moreover, zzso searches against the recently zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that this strain contains four zzso zzso Analysis and sequence comparison of the whole of the zzso elements revealed several common features not found in the most closely related zzso members, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
