The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso coding gene in the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso contains a group I zzso with a length of zzso zzso The identification of the DNA sequence as a group I zzso is based on its sequence zzso to other zzso group I zzso Its group I zzso contained the highly zzso sequence elements zzso zzso zzso and S found in other group I zzso Surprisingly, the zzso sequence of zzso zzso is more similar to that of zzso zzso than to the one found in zzso zzso This is in contrast to the sequence identity found on the neighboring zzso This is an interesting finding and suggests a horizontal transfer of group I zzso zzso
