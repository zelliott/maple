The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces an alkaline active zzso zzso zzso which differs from many other zzso in being zzso stable under alkaline conditions as well as at elevated zzso Compared to zzso active zzso this zzso has a high percent composition of zzso zzso acids which results in high ratio of zzso to positively charged zzso A positive correlation was observed between the charge ratio and the pH zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was zzso using a hanging drop diffusion zzso The zzso belong to the space group zzso and the structure was determined at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso has the common zzso zzso structure of family 10 zzso however, unlike zzso active zzso it has a highly zzso charged surface and a deeper active site zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso acids which are close to the zzso zzso has shown that zzso zzso and zzso are important to zzso zzso at high zzso Unlike the wild type zzso which has optimum pH at zzso the triple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was constructed using sequence information of alkaline sensitive zzso was zzso active around pH zzso Compared to zzso active zzso the alkaline active zzso have highly zzso surfaces and fewer zzso exposed zzso zzso zzso Based on these results obtained from zzso structural and zzso analysis, the possible mechanisms of high pH stability and zzso are zzso This will provide useful information to understand the mechanism of high pH adaptation and engineering of zzso that can be zzso stable at high zzso
