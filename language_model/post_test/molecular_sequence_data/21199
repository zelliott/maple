zzso is a property of zzso assembled in zzso that has been highlighted in a variety of zzso This characteristic was assessed for zzso river zzso at the community scale and at the bacterial population zzso At the community scale, zzso was evaluated on stainless steel and copper zzso coupons used both as zzso colonization supports and as working zzso At the population scale, the ability of environmental bacterial strains to catalyze oxygen reduction was assessed by zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso river zzso development on the electrodes, measured by dry mass and zzso a content, resulted in significant increases of the recorded zzso with zzso of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on stainless steel zzso and zzso zzso on copper zzso zzso bacterial strains isolated from natural zzso river zzso were tested by zzso zzso Twenty-five were able to catalyze oxygen reduction, with shifts of potential ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso peak zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and peak zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso These zzso were diversified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and exhibited various zzso properties zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso river zzso communities and/or most of their zzso bacterial populations present the ability to promote electronic exchange with a metallic zzso supporting the following zzso zzso development of zzso sensors allowing in zzso zzso river zzso detection and zzso production of microbial fuel cell zzso under zzso zzso
