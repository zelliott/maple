The zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from an expression library in zzso coli using a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a positive clone revealed the presence of an open reading frame of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of this sequence with zzso from other bacteria showed a significant degree of zzso in both the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso The zzso zzso was determined to be 1 zzso in size, which is the expected size for a zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso was found to be regulated at the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis, using the zzso gene as probe, indicated that zzso zzso can be divided into two zzso These groups zzso to the zzso zzso AB and ABC, respectively, as well as to the two types of zzso zzso based on the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso
