The notion of zzso zzso activity as a participant in starch synthesis is gaining zzso zzso reports from zzso analyses zzso either zzso or zzso as a zzso in zzso formation and whether zzso plants zzso one or the other, or both, of these zzso zzso in starch synthesis is zzso Recent results on the zzso zzso in zzso suggest that both forms of zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso We wished to find out if zzso takes part in starch synthesis by comparing zzso gene activity under three conditions: zzso during starch zzso in developing sink zzso zzso during starch degradation in zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression after applying zzso a starch zzso We isolated the gene for barley zzso zzso and zzso its expression and regulation in zzso seeds, developing zzso and zzso zzso and compared the zzso gene expression in sink zzso from three different zzso Our results indicate that zzso gene activity is involved in starch synthesis in zzso plants and is modulated by zzso
