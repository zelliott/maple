In zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor B1 zzso transcript contains in its zzso region a zzso upstream open reading frame zzso as zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso encodes a novel zzso the coiled zzso zzso protein 56 zzso zzso in zzso We show that zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso and contains 87 zzso acids in flies and 106 in humans with the two proteins sharing zzso zzso acid zzso We show by rapid amplification of zzso ends and Northern zzso that zzso zzso protein and zzso are zzso on a bona fide zzso zzso We report the generation and characterization of two zzso zzso lines in zzso carrying the zzso and zzso zzso Lack of the zzso protein in flies zzso a zzso delay and zzso zzso by arrest of zzso development at the third zzso zzso zzso larvae show a significant decrease in the level of fully assembled zzso c zzso zzso and in its activity, suggesting a zzso in complex zzso the activity of the other zzso zzso complexes remained either unaffected or increased in the zzso zzso zzso The lethal zzso and the decrease in zzso were partially rescued by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso These results indicate an important role for zzso in the zzso zzso system and in particular in zzso function required for proper development in zzso zzso We propose zzso as a candidate factor required for zzso zzso
