zzso zzso in zzso zzso is brought about by cooperative interactions between zzso DNA sequences zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso factors, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, DNA repair gene zzso which plays a role in zzso DNA repair and zzso of proteins including zzso is also involved in zzso albeit in a unique way; its effect on zzso and zzso structure of the donor zzso is dependent on their switching zzso Earlier, we hypothesized the existence of a zzso of zzso that plays a role in zzso of the zzso structure coincidentally with DNA replication associated with zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a zzso protein as an in zzso target and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The level of this protein is greatly elevated in zzso zzso and zzso as compared with wild type zzso Both the deletion and zzso of the gene zzso this protein elicit zzso loss of zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and associates with zzso locus during S phase in wild type zzso Interestingly, it contains a zzso motif similar to that of zzso zzso and like zzso zzso it interacts strongly with zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso renamed as the zzso zzso protein zzso is an in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Thus, regulation of association of zzso with zzso and zzso followed by degradation may play a role in zzso of inactive zzso structure at the silent zzso zzso
