The low temperature form of human zzso zzso was zzso from a zzso solution and its structure was refined to the R value of zzso at zzso A resolution by the zzso zzso zzso Average estimated standard zzso of atomic parameters for zzso atoms were zzso A for coordinates and zzso zzso for zzso temperature factors zzso The magnitude of equivalent zzso temperature factors zzso was highly correlated with the distance from the molecular zzso and fitted to a zzso equation as a function of atomic zzso The atomic zzso motion was rather zzso in the core region and the zzso increased towards the molecular zzso The statistical analysis revealed the zzso motion of zzso oxygen zzso indicating that zzso groups are in zzso zzso around a zzso zzso The zzso model, which describes the zzso motion in terms of translation, zzso and screw motions, was adopted for the evaluation of the molecular motion and the zzso parameters were determined by the zzso fit to zzso The reproduced zzso from the zzso parameters was in fair agreement with observed zzso but differences were found in regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where zzso was larger than zzso because of large local zzso To evaluate the internal motion of zzso the contribution of the zzso motion was determined to be zzso % of zzso in zzso which was the highest zzso to satisfy the condition that the zzso zzso of the internal motion have positive zzso zzso The internal motion represented with atomic zzso zzso clearly showed local motions different from those observed in zzso zzso which have a backbone structure very similar to zzso The result indicates that the internal motion is closely related to biological function of zzso
