The zzso capacity of the zzso zzso of the zzso coronavirus S protein was examined by testing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso which consists of the zzso 330 zzso acids of the zzso zzso both of which exhibited zzso capacity, were able to prevent the binding of zzso virus to the zzso while the zzso protein zzso which failed to bind to the zzso zzso and zzso which lacks the zzso and zzso zzso normally existing in the zzso were unable to prevent the binding of zzso By using cultured zzso cells, it was revealed that the infection of cells by zzso virus was significantly inhibited by zzso but not by zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein is not involved in the zzso binding of zzso zzso
