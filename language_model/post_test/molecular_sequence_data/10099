zzso is the most abundant zzso in the zzso Although generally resistant to degradation, it may be zzso by zzso organisms that have evolved a variety of structurally distinct zzso zzso and zzso for this zzso zzso I zzso I) is the major zzso produced by the zzso fungus zzso zzso accounting for 5 to zzso of the total amount of zzso produced by this zzso Together with zzso I from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso the zzso is classified into family 7 of the zzso zzso and it zzso zzso with a net retention of the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso core domain zzso 1 to zzso of zzso I from zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution by the molecular replacement method using the structures of zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso I as search zzso By employing the zzso zzso symmetry zzso the structure was refined zzso despite the limited zzso The final model has an zzso of zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso I reveals an extended, open zzso zzso rather than a tunnel as found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This confirms the earlier proposal that the zzso zzso in zzso I have been deleted in zzso I, which has resulted in an open active site in zzso I, enabling it to function as an zzso zzso of the structure of zzso I with several related zzso reveals structural similarities, and differences that relate to their biological function in degrading particular zzso A possible structural explanation of the drastically different pH profiles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I is zzso
