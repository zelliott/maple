zzso 1 and 2 are unique members of the basic zzso zzso family as they are zzso zzso Here we report the identification and zzso characterization of mouse zzso a zzso zzso of zzso which is missing the zzso zzso repressive zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in kidney and skeletal zzso however, the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso differs between these zzso Similar to full-length zzso zzso interacts with zzso and to a lesser extent, zzso The effects of zzso on zzso regulation through zzso zzso and central zzso response elements are different than that of full-length zzso Specifically, zzso exerts a less repressive effect on zzso gene expression than full-length zzso but is just as effective as zzso at zzso zzso gene expression from a zzso response zzso Interestingly, zzso bind to and activates expression from a central zzso response zzso reporter through an zzso zzso zzso zzso The differences in expression pattern, protein zzso and zzso activities between zzso and zzso may reflect differential roles each zzso plays during development or in zzso effects on other zzso zzso
