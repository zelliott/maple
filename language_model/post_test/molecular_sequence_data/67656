We previously identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which is designated zzso syndrome zzso region 17 zzso because it is located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso syndrome zzso Recent zzso analysis of zzso cells treated with a high concentration of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was one of the zzso genes possibly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso Khan, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso To assess its roles, we first expressed zzso zzso in zzso cells and demonstrated that it was zzso and localized mainly in the zzso apparatus, as is the case for the other zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed in insect cells showed very low activity toward typical zzso zzso zzso We then suppressed the expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells using zzso and observed zzso changes of the zzso cells with reduced zzso formation, altered zzso profiles, and unusual zzso of zzso in the late zzso zzso of zzso pathways revealed that zzso but neither zzso nor zzso zzso was elevated in the zzso zzso This was further supported by the findings that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, altered zzso and inhibited zzso zzso therefore plays important roles in zzso formation and the regulation of zzso as well as zzso Our study suggests that a subset of zzso produced by zzso controls dynamic membrane trafficking, probably between the cell surface and the late zzso through zzso in response to the zzso concentration as exemplified by environmental zzso
