More than 40 peptides associated with zzso and zzso which are highly abundant in zzso debris of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Among these zzso we found that a novel compound, which was called zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso effect and viral zzso zzso Its 50% effective concentration was zzso zzso while its 50% zzso concentration was 54 zzso The zzso activity of zzso was observed with several strains of zzso including zzso zzso and with zzso within the concentration range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited giant cell formation on the zzso of zzso and zzso cells but modestly inhibited direct zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit reverse zzso zzso A zzso study, which involved monitoring of the appearance of zzso DNA by using the zzso chain reaction technique, found that zzso exerted its effect on a process, most probably zzso fusion or zzso immediately after virus zzso
