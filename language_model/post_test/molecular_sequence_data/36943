The zzso origin of zzso from zzso has long been suspected and has been confirmed in recent years by many lines of zzso Debate now is centered on whether zzso are derived from a single zzso event or from multiple events involving several zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso analysis was undertaken using the zzso zzso acid sequences from the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a published analysis zzso and Turner, zzso of zzso sequences of small zzso zzso zzso to examine the relationships among purple bacteria, zzso and the zzso of zzso algae (including zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso green algae, zzso and land zzso zzso within and among groups are generally consistent among all the zzso for example, zzso cluster with zzso (and not with green zzso in each of the trees and zzso are ancestral to or the sister group of the zzso zzso One notable exception is that zzso are associated with the green zzso lineage in zzso zzso zzso and zzso trees and with the zzso zzso lineage in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences suggests that only a single bacterial zzso event occurred leading to zzso in the various zzso and plant zzso In contrast, analysis of zzso and zzso sequences strongly suggests that zzso are zzso in origin, with zzso being derived independently from both purple bacteria and zzso A hypothesis consistent with these zzso trees is that a single bacterial zzso event occurred leading to all zzso followed by the lateral transfer of the zzso zzso from a purple zzso to a zzso
