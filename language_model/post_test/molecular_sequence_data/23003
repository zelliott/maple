High zzso rate in zzso zzso DNA generates a highly divergent pool of zzso even within species that have dispersed and expanded in size zzso zzso analysis of 277 human zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso zzso zzso excess of zzso and zzso base zzso among hotspots of zzso zzso Most hotspots involved transitions from zzso to zzso that, with zzso zzso illustrate the zzso bias in zzso usage at synonymous sites on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso varied significantly more than any other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were involved in 259 of the zzso zzso acid replacements zzso The ratio of zzso changes from and to zzso and zzso differed significantly zzso zzso zzso between populations with neutral zzso and populations with significantly negative zzso D values zzso independent of their geographic zzso In contrast to a recent suggestion that the excess of zzso zzso is characteristic of Arctic zzso zzso their role in cold adaptation, we demonstrate that the surplus of zzso zzso is a general feature of the young branches of the zzso tree, affecting also those that are found only in zzso We introduce a new zzso method of the zzso rate of synonymous transitions to estimate the zzso times of zzso zzso
