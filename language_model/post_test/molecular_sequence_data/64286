Growth of plant zzso relies on coordinated cell proliferation followed by cell growth, but the nature of the zzso signal that specifies organ size remains zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso Our previous study using a zzso zzso of zzso revealed the presence of zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso and zzso two functional zzso of zzso play redundant but unique roles in a part of the zzso signaling pathway, and that synergistic interaction of three zzso zzso define aerial organ zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso they enhanced zzso defects in a unique zzso Overlapping but distinct roles of zzso and zzso can be ascribed largely to their intricate expression patterns rather than their functions as zzso zzso Loss of the entire zzso family genes led to striking zzso reduced lateral organ size and abnormal flower development, including defects in zzso polar expansion, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso These defects are due to severely reduced cell zzso Our findings place zzso zzso as redundant receptors that link cell proliferation to organ growth and zzso
