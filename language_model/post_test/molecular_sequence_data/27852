The synthetic zzso zzso has been zzso by zzso X-ray zzso techniques and the structure refined to R zzso zzso and zzso A resolution, with the location of 94 zzso zzso The sequence zzso as a full turn of a zzso zzso with ten zzso zzso and two zzso zzso The analysis clearly shows that the zzso are of the form zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the stability of the duplex is strongly pH dependent, with a maximum at pH zzso suggesting that the zzso is stabilized by zzso Three different arrangements have been observed for zzso between zzso and zzso and it is likely that zzso mismatch zzso is strongly influenced by zzso interactions with adjacent zzso
