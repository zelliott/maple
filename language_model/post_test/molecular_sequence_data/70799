zzso the major soluble protein component of the avian and zzso eye zzso is zzso to the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso In duck zzso there are two delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is both a major structural protein of the lens and also the duck zzso of zzso an example of gene zzso Although zzso identical to zzso in the zzso acid zzso zzso is zzso zzso A series of hybrid proteins have been constructed to assess the role of each structural domain in the zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where the three numbers zzso to the three structural zzso and the value of 1 or 2 represents the protein of origin, zzso or zzso zzso constructed and zzso and zzso zzso The kinetic analysis indicates that only domain 1 is crucial for restoring zzso activity to zzso zzso and that zzso acid zzso in domain 2 may play a role in zzso zzso These results confirm the hypothesis that only one domain, domain 1, is responsible for the loss of zzso activity in zzso The zzso characterization of human zzso zzso and duck zzso and zzso indicate that delta zzso are slightly less stable than zzso with the zzso being the least zzso The zzso of unfolding are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso This result was unexpected, and we speculate that delta zzso have adapted to their structural role by adopting a slightly less stable zzso that might allow for enhanced zzso and zzso zzso
