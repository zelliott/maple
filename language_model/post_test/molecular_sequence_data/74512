In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new zzso that exhibits high zzso activities against a range of oil zzso and demonstrates a differential capacity to zzso various zzso zzso and zzso metal species from marine zzso under zzso and seawater zzso zzso This zzso zzso was produced by a new zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso number zzso during growth in a modified zzso zzso medium amended with zzso zzso Chemical and zzso analysis showed it to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso was notable in that it contained zzso as the major sugar component at unusually high levels zzso not previously reported for a zzso zzso The zzso was shown to zzso various metal species from marine zzso function zzso zzso by its high content of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso strength zzso using zzso M zzso however, caused a significant reduction in zzso ability to zzso the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the importance of zzso a physical zzso intrinsic of seawater, in influencing the interaction of microbial zzso with metal zzso In zzso zzso may represent a new class of zzso zzso with a potential for use in zzso applications as an zzso or zzso zzso In addition to the zzso potential of these findings, the ecological aspects of this and related bacterial zzso in marine environments are also zzso
