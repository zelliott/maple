The variable zzso zzso zzso and joining zzso region zzso zzso zzso genes zzso can perform like zzso and are thought to have initiated development of the zzso immune system in early zzso by splitting archaic V genes with zzso zzso In zzso fishes, the zzso zzso light chain genes are organized as multiple zzso zzso zzso some zzso are capable of zzso while others contain fused zzso The latter may be key to understanding the evolutionary role of zzso Are they relics of the archaic zzso or are they results of zzso in germ cells? Our data suggest that some fused zzso genes are not only recently zzso but also resulted from zzso activity involving hairpin zzso zzso studies show that these, like some other zzso zzso zzso are expressed at significant levels only early in zzso We suggest that a rejoined zzso gene may not merely be a sequence restricting zzso diversity, but is potentially a novel zzso no longer tied to zzso zzso expression and zzso From the combined data, we arrived at the unexpected conclusion that, in some zzso zzso is still an active force in changing the zzso
