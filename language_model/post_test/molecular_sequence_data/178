A prior knowledge of protein structural classes can provide useful information about its overall structure, so it is very important for quick and accurate determination of protein structural class with zzso method in protein zzso One of the key for zzso method is accurate protein sample zzso Here, based on the concept of zzso zzso acid composition zzso zzso zzso structure, function, and zzso zzso 2001), a novel method of feature extraction that combined continuous zzso transform zzso with principal component analysis zzso was introduced for the prediction of protein structural zzso zzso the digital signal was obtained by mapping each zzso acid according to various zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to extract new feature zzso based on zzso power spectrum zzso which contains more abundant information of sequence order in frequency domain and time domain, and zzso was then used to reorganize the feature zzso to decrease information zzso and zzso zzso Finally, a zzso acid composition feature zzso was further formed to represent primary sequence by zzso zzso zzso with a set of new feature zzso of zzso in an zzso space by zzso As a zzso the rigorous zzso zzso test was performed on the working zzso The results indicated that prediction quality has been improved, and the current approach of protein representation may serve as a useful complementary vehicle in zzso other attributes of zzso such as zzso family class, zzso zzso membrane protein types and protein secondary structure, zzso
