The increasing interest in click chemistry and its use to stabilize turn structures led us to compare the propensity for zzso stabilization of different zzso designed as mimics of the zzso structure found in zzso The zzso zzso of linear zzso zzso peptides and zzso zzso were compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their zzso structures and their propensity to fold in zzso in solution, and for those not structured in solution in the presence of zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and by restrained molecular dynamics with energy zzso The linear zzso zzso and both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso adopt zzso in solution a zzso zzso closely related to the one observed in zzso On the contrary, the zzso zzso peptides such as zzso zzso zzso zzso , and the zzso zzso zzso zzso , both specifically designed to mimic this zzso do not adopt stable structures in solution and do not show any characteristics of zzso zzso However, these zzso peptides specifically interact in the active site of zzso as shown by zzso and zzso transfer difference zzso experiments performed in the presence of the zzso and are displaced by zzso a specific zzso zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso peptides may not be regarded as zzso stabilizers, but can be considered as potential zzso zzso
