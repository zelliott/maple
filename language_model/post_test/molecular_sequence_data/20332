Small heat shock proteins zzso are products of heat shock response and of other stress responses, and ubiquitous in all three zzso of life, zzso bacteria, and zzso They mainly function as molecular zzso to protect proteins from being zzso in extreme zzso Study on insect zzso could provide some insights into evolution of insects that have adapted to diverse niches in the zzso 

Taking advantage of the newly assembled zzso zzso we performed a zzso analysis of the candidate zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso Based on known zzso zzso zzso we identified 16 zzso zzso zzso Most of them are distributed on two zzso zzso 5 and 27, zzso 15 of 16 zzso zzso have expression zzso The comparative analysis of insect zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that there is only one zzso cluster whereas remaining clusters are zzso on the zzso zzso This suggested that most of zzso might have zzso in function across insects zzso In addition, the data presented in this study also revealed that zzso in the insect zzso cluster are highly zzso in both sequence and expression zzso In sum, insect zzso show a completely different evolutionary pattern from that found in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso has the largest number of insect zzso genes characterized to date, including 16 zzso The zzso that most zzso zzso might have zzso in function across insects investigated will help us understand the zzso of these insects to diverse zzso
