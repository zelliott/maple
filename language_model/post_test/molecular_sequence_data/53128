zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso syndrome characterized by zzso and zzso overgrowth zzso which clinically resembles the zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso and zzso involving the zzso gene ( zzso ) have been shown to be associated with zzso Occasionally, these deletions also include the zzso gene ( zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso which have a role in the control of cell growth and cell zzso We have examined the zzso status of the zzso and zzso genes in one patient with Perlman syndrome, three patients with overgrowth without syndrome diagnosis, ten unrelated zzso and 11 zzso zzso We identified one zzso patient with a deletion of a zzso zzso Six zzso patients showed point zzso in zzso One zzso three nonsense, and one zzso zzso predict a zzso of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso changes an zzso acid that is zzso in all zzso identified so zzso A zzso protein that reproduces this zzso is poorly processed and fails to increase the cell surface expression of zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso is also a zzso zzso In three zzso patients and in all zzso patients, no zzso could be zzso We found three single zzso zzso in the zzso gene but no evidence for zzso zzso in zzso associated with zzso
