The zzso are a family of zzso zzso proteins with biological roles in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso to zzso determined from two crystal forms reveals a zzso that is similar to that of the protein zzso zzso with two zzso an additional zzso zzso and an extra zzso The zzso zzso in zzso displays a zzso zzso this feature is not seen in zzso zzso due to a shift in the relative position of the zzso motif between the two zzso The occurrence of a zzso in one crystal form suggests that zzso may zzso during its biological zzso The zzso interface involves a region of the zzso zzso that is analogous to the zzso domain in zzso zzso and may mediate interactions with its zzso
