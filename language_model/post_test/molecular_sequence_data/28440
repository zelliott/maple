Several plasma and membrane proteins belong to a zzso of structurally related proteins that contain internal zzso of a variable number zzso of repeating zzso Each zzso (short consensus zzso unit is approximately 60 zzso acid zzso in zzso with the positions of 1 zzso 2 zzso and 4 zzso zzso being zzso The aim of this study was to provide experimental evidence that each zzso may exist as an independent structural domain maintained by zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso with eight zzso units in each of its seven identical chains was chosen for this zzso Analysis of the zzso pattern indicated that zzso zzso bonds may be localized within each zzso unit, with the first and third and the second and fourth zzso in each unit being zzso This pattern of zzso may zzso to zzso (and to other structurally related zzso a zzso which apparently allows the assembly of the zzso units zzso in a tandem zzso Such an arrangement of the zzso zzso may explain, in part, the zzso shape of these protein zzso The structural motif of the zzso units of zzso is discussed in relation to those previously described for the type II domain of zzso and the zzso structure present in various proteins of the zzso zzso
