The zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso with high sequence specificity at sites that contain zzso zzso zzso Although they are abundant in zzso many of these potentially zzso junctions are protected from zzso activity by secondary zzso To zzso the process of zzso selection in long zzso zzso a multiplex zzso was developed for simultaneous comparative analysis of 50 or more different zzso in one zzso Using this approach, the efficiency of 80 zzso sites within the E6 component of a full-length zzso zzso transcript was zzso The activity of molecules selected in this system was then compared in a conventional zzso with zzso of intermediate and low zzso This confirmed the results observed in the multiplex zzso with zzso of zzso inducing substantial zzso of the long zzso These zzso regions are potentially accessible to other zzso directed agents such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso in addition to finding the most effective zzso for a particular target zzso this method may also be zzso to locating accessible sites for other zzso zzso gene suppression zzso
