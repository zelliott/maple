The present study examined 1) whether the zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs in the nuclear or zzso fraction of the liver cell, and 2) whether the selective zzso regulation of zzso zzso stability might result from zzso changes introduced in the processing or zzso of the primary zzso The disappearance of zzso zzso after zzso is restricted to the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso changes in steady state levels of the mature nuclear transcript were observed that mirrored the transient zzso changes previously reported for zzso gene zzso When zzso 24 h after zzso (when zzso zzso is virtually zzso in the zzso zzso the steady state levels of both the primary and mature zzso transcripts found in the nucleus were the same as observed in control zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso or selection of zzso sites on the zzso as determined by high resolution gel analysis of the zzso and DNA sequencing of zzso clones isolated from a liver library from an zzso male zzso Most zzso zzso have zzso tracts several hundred zzso in zzso and recent studies have demonstrated that a change in the stability of a number of zzso zzso directly with the degree of zzso zzso contrasts sharply with this, first because it has an exceptionally short zzso tail of 17 zzso and second because the degree of zzso is totally unrelated to its zzso in response to zzso These findings indicate that a unique zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso stability by zzso in zzso
