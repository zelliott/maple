zzso zzso zzso has been shown to stimulate plant growth and to suppress the growth of plant zzso organisms including zzso However, the mechanism underlying its effect against zzso remains zzso In this study, we screened a random zzso library of zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso zzso zzso and identified a zzso strain F5 with attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction revealed that three candidate genes zzso zzso and zzso that were disrupted by the zzso in strain F5 potentially contributed to its decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso impaired in the three candidate genes demonstrated that directed deletion of gene zzso resulted in loss of zzso activity comparable with that of the F5 triple zzso zzso has been reported as being involved in zzso of zzso a zzso zzso with zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analyses of surface extracts revealed that zzso bearing a molecular weight of zzso Da was present in zzso zzso zzso zzso but absent in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the organic extract containing zzso also showed a moderate zzso zzso We conclude that a novel gene zzso and its related zzso are involved in the zzso effect exerted by zzso zzso zzso against zzso
