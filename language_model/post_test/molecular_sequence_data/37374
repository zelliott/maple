Due to the large size zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and the existence of over 400 zzso identifying zzso in patients with zzso zzso is labor zzso We compared the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso patients from varying zzso who were carrying common zzso zzso We used zzso to determine zzso zzso To our surprise, all of the most common zzso zzso in our large multiethnic cohort were associated with specific zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso predated zzso zzso but not zzso zzso We conclude that these frequently observed zzso zzso are not hot spots, but have occurred only once and spread with time to different ethnic zzso More generally, a combination of zzso and zzso zzso could be used as a screening strategy for identifying zzso in other large genes by first determining the ancestral zzso and zzso zzso in order to identify specific founder zzso We estimate this approach will identify approximately zzso of zzso in zzso patients across all ethnic zzso
