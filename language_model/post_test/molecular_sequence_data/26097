We used zzso fusion proteins containing parts of the zzso zzso tail to zzso those regions of the tail responsible for each of the three steps in the successive zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stafford, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Fusion proteins containing the terminal approximately zzso of the zzso tail assemble zzso but deletions within the last 100 zzso acids of the tail sequence alter or prevent zzso The first step in zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso requires the zzso approximately 30 zzso acids that are thought to form a zzso domain at the end of the zzso The second step, formation of zzso zzso requires the last approximately 40 zzso in the zzso The final step, the association of two zzso zzso to form the completed zzso zzso requires zzso approximately zzso from the end of the zzso A region of the tail near the junction with the heads is important for tight packing of the tails in the zzso zzso zzso induce the lateral zzso of zzso formed from native zzso or fusion proteins containing a zzso zzso but under the same conditions fusion proteins composed essentially only of zzso tail sequences with very little zzso sequences form zzso The region of the tail necessary for this zzso formation lies zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso in the native zzso zzso
