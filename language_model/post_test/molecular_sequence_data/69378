Feeding a zzso zzso plus zzso zzso diet to rats increases zzso cholesterol concentration and zzso to levels generally found in human native zzso zzso By using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and electron zzso we isolated, zzso and identified zzso structures zzso zzso and zzso as a major zzso cholesterol transport in zzso human and rat zzso It was estimated that more than zzso of zzso cholesterol is transported in these zzso carriers, which were identified by transmission electron zzso as zzso zzso and zzso bodies within zzso zzso of rats with cholesterol zzso zzso By zzso a characteristic and constant protein profile was found associated to the zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso and used for preparation of a rabbit zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso rat zzso By Western zzso it was established that the zzso low density fraction of zzso zzso containing zzso was enriched with the zzso zzso The zzso protein was characteristically detected at the zzso membrane by Western zzso of zzso zzso zzso and by zzso of rat and human liver zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso of the zzso protein demonstrated a complete identity with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies show that zzso lipids may acquire an ordered zzso structure that is present in the zzso of rats with zzso zzso These zzso zzso are similar to zzso bodies and zzso material frequently found in other zzso suggesting common zzso zzso and functional zzso The identification of zzso N associated with zzso zzso is consistent with the involvement of the zzso membrane in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso
