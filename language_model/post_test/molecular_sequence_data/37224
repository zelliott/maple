The basic zzso protein zzso activates zzso of the zzso gene and is essential for terminal differentiation of zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso complexes with its partner basic zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be a strong zzso of zzso by zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso in the zzso gene identified several zzso elements in addition to the zzso binding site for zzso We identified by expression cloning the zinc finger protein zzso also known to exist as a longer form, zzso as the protein binding to one of the zzso sensitive zzso zzso lacks an intrinsic zzso domain and by itself did not activate zzso gene zzso Here we show that zzso can associate with zzso to enhance its zzso zzso Both DNA binding and physical interaction of zzso with zzso are required to zzso zzso Thus, zzso does not function as a classical zzso of zzso that recruits an zzso domain to a zzso zzso zzso may be distinguished from zzso which increase zzso without zzso DNA zzso We suggest that zzso should be considered a zzso of transcription, representing a distinct category of zzso zzso
