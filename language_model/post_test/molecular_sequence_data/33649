zzso is a novel tumor zzso located in the critical zzso zzso region frequently deleted in multiple zzso We previously showed that zzso mice display a complex zzso zzso with a predisposition to zzso The goal of this study was to analyze possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso - an aggressive inflammatory cancer associated with exposure to zzso 

zzso zzso in clinical specimens of zzso was assessed via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso and zzso evaluation zzso zzso A possible link between zzso expression and exposure to zzso was studied using zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso in zzso were assessed through expression array analysis of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was zzso in approximately zzso of zzso specimens while loss of zzso zzso region observed in approximately zzso of zzso including stage 1 zzso Exposure to zzso led to a zzso suppression of zzso which we found to be zzso zzso array studies showed that zzso activates zzso of multiple genes with tumor zzso properties and zzso zzso zzso thus supporting its role as a tumor zzso In agreement with our knockout model, zzso zzso zzso and also modulated more than 40 other genes zzso zzso of total zzso zzso associated with immune zzso Among these zzso we identified zzso and zzso key zzso that regulate zzso T and B cells and play important roles in systemic zzso zzso Finally, clinical significance of zzso zzso effects was validated on the expression array data produced previously on clinical specimens of zzso In this analysis, 42 zzso targets proved to be zzso modulated in zzso serving as disease zzso 

Our data support zzso potential of zzso define its targets, and underscore its importance as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
