The zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso and zzso zzso the second and fourth zzso of zzso zzso Although the single zzso species yielded a zzso zzso zzso Western zzso with zzso zzso showed a major band of zzso and minor zzso zzso zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso zzso showed that the zzso band contained zzso zzso and an zzso zzso suggesting the occurrence of independent zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid of zzso zzso was zzso In zzso processing zzso showed that zzso zzso was decreased by the zzso zzso zzso accompanying the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that fused zzso is the precursor to mature zzso Large amount of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is discussed from a viewpoint of its zzso zzso
