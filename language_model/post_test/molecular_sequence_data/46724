In higher plants, zzso genes are transcribed by at least two types of zzso zzso zzso One of them is the well-known zzso zzso type of zzso that recognizes zzso promoters consisting of zzso and zzso consensus zzso The other recently recognized zzso zzso has been found to be zzso entirely in the nucleus, and it recognizes a completely different set of zzso designated previously as zzso type II zzso zzso Here, we report the development of an in zzso zzso system using zzso zzso of cultured tobacco zzso zzso This system zzso and accurately zzso zzso from zzso zzso The conditions for in zzso zzso were zzso by using the tobacco zzso promoter, which has been found to be the most highly expressed zzso promoter in zzso Analysis of in zzso zzso initiation in a series of zzso zzso deletion zzso revealed that sequences upstream of zzso zzso do not influence the zzso activity of this zzso A zzso region zzso zzso to zzso was further analyzed by introducing single or multiple zzso zzso into two regions zzso I and box zzso of high sequence zzso We report here that the zzso sequence zzso box II and the zzso to zzso region zzso to zzso zzso in box I significantly influence the activity of this zzso zzso
