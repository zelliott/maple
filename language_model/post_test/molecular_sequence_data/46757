zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso synthesis is strictly regulated during the cell zzso To investigate zzso zzso regulation, we have analyzed zzso interactions at the promoter region and in the first zzso in zzso zzso and following serum zzso Twenty putative zzso sites, distributed in two divergent promoters at the zzso zzso were identified in zzso by zzso zzso These elements bind zzso factors continuously throughout the cell cycle with the exception of one zzso consensus site, located in the first zzso at position zzso This zzso site becomes strongly occupied 18 h after serum zzso zzso that an zzso zzso complex plays a role in zzso of the zzso gene at the onset of S zzso We detected a zzso zzso zzso transcript by Northern zzso zzso This zzso has no apparent coding capacity and is zzso transcribed from a promoter located within the first zzso We suggest that zzso of the zzso gene is accomplished through base pairing between sense zzso and zzso zzso The binding of S zzso zzso complexes at the zzso element may help to overcome the negative effect of the zzso transcript, which results in zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso
