zzso proteins control the formation and zzso of zzso bonds during the folding of zzso and membrane proteins in zzso zzso a member of this family, has zzso bond zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present two crystal structures of zzso at zzso zzso resolution that are meant to represent the reduced and oxidized forms, zzso The oxidized structure, however, reveals a mixture of both zzso forms, suggesting that oxidized zzso is less stable than the reduced zzso This trait would contribute to zzso zzso activity, which requires that the zzso zzso zzso are kept reduced, regardless of the highly zzso environment of the zzso We propose that a zzso zzso that is zzso in the zzso loop of zzso and zzso but not found in other zzso proteins could play a role in this zzso Also, the structure of zzso reveals an unanticipated and surprising feature that may help define its specific role in zzso protein zzso Thus, the dimensions and surface features of zzso show a very large and charged binding surface that is consistent with interaction with zzso protein zzso having charged zzso This finding suggests that, rather than catalyzing zzso zzso in unfolded zzso zzso may zzso act later in the folding process to catalyze zzso zzso in folded or partially folded zzso
