zzso zzso is a Venezuelan scorpion known to cause severe human zzso It contains toxins that impair proper zzso channels function, affect zzso pathways and interfere with the zzso system, leading to a widespread inflammatory zzso This communication reports the results of genes cloned from a zzso expression library of zzso zzso from zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso library was prepared from which zzso genes were cloned and grouped in 22 clusters showing more than one zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso and 29 zzso zzso The identified putative proteins were assorted into two zzso One zzso by precursors similar to gene products implicated in common cellular zzso accounting for zzso of transcripts and other zzso putative zzso representing 50% of total zzso A total of 14 sequences are thought to be peptides that recognize or affect zzso function and 6 peptides that affect zzso Among these two classes of zzso components are several for which the peptides were previously isolated and zzso However, based on sequence similarities, three distinct classes of peptides were also identified and are reported: a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of unknown zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of several peptides is reported here for the first zzso A zzso tree analysis is also reported, as well as three three-dimensional models of representative zzso
