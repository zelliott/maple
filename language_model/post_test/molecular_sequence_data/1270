zzso zzso is a common compatible zzso found in zzso and zzso zzso In this study we characterized a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso with extensive zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which catalyze the consecutive synthesis and zzso of zzso to yield zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli, and we confirmed the combined zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso The optimum activity of the zzso was at 50 degrees zzso To examine the properties of each zzso domain of zzso we expressed them separately in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso while the zzso was stable and was zzso zzso zzso cannot be grown sufficiently to identify zzso compatible zzso and zzso coli harboring zzso did not accumulate zzso However, zzso zzso expressing zzso accumulated zzso confirming that this gene product can zzso this compatible zzso and arguing for a role in zzso adjustment in the natural zzso We did not detect zzso activity in cell extracts of zzso zzso Here we describe the first gene and zzso for the synthesis of zzso from a zzso zzso and discuss the possible evolution of this zzso zzso by lateral gene transfer from zzso and zzso zzso
