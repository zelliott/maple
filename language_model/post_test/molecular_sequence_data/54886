Four efficiently zzso zzso coli zzso strains isolated from the blood of humans zzso pigs zzso and rats zzso and zzso were tested for their ability to adhere and zzso across human gut zzso zzso and zzso cells, to elicit a zzso response and for the presence of 47 zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more efficient in zzso and zzso than rat zzso had identical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso more than zzso belonged to different zzso and zzso but the same zzso group as zzso zzso strains zzso significantly higher zzso response in both cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso induced the highest zzso response which may be associated with its zzso zzso Apart from zzso genes zzso and zzso that were carried by all zzso zzso and zzso carried capsule synthesis gene zzso III and zzso carried the zzso toxin zzso The lack of known zzso genes and the ability of zzso to efficiently adhere and zzso whilst causing zzso response suggests that these strains may carry as yet unidentified genes that enable their zzso zzso
