zzso zzso are zzso regulatory zzso frequently expressed as zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that the zzso cluster zzso approximately 92 has important roles in tissue development and zzso However, the precise role of each zzso in the cluster is zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso results in decreased cell zzso migration and zzso zzso mice zzso zzso showed overall growth zzso smaller zzso and greatly reduced zzso cell zzso We found that zzso and the zzso zzso domain containing 3A zzso are two targets that have their expression zzso by zzso both in zzso and in transgenic zzso Several lines of evidence support the notion that zzso causes cellular defects through its repression of zzso zzso Our single zzso expression zzso may be evolved to allow the manipulation of individual zzso functions in zzso and in zzso We anticipate that this could serve as a model for studying gene regulation by zzso in the development of gene zzso
