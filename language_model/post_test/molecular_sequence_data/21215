zzso genes are important sources of data for studies of evolution and protein zzso To date no service has been made available online to aid in the large-scale identification of fused genes in zzso zzso We have developed a program, Gene zzso that analyzes uploaded protein sequence files for characteristics of gene fusion events and presents the results in a convenient web zzso 

To test the ability of this software to detect zzso on a zzso scale, we analyzed the zzso gene models predicted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso detected members of eight of the nine families of gene zzso known or predicted in this species and identified zzso new families of fused zzso each containing between one and twelve zzso In addition to these genuine zzso Gene zzso also detected a particular type of gene zzso in which two independent genes were predicted as a single transcript by gene zzso zzso zzso of the artifacts detected by Gene zzso in the initial zzso have been corrected in subsequent versions, with a total of 25 zzso artifacts (about 1/3 of the total zzso zzso remaining in the most recent zzso 

The newly identified zzso zzso belong to classes of genes involved in processes such as zzso zzso nuclear export, and surface zzso zzso These results highlight the potential of Gene zzso to reveal a large number of novel fused genes in zzso isolated zzso Gene zzso may also prove useful as an ancillary tool for detecting fusion artifacts during gene model zzso
