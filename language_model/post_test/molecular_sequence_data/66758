To verify and expand the known spectrum of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso type 1 zzso gene zzso in chronic zzso 

DNA extracted from zzso chronic zzso patients was zzso for zzso gene zzso by zzso and DNA zzso A control cohort of 90 unrelated healthy individuals was zzso by the same methods for presence of common zzso zzso and frequency of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of gene aberrations in single zzso gene copies were zzso by long-distance zzso followed by zzso zzso and DNA zzso 

The most frequent zzso gene zzso zzso was found at a frequency of zzso Furthermore, we detected the zzso intervening sequence zzso 3 + 2 T zzso C zzso gene in 2 German patients and 1 zzso chronic zzso zzso In all three zzso gene copies an additional rare base substitution was zzso zzso region zzso G zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that all three affected genes carried the same zzso zzso DNA sequencing of another chronic zzso gene zzso zzso zzso did not reveal any zzso in these 3 zzso 

We found in 3 zzso of zzso chronic zzso patients an zzso + 2 T zzso C zzso gene zzso and a base substitution zzso G zzso A in the same gene zzso Most probably the zzso G zzso A represents a rare zzso and not a zzso as previously zzso zzso analysis suggests a common origin of the zzso + 2 T zzso C zzso in these zzso
