zzso which was first reported over a century ago, is caused by zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso in seven zzso zzso (A through zzso The primary structures of a number of these zzso have been determined and are reviewed here, together with their gene structure and zzso The biological actions of zzso which result in their ability to block neurotransmitter release have been the subject of intensive study, and in this review we discuss the binding of zzso to the cell surface as well as the mechanism of their zzso zzso The ability of zzso to block neurotransmitter release has been exploited in therapeutic applications to reduce muscle zzso for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions associated with zzso muscle zzso and zzso The advantages, limitations, and risks of these applications are zzso Certain compounds provide some limited protection against zzso However, more effective protection has been obtained zzso either by passive immunity zzso by administration of zzso zzso or by zzso with zzso zzso More recently, excellent protection has been obtained by zzso with the zzso region zzso the zzso zzso 860 to zzso zzso zzso of the heavy chain of zzso Here we review the mapping of the zzso on the zzso region of zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso raised in zzso human, and zzso The zzso on the zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso and by zzso T zzso were mapped in two mouse strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso which contain zzso or T cell zzso (or zzso on the zzso were used as zzso in zzso and zzso mice and we identified those peptides whose zzso and/or zzso response zzso with zzso Identification of these peptides is an important first step in the intricate requirements for the design of a synthetic zzso
