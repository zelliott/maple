The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso coding for the zzso protein zzso was zzso We compared the deduced zzso acid sequence with the zzso sequence of zzso coli K zzso The mature proteins differ in only 19 of 309 zzso acid zzso corresponding to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso control region by zzso zzso revealed that two zzso zzso and zzso constitute the zzso control region zzso zzso and zzso function in a synergistic zzso zzso is the main promoter of the zzso its activity is 20 times the activity of zzso Both promoters are activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso While zzso is inactive in the absence of the zzso complex, there is residual activity of zzso under these zzso Studies on the zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso were hampered by the zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in a partially zzso expression of the zzso zzso The results indicate that only zzso is responding to induction by zzso A weak promoter, zzso within the zzso region but divergent to it was zzso zzso is neither zzso by the zzso complex nor by zzso We cloned the gene located downstream to zzso and found it to strongly repress the expression of the zzso zzso We termed this gene zzso The presence of zzso abolished the repression caused by the zzso zzso gene zzso
