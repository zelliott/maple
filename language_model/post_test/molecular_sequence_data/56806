To determine the zzso zzso zzso we have developed an approach based on zzso chain reaction zzso Using this method several zzso zzso strains have been screened for the presence of the zzso B zzso A DNA zzso of the selected strain zzso zzso containing zzso B gene has been obtained by the zzso method and cloned in the zzso zzso It is shown that zzso B with the leader zzso forms zzso complexes in zzso coli cells, whereas the mature toxin is present in zzso fraction in a soluble zzso The zzso toxin made up for zzso of the total cellular protein in zzso coli zzso 109 zzso
