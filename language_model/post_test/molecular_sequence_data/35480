We developed a simple and reliable genetic method to determine sex in bats from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to amplify a portion of the zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We designed zzso to produce size variation between the zzso and zzso products that could be zzso using gel zzso Using an example from our zzso research, we show how sex data generated using this method are superior to sex data based on external zzso Our method allows for the generation of sex data across a wide range of bats that can be used to address key questions in wildlife zzso zzso zzso conservation and evolutionary zzso
