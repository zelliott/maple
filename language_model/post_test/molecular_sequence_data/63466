zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso signals across the plasma zzso with the zzso zzso zzso acting as zzso in this zzso Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of an zzso zzso zzso To assess the influence of the membrane model system, structure zzso of the zzso zzso zzso segment and zzso sequences were carried out in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso a zzso linear zzso encompassing zzso zzso is adopted, of which zzso appear embedded in the zzso zzso zzso This relatively long zzso zzso implies a pronounced zzso tilt within a typical zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso charged side chain out of the zzso core while simultaneously immersing zzso zzso in the zzso A zzso of zzso zzso hydrocarbon tails does not lead to the transfer of zzso into the zzso phase, suggesting that the reported embedding represents the preferred zzso zzso The nature of the zzso zzso affected only the zzso part of the zzso zzso indicating that an zzso zzso distribution is not required for studying the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso are also embedded but zzso from linear zzso zzso in contrast to zzso which closely resemble the zzso zzso
