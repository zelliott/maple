Among the 10 zzso of the M group of human zzso virus type 1, zzso C is the most prevalent in India and may dominate worldwide in the near zzso however, there has been no report on the infectious DNA clone of this zzso We have isolated an infectious DNA clone of the zzso strain of zzso zzso C, which was isolated in India in zzso zzso cells, which are derived from zzso zzso cells and express zzso were zzso with the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA of the infected cells was used as a template for amplification of the zzso zzso The zzso DNA obtained was zzso into zzso and the resulting zzso was designated as zzso The insert of zzso was zzso zzso in length and had an intact zzso organization with open reading frames of all zzso zzso and accessory zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso sequence of zzso is closely related to those of zzso zzso C isolated in zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells yielded as much virus as did zzso one of the most widely used zzso DNA zzso The recovered zzso virus infected zzso but not the parent zzso cells, indicating that zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was reacted efficiently with the zzso of zzso patients of India, but not of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also confirmed by zzso
