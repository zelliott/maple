In this study, zzso from roots and zzso zzso of zzso plants were isolated using starch zzso zzso supplemented with zzso and zzso zzso Three hundred and zzso zzso were isolated with 77 zzso obtained from plant roots and 240 zzso from zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso showed that zzso strains were rich in the zzso of zzso acid, a result consistent with their assignment to the zzso The remaining 28 strains were assigned to zzso based on the presence of zzso of zzso acid in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity against soybean pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso overlay zzso zzso zzso 365 showed the highest activity with an zzso ratio of zzso with no zzso activity on the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that isolate zzso 365 shared zzso similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso which contained zzso were also identified by zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The results showed that they were members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
