To investigate specific properties of zzso cells zzso which are not shared by other zzso cells, we compared gene expression patterns of mouse DC and zzso by differential zzso zzso One of the zzso identified coded for a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene is expressed in a subset of bone zzso DC and is zzso after zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed by zzso DC, zzso DC and zzso cells in the zzso No expression was detected in bone zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso zzso has no zzso activity on zzso peripheral zzso T zzso In contrast, zzso induced migration of primed zzso zzso T cells with a preference for zzso cells during the early phase of the T cell zzso These observations suggest that zzso directs migration of zzso T helper cells to DC in zzso as well as in zzso zzso
