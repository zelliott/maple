zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso necessary for defense against zzso zzso zzso have evolved to inject maternal zzso factors into the host zzso to suppress zzso zzso for the successful development of their zzso In this study, the full-length complementary DNA zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso Its zzso contained a 2 zzso pair zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso Two putative zzso sites, a zzso zzso site, three zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso motif were found in the deduced zzso acid zzso According to both multiple alignment and zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso gene cloned here is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso fluid resulted in reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, demonstrating the ability to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso showed that transcripts of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso from larvae had not significantly changed following zzso injection, suggesting that the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was not employed by zzso zzso to cause failure of zzso in zzso zzso While decreased zzso zzso zzso gene expression was observed in the zzso after zzso fluid injection, no zzso zzso change was induced by zzso indicating that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso fluid might play a minor role involved in zzso the zzso zzso
