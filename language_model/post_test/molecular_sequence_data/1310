An zzso zzso protein fraction was identified which zzso partial protection against an zzso zzso challenge zzso From this fraction a 37 zzso protein was zzso and its corresponding zzso was cloned and shown to zzso a zzso zzso zzso Full length zzso zzso zzso from two related species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso between the primary zzso acid sequences of these three zzso zzso zzso was rather low zzso demonstrating an evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso crystal structure was used to generate a zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso which demonstrated that the many variations in the primary zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show only zzso zzso had not resulted in altered zzso Only a single zzso gene was identified in zzso which was active as a zzso The protein was present at similar levels throughout different zzso stages zzso zzso zzso and zzso but its corresponding zzso was only observed in the zzso stage, suggesting that its synthesis is restricted to the zzso zzso
