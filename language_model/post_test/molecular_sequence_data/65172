Human zzso zzso are present in virtually all cervical zzso An important step in the development of zzso disease, including cervical cancer, involves a loss of sensitivity to transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso type 16 zzso early gene zzso including that of the E6 and zzso zzso zzso is under the control of the upstream regulatory region zzso and E6 and zzso expression in zzso human zzso cells is inhibited at the zzso level by zzso While the zzso contains a myriad of zzso factor binding sites, including seven binding sites for nuclear factor I zzso the specific sequences within the zzso or the zzso factors responsible for zzso zzso of the zzso remain zzso To identify potential zzso factors and binding sites involved in zzso zzso of the zzso we performed zzso I footprint analysis on the zzso zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso human zzso zzso treated with and without zzso zzso protected regions were found to be located around zzso binding zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using the zzso binding sites as zzso showed decreased binding upon zzso zzso This decrease in binding was not due to reduced zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of individual and multiple zzso binding sites in the zzso defined their role in zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso of the zzso family members in zzso decreased the ability of zzso to inhibit the zzso Since the zzso Ski has been shown to interact with and increase the zzso activity of zzso and since cellular Ski levels are decreased by zzso treatment, we explored the possibility that Ski may provide a link between zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ski in nuclear extracts from zzso confirming that zzso and Ski interact in these zzso Ski levels dramatically decreased upon zzso treatment of zzso and zzso of Ski eliminated the ability of zzso to inhibit the zzso Based on these studies, we propose that zzso zzso of zzso early gene expression is zzso by a decrease in Ski levels, which in turn dramatically reduces zzso zzso
