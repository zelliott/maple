zzso of the D1 protein zzso is a zzso component closely associated with the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso reduces the primary donor zzso and zzso is then zzso by the zzso cluster that zzso zzso We aimed to investigate whether water zzso by zzso could occur through an alternative zzso in the absence of zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso was performed in zzso presumed to be in the environment of zzso Full sequence zzso was introduced in two regions of the D1 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are close to zzso by zzso and at zzso zzso which are assumed to be close to zzso in the zzso zzso at position 161, the zzso combinations were designed to not give rise to a zzso zzso The zzso DNA mixture was used to transform an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso at position 161 zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected in which zzso growth was zzso resulting in 11 viable zzso In all of these zzso however, a zzso zzso was found at position 161, introduced either by complex repair processes or as a result of zzso zzso Additional zzso found in zzso neighboring zzso mostly retained zzso II properties similar to those of wild zzso However, in two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth was impaired and the relative variable zzso was zzso Computer simulations of the environment of zzso suggest that the position of zzso varies with respect to some neighboring zzso without major functional zzso We conclude that zzso fulfills a critical role through its chemical nature and positioning and that this function cannot be zzso by another zzso at a nearby zzso
