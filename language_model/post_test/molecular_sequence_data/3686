zzso alignment predicts that zzso of pig heart zzso zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso of the zzso coli zzso which interacts with the zzso in the crystal structure zzso et zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are close to that zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, and zzso The zzso zzso has zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso for wild zzso Thus, zzso is not involved in zzso binding and has a minimal effect on zzso In contrast, zzso exhibits a zzso for zzso 40 times that of wild type and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso values for zzso and zzso similar to those of wild zzso These results zzso zzso in the region of the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso by Q or F yields zzso with no zzso zzso The zzso zzso bind zzso poorly, under conditions in which wild type and zzso bind zzso zzso of zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is important for the binding of zzso The zzso zzso bind zzso zzso as do zzso and the other zzso zzso However, as distinguished from the zzso zzso the zzso zzso are not zzso zzso by metal zzso zzso that the metal zzso is not bound zzso Since circular zzso zzso are similar for wild type, zzso and zzso these zzso acid zzso do not cause major zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of zzso results in zzso change in the zzso CD spectrum and therefore in its secondary zzso We propose that zzso plays a significant role in the binding of zzso contributes to the proper coordination of zzso metal zzso in the presence of zzso and maintains the normal zzso of the zzso
