Computer methods for database search, multiple alignment and cluster analysis indicated significant zzso between zzso sequences of 21 zzso or zzso zzso zzso All of them were found to be involved in the reduction of organic nitrogen compounds and zzso zzso A zzso motif was found which may be important in zzso binding and in zzso zzso zzso studies between these zzso and some zzso zzso and zzso or zzso with unknown functions provided new insight into the evolution of these zzso zzso of these genes seemed to be facilitated by transfer of genetic elements such as zzso and zzso
