In order to identify important promoter elements controlling the zzso expression of the soybean gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso promoter deletions were fused to the zzso reporter zzso To allow the detection of positive and negative regulatory zzso a series of 3' deletions were fused to a zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso placed upstream of the zzso zzso Both types of construct were introduced into zzso zzso plants and soybean roots via zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso activity in roots, root zzso and shoots of transgenic plants revealed that a strong zzso positive element zzso of 400 zzso located in the promoter zzso region is indispensable for the zzso expression of zzso Interestingly, this zzso was able to direct zzso expression in both a zzso and zzso background to a level similar to that driven by the zzso zzso full-length zzso In addition, results showed that separate zzso zzso located in the first zzso zzso relative to the zzso start site, are essential for zzso and root zzso zzso This zzso region contains an zzso and two zzso consensus sequences characteristic of zzso or zzso gene zzso A putative zzso region containing the same zzso consensus sequence was identified between the zzso and the zzso zzso The presence of positive, negative and zzso elements together with the three zzso consensus sequences within the promoter strongly suggest that these multiple promoter fragments act in a cooperative manner, depending on the spatial zzso of the DNA for zzso factor zzso
