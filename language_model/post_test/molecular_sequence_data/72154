zzso is a common site of zzso integration in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies have localized zzso to a region approximately 18 zzso upstream of another common viral integration site, zzso on mouse zzso 5 zzso X, Jenkins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 69, zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger zzso factor involved in zzso zzso To determine if zzso encodes a gene separate from zzso that might also be involved in zzso disease, we have searched within the zzso locus for novel zzso A zzso zzso transcript was identified in these studies that spans the zzso locus and is disrupted by viral integration at zzso This transcript is expressed in all embryonic and adult mouse zzso zzso While blast searches indicated that zzso is a novel zzso zzso were detected between zzso and a known zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso thus encodes a gene separate from zzso that may also be involved in zzso zzso
