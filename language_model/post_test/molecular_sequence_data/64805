zzso of zzso tissue is frequently observed in chronic inflammation and zzso A similar response of zzso to injury, referred to as zzso cardiac zzso zzso occurs in certain zzso strains of zzso We now examined a putative inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong zzso expression was found zzso with zzso in zzso strain zzso which exhibited low zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was zzso higher than in resistant strain zzso which exhibited zzso zzso without zzso and little zzso zzso zzso analysis identified several zzso in zzso and zzso sites in zzso zzso Their potential relevance for zzso was tested in zzso mice, which shared the zzso locus with zzso but retained a zzso segment from zzso on zzso zzso zzso These mice exhibited strong zzso expression and zzso comparable to zzso suggesting that a zzso of zzso zzso residing on zzso 7 and not the zzso gene on zzso 5 was responsible for the genetic differences in zzso zzso A known zzso zzso zzso by a gene on zzso 7 is the transforming growth zzso which was more induced zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso
