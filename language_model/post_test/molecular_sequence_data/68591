zzso strains were isolated from four patients treated with zzso for more than 6 months and from three patients zzso with zzso zzso from patients treated with zzso have been cultured by passage of virus in cell culture in the presence of 1 zzso zzso However the zzso from patients zzso with zzso could not be cultured in the presence of zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso which had been cultured in the presence of zzso were amplified by zzso and cloned to zzso zzso Four zzso acid zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with resistance to zzso were zzso All of the 22 clones obtained from the zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso had zzso at zzso zzso or zzso Some of the 22 clones also had other zzso at zzso 67 zzso zzso 70 zzso and zzso 219 zzso or zzso Four zzso acid zzso in zzso gene of the zzso which had been cultured in the presence of zzso were compared to that of the zzso cultured in the absence of zzso The clones of the zzso obtained from the patients zzso or zzso had zzso at only zzso 215 zzso in both the presence and the absence of zzso All of the clones of the zzso obtained from the patients zzso or zzso had zzso at zzso 215 and some of them had other zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
