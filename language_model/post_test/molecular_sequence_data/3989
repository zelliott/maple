zzso T cells play critical roles in zzso zzso and maintaining zzso immune zzso One way to improve current tumor vaccines that mainly induce zzso would be to activate zzso zzso T cells that recognize zzso class II restricted tumor associated zzso Human zzso reverse zzso zzso is zzso expressed by various tumors and, therefore, could be a universal tumor zzso In this study, we used a combined approach of using the prediction software zzso to select class II zzso candidates and in zzso zzso biological analysis to identify class zzso zzso in zzso We first identified several zzso zzso zzso candidates in zzso by examining human zzso responses to synthetic zzso We then characterized these zzso zzso zzso candidates by establishing and analyzing zzso zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso T cells specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso can respond to naturally processed zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso T cells recognized zzso zzso from various tumors, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and zzso Thus, the identification of the naturally processed zzso zzso zzso together with the previous finding of class zzso zzso zzso provide a basis for the combined application of class zzso and zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso long-term zzso and zzso zzso responses against a broad spectrum of zzso
