zzso an antibiotic, exhibits potent zzso activity against most zzso cells including those of higher zzso plants and zzso by binding to zzso The zzso gene of three independently isolated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In all three zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso gene was altered to zzso coding for zzso zzso displacement experiments confirmed that the substitution of zzso for zzso zzso resistance to zzso in this zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso surrounding the 100th zzso acid zzso from the zzso including zzso are highly zzso with a few zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the budding zzso zzso zzso are naturally occurring zzso organisms whose zzso genes zzso zzso and Val respectively at the 100th zzso acid zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso were altered to zzso using zzso zzso and gene displacement zzso The zzso zzso strains of these two zzso uniquely expressing zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso or zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso is normal except for its sensitivity to zzso These results suggest that zzso resistance has a common basis in both naturally occurring species and zzso selected zzso in the substitution of zzso or Val for zzso in zzso
