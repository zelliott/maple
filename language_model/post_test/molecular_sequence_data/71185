zzso zzso zzso zzso feeding activity, zzso and mating behavior in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned a novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso that has high sequence zzso with zzso receptors from other zzso When zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso exhibited zzso binding activity and activated zzso signaling in a manner analogous to other zzso zzso However, zzso displayed unusual pharmacological properties, which resembled both zzso and zzso receptors but did not correlate well with any of the known zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso that differ by 48 zzso zzso acids were zzso The two zzso were found to have virtually identical binding and signaling properties but differed in their levels of zzso zzso with the longer zzso being four times more abundant than the shorter species in all zzso stages zzso Taken together, the results describe two zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which has some of the properties of the zzso family but whose pharmacological profile does not conform to any known class of zzso
