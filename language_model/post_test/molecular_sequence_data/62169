A gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso which is a component of the zzso zzso system, was cloned from the onion zzso zzso zzso The identification of this gene and the previously reported genes zzso zzso and zzso provides evidence that the zzso system exists in zzso In addition, a gene zzso an zzso membrane protein zzso (a type of zzso membrane zzso of zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso gene consisted of 702 zzso zzso a protein of 233 zzso which was highly similar to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Part of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli, zzso and used to raise an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso reacted specifically with an zzso plant extract in Western zzso analysis and was therefore useful for the detection of zzso as well as zzso zzso has a zzso protein motif that is known to be exported by the zzso system of zzso zzso A partial zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli was localized in the zzso as a zzso zzso processed form of the zzso It had probably been exported from the zzso to the zzso through the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso and detected in zzso plants was apparently also zzso Because zzso cannot be cultured or transformed, little information is available regarding their protein zzso zzso This study suggests that the zzso system operates in this zzso to export zzso zzso
