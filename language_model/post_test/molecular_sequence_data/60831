Three zzso zzso zzso generated against rainbow trout zzso cells zzso have been selected for their ability to protect cells from the viral zzso zzso virus zzso infection, a zzso zzso Protection from infection was restricted to the zzso cell lines indicating species specificity of the blocking zzso Surprisingly, the blocking activity of these zzso was also effective against other zzso related fish zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso observations demonstrated that the three zzso were all directed against an abundant cell plasma membrane zzso and zzso studies indicated that the target consisted of a zzso complex with molecular masses of 200 and 44 zzso zzso data provided the following evidence that zzso is part of this complex and that it could represent the main zzso for fish zzso zzso An zzso generated against the zzso protein reacted against the zzso rainbow trout zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso rainbow trout zzso was able to bind specifically to zzso To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a cellular component acting as a primary zzso for a virus replicating in lower zzso and, more interestingly, for viruses belonging to the zzso zzso
