A zzso chain reaction zzso test was developed to aid in identification of zzso zzso and for use in surveys for infected zzso of zzso zzso zzso A set of zzso zzso was designed based on the DNA sequence of a zzso zzso surface zzso zzso The predicted product was a zzso zzso DNA zzso The target zzso was amplified from free zzso zzso larvae (both zzso and zzso individual infected zzso pools of 30 mosquitoes (including a single infected zzso infected mosquitoes stored desiccated at room temperature for 7 zzso and whole blood from a dog infected with zzso zzso These zzso did not amplify a zzso zzso from a zzso or from 4 other species of zzso zzso (including 1 other zzso zzso zzso larvae from zzso mosquitoes also were zzso zzso zzso identified tentatively as zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso There was no amplification using the zzso test for zzso identified tentatively as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data provide a strong indication of the specificity of these zzso The potential utility of this technique for detecting the presence of zzso zzso in field populations of mosquitoes is zzso
