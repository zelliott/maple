A zzso zzso zzso fragment, cloned in zzso coli, that carries part of a cluster of genes zzso zzso zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso on both zzso The sequence consists of a truncated zzso zzso an zzso region zzso a zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, the zzso gene and the zzso part of zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso with a deduced zzso of zzso A very high and zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in extracts of zzso coli zzso B zzso transformed with the zzso zzso zzso on a zzso A zzso band of zzso 27,000 was detected by zzso of heat-treated extract from such a zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by the same zzso zzso open reading zzso The deduced sequence of 410 zzso acids zzso to a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can complement a double zzso zzso zzso coli zzso to zzso zzso of a heat-treated extract of the zzso double zzso zzso coli host showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities zzso in a single peak corresponding to zzso zzso Both activities were also zzso at the same temperature and strongly inhibited by zzso These results suggest that both activities can be ascribed to a single zzso
