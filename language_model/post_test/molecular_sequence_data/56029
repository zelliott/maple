The initial step of zzso zzso and zzso degradation was studied in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are converted into their zzso A zzso zzso by two different specific zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso is active as a zzso of molecular mass 48 zzso as determined by gel zzso and zzso At a pH optimum of zzso the apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso A are 37 zzso 77 zzso and 125 zzso zzso The zzso zzso specifically with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso of zzso notably 3- or zzso are zzso and zzso and zzso act as competitive zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso were raised and used in zzso zzso to study the regulation of the expression of zzso zzso The zzso is zzso when cells are grown zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso are zzso via zzso The zzso is not present in cells grown zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso
