To explore the binding domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the interaction with protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso P 311 was amplified by zzso using zzso zzso 311 as zzso The total zzso of zzso zzso zzso was extracted by zzso to amplify zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 311 and zzso were constructed by zzso zzso and they were verified by zzso and zzso The secondary structure of protein zzso was analyzed with software zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were amplified based on the result of software zzso And then the zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, and 4 were constructed by zzso zzso and verified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were transformed into competent cells by zzso zzso method and divided into 7 groups roughly in the same amount, including zzso full zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hybrid groups, positive control group, and negative control zzso zzso in the first five groups were respectively transformed with zzso zzso zzso full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that in the rest two groups were transformed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Immediately after zzso a part of the transformed cells in each group was spread onto the medium lacking zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso called zzso lacking zzso and another portion of the cells was spread onto the medium lacking zzso and zzso zzso called zzso lacking zzso After 3 to 6 days' culture, the growth of zzso was observed, and the expression of zzso of zzso was detected by color reaction with zzso 

zzso zzso P 311 and the reported P 311 zzso ID zzso had the same zzso The A base at zzso zzso in reported zzso zzso ID zzso was replaced by G base as found in cloned zzso It was verified that the insert segment of each zzso zzso was zzso zzso Among those 216 zzso acids which composed the protein zzso 101 zzso acids might form zzso zzso 90 zzso acids might form random zzso 25 zzso acids might form zzso as revealed in the simulated structure analysis by zzso zzso zzso segments zzso 2, 3, 4 showed expected zzso It was verified that the insert segment of each zzso zzso was zzso zzso Except for strains in negative control group which did not show growth on zzso lacking zzso all strains in other groups grew on both kinds of media, and growth of colonies was less in zzso (with the fewest number of zzso zzso and zzso hybrid zzso zzso Positive expression of zzso was observed in strains of all groups growing on zzso lacking medium except for the zzso hybrid zzso No expression of zzso was observed in strains of negative control group which grew on zzso lacking zzso 

zzso zzso may closely bind with protein zzso by zzso zzso which plays an important role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
