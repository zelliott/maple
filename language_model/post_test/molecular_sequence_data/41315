A total of 300 zzso zzso were collected from 5 pig farms in two provinces in the Eastern part of Thailand in February 2011 and were subjected to viral isolation of influenza A zzso Two zzso and 6 zzso influenza A viruses were isolated from zzso collected from clinically healthy weaning pigs on farms in zzso and zzso provinces, zzso The zzso zzso consisted of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes closely related to Thai zzso and derived from a cluster of human seasonal zzso strains circulating around zzso The remaining gene segments of the zzso originated from the zzso zzso 2009 (A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was distinguishable from a human seasonal vaccine strain in the zzso seasons that represented zzso of the seasonal strains around zzso zzso zzso from a zzso farm yielded A zzso zzso viruses in chicken zzso eggs and zzso zzso A zzso zzso viruses isolated in this study grew poorly in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso region of the zzso protein of egg isolated viruses were identical to the sequences directly amplified from original zzso zzso Our result demonstrated that the A zzso zzso virus has been established in the Thai pig population and this has resulted in genetic zzso with Thai zzso that previously circulated among zzso
