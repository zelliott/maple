zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a spontaneously active, zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso specified by multiple zzso charged side zzso the one at position zzso + 3 being of crucial importance zzso consensus zzso Recently zzso has been reported to catalyze zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso fulfilling the consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Martin, zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that, by contrast to other zzso peptides fulfilling the consensus sequence for zzso a zzso zzso the sequence around zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso albeit with much higher zzso zzso versus zzso 3 zzso and lower zzso zzso versus zzso zzso than its zzso with zzso replaced by zzso The replacement of zzso at position zzso + 1 with zzso and, to a lesser extent, of zzso at zzso - 1 with zzso are especially zzso to zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso which is actually zzso by the zzso to zzso zzso In contrast the replacement of zzso at zzso + 3 with zzso almost suppresses zzso zzso but not zzso zzso It can be concluded that zzso is capable to zzso under special circumstances, zzso zzso which are specified by structural features partially different from those that zzso zzso zzso
