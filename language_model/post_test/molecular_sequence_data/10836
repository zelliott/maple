To assess the functional significance of putative proteins zzso by alternately spliced zzso of the sheep zzso zzso zzso a short form zzso zzso of the first four zzso zzso zzso mature zzso was engineered for expression in zzso zzso The expressed protein of molecular mass 15 zzso was zzso to zzso and verified by reaction with an zzso against a synthetic zzso sequence unique to the zzso zzso region zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain protein bound zzso zzso in a zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Further analyses by slot zzso revealed high affinity of the immobilized protein with significant reaction at 10 zzso As the immobilized zzso protein also reacted with structurally related hormones zzso zzso human zzso zzso we confirmed that interaction most probably occurred via the common zzso of these zzso zzso Our results reveal that this zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso major zzso for hormone recognition that could be zzso via the zzso A rabbit zzso to the zzso inhibited zzso action in zzso bearing cells, revealing the utility of such zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of hormone zzso
