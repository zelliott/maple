zzso spores can account for large proportions of air particulate matter, and they may potentially influence the zzso cycle and climate as zzso for water droplets and ice zzso in clouds, fog, and zzso Moreover, some zzso are major pathogens and zzso The diversity of airborne zzso is, however, not zzso By DNA analysis we found pronounced differences in the relative abundance and seasonal cycles of various groups of zzso in coarse and fine particulate matter, with more plant pathogens in the coarse fraction and more human pathogens and zzso in the zzso fine particle fraction zzso zzso Moreover, the ratio of zzso to zzso was found to be much higher than previously zzso which might also apply to the zzso
