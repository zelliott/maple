The gene and zzso zzso a putative zzso hormone beta zzso zzso from African zzso zzso zzso were zzso Similar to other zzso zzso the zzso gene consisted of three zzso interrupted by two zzso The zzso zzso coded for a mature protein of 115 zzso zzso The 12 zzso that are required for the typical zzso folding of zzso hormone beta zzso were zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso expression was exclusively detected in the zzso and was zzso before zzso development was zzso The zzso transcript levels increased in particular during early stages of zzso and reached constantly high levels after the first appearance of zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso cells were localized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of mature males caused elevated zzso zzso levels that were decreased by steroid zzso Previous work indicated that the African zzso is an interesting model to study the regulation of zzso functions because zzso is able to activate both the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso Because zzso zzso has failed so far, ongoing studies are directed toward the production of zzso zzso After all, the zzso and hormonal regulation of zzso transcript levels opens the possibility for zzso relevant actions of the putative zzso next to the zzso zzso acting zzso
