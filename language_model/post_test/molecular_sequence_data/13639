A highly effective zzso zzso method using a zzso cell sorting zzso automated cell deposition unit zzso that sorts single cells directly into zzso tubes was zzso To evaluate the sensitivity of this method, single zzso cells zzso one zzso zzso per zzso were zzso and 220 out of zzso samples zzso were zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, the number of samples accidentally containing more than one cell was determined by sorting single cells from a mixture of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was then performed, detecting zzso and zzso DNA zzso From 66 sorted cells, 2 zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso 31 zzso for zzso alone, 30 zzso for zzso alone and 3 zzso were zzso The zzso was then programmed to sort defined numbers of cells into zzso zzso This is similar to classic dilution zzso in that it allows the determination of the percentage of cells that was positive for a specific zzso The accuracy of multiple cell deposition by the zzso was evaluated by determining the percentage of zzso cells in defined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rates determined by the zzso correlated well with the rates expected from the given zzso
