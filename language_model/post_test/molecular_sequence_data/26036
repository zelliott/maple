An zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli zzso using the zzso zzso The constructed zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso derived from strain zzso zzso The cloned zzso isolated from zzso coli zzso zzso produced mainly zzso from zzso and exhibited temperature and pH activity profiles closely similar to those of the zzso from the original zzso zzso sequence analysis of the cloned DNA zzso revealed one open reading frame containing the gene which consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared with several other zzso three consensus sequences were identified in the region of the active zzso About 300 zzso acid zzso were present both upstream and downstream of the active site zzso
