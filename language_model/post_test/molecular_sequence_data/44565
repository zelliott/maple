During maturation of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso large zzso called zzso zzso zzso fuse with the zzso plasma zzso zzso in the gene zzso cause abnormal zzso in which the zzso do not zzso although they abut the plasma membrane zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso which we found to be approximately zzso zzso in length and to zzso a zzso zzso transcript whose expression is limited to the primary zzso the cells in which the zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a 235 zzso protein which is highly charged except for a putative zzso domain near the C zzso We identified the zzso associated with five zzso zzso all of which are zzso zzso causing single zzso acid zzso zzso is not similar to any characterized proteins in sequence databases, nor does it contain known functional motifs other than the predicted zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain makes zzso resemble some viral fusion zzso suggesting it may play a direct role in zzso membrane zzso zzso does show significant sequence similarity to several predicted human proteins of unknown zzso Two of the identified zzso zzso are located in regions of similarity between zzso and two of these predicted zzso This strengthens the biological significance of these similarities and suggests these regions of similarity represent functionally important zzso of zzso and the human zzso
