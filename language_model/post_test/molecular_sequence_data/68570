zzso respiratory zzso zzso an zzso gliding zzso associated with respiratory disease in rats, mice, and zzso has previously been cultivated only in zzso chicken eggs, cell culture, or cell culture medium supplemented with zzso medium from cultured zzso A reference strain of zzso zzso originally isolated in eggs, grew in cell culture zzso as adherent individual zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cell culture media supplemented only with fetal calf zzso Using zzso minimal essential zzso we isolated zzso zzso from naturally infected rats and a naturally infected rabbit and from zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso were maintained for up to 20 zzso zzso from rats were similar in zzso to the reference strain, but most were more actively zzso and formed zzso zzso The rabbit zzso were smaller and formed fewer zzso zzso of rat zzso differed only slightly in restriction zzso patterns from that of the reference strain, whereas that of the rabbit isolate was distinctly zzso zzso of zzso zzso of all strains from rats contained zzso zzso zzso zzso or both, and cultures of the zzso zzso from the rabbit contained an unidentified zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso gene of the reference strain was determined by amplification by zzso chain reaction, cloning of the product, and sequencing by the zzso chain termination zzso zzso of the sequence with sequences in the zzso data base indicated that zzso zzso is a unique zzso most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
