We examined zzso relationships of zzso zzso zzso worldwide to test the proposed existence of two geographic races and to zzso the timing and extent of demographic processes underpinning the expansion of this species across the Northern Hemisphere in the late zzso zzso variation within the left zzso domain of the control region occurred at low or moderate levels worldwide and was structured zzso zzso of genetic zzso among regions indicated that isolation by distance was the primary agent for differentiation of zzso populations but does not support the existence of distinct eastern and western zzso zzso of genetic variation and structure of zzso trees identify Asia as the origin of all extant zzso zzso A recent zzso is zzso with the most recent common zzso dating to the last ice zzso zzso have undergone two episodes of population expansion, likely corresponding to the final zzso of the most recent ice age and the onset of the current zzso zzso of expansion for the population in the zzso region of eastern Asia indicates that it is one of the oldest populations of zzso and may represent the source of founders of extant populations in North America, which were zzso within the last 15,000 zzso Our data suggest an extended period of low population size or a severe bottleneck prior to the divergence and expansion of extant lineages and a recent, zzso bottleneck among European zzso Climate change during the last ice age, acting through contraction and expansion of zzso habitat and the flooding of the zzso land bridge, undoubtedly was a key factor influencing the divergence and expansion of zzso zzso
