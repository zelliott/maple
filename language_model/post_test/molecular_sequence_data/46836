There are few genes that are specific and diagnostic for human zzso zzso and zzso are two of zzso zzso is unique, whereas zzso encodes distant similarity with some cellular zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso and sequence analyses show zzso zzso transcripts corresponding to minor full-length and abundant spliced forms of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The zzso donor and zzso sites do not fit consensus sequences for either major zzso or minor zzso zzso However, the spliced form can also be detected in a zzso zzso cell line; thus the novel sites are used by cellular zzso This zzso may represent a new minor zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso regulates gene expression by introducing a central stop zzso that abrogates production of the zzso zzso resulting in an zzso truncated zzso The use of zzso zzso and an infection time course showed expression of the two zzso transcripts with immediate early zzso However, the full-length product accumulated later, dependent on virus DNA zzso similar to zzso zzso analyses of 16 strains showed high variation zzso in zzso with conservation of the novel zzso zzso Representative strain zzso had similar zzso of expression and spliced zzso
