zzso C disease zzso is a zzso zzso storage zzso A variety of studies have highlighted defective zzso trafficking from zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso nature of additional accumulating zzso suggests that the cellular zzso may involve a more generalized block in retrograde zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso reveal that the zzso gene product resides in a novel set of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that can be distinguished from zzso zzso zzso Drugs that block zzso transport out of zzso also zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso relocation from zzso in cultured human zzso can be blocked at 21 degrees C, consistent with zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may zzso interact with zzso to facilitate zzso zzso Independent of defective zzso trafficking, zzso zzso are also deficient in zzso clearance of zzso zzso zzso modeling of the observed zzso clearance data targets the trafficking zzso caused by zzso in zzso to an zzso compartment zzso to zzso Low density zzso zzso by normal cells zzso retrograde transport of zzso through this same kinetic zzso further suggesting that it may contain the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a distinctive zzso containing zzso mediates retrograde zzso transport of zzso cargo that is not restricted to zzso
