The Survival Motor zzso zzso gene shows deletions in the majority of patients with Spinal zzso zzso zzso a disease of motor zzso zzso To date only two zzso zzso have been reported in zzso in patients with zzso The fact that no zzso have been forthcoming from zzso searching has resulted in a lack of hypotheses concerning the structural and functional consequences of these zzso Recently zzso has been shown to interact with zzso nuclear zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso zzso We describe a novel zzso zzso and the subsequent identification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence at the zzso of zzso which encompasses each of the three predicted zzso acid sequence zzso We have identified apparent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These sequences retain the highly zzso zzso motif and provide additional support for a role of zzso in zzso zzso
