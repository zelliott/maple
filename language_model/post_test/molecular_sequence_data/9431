zzso deletions have been associated with numerous diseases and zzso zzso zzso however, have been resolved at the molecular level because their zzso often occur in highly zzso duplicated zzso We present an approach that uses a combination of zzso cell hybrids, array comparative zzso zzso and the specificity of next-generation sequencing to determine zzso that occur within zzso zzso zzso our technique to the zzso zzso syndrome, we used zzso sequencing to determine zzso zzso in three zzso individuals with molecular zzso For two cases, we observed zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso involving only zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso resolution revealed that the zzso occurred at different locations within a 145 zzso segment zzso identity and disrupt zzso zzso known as zzso In the remaining case, we found that unequal crossover occurred zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso and that this event was zzso by a zzso sequence that was once again missing from the human zzso Interestingly, the zzso mapped zzso to gaps in the current reference zzso zzso which we resolved in this zzso Our method provides a strategy for the identification of zzso within complex regions of the zzso harboring zzso and zzso zzso zzso The approach should become particularly useful as high-quality alternate reference sequences become available and zzso sequencing of zzso DNA becomes more zzso
