The zzso zzso protein zzso containing an zzso zzso domain and three zzso zzso zzso is a heart and skeletal zzso protein that has been shown to zzso interact with protein zzso C beta zzso through the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We here demonstrate that zzso is zzso with a zzso protein zzso in the zzso region of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso system also showed the interaction of the zzso domain of zzso with zzso and zzso Furthermore, by combined use of the in zzso and conventional zzso cloning methods, we have isolated three zzso clones from a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso corresponding to rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter two containing only a single zzso zzso Deciphering their zzso zzso these zzso zzso appear to be generated from a single zzso gene by alternative zzso Northern zzso analyses using human cancer cells and mouse zzso have shown expression of each zzso zzso to vary considerably among the cell types and during the zzso zzso Together with a recent finding that zzso is markedly activated in the cardiac zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the heart development by scaffolding zzso to the zzso region and that zzso and zzso zzso zzso the scaffolding activity of zzso
