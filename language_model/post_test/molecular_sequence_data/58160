The sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that dictate the specific amplification of viral zzso in infected cells remain zzso We have analyzed the structure of the 3' zzso region of the viral zzso by zzso structure calculation and by chemical and zzso probing of in zzso zzso and provide evidence for the existence of an zzso zzso structure in this zzso To explore the functional significance of this structure, zzso of a zzso bearing a zzso in the proposed zzso and exhibiting a zzso zzso in viral zzso synthesis were isolated and zzso The results of this genetic analysis established a correlation between the structure of the 3' zzso of the viral zzso and its function in zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis indicated that a similar structure could be formed in zzso zzso a related zzso which further supports a role for the zzso structure in viral zzso amplification in infected zzso
