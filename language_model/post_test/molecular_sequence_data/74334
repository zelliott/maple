zzso peptides represent the most characterized and diverse class of peptides within the defensive skin zzso of zzso zzso With an ever expanding database of primary structures, the current accepted rules for nomenclature have become increasingly difficult to apply to peptides whose primary structural attributes are either unique or that fall between those that define existing zzso An additional factor that adds to the confusion is the regular zzso or revision of existing zzso In the present study, we have identified five new zzso zzso zzso in the defensive skin zzso of the Chinese zzso zzso frog, zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso by cloning of their respective zzso zzso As these peptides are obvious zzso of the zzso and zzso families we have named these in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reasons for adopting these names are zzso It is clear that with an ever-increasing number of zzso skin zzso peptides appearing in the literature that a consistent nomenclature scheme needs to be zzso
