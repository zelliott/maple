We performed an environmental study of viruses infecting the symbiotic zzso algae of zzso zzso zzso zzso Chlorella virus, zzso in Lake zzso the largest lake in zzso The viruses detected were all Chlorella zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso One of them, designated zzso was subjected to further zzso 

zzso formed small plaques and had a linear DNA zzso of 370 zzso as judged by zzso gel zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso DNA belongs to group zzso one of the most resistant groups among zzso zzso Based on a zzso tree constructed using the zzso zzso zzso was classified into two zzso A and zzso zzso belonged to zzso B, in contrast to all previously identified virus strains of group H that belonged to zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso composes a distinct species within zzso zzso zzso
