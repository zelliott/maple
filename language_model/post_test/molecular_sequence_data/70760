We report here the zzso zzso and functional characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is essential for zzso viability and zzso While zzso induced total zzso zzso cause zzso zzso partial zzso zzso cause zzso zzso such as extreme reduction of body size, zzso zzso hatched abdominal zzso and reduced female zzso zzso abnormalities characteristic of zzso are found in the zzso and a proportion of eggs laid by zzso zzso females zzso during zzso We show that zzso encodes an ubiquitous zzso protein that plays a central role in zzso zzso processing and zzso whose known zzso zzso are zzso zzso rat zzso and human zzso zzso by the gene responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic analysis represents the first in zzso functional characterization of a member of this highly zzso gene family from higher zzso In addition, we report that zzso hosts an zzso zzso box zzso zzso zzso the first member of this class of zzso identified so far from zzso
