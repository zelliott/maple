zzso is a zzso zzso that is widely used in clinical zzso zzso antibiotics such as zzso specifically bind to the zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso thereby interfering with protein zzso A selected zzso sequence from our former study, composed of 19 zzso zzso which was isolated from a zzso display library because of its ability to bind zzso displayed significant similarity to a portion of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein binds to zzso immobilized on a zzso sensor chip and the zzso constant was zzso The binding of zzso zzso protein to zzso DNA was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in gel mobility shift zzso zzso obtained from a natural product zzso also inhibited human zzso protein binding to zzso This study illustrates the general utility of the zzso display method in detecting zzso zzso
