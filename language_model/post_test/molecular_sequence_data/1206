Mice that are zzso for the kidney disease zzso zzso are apparently healthy for the first 8 weeks of life, but spontaneously develop a severe form of zzso zzso that zzso to zzso zzso disease zzso by 4 to 8 months of zzso By testing for linkage to zzso zzso we previously localized the zzso gene to a zzso zzso 

The sequence of the entire critical region was zzso and candidate genes were zzso These candidate genes were zzso in both zzso zzso mice and normal zzso The zzso was further characterized by zzso and electron zzso zzso mice were constructed that carried the zzso zzso of the prime candidate zzso and this zzso was transferred to a zzso background by zzso 

We have obtained evidence that zzso is a zzso zzso of a novel gene for a zzso zzso protein zzso This gene is alternatively zzso with the larger gene product having one domain that resembles zzso and another that is similar to zzso zzso zzso The smaller gene product includes only the first zzso An zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso defects are present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, and to a lesser extent, zzso and heart cells from zzso zzso In a line of zzso mice that carried the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso only 1 out of 13 animals expressed the disease by 120 days of zzso 

The zzso zzso codes for a novel protein that zzso to the zzso and the zzso mouse has zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This mouse is therefore a unique animal model for studying mechanisms that lead to zzso zzso
