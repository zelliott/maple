The human pathogen zzso zzso produces zzso that are essential for zzso to host surface zzso zzso the zzso at the zzso tip, was recently shown to have a zzso zzso The zzso bond is believed to be important in zzso zzso a mechanism of zzso attachment analogous to that used by human complement zzso Here, we have characterized a second active zzso domain on zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli gave zzso linked zzso These were shown by zzso zzso and mass zzso to comprise two zzso molecules zzso by the zzso zzso following reaction with the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso provides a model for the zzso attachment of zzso to target receptors and thus the zzso zzso to host zzso Similar zzso zzso were identified in cell wall proteins of other zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are more widely used and provide a mechanism of zzso by zzso bonding to target molecules on host cells that mimics that used by the human complement system to eliminate zzso
