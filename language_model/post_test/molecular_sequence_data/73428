In this report, we demonstrate that the T cell zzso strain of zzso zzso does not replicate in zzso zzso T cells zzso by zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso replicates well in memory zzso T cells zzso in the same zzso Unlike this zzso relevant zzso zzso stimulates productive zzso replication in both zzso and memory T zzso These studies were conducted with highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso T cells identified by expression of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso T cells showed that zzso T cells do not suppress zzso replication in memory T cells and that memory T cells do not restore zzso expression in zzso T zzso The suppression of productive zzso replication in zzso T cells is not due to differential expression of viral zzso nor is it due to zzso of zzso of the important zzso zzso factors, nuclear zzso and zzso zzso The inherent resistance of zzso T cells to productive zzso infection, coupled with their zzso advantage as demonstrated here, provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex zzso expansion and zzso of zzso T cells from zzso zzso
