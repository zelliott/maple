Heat stress zzso factors zzso are the major regulators of the plant heat stress zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed the existence of 21 zzso frames zzso zzso putative zzso assigned to classes zzso Here we present results of a functional zzso approach to the zzso zzso family focused on the analysis of their zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso for their function as zzso factors and their zzso zzso Using reporter zzso in tobacco zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso pull-down zzso we demonstrate that short zzso motifs enriched with aromatic and large zzso zzso acid zzso zzso embedded in an zzso surrounding zzso zzso are essential for zzso activity of class A zzso In contrast to this, class B and C zzso lack zzso motifs and have no zzso function on their zzso We also provide evidence for the function of a zzso zzso region centered around a zzso zzso motif at the very zzso as a nuclear export signal zzso of class A zzso zzso comparison indicates that the combination of a zzso zzso motif with the consensus sequence zzso as well as the adjacent zzso represents a signature domain for plant class A zzso which allowed to identify more than 60 new zzso from the expressed sequence tag zzso zzso
