Most proteins in all organisms undergo crucial zzso modifications involving zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso We investigated the occurrence of these poorly zzso but essential modifications in zzso focusing on zzso Experimental data for the zzso sequences of animal, zzso and zzso zzso were used to build dedicated zzso zzso in a new zzso In zzso zzso experiments were performed with both plant and animal zzso for accurate prediction of the zzso zzso modifications from the fully zzso zzso of zzso zzso were determined by zzso We identified 105 new modified protein zzso which were used to check the accuracy of zzso zzso An accuracy of more than zzso was zzso demonstrating zzso overall conservation of the specificity of the modification machinery in higher zzso and zzso zzso of the prediction zzso zzso were made for various zzso zzso that had undergone both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be strongly overrepresented among the most abundant zzso in contrast to those retaining their genuine zzso zzso Here we propose that the nature of the second zzso of an zzso is a key marker of the abundance of the mature protein in zzso
