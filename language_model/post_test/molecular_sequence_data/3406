zzso has been shown to interact with zzso which in turn is associated with Parkinson's zzso However, the function of zzso is zzso We have cloned mouse zzso in an attempt to describe zzso and therefore likely functional zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein shows extensive zzso with its human counterpart, with greatest similarities in those regions that contain zzso motifs and the zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso across zzso is similar to its human counterpart and not limited to zzso The results show that the zzso sequence and expression patterns are zzso across zzso
