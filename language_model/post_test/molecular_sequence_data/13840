zzso protein C zzso resistance is usually associated with a single DNA zzso predicting replacement of zzso by zzso in factor V zzso Studies using synthetic peptides suggest that zzso zzso zzso provide factor zzso zzso and protein S binding zzso zzso studies were performed to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso causes zzso resistance and to define the nature of the resistance of zzso to zzso zzso zzso conveyed zzso resistance to zzso plasma in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso generated either by zzso or by zzso was resistant to zzso Nonetheless, zzso was not completely resistant to zzso since it was zzso by zzso approximately zzso slower than normal zzso probably due to zzso at zzso This reduced but significant zzso of zzso to zzso zzso may help explain why zzso resistance, especially for zzso is a relatively moderate risk factor for zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso activity better than zzso zzso activity, and zzso from some zzso zzso syndrome patients zzso zzso zzso Thus, acquired zzso resistance may contribute to zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
