The Veronica zzso complex comprises eight species of zzso zzso over a wide range of mountain systems in the Northern zzso The occurrence of zzso species in the European and North American mountain systems allowed us not only to investigate the effect of the ice ages on zzso zzso patterns and genetic diversity in different zzso of the Northern zzso but also to compare these patterns in closely related zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso length zzso fingerprints were used to zzso the zzso history of the group and zzso patterns within zzso zzso origin of zzso eastern North American zzso zzso from western North American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso A number of zzso groups have been found both in zzso zzso from Europe and in zzso zzso from western North zzso zzso zzso in the zzso is zzso for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso which is zzso characterized by an overall very low genetic zzso Western North American zzso zzso is much more genetically diverse than its zzso relative, zzso zzso an effect that is likely due to differences in the breeding zzso zzso of zzso zzso are differentiated into three groups, those from the Cascades and from the southern and the northern Rocky zzso zzso diversity seems to be higher in the North American zzso zzso than in the zzso and ecologically similar European zzso zzso A possible scenario to explain this pattern is zzso
