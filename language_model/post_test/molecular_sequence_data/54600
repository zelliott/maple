Group C zzso zzso is distributed worldwide as an enteric pathogen in humans and zzso However, to date, zzso sequences are available only for a human strain zzso and a zzso strain zzso To investigate the genetic diversity of human zzso nearly full-length sequences of all 11 zzso segments were determined for human zzso detected recently in India zzso Bangladesh zzso China zzso and zzso and Japan zzso and zzso and zzso zzso with sequence data for zzso published zzso All the zzso segments of human zzso strains except for the zzso gene showed high levels of conservation zzso zzso sequence identity, zzso zzso acid sequence zzso belonging to a single genetic cluster distinct from those of animal zzso In contrast, the zzso genes of human zzso could be zzso into two zzso designated zzso and zzso that were distinguished zzso from those of zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Between zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity of the zzso gene was zzso whereas high identities were observed within each cluster zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso divergence among the four zzso clusters was observed throughout the zzso acid sequence except for zzso zzso including those possibly related to zzso functions of zzso The presence of obvious genetic diversity only in the zzso gene among human zzso suggested that either the zzso or zzso zzso gene of human zzso might have been derived through zzso from an animal zzso or from an unidentified human zzso strain belonging to a novel zzso
