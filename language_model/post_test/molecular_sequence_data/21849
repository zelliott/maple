zzso C virus Core plays a vital role in the development of zzso zzso however, its action mechanism is still zzso Here, we showed that Core zzso levels of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso which lead to growth stimulation of zzso For this effect, Core inhibited zzso expression by inducing promoter zzso via zzso of DNA zzso 1 zzso and zzso The growth zzso effect of Core was abolished when levels of zzso were restored by either zzso zzso or treatment with zzso indicating that the effect is critical for the stimulation of cell growth by zzso
