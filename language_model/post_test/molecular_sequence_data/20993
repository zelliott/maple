A dual pressure linear zzso trap mass zzso was modified to permit infrared zzso zzso zzso in each of the two zzso first a high pressure cell operated at zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and the second a low pressure cell operated at zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso When zzso was performed in the high pressure cell, most zzso zzso did not undergo significant zzso however, in the low pressure cell zzso zzso were efficiently zzso with less than 25 zzso of zzso zzso regardless of charge zzso zzso of zzso zzso allowed the detection of low zzso product zzso including the zzso fragments and zzso zzso which are not typically observed by zzso trap collision induced zzso zzso zzso efficiencies of approximately zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso efficiencies of greater than zzso were observed for both multiply and zzso zzso zzso In general, higher sequence coverage of peptides was obtained using zzso over zzso Further, greater than zzso of the product zzso current in the zzso mass zzso of doubly charged zzso zzso was composed of zzso charged product zzso compared to the zzso mass zzso in which the zzso of the multiply and zzso charged product zzso were equally zzso zzso charged primary product zzso also underwent efficient zzso to yield zzso charged secondary product zzso thus simplifying the zzso product zzso mass zzso
