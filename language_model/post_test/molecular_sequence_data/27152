zzso is an amazing example of natural order and zzso zzso sponge zzso in particular, are characterized by a large variety of dimensions and shapes, with an zzso based on zzso zzso strictly packaged around an zzso filament constituted by a family of proteins called zzso These peculiar proteins have a high sequence zzso with zzso and they play a double role of zzso and template in the control of zzso zzso However, their natural structural organization inside the zzso is far from being understood in zzso In this work, zzso filaments extracted from zzso of zzso zzso have been extensively analyzed by mass zzso exploiting zzso and zzso analysis of both the intact protein and the peptides coming from zzso of the zzso filament with different zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso contain almost only zzso zzso Several zzso zzso like zzso at the zzso region, three zzso sites, and the zzso of a zzso and of a zzso to zzso acid, are zzso
