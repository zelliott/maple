A zzso zzso zzso probe was used to determine whether zzso populations are an indigenous component of marine zzso bacterial zzso Previous debates have suggested that marine zzso zzso are derived not from resident populations but from spores of zzso species which have been physically transported to marine zzso but remain dormant until zzso zzso controlled zzso of zzso extracted from coastal zzso sediments with the zzso probe indicated that zzso zzso accounted for 2 to zzso of the zzso community zzso and that spores are not the source of the zzso zzso zzso populations must therefore be at least the 26th most abundant zzso source of bacterial zzso the relative amounts of zzso from zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso (4 to zzso zzso were highly consistent in these marine sediments throughout an annual cycle, indicating that the species composition of zzso bacterial communities may be more stable than recent studies suggest for marine zzso bacterial zzso Laboratory studies designed to investigate the possible functional roles of zzso populations in coastal sediments demonstrated that population levels of this zzso changed relatively rapidly zzso a time frame of 6 weeks) in response to manipulation of zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso with two compounds zzso acid and zzso zzso consistently resulted in zzso populations contributing an increased percentage of zzso (6 to zzso to the total bacterial zzso zzso
