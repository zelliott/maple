zzso zzso are the primary target of the zzso ultraviolet part zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the resulting zzso response at the zzso level by differential display zzso identified a formerly zzso large group of zzso zzso Among those zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso inhibitor zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The isolated full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a potential protein with 391 zzso acid zzso and a predicted molecular mass of approximately 44 zzso The novel zzso has nearly 59 % zzso acid identity with the zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso 2 zzso In addition, it displays all of the structural features unique to the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the hinge region in the zzso site loop suggests that zzso has the potential for zzso zzso The putative zzso center zzso were identified as zzso by alignment with other zzso The zzso target zzso is unknown and the in zzso translated zzso does not form zzso complexes with a variety of known zzso zzso zzso of zzso is restricted to zzso cells where two distinct transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso appears to be related to the zzso or proliferation state of zzso since zzso transcripts are more abundant in immortalized zzso zzso and in cultured normal human zzso compared to the expression in normal zzso Moreover, in zzso a skin disease characterized by zzso of zzso and responsive to therapeutic zzso zzso zzso of zzso is noted in zzso skin zzso compared to zzso zzso
