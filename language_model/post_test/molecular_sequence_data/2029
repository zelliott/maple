We describe a general zzso designed to detect zzso of zzso that are defective for any of several aspects of zzso zzso Using this zzso we have isolated a zzso that displays a progressive decrease in zzso length as well as an increased frequency of zzso zzso This zzso defines a new zzso designated zzso (for ever shorter zzso zzso zzso of zzso are not immediately zzso instead, they have a zzso zzso due to the gradual loss of sequences essential for zzso function, leading to a progressive decrease in zzso stability and subsequent cell zzso
