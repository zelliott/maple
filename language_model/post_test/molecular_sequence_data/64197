Advances in zzso sciences are demonstrating the dynamic nature of zzso DNA regions, which are comprised largely of repetitive elements with no apparent zzso zzso are one class of mobile genetic elements that amplify and move about the zzso via a zzso mechanism that employs an zzso zzso Short and long zzso elements zzso and zzso zzso are types of zzso of particular interest because of their active role in shaping the architecture of zzso and their diagnostic value as evolutionary markers for studies of zzso and population zzso Although the use of zzso and zzso for molecular systematic studies is proliferating, a comprehensive laboratory protocol that explicitly outlines how to isolate and characterize zzso for systematic studies in a detailed, zzso fashion has been zzso The present chapter addresses this gap in the literature by focusing on the strategy for zzso new zzso from a zzso library, the screening process, the sequencing and characterization of clones into zzso zzso of copy number in host zzso and the critical diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso and LINE zzso zzso zzso limits to the method are discussed in relation to sampling design, systematic character theory, and the empirical distribution of elements observed in zzso zzso Major steps in the experimental process are illustrated with case examples from a diversity of zzso groups and by published results in the molecular biology and zzso zzso
