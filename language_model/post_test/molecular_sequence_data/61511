zzso and zzso are structurally related zzso proteins involved in the regulation of cell shape, zzso zzso and signal zzso Here, we identified and characterized the zzso zzso gene by using zzso Human zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso were zzso partial zzso derived from human zzso gene and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene were located within human zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso within zzso Complete coding sequence of zzso was determined in zzso by assembling zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso identity with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared the common domain structure, consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso family proteins is the zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso is the binding domain for zzso family zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso domain of zzso family proteins interacts with zzso region of zzso and zzso family zzso zzso gene was linked to zzso gene in zzso manner with an zzso less than 8 zzso within the human zzso zzso locus at human zzso zzso was zzso to zzso locus at zzso and zzso locus at zzso This is the first report on comprehensive characterization of zzso which is predicted to function as a scaffold protein for zzso zzso family zzso zzso proteins and zzso family zzso
