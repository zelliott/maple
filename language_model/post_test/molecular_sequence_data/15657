zzso tuberculosis can zzso various nutrients including nitrate as a source of zzso zzso of nitrate requires the reduction of nitrate via zzso to zzso which is then incorporated into zzso zzso This study was undertaken to define the molecular mechanism of nitrate zzso in zzso zzso zzso to a zzso nitrate zzso and a zzso zzso zzso have been found on the zzso of zzso zzso Previous studies have implied a role for zzso in nitrate zzso rather than nitrate zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis failed to grow on zzso A zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis failed to grow on both nitrate and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso that are unable to grow on nitrate were zzso The zzso were rescued by screening a zzso library from zzso zzso and a gene with zzso to the response regulator gene zzso of zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis was generated, which also failed to grow on zzso but regained its ability to zzso nitrate when zzso was expressed from a zzso suggesting a role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso A specific binding site for zzso within the zzso promoter was identified and confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso as well as zzso analysis, demonstrated zzso of zzso expression in response to zzso under zzso zzso In zzso we conclude that zzso and zzso of zzso tuberculosis mediate the zzso reduction of nitrate and zzso respectively, and that zzso acts as a zzso zzso of zzso
