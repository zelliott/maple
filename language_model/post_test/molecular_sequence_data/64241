zzso analyses of bovine viral zzso virus zzso were performed based on the zzso sequences of the zzso untranslated region zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso detected from naturally infected cattle in the northern region of Japan were divided into three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In a zzso tree constructed from the zzso zzso zzso was identified and the viruses classified in zzso were included in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso in the zzso tree clustered closer together than in the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso analysis of the zzso gene was more useful for identification of zzso within zzso
