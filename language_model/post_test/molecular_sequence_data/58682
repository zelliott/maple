A zzso zzso was cloned from a human zzso library by screening with a zzso chain zzso zzso The zzso was generated from the library using zzso corresponding to zzso sequences encompassing the zzso zzso zzso zzso sites of the zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso and human kidney zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso contains a coding sequence from positions 161 to zzso Between bases zzso and zzso in a very long zzso zzso region, there is a zzso region in the minus zzso which contains a zzso tandem zzso The human zzso zzso sequence and its translated zzso acid sequence are zzso and zzso identical to the corresponding zzso zzso while the identities for the zzso sequences and those for human kidney zzso are zzso and zzso zzso The zzso consensus zzso and protein sequences are identical for the zzso zzso and zzso but the corresponding sequences for human kidney zzso are zzso Three His zzso that have been identified as zzso zzso in other zzso zzso are zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso It was concluded that the zzso zzso zzso frame codes for a zzso zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso acid signal zzso was identified for human zzso zzso zzso The resulting mature protein would be composed of zzso zzso zzso and would have a Mr of zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso with DNA sequences found in zzso suggests that the gene for this zzso is located in the zzso region of human zzso 17, near the zzso zzso
