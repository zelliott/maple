zzso zzso sites in the zzso zzso region of zzso were determined by zzso sequence of zzso zzso a zzso containing the zzso half of human zzso In addition to two zzso containing zzso and zzso which were previously indicated to be in zzso zzso sites, two novel zzso containing zzso or zzso and zzso as possible zzso sites, were isolated, though only in in zzso zzso The role of zzso at zzso and zzso which were differently zzso during the cell cycle zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso using zzso zzso to zzso zzso which mimic zzso at each zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso activity, while zzso at zzso did zzso These results suggest that zzso could be the critical zzso site causing zzso to be dynamic at zzso
