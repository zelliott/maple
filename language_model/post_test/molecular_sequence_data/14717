A cherished zzso of zzso acid zzso holds that synthesis of zzso zzso zzso proceeds via the attack of a zzso on a zzso zzso zzso either a zzso zzso in the case of zzso zzso or an zzso intermediate zzso the case of zzso zzso zzso exemplifies a family of zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso and zzso Unlike classic zzso zzso seals broken zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso a three-step zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction of zzso of the zzso with zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer of zzso to a zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso and zzso attack of a zzso on the zzso end to form the zzso zzso zzso is structurally zzso zzso and its chemical mechanism is zzso The wide distribution of zzso proteins in bacteria, zzso and zzso raises the prospect of an alternative zzso based on zzso activated 3' zzso
