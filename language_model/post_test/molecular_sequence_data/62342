Type III zzso systems enable plant and animal bacterial pathogens to deliver zzso proteins into the zzso of zzso host cells, causing a broad spectrum of diseases including zzso zzso typhoid fever, and zzso plague in zzso and localized zzso systemic zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, type III zzso systems are also required for zzso of the bacterial zzso The zzso zzso a component of the zzso apparatus of zzso zzso with zzso in all type III systems, has a variable zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso and show that this domain retains the ability of the full-length protein to interact with other type III zzso A zzso analysis of sequence conservation patterns reveals two clusters of zzso potentially involved in zzso zzso Based on the analogies between zzso and its zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso in the formation of a zzso zzso
