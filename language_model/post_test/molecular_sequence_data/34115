Here we present a protocol to genetically detect zzso in sediments of the Kenyan tropical Lake zzso based on zzso zzso amplification of short fragments zzso 100 zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso gene and subsequent separation of zzso zzso products by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso An evaluation of zzso differing in primer specificity to zzso and length of the fragments amplified demonstrated that the number of different zzso sequence types detected after cloning of the zzso products critically depended on the specificity of the zzso to zzso and the length of the amplified fragments zzso shorter fragments yielded more species of zzso The zzso was able to discriminate between very short zzso based on the sequence difference, even if the fragments were of identical length and if the zzso differed only in a small number of zzso Generally, the method identified the dominant sequence types from mixed zzso A comparison with microscopic analysis of the zzso samples revealed that the sequence types identified in the molecular assessment corresponded well with the most dominant zzso In zzso the zzso zzso protocol offers a fast, reliable and zzso possibility to study DNA from sediments and other environmental samples with unknown zzso content, even for very short DNA zzso
