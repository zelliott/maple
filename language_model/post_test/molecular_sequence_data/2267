zzso zzso zzso in the zzso is a rare genetic disorder associated with zzso zzso To determine the molecular basis of this disorder, we first cloned the normal gene zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined the zzso The gene was 12 zzso pairs long and was split into 7 zzso The structures of zzso and zzso regions were determined by primer extension and zzso zzso zzso The results showed that two species of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso which differed at the zzso portion, were generated by the zzso zzso zzso sequences were found in the largest zzso zzso 5) and in the zzso region of zzso zzso Next, both zzso of the zzso gene were cloned from DNA of a patient bearing the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso sequences zzso A transition zzso was found in zzso 6 on an zzso which resulted in an zzso to zzso zzso substitution at the zzso zzso of zzso Since chicken zzso is highly zzso to human zzso with respect to the zzso acid zzso we introduced an zzso to zzso substitution to chicken zzso at the same position by zzso zzso The zzso chicken zzso expressed in zzso coli showed a reduced zzso activity as well as a decreased zzso and a change in affinity to zzso Thus it was considered that the observed zzso transition was a cause of the decreased zzso activity of the patient's zzso Analysis on zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the patient and parents revealed that the patient's zzso zzso was derived from the zzso
