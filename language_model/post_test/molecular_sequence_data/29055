Three zzso methods are described that allow zzso zzso zzso and their repair, to be studied at various levels of resolution from gene regions to the individual zzso level in single copy zzso A quantitative zzso zzso method measures the total damage on both DNA strands in a gene region, usually between 300 and 3,000 base pairs in zzso zzso zzso incorporates adaptations that allow damage to be measured in the same region as zzso but in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the detection of zzso formation at the level of single zzso on individual zzso in a single copy gene in zzso zzso If zzso to the DNA zzso of interest are available, these can be used to capture and isolate zzso DNA for use in zzso zzso zzso increasing the sensitivity of the zzso
