Human growth hormone zzso a 191 zzso protein containing two zzso bonds, was fused to the zzso domain of the gene III zzso a minor coat protein exposed at one end of the zzso zzso zzso The gene fusion was cloned into a zzso containing origins of replication for zzso coli and zzso zzso and was packaged into zzso particles upon infection by an zzso helper zzso zzso of the zzso III fusion was controlled so that usually no more than one copy of the fusion protein was displayed along with the four copies of the zzso gene III zzso The zzso III fusion protein was properly zzso as judged by zzso with six zzso zzso zzso whose zzso are sensitive to the folded zzso of zzso Moreover, the zzso III zzso particles were enriched over zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso following a single zzso zzso step from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso should be useful for zzso new zzso binding zzso of zzso More generally, this expression system may allow other large proteins with zzso binding zzso to be displayed, and binding selections applied to their zzso gene III zzso on zzso zzso
