We have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso were also compiled using modified rapid amplification zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene demonstrated that it is a zzso zzso gene with a complete open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso results showed that zzso zzso was solely expressed in the zzso There was a lower amount of zzso expression in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and a very small amount of zzso expression in the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso compared to an adult zzso Two zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected and zzso among six pig zzso The zzso C at zzso responsible for the zzso acid exchange to zzso could lead to the loss of a zzso zzso II zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso Association analyses between zzso zzso and several traits of zzso quantity and quality were zzso The results showed that zzso has a positive significant effect on zzso volume in the breed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso revealed an increased volume of 49 zzso compared with zzso having the zzso zzso
