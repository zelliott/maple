zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso is often presented as evidence for the possible involvement of zzso zzso in zzso binding and zzso or to highlight possible important differences in structure and mechanism between closely related zzso The primary zzso distinction between the zzso type II zzso zzso zzso typified by the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso is the greatly enhanced zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso present on zzso and that of a related zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso indicates that sensitivity to such zzso cannot be due to the presence of additional zzso zzso zzso in zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso occurs as a result of chemical modification of the same zzso zzso in each zzso zzso zzso that zzso via a zzso process zzso and zzso appear to bind with a greater affinity to zzso and zzso the intrinsic zzso of zzso in zzso greatly exceeds that of the corresponding zzso in zzso The results lead to the conclusion that a striking difference in chemical zzso of a unique and zzso zzso group between closely related zzso zzso may not be easily explained even when a high-resolution zzso structure is available for one of zzso zzso explanations include more zzso access of zzso to zzso in zzso or an enhanced zzso of its zzso group imposed by the side chains of zzso that are not in immediate contact with zzso
