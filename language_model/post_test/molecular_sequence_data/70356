The zzso gene coding for a zzso domain zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, which produces zzso S zzso 2 defective in zzso By comparison of the zzso sequence with the zzso zzso a single point zzso was found at the zzso zzso which was replaced with zzso resulting in the change of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso search for the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso gene revealed that the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso sequence was highly zzso among the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso S zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, this zzso sequence was not zzso in the other zzso zzso lacking zzso acid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Single base zzso at the zzso zzso zzso were carried out by zzso zzso zzso Four zzso clones were isolated, containing zzso genes which exchange zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The translated products from these clones could scarcely catalyze zzso zzso exchange zzso The zzso structure of zzso region was lost in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso protein is essential for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
