zzso zzso zzso cells have been shown to provide zzso environmental conditions for the development of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso zzso products on zzso activity and gene zzso in zzso zzso mother zzso Using the zzso technique, we identified several zzso transcripts regulated by exposure to zzso soluble zzso Research in databases indicated that six of the eight differential products zzso were zzso to sequences already present in zzso Two transcripts appeared of interest for zzso development since they could be associated with cell division and protein synthesis in developing zzso Their zzso following contact with cell products was confirmed by zzso zzso The first zzso coded for a part of the zzso containing zzso protein gamma zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso The second one represented a new zzso zzso expressed sequence tag zzso a protein zzso to various zzso zzso zzso The full-length sequence of zzso was cloned from adult zzso and its primary sequence was compared to other zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso could be correlated with the zzso changes observed in zzso zzso
