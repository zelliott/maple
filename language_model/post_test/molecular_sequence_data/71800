zzso is a classic inhibitor of zzso zzso by zzso zzso II zzso zzso Since zzso generally affects class II zzso factors involved in this process must play fundamental roles in pol II zzso Recently, two zzso factors essential for zzso action were identified, namely zzso and zzso Here we describe the identification and zzso from zzso nuclear extract of a third protein factor required for zzso zzso This factor, termed negative zzso factor zzso zzso with zzso and strongly zzso pol II zzso This repression is reversed by zzso zzso of the pol II zzso zzso zzso is composed of five zzso the smallest of which is identical to zzso a putative zzso protein of unknown zzso This study reveals a molecular mechanism for zzso action and a regulatory network of positive and negative zzso zzso
