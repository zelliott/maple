zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso from the cells using zzso zzso as a model zzso The zzso zzso behaved as a zzso under both zzso and zzso conditions, indicating that the zzso comprises a single zzso It was zzso active at pH levels between zzso and 9, but showed little or no activity at pH below 7 and above zzso As with other zzso its activity was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso such as zzso and by zzso In addition to the model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso extension protein of 80 zzso acids and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso It was also capable of releasing free zzso from zzso zzso chains that are zzso to proteins through zzso bonds, although to a limited zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the generation of free zzso and certain zzso proteins from zzso fusion proteins as well as in zzso of certain zzso proteins targeted for degradation by the zzso zzso
