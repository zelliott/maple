The coffee berry zzso zzso zzso is the most important insect zzso of coffee worldwide and has an unusual life history that ensures a high degree of zzso Individual females lay a predominantly female zzso within individual coffee berries and because males are zzso there is almost entirely full zzso zzso We investigated the zzso associated with this interesting life history after the important discovery of resistance to the zzso type zzso zzso Both the inheritance of the resistance zzso and the zzso point zzso in the zzso acid zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso with zzso males failed to express and transmit zzso derived resistance zzso Furthermore, while zzso examination revealed that males are zzso one set of zzso was condensed, and probably zzso in the zzso cells of all males zzso Moreover, although two sets of zzso were present in primary zzso the zzso failed to pair before the single zzso division, and only one set was packaged in zzso Thus, the coffee berry zzso is zzso zzso Its zzso and life history may therefore represent an interesting intermediate step in the evolution of true zzso The influence of this breeding system on the spread of zzso resistance is zzso
