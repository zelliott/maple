zzso characterization studies have been carried out on the zzso backbone of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso backbone isolated from zzso zzso by sequential zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso consisting of 3 zzso of zzso zzso (of which one is zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso and 1 zzso each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso analyses by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso demonstrated that the zzso backbone is zzso in which the zzso zzso is further zzso by zzso at position 4 and by zzso at position zzso In native zzso zzso an additional 1 zzso of zzso acid, which is liberated by zzso in zzso acid, is present at an unknown zzso A previous study by the present authors reported that, of 13 zzso zzso of zzso zzso the only zzso from which zzso was detected was from zzso zzso after mild acid zzso In the present study, we have demonstrated that only 1 zzso of zzso is present at the zzso A zzso position, a component which is common to the zzso in all zzso of the zzso and that there is no additional zzso in the zzso backbone of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis using zzso against zzso and zzso zzso Minnesota zzso and zzso of both strains further revealed that zzso is not involved as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso
