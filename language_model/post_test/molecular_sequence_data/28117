The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso are structurally unrelated but share a common functional zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso of the probable zzso binding site regions of the zzso and zzso protein sequences revealed the presence of ten nearly zzso spaced consensus zzso six of which contain potentially zzso side zzso Important elements of the consensus zzso also were found in one unique sequence region of the zzso zzso among the two receptors and zzso outside the apparent binding region were rare, and the consensus zzso binding zzso were largely zzso in the zzso zzso which do not bind zzso The consensus zzso include two possible zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso that may hydrogen bond to the zzso zzso in the zzso These zzso zzso to positions zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso No corresponding consensus zzso is found in the zzso zzso this is expected because of a downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso 193 and zzso zzso zzso 97 may be important in energy zzso associated with zzso zzso The presence of additional zzso aromatic zzso that may form a zzso environment near the zzso zzso are aligned zzso but not between, the three zzso protein zzso These observations target specific regions and zzso within these proteins for zzso studies of the zzso binding zzso
