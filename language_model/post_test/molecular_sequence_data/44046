The zzso acid sequences of two zzso from a callus cell culture of zzso zzso were zzso The two sequences differ at zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso was found with a large family of zzso zzso zzso food zzso and tree zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso plant zzso There is about zzso sequence difference with proteins from species belonging to the same plant order zzso parsley and zzso zzso with those from four other zzso plant orders and about zzso from that of the zzso zzso More thorough evolutionary analyses of sequences lead to the conclusion that the general biological function of members of this protein family may be closely related to the ability to cleave zzso zzso and that they have an important role in cell zzso As the three-dimensional structure of one of the members of this protein family has been determined recently zzso et zzso Nature zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso it may be possible to assign zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and make hypotheses about its mode of zzso zzso features in addition to the cellular site of zzso indicate that this family of zzso is very different from previously investigated zzso
