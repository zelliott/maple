The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso D1 gene zzso which is critical in regulating the progression of the cell cycle in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso were performed to measure promoter activities of rat zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso were used to examine the binding of zzso factors to sites responsive to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso increased both zzso zzso and its protein levels in a zzso zzso The region from zzso to zzso of the promoter was found to contain zzso elements responsible for zzso gene zzso Early growth zzso zzso protein was bound to the region from zzso to zzso which includes the putative zzso binding site zzso Moreover, zzso recruited zzso protein to the promoter in zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso activates zzso zzso through induction of zzso binding to a zzso element between zzso and zzso on the rat zzso zzso These results provide an important indication that zzso is a growth factor regulating beta cell zzso
