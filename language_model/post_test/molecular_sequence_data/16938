Some zzso zzso restore cell surface expression of zzso receptors retained in the zzso zzso zzso and are therefore termed zzso Whether zzso increase protein stability, thereby preventing rapid degradation, or assist folding via direct zzso interactions or interfere with quality control components remains zzso We now show that the cell surface expression and function zzso of the zzso of the mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso V2 zzso zzso fusion protein zzso is restored by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values similar to their zzso zzso This effect was preserved when protein synthesis was zzso In addition, zzso rescued eight zzso human zzso zzso three are responsible for zzso diabetes zzso characterized by zzso acid exchanges at the zzso end of zzso zzso TM I and TM zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso acid exchanges at the interface of TM II and IV were not rescued by either zzso The mechanisms involved in successful rescue of cell surface delivery are explained in a three-dimensional zzso model of the zzso zzso
