The zzso sequence of zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso has been determined by screening of human zzso zzso library and by utilizing zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes 767 zzso acids chain resulting in 89 zzso zzso The zzso consensus signal zzso located at zzso zzso 3' downstream from the stop zzso The zzso to human and rat zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at the zzso level in the area of open reading frame, and zzso and zzso similarities at the deduced zzso acid zzso
