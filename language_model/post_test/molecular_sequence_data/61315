The large zzso of the human U2 small nuclear zzso particle auxiliary factor zzso is an essential zzso factor required for the recognition of the zzso tract immediately upstream of the 3' zzso zzso In the present study, we determined the solution structures of two zzso fragments, corresponding to the first and second zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso structure of zzso is similar to that of typical zzso zzso with the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso structure has unique features: zzso the zzso zzso is zzso by one turn toward the zzso zzso the loop between zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso is much longer and has a defined zzso zzso the zzso strand is zzso which was not predicted by sequence zzso and zzso the zzso loop is much zzso Chemical shift zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso fragments interact with the four zzso of zzso zzso in contrast, they interact with zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso or the zzso loop, of zzso The characteristic zzso structure of the zzso zzso may interact with other zzso such as zzso
