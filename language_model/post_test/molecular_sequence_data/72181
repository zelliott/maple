zzso zzso zzso cells have been used as a source to purify and identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In comparison with zzso the production yields of zzso and zzso in these cells are rather low and zzso Although the protein sequence of human zzso is identified, its DNA sequence remains zzso A zzso primer set was used to isolate an zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso Based on the gene sequence of zzso a unique primer set was zzso and used to screen zzso libraries for the presence of zzso transcripts by zzso The complete zzso zzso was cloned from a human bone zzso zzso library and zzso The zzso protein sequence was identical to that of zzso natural zzso except for zzso which replaced zzso There seem thus to exist two zzso zzso zzso because at position 46 the zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso were detected in individual zzso As shown by Northern zzso the zzso zzso zzso levels in normal zzso zzso were increased by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed induction of zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso and zzso zzso The regulated production of zzso by tumor cells and normal zzso cells is indicative of a role in zzso and inflammatory host zzso
