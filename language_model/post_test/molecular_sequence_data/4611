An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso zzso fragments has been subjected to a combined zzso and molecular modeling zzso The zzso behavior of the two zzso zzso segments was investigated using a systematic grid search approach with the zzso force field along with the proper parameters for the zzso zzso zzso The exploration of the potential energy surfaces of the zzso was performed through the use of the zzso methods zzso with the zzso force zzso In all cases, the zzso zzso was given the three favored ring zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were clustered into families, four of which are likely to exhibit significant occupancy in zzso The different low-energy zzso families display different zzso at the zzso linkages and/or different ring shapes for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the major one for the zzso but is still in equilibrium with the zzso ring zzso The occurrence of such a zzso equilibrium in solution was zzso via high-resolution zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results are in keeping with the observation that zzso zzso display a similar affinity for zzso III as their zzso zzso
