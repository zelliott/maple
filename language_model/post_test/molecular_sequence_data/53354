We have identified an zzso recognized by zzso zzso on the melanoma cells of a patient who enjoyed an unusually favorable clinical zzso The zzso zzso which is presented by zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso sequence in a new zzso This zzso which was named zzso is expressed zzso and shows zzso with the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso dilution analysis indicated that at least zzso of the blood zzso T cells were zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was recognized by zzso of these zzso indicating that it is the dominant target zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The high frequency of zzso zzso was confirmed with zzso of soluble zzso molecules loaded with the zzso zzso zzso zzso stained zzso of blood zzso cells, a frequency that has never been reported for T cells directed against a strictly zzso zzso To confirm these results, the zzso T cells that were clearly labeled with zzso were zzso in zzso zzso About zzso of these cells zzso and all the resulting clones proved zzso and zzso zzso By improving the conditions used for the in zzso zzso of zzso precursors by the tumor cells, the same frequency could be obtained in limiting dilution zzso These results show that some cancer patients have a high frequency of circulating zzso that are directed against a strictly zzso zzso These zzso are responsive to zzso in zzso and are easily detected with zzso Such responses may therefore be an achievable goal for therapeutic vaccination with zzso zzso
