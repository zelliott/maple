The core zzso of zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso mimic the zzso zzso of zzso present on human zzso Such mimicry may serve to camouflage the bacterial surface from the zzso The LOS component is zzso and/or chemically identical to zzso zzso and can become zzso in zzso zzso when the zzso is grown in the presence of zzso zzso acid, the zzso sugar of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also express similarly zzso zzso zzso of the LOS influences zzso to zzso zzso may decrease or prevent zzso cause zzso of complement zzso and decrease adherence to zzso and the subsequent zzso burst zzso The core zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso which are associated with the development of the neurological disorder, zzso syndrome zzso exhibit mimicry of zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso are considered to play an important role in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of a number of zzso zzso strains exhibit mimicry of zzso and zzso blood group zzso The role of this mimicry remains to be investigated, but may play a role in bacterial zzso the induction of zzso and immune suppression in zzso zzso zzso
