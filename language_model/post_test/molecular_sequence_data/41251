A central hospital laboratory in South zzso 

To evaluate the usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso in a country with an intermediate tuberculosis zzso 

A total of 71 real-time zzso chain zzso zzso sediments were tested within 24 h by the zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis detection was compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance was compared with a zzso method and zzso gene zzso We also assessed the limit of detection for zzso proportions and time savings in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso detected zzso tuberculosis in 71 zzso specimens (32 zzso 39 zzso This zzso showed zzso zzso zzso with drug resistance confirmed by culture and zzso zzso zzso with zzso A zzso containing approximately 50% of zzso zzso was falsely interpreted as zzso zzso by this zzso The minimal detection ratio was zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The median time saved was zzso days zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso tuberculosis and zzso days zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso showed high sensitivity in detecting zzso tuberculosis with information on zzso resistance, and had a more rapid time to diagnosis compared to conventional tests; however, the location and amount of zzso may affect test zzso
