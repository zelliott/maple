zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso that zzso plasma zzso containing a terminal zzso or zzso The zzso recognition domain zzso of zzso has three zzso binding sites zzso 1, 2 and zzso with zzso at site 2 being directly involved in zzso zzso Following zzso the zzso are released from zzso in zzso to allow zzso recycling to the cell zzso Although zzso of the zzso complex is zzso by the zzso environment within the mature zzso many of these complexes also zzso in the early time of zzso where pH is approximately zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso release from zzso in early zzso we examined the binding mode of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso by zzso We demonstrate that sites 1 and 2 of zzso are high affinity zzso binding sites, site 3 is low zzso and that zzso zzso bind to sites 1 and 2 zzso The pH and zzso concentration zzso of zzso binding states indicated that early zzso conditions favor zzso zzso allowing zzso zzso Our results zzso that the cooperative binding mode of zzso makes it possible for zzso to be more sensitive to zzso zzso in early zzso and plays an important role in the efficient release of zzso from zzso In our proposed zzso zzso can rapidly release zzso and its zzso even at nearly neutral zzso zzso comparisons of zzso zzso zzso receptors suggest that this mechanism is common in their zzso
