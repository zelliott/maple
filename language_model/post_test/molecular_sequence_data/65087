The zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso have extensive structural zzso and have been identified as zzso factors that mediate zzso gene expression through zzso element zzso They play critical roles not only in normal development, but also in tumor zzso zzso cells zzso express both zzso and zzso In this study, we examined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in bovine zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso analysis and found that even under zzso conditions, as with its zzso partner zzso zzso was stable, and was localized in the nucleus of zzso differently than zzso zzso might be regulated by a different mechanism than zzso and might mediate the expression of some zzso genes under zzso zzso We further found that cardiovascular zzso factor zzso 2, which had been identified as an zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and suppressed zzso gene expression both under zzso and zzso zzso might be one of the key regulators of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
