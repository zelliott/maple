Bone zzso proteins zzso constitute a family of approximately 20 growth factors involved in a tremendous variety of embryonic zzso zzso zzso elicit zzso effects on patterning during zzso and zzso of zzso activity are thought to be established through regulation of the relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We tested whether later zzso events also are sensitive to reduced levels of zzso zzso We engineered a knockout mouse that expresses a zzso type II zzso that lacks half of the zzso zzso This altered zzso is expressed at levels comparable with the zzso zzso but has reduced signaling zzso Unlike zzso mice, mice zzso for this zzso zzso undergo normal zzso providing genetic evidence of the zzso effects of zzso during zzso zzso zzso however, die at zzso with cardiovascular and skeletal zzso demonstrating that the development of these zzso requires zzso levels of zzso zzso The most striking defects occur in the zzso tract of the heart, with absence of zzso of the zzso below the valve level and interrupted zzso arch, a zzso known in humans as persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso valves do not form in zzso while the zzso valves appear zzso zzso zzso of the heart and valve anomalies are the most frequent forms of zzso cardiac defects in zzso however, most mouse models display broad defects throughout cardiac zzso The more restricted spectrum of cardiac anomalies in zzso zzso makes this strain a key zzso model to understand the embryonic defects of persistent zzso zzso and impaired zzso valve formation in zzso
