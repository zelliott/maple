zzso alpha zzso zzso known to be expressed in zzso was found to be transcribed in human fetal zzso Due to the unexpected finding of expression of this gene in the inner ear and the success of the candidate gene approach in identifying zzso for a variety of zzso disorders, we investigated the possible role of this gene in Usher syndrome type I and type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to screen the zzso coding region, as well as zzso donor and zzso sites, for zzso in a total of 140 unrelated zzso Two zzso changes leading to two silent zzso acid changes and one rare zzso were zzso In view of these results and those of a previously published Southern zzso analysis, it is unlikely that zzso in zzso are a common gene zzso in Usher syndrome type I or type zzso
