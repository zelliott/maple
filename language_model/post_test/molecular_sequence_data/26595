zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso comprise a group of genetically zzso neurodegenerative disorders among which zzso zzso type 3 zzso represents the most common form of zzso zzso The fragments of zzso zzso is the member of family zzso amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso products of zzso gene were detected with zzso zzso zzso and sequencing to evaluate the size of zzso repeats, feature in the transmission and the zzso in the family with zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso 10 of the zzso gene contains zzso zzso repeats in all of the affected individuals and three zzso carriers of the zzso The number of the zzso repeats during transmission in the normal individuals carrying zzso zzso remains consistent, suggesting that zzso zzso could have no effect on zzso stability of zzso repeats in normal zzso In addition, two novel point zzso were zzso zzso T zzso C in the zzso region and a zzso zzso 220 G zzso A zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These two novel point zzso have not been reported and the effect of the zzso on the zzso of zzso is not zzso
