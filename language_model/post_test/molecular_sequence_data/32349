zzso zzso is an essential zzso and one of the most abundant zzso zzso in plant zzso We have cloned an zzso zzso zzso zzso for a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plant CCC proteins are highly zzso and zzso analyses revealed their relationships to the zzso of animal zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso CCC protein (At zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and this transport activity was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso indicating that At CCC encodes for a bona fide zzso zzso Analysis of At CCC zzso transgenic zzso plants revealed preferential expression in the root and shoot zzso at the zzso boundary, root tips, zzso leaf zzso leaf zzso and zzso Plants zzso for two independent zzso insertions in the CCC gene exhibited shorter zzso such as zzso zzso roots, leaves and zzso The zzso zone of the zzso stem of zzso plants often zzso during zzso zzso while seed production was strongly zzso In addition, zzso plants exhibited defective zzso zzso under high zzso as they accumulated higher and lower zzso amounts in shoots and roots, respectively, than the treated wild type, suggesting At CCC involvement in long-distance zzso zzso zzso evidence is provided on the occurrence of zzso zzso in the plant kingdom and their significant role in major plant zzso processes and zzso zzso
