Nuclear hormone receptors are zzso factors that require multiple zzso interactions to regulate the expression of their target zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we identified a zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso protein zzso that specifically interacts with a region of the human zzso hormone zzso zzso consisting of the hinge region and the zzso portion of the zzso binding domain in a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso acid zzso but has no effect on the zzso zzso or the zzso X zzso in zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso exerts its action on zzso and zzso acid zzso by interfering with their abilities to interact with their zzso zzso represents a type of regulatory protein that zzso the zzso activity of a zzso of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso by preventing interaction with their zzso response zzso
