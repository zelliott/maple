zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is cell zzso and occurs in two major zzso zzso found in zzso embryonic cells, and transformed zzso and zzso found in all rapidly dividing zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zheng, zzso zzso Whitfield, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When full-length zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso is zzso zzso into zzso cells, it is efficiently transported into the nucleus within 2 h after translation in the zzso whereas the zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso deletion zzso zzso is retained in the zzso In zzso cells synchronized by a double zzso block and zzso zzso to zzso full-length zzso or zzso progression through the zzso border is zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso site zzso deletion zzso zzso or zzso were not delayed in progression through the zzso zzso By using a DNA zzso zzso in zzso binding data demonstrate that zzso zzso complexes can transfer zzso zzso to DNA, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso mobility in the nucleus by zzso recovery after zzso indicates that zzso mobility is virtually identical to that reported for zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso complexes exist in the nucleus and that zzso can influence cell cycle progression through the zzso border through mediation of zzso zzso zzso
