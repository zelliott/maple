zzso dormancy is an important zzso trait in wheat zzso zzso zzso can be released from a zzso dormant state by zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of zzso in zzso zzso switches from dormancy to zzso in wheat seeds, we performed comparative zzso analyses between dormant zzso and zzso zzso seeds in both dry and zzso zzso zzso zzso of genes represented by a core of 22 and 435 zzso was evident in the dry and zzso states of D seeds, zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso analysis identified 36 zzso as specifically regulated by zzso These data suggest that biological functions associated with these genes are involved in the maintenance of seed zzso zzso of genes zzso protein zzso zzso was significantly zzso during zzso leading to dormancy zzso zzso zzso seeds led to zzso zzso of distinct biological zzso including those related to DNA zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell wall zzso These zzso zzso programs appear to be regulated by zzso zzso zzso of our zzso data produced 16 gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso elements were significantly overrepresented in two zzso indicating the linkage of dormancy in wheat with that of seed sensitivity to zzso The role of zzso zzso in regulating wheat seed dormancy was further supported by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso seeds and absence of differential expression of zzso zzso genes between D and zzso zzso
