The pattern of expression of two zzso transcripts initiated in the 62nd zzso of the zzso gene was investigated under different circumstances; zzso during the development of different rat zzso these transcripts and zzso a protein zzso by one of them, increased with brain development and decreased with muscle zzso zzso in cultured zzso and zzso cells, the zzso promoter was zzso with zzso upstream zzso the zzso promoter in zzso cells and the zzso promoter in zzso cells, which suggests that activity of the upstream promoter does not interfere with activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso patients with various deletions of the zzso zzso the most zzso of which included the 56th zzso the production of the zzso transcript was not zzso
