zzso the zzso zzso protein of the bacterial zzso system zzso controls sugar zzso and carbon zzso in zzso zzso bacteria and in zzso zzso We have zzso zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso sequence matched the product of an zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso as part of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso The zzso gene appears to form a zzso zzso zzso of the evolutionary relationship revealed that zzso zzso zzso is equally distant to all known zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso site around zzso 15 is perfectly zzso while a second possible zzso site at zzso 47 is not zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli in its native form and as a zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by its own zzso I zzso and zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was absent in an zzso zzso in which zzso 15 was replaced by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso could efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso could also zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected with zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results present the first identification of a gene of the zzso complement of zzso zzso providing the basis to zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso in this class of zzso
