The bacterial community composition of a zzso enrichment culture and the role of the individual strains in zzso degradation have been determined by a combination of methods, such as zzso zzso gel zzso of the total zzso zzso gene pool, isolation and identification of zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso were isolated directly from the zzso zzso In addition, subculture of this enrichment culture on potential zzso in the degradation zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in the isolation of, respectively, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of these five zzso only zzso zzso strain zzso was able to use zzso as the sole source of C, zzso and zzso zzso first converted zzso to zzso zzso which zzso accumulated in the medium but was subsequently zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a strain that degrades zzso further than the aromatic zzso Interestingly, the rate of zzso degradation by strain zzso was lower than that for the zzso but was clearly increased when zzso was zzso with each of the other four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be responsible for degradation of the intermediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the only strain able to degrade zzso The role of zzso zzso strain zzso needs to be further zzso The degradation of zzso can thus be performed by a single zzso zzso zzso strain zzso but is zzso by a synergistic interaction with the other strains isolated from the same zzso zzso
