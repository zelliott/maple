Over the last decades, the demand for pork products has increased significantly, along with concern about suitable waste zzso zzso zzso for zzso stabilization is a good strategy, although little is known about the microbial communities in the zzso Here, we employed a zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene to characterize and zzso the zzso community composition in a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the zzso library zzso 15 bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and candidates division zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso library was generally dominated by zzso zzso The zzso sequences were related to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso predominated in the library, demonstrating that it is not restricted to zzso zzso being also responsible for ammonium zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequences were associated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the number of bacterial cells was at least three orders of magnitude higher than the number of zzso cells in the zzso The identified zzso diversity was ecologically zzso particularly the zzso community of zzso zzso which was responsible for methane production in the zzso zzso This study provided insight into the zzso involvement in the overall zzso of organic matter and the production of zzso zzso the treatment of zzso waste in the sludge zzso zzso could represent a potential zzso for the start-up of municipal zzso zzso
