Here we present the sequence of the large zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso forms (and therefore zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso from two different zzso We determined the zzso sequence of a zzso unit of the zzso zzso strain from within the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso through the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the entire large zzso zzso zzso We have also determined the corresponding sequence of the gene of the zzso strain by sequencing zzso clones derived from zzso asexual zzso zzso between the two were due to scattered point zzso in expansion segments of the mature zzso zzso In addition to the point zzso the zzso genes from the two strains could be distinguished by the presence of a more complex zzso near the 3' end of the zzso The most complex zzso form was localized on a single zzso and found in only a subset of geographically distinct zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso unit and the zzso zzso unit reported here can be logically assembled into a complete secondary structure which zzso to the standard structure zzso in all zzso zzso The construction of a model of secondary structure for the zzso zzso has allowed the identification of zzso zzso sequences involved in drug interaction with the zzso as well as those sequences involved in zzso interactions within the zzso zzso
