We report the analysis of 872 zzso clones from a zzso white shrimp zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso protein and zzso sequences identified zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as previously known zzso while zzso are novel zzso The zzso zzso zzso represent transcripts of 276 zzso These genes were zzso into 12 groups according to their zzso The more abundant categories were zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso transcripts and sequences without zzso to proteins deposited in the zzso database zzso zzso hypothetical proteins zzso which include genes never described in shrimp and zzso metabolism related proteins zzso We also found genes involved in stress and immune zzso and only one involved in zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso associated protein 2 zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Their zzso steady state levels in addition to zzso changed at different times zzso infection as estimated by zzso These results suggest that zzso alters gene expression in zzso and has led to the identification of novel white shrimp specific zzso
