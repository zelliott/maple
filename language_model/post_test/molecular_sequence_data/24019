zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso are widely used for zzso stem cell zzso gene transfer, but zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso virus zzso may allow higher efficiency transfer and better zzso Recent studies in cell lines have challenged the notion that zzso and zzso zzso integrate randomly into their host zzso Medical applications using these zzso are aimed at zzso and thus large-scale comprehensive analysis of zzso and zzso integration in long-term zzso zzso is crucial to help develop improved zzso zzso We studied integration sites in zzso of zzso monkeys that had been transplanted 6 zzso to 6 y prior with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso insertions were compared to a set of in zzso random integration zzso While zzso zzso were located predominantly around zzso start sites, zzso zzso strongly favored zzso units and zzso regions of the zzso These integration patterns suggest different mechanisms for integration as well as distinct safety implications for zzso versus zzso zzso
