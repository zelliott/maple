Twelve zzso from zzso a Korean zzso zzso identified as zzso zzso were compared by zzso and zzso methods to determine their precise zzso identities at the subspecies zzso Four strains and three strains had complete zzso zzso gene sequence matches with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso linens zzso zzso zzso Five strains showed zzso % identity with the sequences of both type zzso In our zzso zzso analyses among two type strains and two zzso the similarities were over 72 % and were higher than the similarities presented at the subspecies zzso zzso characteristics such as sugar zzso zzso activity, zzso resistance and salt zzso which were adopted for subspecies zzso could not be applied to assign the zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso formation and protein profiles did not present markers to divide the zzso into either of the zzso zzso sequence typing of the sequences of the zzso zzso gene and five zzso genes did not produce any coherent relationship among the zzso and type zzso zzso zzso zzso using ERIC zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso classified 12 zzso to three zzso and the zzso of both type strains coincided with two zzso expressing different zzso Based on these zzso and zzso analyses results, we propose to unify the present two subspecies of zzso zzso into one species, zzso zzso
