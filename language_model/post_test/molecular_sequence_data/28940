The diversity of the zzso body plan has long been a fascinating subject of zzso A flurry of recent research has analyzed zzso gene expression in various zzso groups, with hopes of gaining insight into the mechanisms that zzso their zzso The zzso genes have been analyzed in insects, crustaceans and zzso However, the expression patterns of the zzso genes have not yet been zzso analyzed in a zzso We present the expression patterns of the ten zzso genes in a zzso zzso zzso and compare our results to those from studies in other zzso We have three major zzso First, we find that zzso gene expression is remarkably dynamic across the zzso The expression patterns of the zzso genes in the zzso are in many cases intermediate between those of the zzso and those of the insects and zzso consistent with the proposed intermediate zzso position of the zzso Second, we found two zzso zzso genes in the zzso compared with those in zzso Based on its pattern of zzso zzso appears to have a typical zzso role in the zzso suggesting that the novel functions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were adopted somewhere in the zzso zzso In the zzso the expression of the gene zzso zzso suggests that it has both a zzso role (as in the zzso as well as a role in zzso (as in zzso This suggests that this dramatic change in function was achieved via a zzso zzso a condition maintained in the zzso zzso we found that zzso expression zzso with zzso zzso consistent with the theory that changes in zzso genes had a major role in evolution of the zzso body zzso
