The bacterial pathogen zzso zzso carries several putative zzso signal zzso systems of unknown zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins constitute a zzso system that is activated by zzso zzso zzso analysis, real-time zzso and primer extension experiments indicated that this system regulates 12 genes (including the zzso zzso present in three zzso zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed that zzso zzso protein bound DNA fragments containing the promoter regions upstream of these three zzso zzso Although functionally similar, the zzso does not exhibit sequence zzso with the classical zzso systems, has a different pho box zzso recognized by the zzso zzso response regulator, and is not zzso Because of these zzso properties, we designated the zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso response zzso and the zzso genes as the pho zzso of zzso zzso
