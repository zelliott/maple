zzso zzso zzso is a novel disease characterized by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and an increased concentration of plasma zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that a genetic disorder of zzso E may be associated with the genesis of this zzso 

An zzso E zzso was analyzed in a zzso Japanese male with zzso and systemic zzso zzso zzso E zzso were analyzed by zzso focusing and zzso zzso E zzso were determined by restriction zzso zzso with zzso zzso chain reaction zzso products of zzso E coding region zzso 3 and 4 were cloned into zzso and were zzso 

A novel zzso E zzso was identified in this patient and his zzso There was a zzso between an zzso E zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a 54 zzso deletion in zzso 4 of the zzso E zzso causing the zzso acid deletion zzso zzso zzso This deletion zzso was further confirmed by the detection of a short zzso of zzso DNA using zzso gel zzso The patient was a zzso with zzso zzso and this zzso was determined to be the structural basis for the zzso E1 zzso One of two daughters was a zzso carrier of zzso zzso although she did not have zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso of zzso E that may be zzso related to zzso and to the development of zzso The result of this family study suggests that the occurrence of zzso may involve other genetic or environmental zzso
