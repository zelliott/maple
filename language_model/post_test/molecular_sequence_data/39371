zzso zzso acid elimination greatly contributes to cholesterol zzso zzso from cholesterol in the liver, zzso acids are actively reclaimed in the zzso by the zzso sodium dependent zzso acid zzso zzso Although the expression level of zzso affects body cholesterol balance, the impact of cholesterol on zzso gene expression remains zzso In this study, the effect of cholesterol on zzso expression and zzso zzso acid zzso was explored in zzso and in zzso 

zzso gene expression was assessed by real time quantitative zzso chain reaction and northern or western zzso or both, in mice subjected to a zzso cholesterol diet for two weeks, in mouse zzso zzso or in human zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso enriched or depleted zzso zzso acid zzso was determined by measuring zzso acid influx into in zzso isolated zzso zzso from mice or into differentiated zzso zzso zzso analysis of mouse and human zzso promoters was undertaken with reporter zzso site directed zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso 

In mice, cholesterol enriched diet triggered a zzso of zzso expression zzso and zzso a fall in zzso zzso acid zzso and a rise in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This effect was direct as it was reproduced ex zzso using mouse zzso zzso and in zzso in differentiated zzso zzso 

This regulation, which involves an original partnership between zzso and zzso zzso factors, affects zzso zzso acid recycling and thus might participate in the maintenance of body cholesterol zzso
