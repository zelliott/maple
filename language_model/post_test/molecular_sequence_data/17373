The zzso sequences of the DNA zzso B zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined and analyzed together with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the zzso tree constructed, the strains of each zzso species formed distinct clusters with deep zzso The degree of sequence similarity within each cluster was zzso or more, whereas similarities between clusters ranged from zzso to zzso These clusters were recovered with zzso zzso probabilities and are in very good agreement with the species of zzso These data suggest that zzso is an accurate zzso marker for the zzso of the zzso zzso considered in this zzso
