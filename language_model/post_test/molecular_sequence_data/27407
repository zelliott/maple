The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is highly zzso in liver zzso in zzso cancer and suspected to be involved in the progression from tumor to zzso During zzso studies based on the screening of zzso zzso activity on several zzso synthetic zzso we observed a decrease in activity depending on sample aging and storage zzso By liquid zzso combined with selective zzso and mass zzso we found two main zzso zzso zzso a zzso bond formation between the zzso zzso and zzso blocking the zzso in an inactive oxidized form, or the conversion of the zzso zzso into zzso We also found that the zzso formation and the zzso into zzso conversion are zzso by zzso present in the sample after protein zzso through a zzso zzso By adding a zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso the sample with zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso These findings suggest that zzso like other zzso is sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso and this has implications for future studies of its activity and zzso
