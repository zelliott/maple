The function of the zzso protein 3 zzso a zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso associated protein is poorly zzso In the present study, the gene zzso zzso zzso lacking the highly zzso domain in the zzso and zzso was expressed as zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso were developed and used to probe a series of zzso peptides using zzso After precise analysis by sequential deletion of the terminal zzso acid zzso from each zzso the minimal zzso recognized by the zzso were localized to zzso and zzso The zzso sequences were well zzso among most of the North zzso zzso with the exception of two zzso acid zzso in both zzso in a few of these zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso were not recognized by any of the five zzso indicating that genetic variation could lead to altered zzso Eight out of nine zzso fragments, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recognized by zzso pig serum as determined by Western zzso zzso The results zzso may zzso partially the zzso structure of zzso and variations of zzso
