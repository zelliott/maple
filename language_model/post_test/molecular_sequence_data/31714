Wood decomposition is an important component in forest zzso but information about the diversity of zzso causing zzso is zzso This is especially true for the temperate rain forests in zzso These investigations show results of a zzso study of zzso zzso in wood obtained from zzso National Park in Los zzso region, zzso zzso from zzso wood followed by sequencing of the complete internal transcribed zzso region of the zzso DNA zzso or partial large zzso region of the zzso identified 12 different species in the zzso All of these zzso were characterized as white rot zzso and were identified with a zzso match of 97 % or greater to sequences in the zzso zzso zzso obtained were species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This report identifies for the first time in Chile the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso was used to characterize the type of zzso caused by the zzso that were isolated and a combination of selective zzso zzso and simultaneous white rot zzso were zzso zzso that cause a selective degradation of zzso are of interest for zzso technologies that require modification or degradation of zzso without cellulose zzso
