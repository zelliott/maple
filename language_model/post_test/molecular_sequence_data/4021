The zzso effect of zzso on zzso calcium concentration zzso has been investigated in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the reporter gene zzso and expressing human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso increase was zzso correlated with zzso density and was higher in cells expressing zzso receptors than in cells expressing a similar zzso zzso zzso The study was performed to establish the zzso sequence responsible for that zzso zzso zzso receptors were first used for a broad zzso those having the third zzso loop zzso of the zzso or of the zzso zzso zzso in that respect, zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso Replacement in the zzso zzso of the sequence zzso zzso within the zzso by its zzso zzso counterpart zzso zzso and the introduction of zzso in state of zzso in zzso was sufficient to mimic the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, a small sequence in the zzso of the zzso zzso probably through interaction with zzso and zzso zzso is responsible for the efficient zzso zzso zzso
