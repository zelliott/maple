zzso is a general zzso factor required for the assembly of the zzso machinery on most zzso promoters transcribed by zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is able to support core promoter and zzso zzso under some circumstances, the roles of zzso factors zzso in zzso zzso remain zzso To define the zzso zzso function of zzso and to zzso the roles of zzso in gene zzso we have cloned the mouse zzso zzso of zzso and further isolated mouse zzso from a zzso zzso cell line that zzso expresses zzso mouse zzso Both mouse and human zzso are capable of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso containing different zzso zzso in a highly zzso human zzso zzso system devoid of zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso by zzso can also be observed in this highly zzso human zzso system with either mouse or zzso zzso zzso are strictly required for zzso zzso zzso independently of the core promoter zzso In addition, zzso are necessary for zzso from a zzso zzso zzso These findings clearly demonstrate an essential role of zzso as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso and in zzso zzso
