zzso an zzso zzso directed against the zzso terminal region of zzso zzso zzso we have examined the expression and distribution of the protein in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso sections of monkey brain demonstrated a zzso distribution of the protein throughout the zzso and zzso zzso was primarily zzso within zzso cell bodies and zzso zzso zzso regions included layers II, III, zzso and VI of cerebral cortex, zzso of the zzso zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso amygdala, thalamus, red nucleus, zzso zzso cells, and deep zzso zzso zzso analysis of extracts of frontal zzso from a wide variety of zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso detected a 190 zzso band in each zzso No zzso material of similar molecular weight was detected in an extract of avian zzso central nervous system zzso zzso Furthermore, in the zzso expression of the protein was predominantly zzso in origin as zzso analyses of zzso tissue extracts detected little or no 190 zzso zzso zzso these investigations suggest a ubiquitous expression of zzso in zzso zzso tissue and provide initial zzso data for the study of the zzso and perhaps, zzso relationships between zzso and zzso forms of the zzso
