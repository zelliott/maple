zzso zzso is a zzso zzso causing zzso human disease such as zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and it is currently classified as zzso to humans for zzso zzso zzso are zzso regulating small zzso molecules which are essential for the complex life cycles of zzso and are involved in zzso zzso To identify and characterize zzso expressed in adult zzso zzso residing chronically in the zzso zzso we developed an zzso approach combining deep sequencing and zzso predictions with zzso real-time zzso zzso 

Here we report the use of this approach to identify and clone 6 new and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which belonged to zzso zzso There was strong bias on families, family members and sequence zzso in zzso zzso zzso was the dominant zzso particularly at positions 1, 14 and 22, which were located approximately at the beginning, middle and end of zzso zzso There was no significant zzso zzso at the first and ninth positions which were commonly found in human, animals and zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso zzso were still innovated and concentrated along three branches of the zzso tree leading to zzso insects and zzso There were two zzso strategies in zzso zzso for its zzso life: keeping a large category of zzso families of different animals and keeping stringent zzso seed regions with high active innovation in other places of zzso mainly in the middle and the end, which were perfect for the zzso to perform its complex life style and for host zzso 

The present study represented the first large scale characterization of zzso zzso zzso which have implications for understanding the complex biology of this zzso zzso as well as zzso studies of other related species such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of human and animal health zzso
