zzso metal zzso are absolutely required for the structure and zzso activities of zzso They are partly coordinated to highly structured zzso which therefore possesses zzso metal zzso binding zzso As metal zzso induced zzso zzso are useful for zzso metal zzso binding sites and zzso structures, we zzso zzso zzso induced specific zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sites were identified by primer extension and compared to those previously identified for zzso lead, zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso sites, mostly those at which a general metal zzso binding site had been already identified, were identical to previously described zzso metal zzso Overall, the zzso zzso are most similar to the zzso zzso pattern, probably due to a similar zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso sites which were specific for zzso were located in regions implicated in the binding of zzso and zzso The binding of zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso efficiencies in the zzso zzso zzso The identification of specific zzso binding sites near the active sites on the zzso will allow to use the fluorescent properties of zzso for probing the environment of metal zzso binding pockets at the zzso active zzso
