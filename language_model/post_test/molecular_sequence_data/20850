zzso retention in zzso zzso receptors has been found in many zzso including rats and zzso The short transcript zzso that exclude alternatively spliced zzso are readily detected in very low abundance in rats and are zzso in mice using the regular zzso zzso The detailed mechanism for the special alternative zzso remains poorly zzso The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of essential zzso signals on zzso retention and to identify sequence elements that determine the differences in zzso between rats and zzso We have constructed a zzso system to mimic natural alternative zzso zzso and analyzed the regulatory elements in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso sites toward the consensus sequences can enhance the zzso of corresponding alternative zzso The effect is much more significant for the 3' zzso site of the longer zzso than for the other two zzso zzso it is also more significant in rats than in zzso The zzso differences between rats and mice are primarily determined by the six zzso zzso within the alternative zzso which promote or suppress the zzso zzso in different ways and cooperate to make zzso of the two zzso more efficient in zzso From these results we conclude that zzso the weakness of the zzso sites is an important zzso for very low efficiency during zzso zzso and, zzso multiple sequence elements determine the zzso differences between rats and zzso The results provide insight into special alternative zzso regulation in zzso zzso
