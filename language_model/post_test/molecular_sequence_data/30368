A fusion of DNA sequences zzso the zzso promoter, the zzso signal sequence from zzso zzso and the mature part of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso was constructed on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of the zzso strain zzso harboring this zzso produced and zzso the plant zzso zzso up to levels of 1,700 zzso A growth medium suppressing the residual zzso activity of strain zzso was used to reach these levels in a zzso zzso of the zzso product followed by zzso zzso acid sequencing showed that the zzso signal sequence had been processed zzso The molecular mass of the product estimated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso was slightly lower than that of the plant zzso zzso which is most likely due to zzso of the zzso The zzso product was active both on the artificial zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of this zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso seeds, indicating that zzso has no essential function for zzso zzso
