zzso zzso zzso was isolated from retail ground beef as part of a study on the genetic diversity of zzso zzso The strain was found to be a strictly zzso zzso zzso that was able to zzso zzso as a sole carbon zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that the strain was closely related to species within the zzso zzso and zzso but it was substantially different from the closest recognized species by nearly 10 % sequence zzso The strain was also found to be closely related zzso % sequence zzso to an zzso bacterial strain that was zzso from a zzso zzso gene clone library constructed to characterize the bacterial community of zzso from a captive spotted zzso zzso zzso zzso shared the zzso type zzso zzso with members of the zzso zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that strain zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso as a sole carbon source, in contrast to other species of the zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
