It has recently been shown that zzso zzso type 1, an essential regulator of inflammation and zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso has been well zzso very little is known about how zzso of zzso is zzso In this study, by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are defective in its zzso zzso activity, we show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso of zzso We further demonstrate that of all zzso family members zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso are positively correlated with zzso zzso shedding and subsequent zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso has a decisive role in zzso zzso and propose a molecular mechanism zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso of zzso through its zzso zzso zzso
