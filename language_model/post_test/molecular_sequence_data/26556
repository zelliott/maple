The zzso is a key zzso component for sister zzso cohesion and is the site for zzso assembly and zzso fiber attachment, allowing each sister zzso to faithfully segregate to each daughter cell during cell zzso It is not clear what types of sequences act as functional zzso and how zzso sequences are organized in zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that the three classes of zzso zzso satellites zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso share no zzso with the zzso satellites in zzso zzso The three classes of zzso satellites are all located within the zzso regions to which the zzso fibers attach and are characterized by zzso tandem zzso that are flanked by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Although these zzso satellites are zzso variable among 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso specific to zzso indicates that they are zzso with zzso in functional zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the three classes of zzso satellites may be the major components of functional zzso in zzso zzso
