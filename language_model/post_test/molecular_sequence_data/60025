We applied the improved sensitivity and soft zzso characteristics of zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso of flight zzso mass zzso zzso to analysis of the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso analysis was applied to the core structure zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso spectrum, zzso zzso such as zzso 162 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were clearly detected as characteristic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso On zzso analysis, zzso zzso of zzso peptides were detected as zzso zzso in the positive zzso zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using curved field zzso of zzso Most of the expected product zzso derived from the zzso zzso containing the core structure and an additional zzso side chain, were successively zzso Thus, zzso and zzso proved to be effective and sensitive methods for analyzing the zzso zzso structure with less than 10 zzso of zzso These characteristic fragments or fragmentation patterns seem to be very useful for identification of zzso zzso peptides derived from any kind of zzso zzso
