zzso zzso associated with Alzheimer's disease and a wide range of other neurodegenerative diseases have a cross zzso structure, where main chain hydrogen bonding occurs between zzso in the direction of the zzso zzso The surface of the zzso has pronounced zzso and grooves when the individual zzso have a parallel orientation and the zzso acids are zzso with one zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso packs against zzso in the zzso of zzso and against zzso in the zzso of zzso These packing interactions suggest that the zzso zzso are displaced relative to one another in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We take advantage of this corrugated structure to design a new class of zzso that prevent zzso formation by placing alternating zzso and aromatic zzso on one face of a zzso We show that zzso zzso based on a zzso framework disrupt zzso packing and inhibit the formation of mature zzso zzso as zzso by zzso T fluorescence, electron zzso and solid-state zzso zzso The alternating large and small zzso acids in the zzso sequence are complementary to the corresponding zzso acids in the zzso motif found in the zzso sequence of zzso and zzso zzso the designed zzso zzso significantly reduce the toxicity induced by zzso on cultured rat cortical zzso
