A simple rapid fluorescent method for the detection of zzso zzso activity of zzso type zzso in the tear fluid is zzso Small filter paper zzso were soaked in the zzso solution zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso 100 zzso zzso dissolved in zzso M zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso The dried zzso were soaked with tears (by direct contact of the punch with the site where the activity should be assessed or by dropping of 3-5 zzso of tears collected by a glass zzso The zzso were incubated in a thermostat zzso degrees zzso together with zzso containing a known zzso activity zzso zzso in zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso In 1 zzso intervals (during the first 15 zzso and in 5 zzso intervals thereafter the zzso were exposed to zzso light, and the time of the first appearance of a bright yellow zzso was zzso In zzso containing 5 zzso zzso activity zzso appeared after 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected after 5 zzso zzso zzso after 15 zzso zzso zzso after 30 zzso zzso zzso after 60 zzso zzso zzso after 90 zzso and zzso zzso after 120 zzso zzso This simple method is recommended for use particularly in clinical zzso It enables zzso to obtain a rather quick information about the zzso activity in the tear fluid and to start the treatment with an appropriate zzso if zzso
