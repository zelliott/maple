Small heat shock proteins zzso are a family of large and dynamic zzso highly expressed in zzso cells of muscle, lens and zzso Several family members are zzso during stress, and some are strongly zzso Their zzso has hindered high-resolution structure zzso particularly for zzso zzso Here, crystal structures of excised zzso domain from rat zzso and that from human zzso show that they form zzso with a shared groove at the interface by extending a beta zzso However, the two zzso differ in the register of their zzso The zzso have empty pockets that in large zzso will likely be filled by zzso sequence motifs from partner zzso In the zzso zzso the shared groove is partially filled by zzso in zzso II zzso zzso zzso with other zzso crystal structures indicates that in full-length chains the groove is likely filled by an zzso zzso Inside the groove is a zzso functionally important zzso that is zzso or its zzso in family members in a range of zzso diseases and zzso zzso of zzso within the groove of the zzso interface show that it has a high density of positive zzso The disease zzso zzso zzso domain zzso was found to be more stable at zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso affects the normal dynamics of zzso zzso The structures provide a starting point for zzso higher assembly by defining the spatial locations of grooves and pockets in a basic zzso assembly zzso The structures provide a high-resolution view of a candidate functional state of an zzso that could bind non-native client proteins or specific components from zzso zzso The empty pockets and groove provide a starting model for designing drugs to inhibit those zzso that have a negative effect on cancer zzso
