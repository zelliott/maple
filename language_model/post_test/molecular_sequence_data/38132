The identification of the new zzso zzso which was found in a woman of Syrian origin and her son, is zzso In the sequence analysis the new zzso differs from zzso by positions 259 zzso and 261 zzso in zzso zzso As the structure is thus identical to the zzso consensus sequence it is likely that the new zzso originated by gene zzso At the protein level, the new zzso has one zzso acid difference from zzso zzso which results in a distinct zzso pattern in one zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 63 contributes to the formation of pocket A and B and is thus important for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso only by two of six zzso but by three zzso zzso The restricted zzso zzso activity may be explained by altered zzso binding as presented peptides can affect the zzso recognition of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso Moreover, our findings suggest that a possible mismatch with the other known zzso zzso may impair clinical outcome of bone zzso zzso
