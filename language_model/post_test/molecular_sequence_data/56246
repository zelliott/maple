DNA zzso breaks are considered to be the most deleterious zzso induced by zzso zzso However, the mechanism of rejoining of these zzso has not been extensively studied at the molecular zzso We have used a shuttle zzso zzso to analyze the mechanism of rejoining of DNA zzso breaks in human zzso The advantage of this zzso system is that, unlike many previously described shuttle zzso it has a large target gene for the detection of deletions and it is maintained as a freely replicating zzso with zzso zzso in the nucleus of human zzso In this study we compare data obtained on the spectrum of zzso induced in zzso by zzso radiation zzso and restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso Unlike zzso radiation, restriction zzso induce zzso breaks in DNA with known end structures at defined locations and therefore provide a model system for analyzing cellular responses to DNA zzso zzso Exposure of human cells containing the zzso to zzso zzso produced both point zzso and large deletions in zzso When the junction regions of the deletions were zzso it was found that zzso were rejoined with up to 6 zzso of zzso at the junction zzso Analysis of zzso zzso suggests that zzso break ends are modified to facilitate rejoining and that the type of modification is characteristic for different end zzso zzso breaks with cohesive ends appear to have fewer modifications introduced at the break points before rejoining than breaks with blunt zzso When considered in relation to the data obtained with zzso radiation this suggests that the presence of cohesive sequences either at, or in proximity to, the ends enhances rejoining of DNA zzso zzso
