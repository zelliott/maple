The zzso sequences of two zzso zzso from Honduras were zzso The symptoms of both viruses are identical in zzso zzso but different in zzso zzso An additional symptom of one virus was yellow vein clearing on infected zzso zzso zzso Both zzso golden mosaic viruses zzso and zzso have zzso zzso zzso A and zzso From the zzso zzso zzso plant two different DNA B molecules were isolated and zzso They differ in length by 24 zzso zzso B1 zzso zzso and B2 zzso zzso and at eight zzso zzso Both proteins zzso by DNA B zzso and zzso are affected by these zzso Computer analysis shows that the zzso zzso resemble those of other zzso zzso From zzso analyses we conclude that both viruses are closely related but zzso zzso with a zzso virus from Costa Rica zzso showed that the two viruses from Honduras are more similar to each other than either of them are to zzso Exchange of zzso and zzso zzso components resulted in viable zzso zzso zzso DNA A was able to produce a viable zzso with zzso DNA B while the zzso exchange was not infectious in zzso zzso zzso DNA A and zzso DNA B produced a viable zzso virus whereas only zzso of zzso DNA A with zzso DNA zzso and not with DNA zzso was infectious in zzso zzso
