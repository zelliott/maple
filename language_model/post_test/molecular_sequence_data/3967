Using sequence zzso searches, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches we have identified a series of zzso zzso zzso that interact zzso with the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments identified more interactions than detected by zzso zzso zzso We report several zzso zzso strong ones include: zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with all forms of zzso and zzso We further characterized the novel zzso interaction found both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and observed that zzso zzso overlapped with zzso with in zzso zzso The wide range of targets for zzso zzso and zzso suggests they may represent a molecular mechanism that can concentrate and/or regulate a number of different receptors at a common site on a zzso These data also suggest that the structural zzso involved in zzso interactions are more complex than originally zzso
