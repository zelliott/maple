The synthesis of reaction center protein zzso and zzso which zzso this protein are zzso maintained at high levels in mature barley zzso To understand the differential maintenance of zzso zzso zzso we have studied the zzso and the zzso produced from the zzso zzso in zzso of light and zzso barley zzso Ten zzso zzso zzso in zzso barley share four different zzso two of which arise by zzso zzso and one of which is generated by zzso of longer zzso zzso zzso of zzso barley causes the decline of these ten zzso and the zzso of two different zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso processing experiments and treatment of plants with zzso (a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso indicate that the zzso transcripts arise by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments provide evidence that both zzso zzso and zzso stability play roles in the zzso of the zzso zzso These data document a novel mechanism for regulating zzso gene expression involving a zzso switch in zzso promoter zzso
