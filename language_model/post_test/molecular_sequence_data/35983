zzso The primary structures of two zzso of rainbow trout zzso zzso plasma zzso protein zzso were determined and found to be approximately zzso identical with those of both human and zzso zzso zzso The comparable sequence similarities that we have found agree with the estimate of similar divergence times between zzso zzso and zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso The two zzso zzso zzso differ by six zzso acid zzso at positions that are not crucial for the interaction with retinol, on the basis of the human zzso three-dimensional structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Jones, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso zzso Models were developed for the three-dimensional structures of rainbow trout and zzso zzso zzso based on that of human zzso The overall three-dimensional structure appears to be very well preserved for zzso isolated from zzso species for which the divergence time is zzso million zzso At zzso with an almost absolute conservation for the zzso that participate in the formation of the zzso binding site in zzso zzso several zzso acid replacements are found for this part of the zzso zzso when the comparison is extended to zzso and zzso zzso However, the only allowed zzso acid replacements are either conservative or more than zzso zzso distant from zzso Besides the zzso binding site, a few regions at the protein surface appear to be rather zzso during zzso development of zzso and, therefore, might be involved in molecular zzso
