The zzso protein from zzso zzso was recently discovered as an zzso zzso zzso is most likely delivered via a zzso zzso system into zzso cells and does not have a zzso zzso This is in contrast to the family of zzso zzso toxins from various zzso and zzso zzso However, there are zzso in zzso acid sequences between the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso toxins such as C2 toxin from zzso zzso and iota toxin from zzso zzso We compared the zzso properties of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso with the zzso components of C2 toxin and iota zzso The specificity of zzso concerning the modification of zzso or zzso was comparable to the C2 and iota zzso although there were distinct differences regarding the recognition of zzso zzso zzso and iota toxin modify both muscle zzso and zzso zzso whereas C2 toxin only zzso zzso In contrast to the iota and C2 zzso zzso possessed no zzso zzso activity in the absence of a protein zzso The zzso reaction rates were comparable for all zzso whereas variable zzso values for zzso were zzso We identified zzso as the modification site for zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso
