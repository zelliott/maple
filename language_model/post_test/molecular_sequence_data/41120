Although zzso zzso stores play a critical role in organisms, mechanisms underlying zzso synthesis are poorly understood in zzso In zzso the synthesis of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurs predominantly by the zzso zzso zzso in most cell types, except for in zzso In these cells, the zzso zzso zzso accounts for the majority of zzso zzso The insect zzso zzso a zzso of zzso disease, exhibits a high capacity to produce zzso in the zzso after a blood zzso providing zzso that are transferred to other zzso such as the fat body, which is specialized in zzso production and zzso In this report, the genes required for zzso synthesis were identified in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso data indicated that zzso is zzso by the zzso pathway, which is the sole zzso for zzso synthesis in this zzso Furthermore, zzso of both the zzso and zzso genes were zzso in a diverse number of zzso at moments of highest zzso zzso In the zzso and fat body, in zzso synthesis of zzso required zzso but not zzso as the initial zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is the only route for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso and its regulation at the zzso level can be a zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso formation in insect zzso
