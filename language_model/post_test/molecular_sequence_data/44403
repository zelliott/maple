The protein sequence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was used to search open reading frames in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of two unidentified open reading frames showed significant sequence similarity to portions of the zzso zzso zzso When the two open reading frames were joined together, the expanded open reading frame was similar in sequence to the entire zzso zzso protein and displayed features of the active site signature sequence proposed for members of class I zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso et zzso 1996, zzso 2, zzso A possible zzso start zzso was identified based on significant sequence similarity of the resulting zzso region to that of zzso and on a zzso zzso between an adjacent upstream sequence and zzso zzso zzso
