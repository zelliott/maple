Using the technique of differential zzso library zzso a zzso clone was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso breast zzso cell line zzso zzso library based upon the zzso of this gene compared to an zzso cell line zzso zzso analysis of this clone determined that it shared significant zzso to zzso zzso This zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso breast zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso was absent or minimal in the zzso breast zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso expressed in human zzso examined but was most abundant in zzso zzso expression was examined in 11 primary breast zzso zzso was detected in all 4 zzso tumors and only 1 of 7 zzso zzso Based upon zzso analysis in hybrid cell lines, the gene for zzso zzso symbol zzso was mapped to zzso zzso The pattern of expression of zzso indicates that this zzso may be involved in zzso responses specific to zzso responsive zzso
