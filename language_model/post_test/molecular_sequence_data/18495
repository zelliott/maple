The zzso marine zzso zzso zzso was successfully cultured from temperate sediments of the Pacific Ocean zzso Bay, offshore Kochi zzso Japan) with the highest latitude of zzso ever reported for this zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the zzso Bay strains are of the same zzso as the type strain zzso zzso zzso However, sequence analysis of their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed novel sequence zzso In total, five new ITS sequences were discovered and further zzso analyses using zzso B and zzso zzso zzso domain sequences supported the zzso diversity of the novel zzso zzso zzso of secondary zzso genes in these strains revealed the presence of zzso domain sequences previously reported in zzso zzso strains isolated from the Sea of Cortez, the Bahamas and the Red zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso which are highly zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso were detected in several zzso Bay zzso making this report the first detection of zzso genes in zzso zzso The results of this study provide evidence of a much wider geographical distribution and secondary metabolism diversity in this zzso than previously zzso
