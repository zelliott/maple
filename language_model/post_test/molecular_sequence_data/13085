By screening for zzso that suppress the zzso defects caused by a zzso active zzso zzso zzso we identified six zzso zzso of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso Our genetic analysis showed zzso positively mediates Ras signaling and functions downstream of or in parallel to zzso In the absence of zzso function, normal Ras signaling is impaired only slightly, suggesting zzso may act to zzso or in a branch that zzso from, the main signaling zzso The predicted zzso protein has a protein zzso domain and is most similar to a recently identified zzso protein involved in Ras zzso We propose that the function of zzso is zzso zzso
