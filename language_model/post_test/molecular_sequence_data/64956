The genetic and zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso and Far East zzso virus zzso which are both within the zzso zzso were zzso Representative zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and Bao 14 for zzso were zzso The entire small zzso and medium zzso zzso except for the zzso and zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso had zzso and zzso identities with the zzso zzso virus in the S and M zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso had zzso and zzso identities in the S and M zzso zzso The three viral strains and zzso virus had similar binding patterns to a panel of zzso zzso zzso except that one zzso did not bind zzso However, zzso from zzso zzso naturally infected with zzso virus, neutralized zzso viruses at zzso to zzso zzso and zzso at zzso to 1:40 zzso The zzso serum neutralized zzso viruses at a zzso dilution and zzso at a 1:40 zzso The zzso serum did not neutralize zzso zzso zzso although it had a high zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso virus may constitute a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso
