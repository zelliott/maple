zzso zzso necrosis virus zzso a member of the family zzso causes a severe disease with high mortality in zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso of the entire zzso was determined for the zzso zzso strain of zzso from southern zzso This allowed detailed analysis of all 6 zzso the deduced zzso acid sequences of their zzso zzso and important control motifs including leader, trailer and gene junction zzso zzso analysis revealed that the 6 virus genes are located along the zzso in the 3' to zzso order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso surface zzso zzso a unique zzso protein zzso and virus zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to have highly complementary zzso (15 of 16 zzso The gene junction regions display the highly zzso sequence zzso (in the zzso zzso which includes the typical zzso zzso zzso signal and a novel putative zzso initiation zzso zzso analysis of M, G and L protein sequences allowed insights into the evolutionary and zzso relationship of zzso of fish relative to those of insects or zzso and a broader sense of the relationship of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these data, a new zzso zzso is proposed which will initially contain zzso viral zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso
