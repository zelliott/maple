zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been identified through expression zzso A zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso zzso zzso was used in zzso to detect zzso to zzso zzso in 239 of 240 zzso zzso and 41 of 42 zzso confirmed positive by zzso zzso The 1 zzso zzso serum was used to zzso a novel gene that contained a repeat zzso A zzso corresponding to this zzso zzso was specific for zzso zzso This zzso detected the zzso zzso serum and enhanced zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso synthetic zzso zzso or a linear zzso zzso realized all of the diagnostic features of the four zzso including the ability to boost zzso of zzso zzso These studies show that peptides and zzso containing multiple repeat zzso are powerful tools for developing zzso for zzso zzso zzso detection and have direct application in blood zzso
