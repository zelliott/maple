zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso is the sole DNA zzso responsible for replication and repair of animal zzso zzso Here, we address the molecular mechanism by which the human zzso achieves high zzso in zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of human pol zzso the accessory zzso that binds with high affinity to the zzso core, pol zzso to stimulate its activity and enhance zzso zzso We find that human pol zzso shares a high level of structural similarity to class zzso zzso zzso zzso and forms a zzso in the zzso A human pol zzso complex model was developed using the structures of the pol zzso zzso and the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso complex, which suggests multiple regions of zzso interaction between pol zzso and the human zzso core that allow it to zzso the newly zzso zzso DNA, and thereby enhance DNA binding affinity and zzso zzso zzso properties of a novel set of human pol zzso zzso are explained by and test the model, and zzso the role of the accessory zzso as a novel type of zzso factor in stimulating pol gamma activity and in enhancing zzso
