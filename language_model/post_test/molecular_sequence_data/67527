zzso are zzso zzso zzso receptors that play key roles in cellular physiology and zzso zzso data indicate that the two zzso motifs in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso promote zzso zzso through the binding of zzso and zzso However, it is unclear how the individual motifs regulate zzso function and zzso 

To investigate how the two zzso motifs individually control zzso zzso function and trafficking, we introduced Y zzso A zzso in either zzso zzso of the zzso zzso completely prevented zzso zzso changes, cell scattering and migration, and zzso zzso In addition, it reduced zzso zzso but not its zzso In contrast, disruption of the zzso zzso promoted degradation of zzso in late zzso but did not prevent zzso cell zzso migration, or zzso zzso Whereas depletion of either zzso or zzso reduced zzso binding to zzso and cell zzso zzso depletion zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso depletion induced zzso zzso in zzso and zzso 

The two zzso motifs of zzso play distinct and zzso roles in controlling the function and trafficking of zzso Whereas zzso binding to the zzso zzso is crucial for connecting zzso to the zzso zzso and thus permit the tension required for zzso zzso and cell migration, zzso binding to the zzso zzso is zzso for these events but regulates zzso surface expression and zzso
