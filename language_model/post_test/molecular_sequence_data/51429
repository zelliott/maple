We present here an analysis of the spectrum of zzso of the zzso gene seen in zzso bone and soft tissue zzso of various zzso zzso Gross zzso were analyzed by Southern zzso using a complementary DNA probe from the zzso zzso and subtle zzso in the entire coding sequence zzso 2 through zzso were identified by a combination of zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct zzso zzso A total of 42 zzso zzso of the zzso gene were found, of which 21 were gross zzso and 21 were subtle zzso These included 17 cases of a single base zzso 3 small zzso and one single base zzso In contrast to reported findings for other types of cancer, we found that zzso of the zzso gene in zzso are quite zzso both in their distribution throughout the gene and in the type of genetic zzso that zzso All 13 zzso zzso we found occurred at highly zzso zzso whereas 8 nonsense zzso occurred at sites that spanned the gene from zzso 46 to zzso Surprisingly, approximately one-half of the zzso with zzso deletions on zzso did not have zzso zzso in the coding sequence of the zzso zzso
