In zzso cells, CLS zzso zzso is involved in the final step of zzso synthesis by zzso the transfer of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso to PG zzso Despite an important role of zzso in regulating zzso function, a gene zzso the zzso CLS has not been identified so zzso We report in the present study the identification and characterization of a human zzso zzso the first zzso CLS zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso sequence shares significant zzso with the zzso and plant CLS zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso efficiently the synthesis of zzso in zzso using zzso and PG as zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in a significant increase in zzso synthesis in intact zzso cells without any significant effects on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein was localized to the zzso when zzso expressed in zzso cells, which was further zzso by results from zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was predominantly expressed in zzso that require high levels of zzso activities for energy zzso with the highest expression in skeletal and cardiac zzso High levels of zzso expression were also detected in liver, zzso kidney and small zzso zzso a functional role of zzso in these zzso
