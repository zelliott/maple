zzso zzso zzso zzso which participate in a variety of signal zzso events, are known to zzso to the zzso face of the plasma membrane through zzso zzso Recently, we showed that zzso an zzso member, is zzso to the plasma membrane via the zzso region along the zzso zzso We show here that zzso trafficking is specified by the zzso zzso Yes is also a zzso zzso and is zzso transported from the zzso pool of zzso to the plasma zzso This zzso can be inhibited in the zzso network zzso surface delivery by temperature block at 19 degrees C or zzso zzso zzso A large fraction of zzso a zzso zzso zzso is directly targeted to the plasma membrane irrespective of temperature block of zzso zzso zzso which lacks the second zzso site, is able to traffic in the same way as Lyn and zzso Moreover, construction of zzso and zzso Lyn or Yes with the zzso zzso further zzso the importance of the dual zzso site for plasma membrane zzso Taken together with our recent finding that zzso a zzso zzso is rapidly exchanged between the plasma membrane and late zzso these results suggest that zzso trafficking is specified by the zzso state in the zzso zzso
