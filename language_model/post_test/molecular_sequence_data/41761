The transforming activity of zzso zzso E zzso units zzso of human zzso zzso strain was originally localized in two terminal zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso to zzso are located in the same region zzso unit zzso and zzso is located in the zzso zzso zzso protein increases zzso zzso activity and causes zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the potential transforming activity of zzso zzso plus its zzso region zzso zzso and the remaining zzso of zzso after deletion of zzso plus zzso zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso is not involved in zzso and that the transforming activity of zzso is located in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequence analysis reveals four putative open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The data from the deletion clones of the zzso zzso zzso and also by disruption of individual zzso by restriction zzso zzso suggest that a complete zzso zzso or zzso may be essential but not sufficient for the transforming zzso Because significant reduction in transforming activity is obtained by interrupting zzso zzso and zzso these zzso may be required for the full transforming zzso
