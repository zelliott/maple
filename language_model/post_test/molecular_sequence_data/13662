We investigated whether the zzso mechanisms controlling zzso zzso or zzso are similar in normal zzso compared with the zzso zzso cell zzso In primary rat zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso and zzso decrease in the amount of the zzso zzso which correlated with functional zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso The suppression of zzso zzso was specific for zzso because a representative zzso and zzso were without effect, and zzso suppression of zzso zzso could be reversed by zzso with an zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso appears to be zzso because following zzso D zzso of new zzso zzso the zzso transcript disappeared at a faster rate in zzso treated versus zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity of zzso zzso plasmids containing the zzso promoter in primary rat zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso Thus, suppression of zzso zzso by zzso in primary zzso is due to a decrease in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso dose zzso increased zzso protein and zzso zzso effects which parallel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was specific for zzso since a representative zzso had no significant effect on zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was not due to a global zzso of zzso zzso factors because zzso treatment did not activate either a zzso zzso virus zzso zzso promoter or the zzso early gene zzso Further studies with a panel of zzso zzso sequence deletion plasmids revealed that the minimal promoter zzso zzso was not activated by zzso In contrast, inclusion of sequences up to zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso These are the first studies to demonstrate that zzso regulate zzso by different mechanisms in normal rat zzso compared to the zzso zzso cell zzso
