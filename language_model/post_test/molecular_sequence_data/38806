zzso clones zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso I) were isolated from a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso clones is 526 zzso acids in length and has highly zzso motifs among zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso The expressed zzso zzso exhibited similar zzso specificity to chicken zzso zzso The mouse zzso I gene was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mouse zzso I gene was also cloned from a mouse zzso library, which was divided into 9 zzso spanning over 8 zzso of zzso zzso The zzso structure of the mouse zzso I gene was similar to that of the mouse zzso II zzso Unlike the zzso II zzso however, which has a zzso zzso promoter with zzso zzso the zzso I gene has two promoters and they do not contain zzso sequences but contain putative binding sites for zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso products suggested that the mouse zzso I gene expression is regulated by these two promoters in zzso zzso
