The zzso zzso gene zzso in a primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was analyzed using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso In all single B cells obtained from zzso skin sections that gave a zzso chain reaction product zzso of 27 in biopsy zzso the same zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso was zzso with no zzso zzso zzso zzso with the most closely related zzso counterpart showed significantly altered zzso determining gene regions as a result of zzso zzso suggesting an zzso selection and expansion zzso particular zzso zzso Interestingly, in a biopsy obtained from the patient 9 zzso later, during disease progression zzso muscle zzso the zzso cells again contained the same zzso gene zzso (six of 18 in biopsy zzso without any further zzso zzso zzso it is suggested that the zzso zzso characterized throughout this study descended from zzso center zzso
