The zzso are a family of zzso involved in recruiting other zzso zzso binding of zzso cargo and induction of membrane zzso These molecules bear a characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and multiple zzso motifs that mediate zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso is involved in zzso signaling zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso zzso 2 zzso plays a signaling role during cell zzso We observed that zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso but not zzso promoted the formation of chains of cells and zzso zzso This zzso effect resulted from zzso interference with zzso assembly zzso We mapped the zzso zzso responsible for induction of the zzso and found them to be important for efficient binding to the zzso regulatory zzso zzso Supporting a zzso role for zzso 2 in cell division, the protein localized to sites of polarized growth and zzso and rescued a zzso in cell division induced by zzso zzso zzso our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism linking zzso (via zzso 2) with signaling pathways regulating cell zzso
