In plants, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other metal zzso into zzso using the zzso zzso formed by zzso and zzso Such zzso carrying 11 zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from plants, zzso and zzso In this study, multiple sequence alignment of several zzso revealed the presence of highly zzso zzso regions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso These two repetitive motifs are designated repeats zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso we generated 31 zzso in the repeats of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in a zzso zzso strain that is sensitive to zzso and zzso because of the absence of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were classified into six classes according to their tolerance for zzso and zzso For example, the class III zzso had no tolerance for either zzso and the class IV zzso had tolerance only for zzso The zzso function of each zzso was zzso We investigated the membrane zzso of the repeats using a method combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that repeat zzso zzso the membrane from the zzso zzso side and forms a zzso zzso Furthermore, several zzso in repeats zzso and zzso were found to be zzso in animal zzso zzso Finally, we suggest that these zzso repeats may form a zzso or filter for zzso zzso
