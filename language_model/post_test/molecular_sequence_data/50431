zzso is a zzso that binds zzso to zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso were zzso The sequences of the two zzso zzso and zzso are identical to those found in the chicken zzso zzso core zzso In zzso gels zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 21 zzso and zzso directed against calf zzso total zzso zzso zzso with zzso The preferential binding of zzso zzso to zzso DNA is not zzso but requires a minimum length of 30 base pairs and one pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso on both zzso zzso zzso As previously zzso there is a decrease in the binding activity of zzso to zzso DNA upon zzso zzso zzso show that upon zzso treatment the amount of zzso zzso protein remains zzso zzso enables another protein to bind DNA which by itself does not bind zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso show that in zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso may participate in the long-term zzso of genes zzso of zzso through selective binding to zzso zzso
