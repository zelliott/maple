The zzso zzso of small zzso has been demonstrated to play an important role in the regulation of membrane traffic in zzso zzso Compared with zzso cells, zzso cells have distinct zzso and zzso transport pathways which need to be separately zzso This raises the question whether zzso cells require specific zzso zzso However, all zzso proteins identified so far were found to be equally expressed in polarized and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of zzso the first zzso zzso small zzso Northern zzso analysis on various mouse zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is present in zzso liver, and zzso but not in zzso lacking zzso cells nor in zzso To determine whether zzso is specific for zzso cells we studied its expression in the developing zzso We found that zzso is absent from the zzso precursors but is induced upon their differentiation into zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies on the embryonic kidney and zzso revealed that zzso is restricted to zzso zzso By zzso and zzso zzso on kidney zzso zzso was localized to the zzso plasma membrane and to zzso zzso zzso proteins associated with two distinct compartments have been found to regulate transport between zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso might be involved in zzso zzso
