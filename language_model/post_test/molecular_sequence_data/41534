zzso browsing can have a strong effect on ecological processes by affecting plant community structure and zzso with zzso effects on zzso cycling and animal zzso However, in the absence of direct observations of zzso zzso zzso zzso are difficult to zzso We therefore know relatively little about zzso competition and zzso browsing patterns in systems with several zzso However, during browsing, a small amount of saliva containing zzso cells is deposited at the bite site, providing a source of environmental DNA zzso that can be used for species zzso Here, we describe extraction and zzso protocols for a browser species diagnostic zzso zzso zzso for zzso DNA were zzso and validated using zzso zzso by captive zzso A time series showed that about 50% of the samples will amplify up to 12 weeks after the browsing event and that some samples amplify up to 24 weeks after browsing zzso zzso to samples of natural browsing from an area where zzso zzso zzso zzso deer zzso zzso fallow deer zzso zzso and red deer zzso zzso are zzso amplification success reached zzso This method promises to greatly improve our understanding of zzso browsing systems without the need for direct zzso
