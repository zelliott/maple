The expression and zzso of zzso growth factor zzso were investigated in human zzso zzso with or without benign zzso Using a zzso chain reaction method, we were able to demonstrate that zzso zzso with benign zzso expressed a significantly higher level of zzso growth factor zzso zzso than normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso Western zzso analysis using an zzso against the zzso gave 2 bands with molecular weights of about 140 zzso and 80 zzso these zzso to the expected sizes of the long and zzso forms of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso An zzso study using the same zzso further demonstrated that the zzso zzso occurred mainly in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso and occasionally in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso growth factors may influence, at least in part, the proliferation of the zzso cells seen in benign zzso of human zzso
