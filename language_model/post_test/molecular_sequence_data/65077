This report describes a study carried out to gain baseline information on the molecular characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso in zzso A total of zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened at 12 participating zzso Of these, zzso clinically zzso zzso zzso displaying reduced zzso to the zzso zzso were submitted to a central laboratory over a zzso period ending on 30 September zzso A total of 116 zzso were confirmed to be zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Five novel zzso were identified and designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, no molecular mechanism was identified for five zzso displaying an zzso zzso zzso analysis of all zzso zzso was conducted, as was restriction zzso length zzso analysis of plasmids harboring zzso Although a zzso distribution of zzso was observed at some individual sites, there was very little evidence suggesting zzso zzso In addition, examples of identical or closely related plasmids that were identified at geographically distinct sites across Canada are zzso However, there was considerable diversity with respect to zzso types zzso
