We have used zzso scanning zzso to identify zzso in zzso domain 5 of the zzso zzso zzso that are important for zzso zzso All of the zzso generated were functionally expressed as demonstrated by their ability to bind zzso with comparable affinity to the zzso zzso and their ability to inhibit zzso zzso formation when activated by zzso Many zzso produced small changes in the potency of zzso but the most pronounced reduction in potency and affinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was seen with zzso of zzso zzso Our modeling suggests that this zzso plays a key role in zzso binding by interacting with the zzso ring of zzso Interestingly, zzso greatly reduced zzso potency in functional zzso but had only minor effects on zzso zzso implicating a role for this zzso in the mechanism of zzso zzso We also studied the functional effects of the zzso by linking the zzso to calcium signaling using a zzso G zzso A comparison of the two functional zzso demonstrated contrasting effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were full zzso in the zzso zzso but zzso exhibited only partial zzso activity through the zzso G zzso Furthermore, zzso another potent zzso in the zzso zzso was only able to activate the zzso zzso in the calcium zzso despite being inactive at the zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso complexes formed by these three different zzso zzso are not zzso zzso
