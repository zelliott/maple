The zzso unknown relationships between the European zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its internally associated zzso were explored by a combined approach involving zzso investigations at a zzso level as well as by molecular analyses of the identity of the zzso zzso present in the root tissue of the zzso We found that this zzso which is currently reported to have a vulnerable status in northern Italy, can host and interact with at least nine types of zzso Some of these zzso show similarity to zzso zzso found in zzso such as the zzso zzso Other zzso found are from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso some of which until have not previously been reported to have an zzso relationship with zzso The repeated occurrence of often zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within healthy specimens of this zzso suggests a tempered interaction with species that are sometimes deleterious to zzso zzso The fact is reminiscent of the symbiotic compromise established by zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso
