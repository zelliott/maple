zzso zzso in zzso of patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso have been described zzso but the corresponding zzso have not been analyzed zzso We therefore used both zzso and high-resolution zzso gel zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso acid sequencing to identify the relevant zzso zzso which are recognized by serum zzso zzso were obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso 75) and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso For detection of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso particles isolated from a bovine heart, was separated on zzso and all zzso were examined by zzso zzso For further characterization of the zzso zzso the zzso fraction was separated in the first dimension according to zzso points using zzso focusing followed by gel zzso zzso recognized by serum zzso in zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso analysis, 51% of patients with zzso and zzso of controls contained serum zzso reacting with zzso protein bands with molecular weights of about 30, 43, 60, and zzso 50 to 55 and 70 to 75 zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients vs zzso in controls, p zzso and 2 core proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients vs zzso in controls, p zzso core zzso zzso in zzso patients vs zzso in controls, p zzso both zzso of the respiratory chain, as are most relevant zzso zzso Furthermore, serum zzso of patients with zzso were directed against zzso zzso vs zzso in zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso vs zzso in zzso Because these zzso play an important role in energy zzso the respective zzso can be more than merely diagnostic markers of cell zzso To attribute them also to zzso relevance appears to be a most attractive but still speculative zzso
