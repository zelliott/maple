zzso import into zzso is a widespread zzso zzso in details for zzso zzso and plants, it still awaits thorough investigation for human cells, in which the nuclear zzso zzso zzso is zzso Only the general requirements for this zzso have been zzso whereas specific protein factors needed for zzso zzso delivery into zzso and its structural zzso of import remain zzso In this study, a systematic analysis of the possible role of human zzso zzso structural elements in import was zzso Our experiments in zzso and in zzso show that two distinct regions of the human zzso zzso zzso are needed for its zzso zzso One of them is located in the zzso part of the zzso I and contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso The second and most important one is associated with the loop zzso IV region with several zzso structural zzso zzso or even zzso of these sites leads to a significant decrease of the zzso zzso import zzso On the contrary, the zzso of the zzso zzso was proven to be zzso for import, and thus it can be deleted or zzso without affecting the zzso zzso zzso This finding was used to demonstrate that the zzso zzso can function as a zzso for delivering zzso zzso sequences into human zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a substitution of a part of the zzso by a foreign zzso sequence were shown to be much more efficiently imported in zzso than the zzso zzso zzso
