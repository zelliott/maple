A T zzso G zzso at position zzso in human zzso DNA is associated with the syndrome zzso zzso and zzso zzso and with a zzso inherited form of zzso zzso The zzso zzso an zzso for a zzso at zzso acid position 156 in zzso 6, a component of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring high levels of the zzso zzso have decreased zzso synthesis activity, but do not display any growth zzso under standard culture zzso Combining the notions that cells with respiratory chain defects grow poorly in medium containing zzso as the major carbon source, and that resistance to zzso a zzso zzso is associated with zzso in the zzso 6 gene in the same zzso domain where the zzso zzso acid substitution is located, we created selective culture conditions using zzso and zzso that zzso a pathological zzso in zzso cells and that allowed for the rapid selection of zzso over zzso zzso zzso We then generated zzso hybrid clones containing zzso levels of the zzso zzso and showed that selection in zzso caused a significant increase in the fraction of zzso molecules (from 16 to zzso in these zzso
