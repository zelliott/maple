zzso zzso is a zzso protein and has many functions in zzso zzso zzso is possibly involved in zzso host immune system zzso To better understand the molecular basis of zzso in zzso we cloned and zzso 4 full-length complementary zzso zzso from the hard tick species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the technique of rapid amplification of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences share high identities (between 77 and zzso with 3 known tick zzso zzso The major characteristics of known zzso are observed in all 4 of our deduced tick zzso These include 3 major zzso a signal zzso sequence at the beginning of the coding region, 2 triplets of zzso regions, zzso sites providing zzso bridges for zzso zzso and a nuclear zzso zzso zzso the replacement of the zzso zzso retention signal zzso by zzso which is believed to be associated with zzso of zzso into the host during feeding and was previously recorded only in 2 ticks and a zzso is also present in all 4 of our tick putative zzso In addition, the zzso gene is potentially useful for tick zzso zzso
