zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways are the two classical zzso by which zzso elements are zzso A novel variation of cut and zzso a zzso zzso cycle, has recently been proposed for zzso sequences of the zzso zzso In zzso this variation involves the formation of a zzso putative zzso intermediate (the zzso in the first zzso Two aspects of the zzso may involve its proposed role in the second step zzso into the zzso The first is the presence of a highly zzso junction formed by the two zzso ends of the zzso The second is the assembly at the zzso junction of a strong hybrid promoter which generates higher levels of zzso In this report we show that zzso possesses a highly zzso zzso junction at which a strong promoter is assembled and that the promoter is needed for the efficient completion of the zzso We show that the sequence zzso which characterize the imperfect zzso repeats or ends of this element have evolved specifically to permit the formation and optimal function of this zzso While these sequence zzso eliminate zzso activity of the left end zzso in the linear element, sufficient sequence information essential for zzso is retained by the zzso in the context of the zzso zzso These data confirm that the zzso is an essential intermediate in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso
