zzso zzso zzso cell lines, representative of early embryonic zzso cells, are zzso for zzso zzso infection as a result of a blockade of viral DNA early zzso and zzso All enhancers of zzso zzso zzso zzso selected for the ability to grow on zzso zzso cells, display a zzso of zzso and zzso binding sites zzso 1 and zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso is complex and results in variable zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso of sites 1 and 3 is absolutely required for a cooperative zzso zzso of early zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we detect in zzso zzso cells significant amounts of site zzso and zzso zzso which we characterize as related to the zzso and zzso protein families, zzso zzso zzso restriction in zzso zzso cells may be relieved by a cooperation between site zzso and zzso proteins that would thereby be zzso Since site zzso or zzso factors could be zzso we improved the analysis of zzso zzso zzso complexes and were able to detect a novel factor, called zzso (for zzso zzso A site zzso and zzso zzso Its DNA binding sequence zzso sites 1 and 2 zzso binding zzso and is not duplicated in the zzso zzso which exhibits the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso he suggest that zzso is also involved in the regulation of zzso zzso activity by zzso the site zzso zzso
