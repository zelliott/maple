Using the zzso zzso zzso technique, we have screened 66 zzso zzso tumors for zzso zzso in zzso 5 to zzso Thirty-four of the tumors demonstrated a zzso zzso zzso band shift in this region of the zzso including 6 in zzso 5, 7 in zzso 6, 12 in zzso 7, and 10 in zzso 8 (one of the tumors showed a shift for zzso 7 and zzso All of the zzso zzso zzso shifts have been further characterized by DNA sequencing, and 31 of 35 have been shown to represent genuine DNA zzso These include 27 point zzso zzso zzso 2 nonsense, and 2 silent zzso 3 deletions (a zzso pair deletion zzso by zzso a stop zzso further zzso a zzso pair zzso and an unusual zzso pair deletion made up of separate zzso pair and zzso pair zzso and a zzso pair zzso zzso a stop zzso zzso In total, 29 of the 66 zzso zzso analyzed had zzso affecting the primary sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in tumors of all International Federation of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it might be an earlier genetic event in the progression of zzso zzso tumors than previously zzso A significantly greater number of zzso zzso were seen in high-grade zzso zzso than in those of zzso and zzso types zzso zzso P zzso zzso Analysis of the distribution of point zzso showed no preference for any particular zzso zzso
