We have zzso the sequence zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the light of the solution of the structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso This analysis indicates that the elements of secondary structure zzso the core of the two zzso in zzso zzso are zzso in the other two zzso There is a striking conservation of the zzso responsible for the recognition of the zzso ring of the zzso zzso and the backbone of the zzso acid zzso Furthermore, zzso involved in a major zzso zzso on zzso acid binding are zzso as are those implicated in the zzso zzso In contrast, the pattern of zzso between these zzso is consistent with possible differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity between these zzso is achieved by critical zzso at the base of the binding pocket, which zzso the zzso of the zzso acid zzso This provides insights into the zzso necessary to produce new zzso for the zzso synthesis of novel zzso zzso
