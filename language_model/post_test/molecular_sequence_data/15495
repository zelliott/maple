Two novel zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from the green zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strains represented a novel lineage within the family zzso The most closely related zzso with zzso published names were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso by gliding and grew at temperatures up to 49 degrees zzso They produced acid from carbohydrates and possessed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : 1) G, summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
