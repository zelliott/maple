The effects of transforming growth zzso zzso and serum on zzso synthesis by tissue zzso from the zzso region of adult bovine zzso and by cells in culture from this region were zzso The most characteristic effect of added zzso on both zzso tissue and cells in culture was enhanced synthesis of one small zzso zzso serum concentration diminished incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso cell zzso increased overall zzso zzso and increased the length of zzso chains on all zzso zzso The effect of zzso on cells in culture was highly consistent whereas zzso from different animals showed greater zzso in the zzso It was concluded that zzso did not specifically promote or maintain the zzso nature of this tissue because supplementing medium with zzso did not significantly alter the ratio of zzso zzso zzso by tissue zzso However, the observation of enhanced zzso synthesis by zzso suggests that zzso could be involved in differentiation of regions of zzso subjected to zzso because compressed zzso contains both zzso and zzso small zzso whereas zzso zzso contains primarily zzso Excess zzso added to cell culture medium did not affect the ability of zzso to enhance synthesis of zzso
