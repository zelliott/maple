The genetic zzso of familial zzso zzso is unclear in the majority of zzso zzso in zzso B zzso are the only confirmed causes of zzso Recently, zzso zzso of zzso gene have been shown to be associated with the zzso zzso Our primary goal was to confirm that zzso in zzso could be another cause of zzso Using the sequencing approach, we found that the zzso variation in zzso a common zzso zzso in both African American and Caucasian zzso is associated with the zzso zzso in three zzso zzso Then we tested whether this variation could be associated with lower cholesterol levels in the general zzso A total of zzso subjects from a Caucasian population, in which zzso zzso and normal groups were classified using standard criteria, were zzso for this zzso The zzso frequency of this variation in the zzso group was zzso but was only zzso in the normal zzso zzso The mean plasma zzso zzso zzso level in subjects zzso for this zzso is significantly lower than that in the normal group zzso zzso subjects also had higher zzso zzso zzso levels zzso In general, zzso concentration in individuals with zzso zzso variation was approximately zzso zzso lower than that in normal zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso plays a role in lowering cholesterol in the general zzso
