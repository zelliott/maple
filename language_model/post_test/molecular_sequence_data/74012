The relationship between expression level and zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso was determined in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso delta integration zzso zzso zzso productivity of 15 zzso of zzso cell dry weight yields 180 zzso zzso active zzso in zzso cultures, an order of magnitude increase over 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso productivity is determined by the protein folding capacity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein accumulates in the zzso as synthesis increases, until a zzso instability is reached and zzso decreases zzso despite high zzso zzso zzso zzso specific productivity of a standard laboratory strain of zzso zzso is double that reported for zzso of zzso by zzso zzso indicating that efficient zzso of zzso zzso available zzso capacity can eliminate apparent differences among zzso species in their capacity for zzso protein zzso Although not generally zzso the existence of an optimum synthesis level for zzso is apparently a general feature of zzso expression systems and could be of substantial significance for zzso of protein zzso in zzso and insect cell zzso
