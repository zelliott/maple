Six zzso class I and class zzso Chinese cell lines with unique zzso types were zzso Since the majority of zzso class II zzso sequence zzso is localized within the second zzso of the zzso we used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify these regions in zzso and zzso genes and subsequently determined the zzso zzso No unique zzso or zzso zzso were zzso However, a new zzso of zzso was found in two zzso and zzso was found in association with zzso in another two zzso This indicates that new zzso associations may explain the observed new zzso zzso The zzso sequences were identical in all six cells and were identical to a sequence previously reported in a zzso zzso The zzso sequences from two clones obtained from two cells differed from each other and from previously reported zzso The results show that the zzso and zzso zzso in the Chinese individuals studied are as previously reported in Caucasian populations and as such may be typed by restriction zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso typing zzso or zzso using conventional probe or restriction zzso zzso
