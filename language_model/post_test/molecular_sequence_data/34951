zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso with a broad host spectrum characterized by a unique and highly sophisticated invasion apparatus, the polar tube zzso In a previous study, two zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso and zzso (35 zzso were identified in zzso zzso an zzso zzso that is used as a biological control agent against zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso with a band zzso at zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso is closely related to zzso A zzso search against the zzso zzso zzso database allowed the identification of two further zzso proteins named zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both proteins are characterized by a specific zzso and zzso zzso extension with zzso structural features and share a common zzso end zzso with zzso zzso identity for the last 250 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso band revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso spores, confirming that this zzso is a zzso zzso Finally, we showed that several zzso proteins are also present in other zzso related insect zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso
