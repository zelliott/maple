The induction of zzso expression by zzso on the surface of various zzso presenting cells has been previously zzso In order to understand the mechanisms by which the expression of the zzso gene is regulated by zzso at the zzso level, we have cloned and characterized the zzso region of the human zzso zzso To functionally analyze the upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso a series of zzso reporter gene zzso were prepared and used for zzso of cells from the zzso line zzso and zzso B cell zzso Under zzso conditions, functional activity of these zzso was detected in zzso cells, which show high zzso expression of the zzso zzso but not in zzso cells, which show low expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by stimulation of zzso cells with zzso revealed the presence of two functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that these two zzso elements specifically bind an zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex was zzso by zzso to zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso of zzso but not by zzso to zzso 2, zzso 3 and zzso indicating that zzso elements interact with zzso zzso Point zzso in the zzso elements prevented the formation of zzso complex and significantly reduced the responsiveness of the reporter gene to zzso These findings suggest that two functional zzso elements within the human zzso promoter play an important role in the induction of zzso gene by binding to zzso zzso zzso
