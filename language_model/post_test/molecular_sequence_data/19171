A novel avian zzso was detected in zzso skin zzso collected from a zzso zzso zzso zzso using a combination of multiply primed rolling circle amplification, zzso zzso and long range zzso The sequence of zzso zzso was determined by combining next generation sequencing and primer walking zzso The circular zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso and zzso six open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso and large zzso zzso analysis placed it amongst other members of the zzso zzso most closely related to Crow zzso Next generation sequencing enabled the detection of DNA fragments similar to, but distinct from, zzso virus within the same zzso from which zzso zzso was zzso thus confirming an zzso zzso in the zzso skin zzso of this zzso zzso
