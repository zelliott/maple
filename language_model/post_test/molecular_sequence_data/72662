The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is known to be an efficient electron donor to the zzso reaction center, has been determined using both zzso and zzso zzso The sequence contains 75 zzso with 11 positive charges, 10 negative charges, and one zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso determined by zzso zzso mass zzso is zzso zzso Multiple sequence zzso based both on primary and zzso structure information, reveals conservation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the four zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso is most similar zzso zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of the zzso
