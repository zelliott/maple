zzso zzso is the most common cause of the adult respiratory distress syndrome zzso zzso zzso when administered in zzso produces zzso changes similar to those seen in zzso The zzso of these changes is zzso in part by zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso high zzso levels of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso Increased zzso zzso levels correlate with increased zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso analyses of lung zzso from rats treated with zzso reveal abundant zzso expression in inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso We further examined the molecular regulation of zzso gene expression after exposure of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso in zzso These cells respond to zzso with increased zzso zzso expression and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene by zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso located approximately 4 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show increased zzso zzso zzso binding activity in zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site in this zzso zzso completely zzso zzso gene zzso while zzso of zzso protein zzso binding site exerts negligible effect, suggesting that the zzso family of zzso factors plays a critical role in regulating zzso gene zzso following zzso zzso Furthermore, upstream zzso events zzso this zzso expression of the zzso gene after zzso zzso
