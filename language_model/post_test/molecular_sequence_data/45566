One of the most important zzso changes occurring in zzso zzso zzso roots takes place when the plant plasma membrane zzso zzso around the zzso zzso structures resulting in the zzso membrane zzso To investigate whether AM zzso proteins accumulate at this stage, two complementary zzso approaches targeting the root PM from the model zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso extracts were first enriched in PM using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting PM zzso were further zzso with zzso an automated zzso zzso using a strong zzso exchange and zzso zzso and zzso zzso combined with a systematic zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso ones, were zzso identified in the PM fraction from zzso roots, representing the first survey of the zzso zzso root PM zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso roots revealed two proteins that differed in the zzso root PM zzso They corresponded to an zzso zzso and a predicted zzso blue zzso protein zzso both potentially located on the zzso zzso The exact role of zzso in AM zzso remains to be zzso
