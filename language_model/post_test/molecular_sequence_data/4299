zzso zzso is an zzso pathogen that has evolved to be a frequent cause of zzso infection in zzso zzso Although these zzso are readily zzso they are able to survive and even multiply within human zzso The process zzso zzso circumvent the zzso functions of the zzso is currently not well zzso but this is a key aspect in the zzso of all zzso zzso Previously, we identified a gene in zzso zzso designated zzso (for zzso zzso the expression of which is induced when the zzso grow in human zzso zzso Plum and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso gene has an open reading frame of 295 zzso acids with a strong bias for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene also codes for a putative signal zzso of 19 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is induced by acidity to be expressed as an zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein exhibits an zzso domain zzso However, beyond this motif which is common to zzso that activate a large variety of zzso no zzso to known sequences are zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso strains expressing the zzso protein have a limited advantage for survival in zzso These findings may be zzso with a role of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso
