The zzso and zzso disease resistance genes of zzso zzso zzso are oriented in tandem and are separated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso but lacks zzso zzso analysis of the zzso deletion region in zzso revealed the presence of an zzso zzso element, which we have designated zzso Southern zzso analysis of six zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso sequences in each, indicating that this element is ubiquitous in zzso and has been active in recent evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso adjacent to zzso was unique to the zzso zzso however, and was not present in two other zzso that lack zzso DNA sequence from the latter zzso lacked a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso occurred after the initial deletion of zzso The deletion zzso contained a zzso zzso that displayed hallmarks of a zzso DNA zzso zzso We conclude that loss of zzso was caused by a zzso break and subsequent repair, and cannot be attributed to unequal crossing over between resistance gene zzso
