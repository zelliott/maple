zzso have been reported to produce several zzso peptides in response to septic zzso However, in marked contrast to other insect groups, no zzso zzso molecules had been described so far in this insect zzso Surprisingly, also zzso zzso zzso which predominate in the zzso defense of other insects, had not been discovered in zzso Here we report the isolation from the zzso of immune induced larvae of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso with exclusive zzso zzso We have fully characterized this zzso zzso which has significant zzso with the insect zzso a large family of zzso peptides directed against zzso zzso Interestingly, the novel zzso shows also similarities with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso Thus, zzso appear to have built their zzso immune response against bacteria on zzso and zzso In addition, we report that zzso have zzso zzso properties to the well zzso structure of zzso insect zzso through zzso acid zzso
