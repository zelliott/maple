The requirement for zzso during long-lasting plasticity indicates that signals generated at the zzso must be transported to the zzso We have investigated whether the classical active nuclear import zzso mediates zzso retrograde signal transport in zzso sensory zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso including synaptic zzso where they are well positioned to mediate zzso to nucleus zzso In zzso stimuli known to produce long-lasting but not zzso zzso triggered zzso nuclear zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced zzso nuclear zzso We further showed that zzso stimuli recruited active nuclear import in zzso zzso Together with our finding that long-term zzso of zzso zzso zzso required active nuclear import, our results indicate that regulation of the active nuclear import zzso plays a critical role in transporting zzso generated signals into the nucleus during zzso forms of zzso
