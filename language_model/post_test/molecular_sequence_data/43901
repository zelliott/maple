To study zzso roles of plant small zzso binding zzso we isolated a zzso clone zzso zzso the zzso small zzso binding protein from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso by using human zzso zzso as a zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene shared all the zzso regions, important for zzso binding activities, with those of other small zzso binding zzso zzso is a zzso zzso long zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein which shows zzso similarity on the zzso acid sequence level to the zzso zzso and was used as a zzso Through Southern and Northern zzso zzso we found that zzso is a single copy gene and actively expressed at the stages of cell division and zzso We investigated zzso binding abilities by a filter zzso zzso zzso of a binding zzso zzso within an zzso protein showed a significant decrease of zzso binding zzso suggesting its important role in zzso zzso
