zzso infections are a growing threat to global zzso zzso zzso is a major human pathogen that is widespread in human zzso causing acute respiratory disease, and has been associated with chronic zzso zzso zzso was first identified solely in human zzso however, its host range now includes other zzso zzso zzso and zzso Australian zzso zzso zzso are widely infected with two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between animals and humans has not been zzso however, two other zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso cryptic zzso zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso shotgun zzso Comparative zzso analysis, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso distribution, and zzso analysis of zzso genes and zzso against the human zzso of zzso zzso show that the zzso isolate is zzso to human zzso Thus, we propose based on compelling zzso and zzso evidence that humans were originally infected zzso by an animal zzso of zzso zzso which adapted to humans primarily through the processes of gene zzso and zzso loss, to the point where the animal zzso is no longer required for zzso
