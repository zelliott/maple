Among the small nuclear zzso zzso involved in the zzso processing of zzso zzso is the most zzso As a first evidence for the presence of the zzso machinery in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso We find that in this zzso zzso is a single copy gene that is transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso of approximately 105 zzso We have mapped the zzso end of the zzso zzso transcript, and identified typical elements of a putative zzso III zzso This is the first zzso gene reported in zzso zzso analysis indicates that this gene contains all the zzso zzso known to be important for zzso zzso zzso These results, in conjunction with the earlier finding of genes that contain zzso zzso suggest that zzso has a functional zzso zzso
