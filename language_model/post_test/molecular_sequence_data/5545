One zzso zzso of all zzso studied so far is located downstream from a gene thought to code for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is important to cell wall zzso This zzso has been designated zzso for fast-growing zzso and zzso for slow zzso We have investigated the upstream sequences and promoter activities of zzso zzso of typical fast growers which also possess a second zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso of the fast growers zzso zzso and zzso zzso which each have a single zzso zzso per zzso These fast growers have a common strategy for increasing the efficiency of zzso of their zzso zzso thereby increasing the zzso potential for zzso zzso This strategy involves the use of multiple (three to five) promoters which may have arisen through successive zzso zzso Thus we have identified a zzso multiple promoter region zzso located between the zzso gene and the zzso zzso coding zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso appear to play pivotal roles in zzso zzso zzso they are present in all of the species examined and are the only promoters used for zzso synthesis by the zzso slow zzso zzso is located within the coding region of the zzso zzso and zzso has a characteristic sequence that is related to but distinct from that of the additional zzso In fast-growing species, zzso and zzso produce less than zzso of zzso zzso so the additional promoters found in the zzso are important in increasing the potential for zzso synthesis during rapid zzso In contrast, zzso zzso appear to be regulated by a single zzso because less divergence has taken place, zzso appears to be younger than zzso
