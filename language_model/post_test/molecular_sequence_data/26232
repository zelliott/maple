The success of solid phase zzso synthesis utilizing zzso zzso zzso acids is often limited by deleterious side reactions which occur during zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The majority of these side reactions modify susceptible zzso such as zzso zzso Met, and zzso with zzso zzso protecting groups and zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness of various zzso in suppressing these side zzso We found that the zzso mixture zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso efficient in zzso a great variety of side zzso zzso and zzso of 10 zzso each containing zzso zzso demonstrated the zzso of zzso chemistry with zzso K for efficient synthesis of complex zzso
