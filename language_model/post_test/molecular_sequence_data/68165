zzso zzso is a species of insect which only grows in zzso It is expected to construct a new expression system for genetic engineering by using zzso as a zzso We have established an zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso containing zzso Ph gene was zzso zzso analysis shows that the 735 zzso Ph structural gene has the zzso of zzso and zzso with those of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso box in the zzso zzso regulation region is very similar to those of various other zzso but the zzso downstream sequence has almost no zzso with those of zzso and zzso demonstrating the characteristic property of the structure of zzso Ph zzso Other structural features of the Ph gene promoter are also discussed in this zzso
