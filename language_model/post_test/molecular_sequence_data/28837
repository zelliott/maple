Natural killer zzso cell receptors for classical zzso class I molecules are zzso by the killer zzso zzso zzso zzso family in humans and other zzso Mouse zzso cells, however, employ a completely different zzso family, the zzso zzso zzso zzso to perform the same zzso This example of functional zzso evolution raises the question of what type of receptors are found in zzso and zzso zzso By screening a bovine zzso zzso library, we isolated an zzso gene from the cow zzso zzso and show by zzso Southern zzso that it is likely a single copy gene in this zzso The coding region is intact and has an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in the zzso domain, suggesting a role as an zzso zzso We have also identified several bovine zzso clones related to zzso and show that at least one has an intact open reading frame with two zzso Evidence for multiple zzso genes in the cow was obtained by Southern zzso and we found that at least two of these genes contain an ancient zzso present in all human zzso zzso These results suggest that the cow and zzso zzso families arose from a common ancestral gene but amplified zzso Furthermore, these findings indicate that the existence of multiple zzso genes may be a phenomenon unique to zzso
