zzso sheep zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso pulmonary zzso zzso a sheep lung cancer that resembles human lung zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso that shows lung zzso and zzso pulmonary zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that the lung zzso for zzso is mainly determined by the viral long terminal repeats zzso In a previous study, we showed that zzso and zzso were able to zzso the zzso zzso when zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains two putative zzso binding zzso to investigate the contribution of each zzso binding site to transcription, we generated reporter zzso with deletions or zzso zzso in one or both of the putative zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso from type II zzso zzso within the upstream site zzso zzso to minus zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction of the zzso activity, while zzso of the downstream site had little zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso was greatly reduced in zzso cells zzso with an zzso or zzso expression zzso when the downstream site was zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso revealed that nuclear extracts from zzso cells, but not zzso cells, were able to form a retarded complex with zzso encompassing either the upstream or the downstream zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is activated by the zzso zzso factor zzso and that the upstream zzso binding site is essential for expression in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso by zzso in zzso cells is zzso through the downstream zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso expression in a mouse lung Clara zzso line zzso did not appear to be strongly dependent on either zzso binding zzso These results support the notion that zzso lung zzso is determined by the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso which is governed by interactions with zzso zzso zzso
