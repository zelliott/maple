The sequences of zzso bundle proteins are characterized by a pattern of zzso and zzso zzso acids which is repeated every seven zzso At each position of the zzso repeat there are specific constraints on the zzso acid properties which result from the zzso of the zzso zzso These constraints give rise to patterns of zzso acid distribution which are distinct from those of other zzso The zzso in each of the zzso positions have been determined by a statistical analysis of structural and sequence data derived from seven families of aligned protein zzso The constitution of each position is dominated by a very small number of different zzso zzso with the core positions consisting overwhelmingly of zzso and zzso The zzso preferences of the individual zzso acids can be generally interpreted in terms of zzso properties and zzso zzso The potential for zzso bundle folding is reflected primarily in the pattern of zzso occurrence in the zzso and not in the overall zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso applications of this analysis in structure predictions, sequence alignments and in the rational design and engineering of zzso bundle proteins are zzso
