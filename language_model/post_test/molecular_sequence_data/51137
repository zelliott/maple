The structure of a zzso analog of the zzso region of cardiac zzso zzso zzso when bound to cardiac zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso The bound structure determined for this zzso is similar to that determined previously for the skeletal zzso (which has a zzso at position zzso bound to skeletal zzso zzso and zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This structure shows a zzso like zzso backbone zzso around zzso to bring the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso closer zzso The other zzso of this structure is surrounded by the basic zzso extending zzso towards the protein or zzso While the bound structures of the cardiac and skeletal peptides are shown to be quite similar, the cardiac zzso appears more flexible near the central zzso zzso
