zzso interference is a powerful tool for gene functional analysis in zzso Permanent gene suppression can be achieved by zzso as zzso precursors transcribed from zzso Pol III promoter such as zzso and zzso based on zzso This approach, however, has a major zzso zzso can not be controlled in a time or tissue specific manner because the zzso Pol III promoter is not time or tissue zzso To overcome these limitations, we designed a strategy that allows synthesis of small hairpin zzso in a zzso form zzso by zzso Pol II promoter zzso to efficiently and specifically knock down expression of both zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso As zzso by both zzso observing and quantitative zzso the protein and zzso products of zzso gene zzso were efficiently and specifically zzso quantitative zzso and western zzso results respectively demonstrated that zzso zzso B2 zzso and protein was suppressed without global zzso of protein zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso efficacy for zzso is dependent on target position based on this zzso zzso This method may provide a novel approach for the application of zzso technology in suppressing gene expression in zzso zzso
