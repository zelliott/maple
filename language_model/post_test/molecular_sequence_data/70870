The zzso zzso of all zzso is zzso in zzso as a zzso of zzso chains held together near their zzso For zzso the initial site of zzso has been shown to be a hairpin with a zzso loop containing a zzso sequence of six zzso This structure is proposed to promote zzso by zzso interaction and formation of a so-called zzso zzso A zzso zzso strand containing the loop enclosed by a seven zzso stem has been zzso This zzso was zzso by the zzso method at 310 K, pH zzso with zzso as the zzso agent in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were obtained at zzso A resolution with a conventional X-ray source and at zzso A resolution on a zzso zzso The space group is zzso or its zzso zzso with cell parameters a zzso b zzso zzso 1, c zzso zzso A at ambient temperature, or a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A in a zzso zzso There are two zzso per zzso unit as determined from zzso zzso of a dissolved crystal whose volume was carefully zzso In some cases, either perfectly or partially twinned zzso were zzso Perfect zzso is detected by an apparent zzso symmetry and yields zzso zzso data, whilst partial zzso yields usable data after adequate zzso zzso solution is under way by searching for zzso derivatives and systematically substituting zzso or zzso for zzso
