zzso zzso is a protein zzso identified as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and as an essential component of the zzso factor zzso that is involved in zzso initiation and DNA zzso We have identified in human cells a number of zzso cellular proteins that appear to fall into two classes based on their relative zzso zzso labeling zzso One class of proteins present in zzso zzso as a minor fraction contains components of the zzso zzso complex such as zzso and zzso whereas the other fraction contains four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso associated with zzso Whereas the levels of association of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso remain unchanged between zzso and zzso Ewing zzso zzso cells, the association of zzso with zzso was significantly decreased as cells reached zzso Through a large-scale zzso of zzso complexes and protein zzso we have isolated a zzso that encodes zzso and have shown that it is the human zzso of zzso that is involved in the assembly of zzso zzso contains a highly zzso zzso motif at its zzso zzso a characteristic feature shared among zzso finger zzso The human zzso gene expresses a single zzso transcript, the zzso level of which, like zzso and zzso zzso varies significantly in different cell lines and in different terminally differentiated zzso
