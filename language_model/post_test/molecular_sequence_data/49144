zzso disease type C2 zzso is a fatal zzso disease characterized by zzso of zzso zzso cholesterol in zzso Here we report the zzso resolution crystal structure of the zzso protein deficient in this disease, zzso and the characterization of its zzso binding zzso Human zzso binds the cholesterol analog zzso with zzso affinity at both zzso and neutral zzso zzso has an zzso fold stabilized by three zzso zzso The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region penetrating from the surface into the zzso core that forms adjacent small cavities with a total volume of approximately 160 zzso We propose that this region represents the zzso zzso site that zzso to accommodate an approximately zzso cholesterol zzso
