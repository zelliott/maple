During zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at least three separate precursor zzso zzso occur within the zzso zzso external transcribed zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso primary zzso The zzso zzso sequence contains three regions of very stable zzso zzso One zzso zzso to position zzso is in the zzso region between the zzso and the central zzso zzso a second zzso zzso to position zzso is in the zzso region between the central and the 3' zzso zzso and a third zzso is at the zzso zzso junction zzso to position zzso The three sites share a common consensus sequence around the position of zzso We have used an in zzso zzso processing zzso to define some of the sequence and structural recognition elements necessary for the two precursor zzso zzso to positions zzso and zzso Surprisingly, none of the three zzso zzso zzso are required for recognition or targeting of the zzso although their removal reduces the rate of zzso site zzso We show that the sequence zzso downward zzso zzso encompassing each site contains at least some of the essential features for recognition and efficient targeting of the zzso zzso depends on the presence of a zzso zzso and a zzso two zzso 3' to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to other bases at these critical positions are either not zzso or zzso very zzso Finally, on the basis of zzso that are produced during a processing reaction, we can conclude that the zzso at positions 98 and 31 are not ordered in zzso
