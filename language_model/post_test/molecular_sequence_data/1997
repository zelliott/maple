Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso which showed zzso zzso with serum from four out of 10 diffuse large zzso zzso zzso patients, is zzso by a novel zzso zzso domain containing 1 zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein product, while an alternatively spliced zzso zzso lacking zzso 14, encodes a zzso zzso zzso the first zzso zzso of which are common to both zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso domain that, together with a putative zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso suggests it encodes a zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso in seven zzso cell lines, while zzso zzso appears to be zzso expressed in cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of de zzso zzso patients' zzso with zzso to zzso zzso and zzso indicated that two patients mounting an immune response to zzso were of a poor prognosis zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was restricted to normal zzso while frequent expression was observed in solid zzso zzso out of zzso thus fulfilling the criteria for a novel cancer zzso zzso zzso has potential for zzso vaccine development that may also be widely zzso to other zzso zzso
