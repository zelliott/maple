Signal zzso initiated by a wide variety of zzso signals involves the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in activated receptors or zzso proteins then function as binding sites for the zzso zzso 2 zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein that contains both zzso and zzso zzso and becomes zzso on zzso in response to many different zzso zzso These results have suggested that zzso is a prominent zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus far, only a single zzso zzso site, the zzso at position 317 zzso has been zzso zzso of zzso has been implicated in zzso binding and zzso of the Ras zzso 

Here, we report the identification of two major and novel zzso zzso zzso sites, zzso and zzso These zzso are present in the central zzso zzso region and are zzso in all zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in response to zzso growth factor stimulation or in zzso cells in zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso make an important contribution to the association of zzso with zzso zzso studies suggest that these two zzso zzso may be involved in interactions with a number of cellular zzso 

zzso is the most prominent general zzso for zzso zzso in zzso The identification of two novel zzso zzso sites indicates that zzso has the potential to interact with multiple downstream zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso in evolution, suggesting that the zzso of these zzso is of fundamental zzso We propose that distinct zzso zzso zzso from different zzso complexes and thereby activate separate downstream zzso zzso
