A zzso zzso promoter zzso of the zzso gene that includes the carbon source dependent regulatory regions was investigated using zzso and 3' promoter zzso The results indicate that zzso and ethanol regulation of zzso zzso are independently controlled by distinct zzso zzso The consensus sequence zzso may play a role in this regulation, while the sequence zzso may be important in zzso zzso
