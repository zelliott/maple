The three-dimensional zzso structure of human zzso virus type 2 zzso zzso was predicted by zzso modeling based on the zzso structure of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso The three proteins similarly have three major zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso of zzso have a long zzso loop and clustered zzso in the second half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso uniquely contains a long region between the second and third major zzso and bears several zzso in the first half of the zzso zzso Instead of the zzso there is a group of zzso zzso acids and zzso in the corresponding regions of the two zzso To compare the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we examined the production of zzso as a marker of cell zzso We further analyzed the characteristics of cells zzso with zzso genes driven by an zzso zzso The results obtained clearly show that structurally similar, but zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso to target zzso
