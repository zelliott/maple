To investigate the role of zzso variation in primary zzso glaucoma zzso involving the zzso processing gene zzso repeat domain 36 zzso 

We examined the heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as a potential zzso gene in glaucoma patients found to harbor zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso gene was zzso and its zzso zzso acid zzso zzso as well as the single zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for functional defects in a zzso model system previously used to characterize zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso protein 21 zzso 

A zzso patient zzso for the zzso zzso zzso was discovered to also carry the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso located at an zzso site, was not found in a pool of zzso individuals lacking zzso variation which included 55 normal controls and 20 patients with normal tension glaucoma zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to rescue zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Double zzso zzso strains expressing human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not have significantly different levels of zzso zzso from the corresponding zzso zzso zzso However, specific double zzso zzso strains exhibited significantly slower culture growth at 37 zzso Double zzso zzso strains also displayed altered growth rates at 37 zzso 

zzso variation does not play a significant direct role in the zzso of zzso However, as previously found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso growth zzso in the context of specific zzso zzso zzso and heat zzso Based on the genetic association of two zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso patient and the functional analyses performed in a model system for basic zzso cellular zzso these experiments point to a zzso molecular zzso involving zzso and zzso
