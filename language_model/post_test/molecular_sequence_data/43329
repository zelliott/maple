We have used a zzso construct of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso transcript zzso gene to analyze its transcripts in transient zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the approximately zzso zzso gene encompassing the zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso downstream of the zzso zzso gene zzso Northern zzso of zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells identified three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these transcripts by Northern zzso indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso while the zzso zzso zzso both smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed that this zzso is the spliced zzso of the zzso primary zzso The zzso zzso appears to be an zzso accumulating after zzso of the minor zzso zzso zzso The zzso donor and zzso sites for the zzso zzso identified in zzso and zzso cells are zzso zzso of the branch point of this zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso cells, as well as in zzso infected zzso zzso zzso shows that it is a zzso This branch site does not bear zzso to consensus zzso branch site zzso These data provide evidence that the zzso zzso is an zzso of the zzso zzso with a unique branch zzso
