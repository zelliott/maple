The location of zzso zzso zzso within the secondary structure of rabbit zzso zzso zzso was determined by chemical zzso Naked zzso zzso was first prepared by zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso K in sodium zzso zzso thereby omitting the use of zzso acid zzso zzso within naked zzso zzso were chemically zzso by using either zzso zzso or zzso zzso which specifically react with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Gilbert, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 77, zzso zzso modification sites were identified by zzso sequencing gel zzso either upon zzso strand zzso of zzso intact and fragmented zzso or by primer extension using zzso DNA zzso with reverse zzso The data indicate good agreement between the general pattern of zzso zzso and the location of zzso regions in zzso zzso determined by comparative sequence analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso of zzso zzso toward zzso chemical zzso was, also, similar for both rabbit and zzso coli small zzso The number of strongly zzso zzso appearing within zzso determined zzso zzso however, was greater in rabbit zzso zzso than for zzso coli zzso zzso Some of these zzso were found clustered in specific zzso Such differences suggest a greater zzso of many of the zzso elements within zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso These zzso irregularities could be important for protein association and also may represent biologically relevant flexible regions of the zzso
