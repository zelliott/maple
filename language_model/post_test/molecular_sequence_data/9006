DNA zzso is a key regulatory control route in zzso involving gene zzso and zzso zzso It has been recognized that zzso binding domain zzso proteins play an important role in interpreting the genetic information zzso by zzso DNA zzso Although the function of zzso proteins has attracted considerable attention and is well zzso the mechanism underlying zzso recognition by zzso proteins is still poorly zzso In this article, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso are recognized at the zzso interface by two zzso zzso through an interplay of hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso Through molecular dynamics and zzso calculations we investigate the zzso recognition process and demonstrate that zzso enhances zzso binding by increasing the zzso zzso area and by strengthening the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations also show that zzso yields favorable contribution to the binding free energy for zzso zzso
