We describe here a systematic screen of an anterior zzso zzso zzso library to isolate novel genes which are expressed in the head organizer zzso After removing clones which zzso to labeled zzso zzso zzso with total zzso from a trunk region of zzso zzso the zzso ends of 1039 randomly picked zzso clones were zzso to make expressed sequence tags zzso which formed zzso tentative unique zzso Those clusters were compared against public databases and classified according to similarities found to other genes and gene zzso Of them, 151 clusters were identified as known zzso zzso including eight zzso ones zzso Gene expression pattern screening was performed for 198 unique zzso which were selected because they either have no known function or are predicted to be zzso regulators in other zzso The screen revealed nine possible zzso clones zzso four of which appeared to be expressed in the head organizer zzso zzso expression analysis from zzso to zzso stages showed that these four genes named zzso zzso zzso to human hypothetical zzso zzso (an zzso zzso and zzso zzso to human and zzso hypothetical zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso of the zzso corresponding to the head organizer zzso These results indicate that our screening strategy is effective in zzso novel zzso zzso
