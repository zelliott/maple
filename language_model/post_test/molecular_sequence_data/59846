zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso expression system showed correct zzso and zzso processing of zzso bovine zzso with regard to zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, several of these processes were severely affected by point zzso From the overall results of 16 zzso reported here, four groups were zzso One group significantly affected neither zzso nor folding of zzso zzso zzso zzso A second group produced a truncated protein zzso zzso suggesting that these positions are essential for a correct zzso zzso A third group affected membrane zzso as well as zzso which can be interpreted as interference with the function of a transfer zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to this zzso A fourth group induced structural changes in the protein that led to zzso distribution in the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso Taking any functional consequences of these zzso into consideration, it seems that point zzso can have mosaic effects and therefore should be examined at several levels zzso zzso functional zzso
