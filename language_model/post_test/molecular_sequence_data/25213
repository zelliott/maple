We have developed a general and rapid method for zzso zzso using primed amplification by the zzso chain zzso Starting from a zzso DNA template, this method requires only one single specific zzso primer and two universal sequencing zzso zzso the region to be zzso further upstream and zzso zzso To test the method, two different zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been constructed by this zzso Twelve zzso zzso clones all showed the expected zzso without any zzso zzso
