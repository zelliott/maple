The zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the zzso collagen chain, one of six zzso chains designated zzso that comprise type IV collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso proteins were used to map the location of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been previously localized to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso zzso were constructed by substituting one or more short sequences of zzso at the corresponding positions in the zzso zzso domain and expressed in zzso cells for proper zzso The interaction between the zzso and eight zzso zzso was assessed by both direct and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso C2 containing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso bound zzso as did combination zzso containing these zzso The zzso that encompasses these sequences is zzso showing strong zzso with all zzso zzso and accounting for zzso of the zzso zzso toward zzso The zzso nature of the zzso in the C2 and zzso zzso was established by reduction of the zzso bonds and by zzso analysis of overlapping zzso peptides derived from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences zzso and zzso in zzso have thus been shown to contain the critical zzso of one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso
