A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene from 21 zzso species of eight families was zzso by zzso with specially designed zzso These allowed amplification of zzso DNA without zzso synthesis of host zzso zzso trees were zzso from the sequence data using three methods zzso zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso At the major zzso all three trees were zzso For the first time the zzso zzso could be arranged into the zzso and a narrow relationship between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Members of the families zzso and a cluster of two families zzso and zzso form two zzso groups which derive prior to the remaining families of this zzso zzso A third and a fourth clear zzso group were formed by the zzso and by the zzso A high degree of variation within the examined zzso zzso was observed between two zzso of zzso zzso supporting often discussed genetic zzso within this zzso In contrast, only one zzso exchange was found in 23 zzso of zzso zzso of various geographic origin, indicating that this species is genetically zzso
