zzso with human zzso virus types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso In Africa, the potential exists for additional zzso transmissions from at least 33 different species of zzso zzso virus zzso nonhuman primates zzso through hunting and zzso of these animals for zzso Here we describe a highly sensitive and specific zzso zzso zzso with chemically zzso multiple zzso peptides zzso developed for the detection and discrimination of zzso to zzso genetic zzso The zzso zzso was developed by using a comprehensive array of zzso covering two envelope gene regions from all of the zzso lineages for which zzso sequences were zzso zzso sensitivity was evaluated by using 63 plasma or serum samples obtained from primates naturally or zzso infected with zzso from 10 genetic zzso zzso specificity was determined by using 97 known zzso plasma specimens from these same zzso Also used in the evaluations were zzso human zzso 198 zzso zzso 170 zzso and/or zzso zzso and 1 from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso with both zzso region zzso and zzso region zzso Although zzso zzso sequences from zzso monkeys were not available for specific zzso zzso 5 zzso of 5 zzso samples were detected through zzso with other zzso zzso zzso used in the zzso The one human zzso infection was zzso In conclusion, our zzso zzso zzso proved to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting zzso infections in zzso and zzso As shown with zzso zzso zzso this zzso has the potential to detect previously unidentified zzso strains and should be suitable for zzso surveillance for potential new zzso transmissions of zzso to zzso
