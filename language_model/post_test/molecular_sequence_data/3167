zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of zzso to ammonium and contains the zzso zzso zzso at its active zzso Certain zzso zzso zzso strains unable to zzso zzso accumulate an zzso form of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso composition zzso which can be activated in zzso by the addition of zzso The gamma protein is able to bind zzso or zzso zzso leading to the suggestion that it zzso zzso zzso into the zzso In this work, the zzso gene zzso the gamma zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and found to zzso a zzso zzso This finding, together with a wealth of knowledge on the zzso of proteins involved in zzso and zzso zzso allows us to define a new family of iron and zzso (or zzso zzso proteins that includes zzso zzso zzso and now zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments presented in this work demonstrate that gamma zzso zzso in the zzso required to be fully zzso by the zzso Supporting this conclusion, we show that strains containing zzso in both zzso and zzso are severely affected in zzso growth and zzso zzso activity when cultured under conditions that are likely to occur in natural zzso This finding reveals the zzso importance of the zzso role of which both proteins are zzso The relationship between the metal cluster binding capabilities of this new family of proteins and the ability of some of them to stabilize an zzso is still an open zzso
