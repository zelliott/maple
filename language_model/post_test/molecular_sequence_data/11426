The complete zzso acid sequence of a sodium channel from zzso zzso zzso has been deduced by cloning and sequence analysis of the complementary zzso A unique feature of the zzso sodium channel is the zzso zzso zzso approximately three-fourths of those of the rat sodium channels I, II and zzso On the basis of the zzso and in comparison with those of zzso sodium channels, we have proposed a zzso structure model of the sodium channel where the zzso segments are zzso aligned and the four zzso of zzso between segments zzso and zzso play a crucial role in the zzso gate, zzso sensor and zzso selective zzso which can slide, depending on membrane zzso along inner walls consisting of alternating segments zzso and zzso The proposed zzso structure model is contrasted with that of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure model can explain the gating of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso as well as the action mechanism of both zzso zzso and zzso toxin zzso and can be applied not only to the sodium channel, but also to the calcium channel, zzso channel and zzso zzso
