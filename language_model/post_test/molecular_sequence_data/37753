Identification of the mechanisms by which the zzso zzso zzso activates zzso is critical for understanding zzso and zzso zzso activates cells at least in part by zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso are zzso receptors expressed in mouse zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso 4) and knockout of the zzso gene inhibited mouse zzso zzso at low but not high zzso of zzso Thus zzso is important for zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso of human zzso in zzso expression systems reliably resulted in responsiveness to zzso zzso despite its importance for the zzso of mouse zzso by zzso mouse zzso zzso did not lead to zzso zzso even when zzso We now report that zzso and zzso interact in a novel way: zzso does not itself mediate zzso zzso but instead functions as a zzso for the zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso This establishes a paradigm for zzso zzso zzso and for a zzso zzso acting as an accessory zzso to present zzso to another zzso
