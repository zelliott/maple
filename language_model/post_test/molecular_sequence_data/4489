zzso channels are important for zzso transport and cell volume regulation in A6 zzso zzso In the present study, we used reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso to identify proteins zzso to zzso zzso channel proteins in A6 zzso Using zzso zzso designed on consensus sequences for members of the zzso family, we amplified an zzso product that had significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was then used to isolate several full-length clones that had total lengths from zzso to zzso base zzso Although the coding regions were zzso sequence differences occurred in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the clones had high zzso to rat and human zzso (85 and zzso respectively, if the 5th zzso of the open reading frame represents the start zzso Three parts of the protein zzso 80, and 63 zzso acids in zzso were zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protection zzso analysis revealed zzso for this protein in zzso zzso zzso liver, brain, and blood, with lower amounts in stomach, muscle, and zzso zzso of the clones in zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso zzso zzso current that was inhibited by zzso acid and possessed an zzso selectivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
