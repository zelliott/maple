zzso zzso is a major zzso of inflammatory responses in zzso disease that zzso bone formation and stimulates bone zzso To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the suppression of bone formation, we have analyzed the effects of zzso on zzso gene zzso Bone zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that appears to function in the initial zzso of zzso Treatment of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso (1 zzso for 12 h caused a marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso 30 zzso prior to stimulation with zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso of the rat zzso gene promoter linked to a zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso (1 zzso suppressed expression of zzso zzso encompassing zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso zzso into zzso zzso The effects of zzso were inhibited by protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso Introduction of 2 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso box zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso response element zzso zzso zzso to zzso a zzso response element zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso specific zzso factor binding element zzso zzso zzso to zzso showed that the zzso effects were zzso by the zzso and zzso Whereas the zzso and zzso zzso complexes were decreased by zzso zzso zzso complex did not change after zzso zzso These studies, therefore, show that zzso suppresses zzso gene zzso through zzso and zzso zzso pathways and that the zzso effects are zzso through zzso and zzso elements in the zzso zzso gene zzso
