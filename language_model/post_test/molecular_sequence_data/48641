zzso A and C, two major structural components of the nuclear zzso that determine nuclear shape and size, are zzso zzso of zzso zzso is cell zzso and is involved in regulating the zzso of zzso filaments during zzso We previously reported that zzso a zzso zzso raised against the zzso site of zzso zzso 2, recognizes a number of zzso including zzso A and C, in zzso zzso zzso 

Here, using zzso proteins and synthetic zzso containing potential zzso zzso zzso sites in conjunction with in zzso zzso zzso we determined the zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso We found that zzso of zzso is required for generating the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and showed that it could be created in zzso by zzso B zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso To further explore changes in zzso zzso zzso in living cells, we precisely zzso the zzso levels of zzso and other sites in zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells at zzso and zzso using the zzso method and liquid zzso mass zzso The results showed that the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso A and C, and zzso in zzso A only, increased zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso our results demonstrate that zzso is a useful tool for detecting zzso zzso zzso in cells and reveal quantitative changes in the zzso status of major zzso zzso zzso sites during zzso
