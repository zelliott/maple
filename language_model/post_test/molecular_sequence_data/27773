Three patients zzso for a partial deletion of the zzso gene were zzso an American Black with an approximately zzso zzso zzso a Turkish patient with an approximately 300 zzso zzso and a Greek patient with a newly discovered deletion of 44 zzso The DNA was amplified by the zzso chain reaction procedure and zzso only the DNA with the deletion was amplified for the patients with the approximately zzso zzso and approximately 300 zzso zzso zzso the interpretation of the sequencing zzso The amplified DNA fragments from these two zzso were also cloned into a zzso zzso and zzso The size of the deletion found in the Turkish patient is 290 zzso and includes zzso 124 or 125 zzso zzso to the Cap site, the zzso untranslated region, zzso 1, and 25, 24, or 23 zzso of the first zzso The total size of the deletion of the Black patient is zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso to the Cap site, zzso 1, zzso 1, zzso 2, and 413 zzso zzso of the second zzso The new deletion in the Greek zzso patient was detected by direct sequencing of amplified zzso the 44 zzso deletion begins within zzso 24 or between zzso 24 and 25, and includes the first 26 or 27 zzso of zzso zzso This deletion was confirmed by zzso of amplified DNA with a specific zzso probe and by sequence analysis of amplified DNA cloned in a zzso A 7 zzso zzso sequence zzso was found at both sides of the 290 zzso zzso while only 3 zzso were repeated at both sides of the 44 zzso deletion zzso No zzso was found between the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
