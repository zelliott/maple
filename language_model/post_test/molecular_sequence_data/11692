zzso resistant zzso tuberculosis strains are threatening zzso control in the zzso Rapid diagnosis of resistance is essential for adequate treatment and optimal control of the zzso 

zzso of a new technique zzso zzso zzso zzso for easy and rapid detection of zzso resistance zzso of zzso zzso 

After amplification of the region of the zzso zzso involved in zzso the amplified product is zzso with a set of 10 zzso immobilized onto a membrane zzso From the pattern obtained the presence or absence of zzso zzso tuberculosis can be zzso 67 clinical samples positive in culture for zzso tuberculosis were analyzed with zzso and results were compared with classical zzso zzso 

In zzso drug sensitivity testing identified 46 zzso sensitive and 21 resistant zzso In 65 of the 67 specimens zzso results matched classical zzso In two zzso cases zzso showed a sensitive zzso 

In contrast to culture and sensitivity testing, where results take on average 6 weeks, zzso testing is an easy and rapid zzso 48 zzso method of detecting zzso zzso tuberculosis in clinical zzso zzso correlated in zzso of the zzso In the two zzso samples with a sensitive zzso pattern another mechanism of resistance is zzso
