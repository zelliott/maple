zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso are targeted to the zzso membrane through their zzso zzso By analyzing more than 30 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for their properties of zzso interaction with zzso like protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso we found zzso organized zzso interactions governing the zzso targeting of zzso domain zzso zzso domain zzso is necessary for zzso interaction with zzso zzso however, these two interactions are not sufficient for zzso zzso as a third group of zzso including zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain, turn out to be zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis indicates that zzso domain interacts directly with membrane zzso partially through the third group of zzso such as zzso of zzso This third tier of interaction with the membrane could be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
