zzso C inhibitor zzso a plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso activated protein C, which plays an important role in the regulation of blood zzso We determined the organization of the gene coding for this zzso A human zzso zzso DNA library was screened using the zzso protein C inhibitor zzso as a probe and a zzso zzso clone that contained the full length of the inhibitor zzso including the zzso and zzso region, was zzso The gene was characterized by restriction zzso zzso Southern zzso and sequencing all the coding parts as well as the zzso and zzso zzso The protein C inhibitor gene spanned about 13 zzso pairs and consisted of 5 zzso and 4 zzso as do the genes for human alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso II and rat zzso All zzso boundaries agreed with the zzso zzso The zzso region contained no zzso or zzso zzso but contained the putative zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso region, which indicated promoter activity in human zzso cell line, zzso using the zzso gene as a reporter gene and the zzso site in the zzso zzso A zzso initiation site was identified by primer extension analysis using template human liver zzso The length of the zzso zzso I of this inhibitor gene was similar to those of the other zzso zzso zzso as described zzso These findings suggest that the protein C inhibitor gene evolved from a common zzso gene of these zzso zzso zzso
