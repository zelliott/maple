zzso 1 zzso is the zzso gene for an zzso dominant familial Alzheimer's disease zzso mapped to zzso zzso Here we show that zzso factor zzso a negative regulator of zzso is a candidate to mediate the function of zzso in the zzso We screened for proteins that bind to zzso from a human embryonic brain zzso library using the zzso method and isolated one clone zzso the zzso zzso The binding of zzso to full-length zzso was confirmed in zzso by pull-down zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso with human samples, including zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are zzso at the zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso in human brain zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso suppresses zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso consistent with the reported function of zzso By monitoring fluorescent zzso protein and by gel mobility shift zzso zzso was shown to accelerate the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso by zzso acid in zzso embryonic zzso cells, whereas this suppression of zzso is attenuated by zzso in zzso zzso the novel function of zzso via zzso influences zzso zzso and zzso
