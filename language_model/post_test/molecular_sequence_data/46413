The zzso factor zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso It belongs to the zzso zinc finger zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso was cloned and inserted into a zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso cells as a zzso fusion zzso After induction with zzso zzso the protein was zzso with a zzso column, and approximately 5-8 zzso of pure protein was obtained per liter of zzso The primary sequence and the predicted partial zzso structure of the potential zzso zzso zzso protein are similar to those of human zzso The DNA affinity zzso zzso and zzso promoter activity zzso further confirm the nature of the zzso zzso zzso protein as a zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso protein is structurally and functionally comparable to human zzso
