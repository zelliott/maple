zzso acid zzso zzso is rapidly zzso from the cell surface due to a zzso zzso signal in its 19 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a series of zzso zzso tail zzso and substitution zzso revealed that the zzso 12 zzso acids of the zzso tail are sufficient for rapid zzso and that the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso and substitution zzso of zzso acid zzso following zzso can prevent zzso even though these zzso do not belong to the zzso zzso It was shown recently that part of the zzso zzso tail zzso corresponding to zzso forms a zzso beta turn structure in zzso zzso zzso zzso of two modified zzso tail zzso in which the single zzso was zzso either by zzso or by zzso revealed that the tendency to form a beta turn is reduced by zzso in the zzso zzso and by approximately 50% in the zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest, that in the short zzso tail of zzso zzso is required for stabilization of the right turn and that the aromatic ring system of the zzso zzso is a contact point to the putative zzso zzso
