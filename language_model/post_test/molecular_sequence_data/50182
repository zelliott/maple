Three members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and are thus likely to have general roles in growth zzso We have previously shown that, after addition of zzso growth factor zzso to zzso cells, all three zzso become activated and associated with the zzso zzso We have now addressed the requirements for this zzso First, we have used a zzso expression system to show that zzso associates with the activated zzso zzso in zzso in the absence of other zzso demonstrating that the association between the two molecules is zzso Second, by generating cell lines expressing zzso molecules consisting of zzso sequences fused to a portion of zzso we found that the zzso domain of zzso is necessary for zzso association with the zzso zzso in zzso Third, those fusion proteins that associated with the zzso zzso also became zzso in zzso following zzso treatment, and in in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso half of zzso contains the sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also became zzso in the activated zzso zzso complex in zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than the novel zzso occurring by zzso
