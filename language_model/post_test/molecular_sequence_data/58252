The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor involved in the regulation of sodium zzso Two distinct zzso zzso of the human MR zzso differing in their untranslated zzso have recently been identified, suggesting the existence of alternative zzso To zzso the regulatory mechanisms controlling zzso gene zzso we have isolated and characterized approximately 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso Various deletion zzso of regions located immediately upstream of the untranslated zzso 1 alpha and 1 beta zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were inserted into a zzso reporter gene and used in transient zzso experiments in zzso and human differentiated zzso zzso zzso Both regions were shown to possess significant functional promoter activity, more pronounced in zzso cells, although zzso directed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso or human zzso zzso zzso revealed that, while both promoters were zzso zzso only the zzso zzso promoter was zzso by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are able to zzso activate the zzso promoter, consistent with zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso induction was localized to a region between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso This region does not contain any consensus hormone responsive element, and direct binding of zzso to this DNA sequence was not observed, indicating that zzso zzso enhancement is zzso by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso bind to zzso sequences on both zzso suggesting that they represent important regulators of zzso promoter zzso Our results indicate that zzso gene expression is under the control of complex regulatory mechanisms involving alternative promoters and differential hormonal control, which might allow zzso zzso of zzso zzso
