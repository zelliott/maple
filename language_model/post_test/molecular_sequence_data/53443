Two zzso zzso zzso against the zzso protein of the zzso strain of zzso E virus zzso were isolated by zzso display from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso bound to reduced, zzso open reading frame 2 zzso protein in a Western zzso suggesting that they recognize linear zzso The affinities zzso zzso constants, zzso for the zzso zzso protein were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The two zzso also reacted in an zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso protein from a zzso zzso the zzso zzso Each zzso blocked the subsequent binding of the other zzso to zzso zzso protein in indirect competition zzso suggesting that they recognize the same or overlapping zzso zzso zzso suggested that at least part of the linear zzso recognized by the two zzso is located between zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso were mixed with zzso zzso in zzso and then zzso into zzso monkeys zzso zzso to determine their zzso zzso Whereas all control animals developed zzso zzso liver zzso levels in zzso and zzso to zzso those receiving an zzso incubated with either zzso or zzso were not zzso zzso each zzso neutralized the zzso strain of zzso in zzso
