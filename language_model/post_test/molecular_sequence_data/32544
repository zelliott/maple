Growth factors, zzso diverse protein and zzso families, are involved in a multitude of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and wound zzso Here we show that peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso as well as various zzso are zzso demonstrating a previously unknown activity of growth zzso zzso The peptides killed the zzso bacteria zzso coli, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as the fungus zzso zzso Several peptides were also active against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso bacteria, paired with analysis of zzso effects on zzso showed that the peptides exerted zzso effects similar to those seen after treatment with the zzso human zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso per se, and its zzso zzso retained its activity in presence of zzso salt and zzso No discernible zzso was noted for the growth zzso zzso Besides providing novel templates for design of zzso zzso our findings demonstrate a previously undisclosed link between the family of growth factors and zzso zzso both of which are induced during tissue zzso and zzso
