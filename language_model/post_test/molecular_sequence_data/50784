The zzso to zzso of an active soluble 25 zzso zzso of zzso produced in insect cells using the zzso expression system, is zzso zzso mapping and analysis by zzso degradation and mass zzso permitted partial characterization of the zzso A total of 165 out of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso regions, were zzso The positions of the two zzso bonds in the zzso region were also zzso zzso 110 is joined to zzso zzso and zzso 42 to zzso zzso Natural zzso 25 zzso zzso was also zzso and found to possess the same zzso bond zzso These results extend the previously noted sequence similarity with zzso to elements of secondary zzso
