A zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso was cloned and zzso from sheep small zzso The zzso preparation containing a one major band zzso zzso and one minor band zzso zzso revealed high activities toward zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The preparation, however, had only little activity toward zzso and no activity toward zzso suggesting that the preparation contains zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the major band was determined to be zzso A full-length zzso zzso was obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction with the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso major one and rapid amplification of zzso ends from sheep small zzso The cloned zzso named zzso by zzso acid similarity has a zzso sequence identical to that of the zzso major zzso Another zzso zzso zzso named zzso was also cloned from sheep zzso zzso was expressed mainly in the liver, whereas zzso zzso was expressed almost only in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role as a general drug zzso zzso zzso in the liver and zzso plays important role in the zzso zzso in the sheep small zzso
