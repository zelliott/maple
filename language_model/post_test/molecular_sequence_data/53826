zzso zzso zzso zzso channels by zzso the zzso of zzso We studied the molecular zzso and physical location of the zzso receptors on the zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we made multiple zzso at three previously identified positions in the zzso zzso of zzso to examine whether these zzso interact intimately with the zzso We also examined a region encompassing zzso using zzso zzso to identify additional zzso of the toxin zzso Finally, guided by the structure of the zzso zzso channel, we explored whether the toxin interacts with the peripheral zzso surface of the pore domain in the zzso zzso zzso Our results argue for an intimate interaction between the toxin and the zzso zzso of zzso and suggest that the zzso receptors are confined within the zzso zzso of the channel, at least zzso A away from the central pore zzso
