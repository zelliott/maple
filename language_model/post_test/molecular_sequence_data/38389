The zzso and dynamics of zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso and the magnetic orientation in the zzso zzso systems were investigated by solid-state zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso it was found that zzso zzso form zzso oriented zzso zzso with the long axis parallel to the magnetic field above the liquid zzso phase transition temperature zzso zzso 24 degrees zzso The zzso orientation, and dynamics of zzso bound to the membrane were further determined by using this zzso oriented zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso bound to the membrane in the static, fast magic angle spinning zzso and slow zzso conditions were zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso chemical shift zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso backbone under the conditions where they form an zzso and zzso rapidly about the average zzso zzso Finally, it was found that zzso adopts a zzso zzso whose average axis is parallel to the zzso zzso The zzso angle between the zzso and zzso zzso rods of zzso in the zzso zzso is approximately 140 degrees or approximately 160 degrees, which is larger than the value of 120 degrees determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was clearly observed below the zzso in the initial stage of zzso by zzso This is considered to be caused by the association of zzso molecules in the zzso zzso
