zzso a probe zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso detects zzso fragments less than 28 zzso in both sporadic and familial cases of zzso muscular zzso zzso These fragments are smaller than those observed in healthy zzso The interpretation of Southern blots is complicated by the fact that zzso reveals two pairs of zzso zzso one zzso and the other zzso to zzso that sometimes overlap each zzso We cloned a zzso zzso zzso not related to the disease from a sporadic zzso patient of Italian zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso experiments showed that this zzso was located on the zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso when compared with the zzso fragment, indicates a similar arrangement of zzso zzso repeated units and zzso zzso However zzso and zzso zzso clones can be distinguished by restriction analysis with zzso and zzso This observation could be exploited for future applications in the field of molecular diagnosis and genetic zzso In addition the isolation of two zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso from a human zzso library and the construction of a detailed physical map, spanning about 40 zzso showed that the structural zzso extended upstream of the zzso sites, suggesting that a duplicated zzso locus resided in the zzso region of the long arm of zzso zzso We cannot exclude the involvement of the duplicated locus in the molecular mechanism of the disease and in the genetic zzso of zzso zzso
