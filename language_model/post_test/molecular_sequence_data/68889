The multiple zzso zzso zzso method was applied to improve the zzso of synthetic peptides representing distinct regions of the influenza virus zzso zzso A zzso zzso with multiply incorporated overlapping zzso and zzso zzso was combined with a particular zzso sequence representing the slightly modified fusion zzso on the zzso of the zzso core zzso As a result of repeated injections of zzso mice with zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso the appearance of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso virus could be zzso In zzso studies revealed the potency of the zzso structure to induce proliferation of zzso zzso and in zzso studies demonstrated the protective feature of the immune response zzso by zzso and to a lesser extent by the zzso zzso The increased level of zzso specific zzso upon viral challenge shows the zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso The advantage of the previously verified zzso helper zzso zzso included in zzso was further zzso to zzso zzso structures zzso short fragments of the zzso of zzso or delta zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The selected peptides of the zzso and zzso regions failed to elicit an zzso response in zzso mice as zzso or zzso but the inclusion of the modified fusion region resulted in an zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
