The zzso zzso receptors are orphan members of the nuclear zzso zzso that bind to their specific DNA target sites as zzso However, it has not been shown whether this mode of binding is required for the zzso zzso they zzso We here show that zzso can also occur between these zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the unique zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso is expressed as two zzso differing by an zzso zzso While the short zzso behaves like its zzso counterparts, the long zzso zzso displays divergent zzso properties according to the target site to which it zzso Indeed, zzso binds as a zzso but does not activate zzso through the zzso response element zzso On the contrary, this zzso binds as a zzso and activates zzso through the classical zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso is required for zzso exerted by the zzso zzso
