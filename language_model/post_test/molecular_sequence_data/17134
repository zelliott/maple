The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso structure has been studied using both theoretical and experimental zzso zzso models, such as the ones employed in zzso protein folding and design, can be used to study the relationship between zzso zzso and the properties of zzso Using a simulated evolution approach that combines zzso zzso with backbone flexibility, we zzso the relationship between basic forces that drive secondary structure formation and sequence zzso Additionally, we find zzso motifs including a zzso zzso capping interaction and stable zzso that result in bent zzso zzso Our studies show that simulated evolution of zzso with backbone flexibility can be a powerful tool in the design of novel zzso with tuned zzso zzso
