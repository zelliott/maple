Human and zzso immature zzso zzso are highly efficient in zzso capture and processing, while as mature cells they present zzso and are potent initiators of zzso immune zzso zzso zzso are logical targets for vaccine zzso Originally discovered for their zzso activity, and thought of as strictly part of the innate immune system, studies with zzso such as human zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso have shown that they can function as zzso for zzso and, in vaccination strategies, can enhance zzso zzso immune zzso Most studies to date have been conducted in zzso In contrast, little is known about zzso in zzso To expand our understanding of the role of zzso in modulating immune responses in zzso zzso were generated from bovine zzso and the immature state of these bovine zzso was characterized zzso and through functional zzso By day 3 zzso bovine zzso zzso stained positively for zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When compared to conventional zzso DC cultures or zzso cultured for 10 days with and without maturation factors, these zzso were functionally at their most immature zzso Fourteen of the 16 known bovine zzso were zzso and the synthetic peptides were screened for their ability to attract bovine zzso zzso zzso were consistently attracted to zzso an analog of zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso in zzso and to zzso in zzso These results are the first to describe zzso ability of synthetic bovine zzso for immature bovine zzso zzso
