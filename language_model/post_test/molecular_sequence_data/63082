White spot syndrome virus zzso continues to be the most zzso among the zzso shrimp zzso In this study, zzso DNA was detected in pond soil samples using a zzso zzso zzso zzso described previously were used for the first round of amplification and based on the zzso zzso an inner primer was designed for the 2nd round of zzso Using zzso DNA zzso zzso containing the 211 zzso target zzso zzso zzso sensitivity showed that the zzso zzso zzso protocol was able to detect down to zzso zzso of the zzso DNA, or approximately 2 copies of the target DNA zzso zzso of zzso DNA in pond soil samples after various time intervals was zzso zzso zzso product zzso zzso was still present in the soil samples even after 10 months of zzso The effect of soil heat treatment on the zzso DNA was also zzso zzso were subjected to 25, 37, 50 and 70 degrees C for 1, 3 and 5 zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso DNA was still present even after 5 days at 70 degrees zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of zzso DNA in soil zzso Based on these findings, it is concluded that the persistence of viral DNA in soil zzso may be an important aspect of zzso ecology and may have an implication for viral zzso
