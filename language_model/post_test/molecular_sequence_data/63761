zzso encodes a class II zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso a widely expressed 1960 zzso acid zzso with a translated molecular weight of 220 zzso The relatively large number of zzso zzso that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso that have been documented for its two zzso zzso and zzso strongly suggest existence of alternative zzso for zzso In the current study, we perform a targeted search for zzso zzso zzso in two separate regions of the heavy chain that zzso loop 1 and loop 2 zzso within which alternative zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso search was conducted using two zzso amplification across the suspected zzso directly or by amplification of putative zzso zzso identified through zzso sequence analysis of suspected zzso zzso Within loop 1, two separate insertions of 12 and 41 zzso were identified using zzso sequence analysis zzso Each of these zzso located within zzso 4, resulted in premature termination of the zzso zzso Within loop 2, a zzso zzso zzso was identified using both zzso The zzso is identical in length and displays zzso sequence identity with its zzso counterpart, but differs greatly from the zzso zzso within zzso transcript identified in this zzso Both loop 1 and loop 2 zzso of zzso were detected in the zzso with the latter being most abundant in the zzso zzso of loop 1 zzso with premature termination zzso may reflect an alternate mode of regulating zzso zzso while the zzso sequence and selective expression of the loop 2 zzso highlight its potential biological zzso
