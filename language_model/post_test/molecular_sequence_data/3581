zzso zzso is a human zzso zzso that binds to both zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso is distinct from other human zzso zzso in that it has long zzso acid zzso preceding the first zzso at the zzso zzso and contains two extra zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso were deleted zzso and the effects of each deletion were zzso In zzso cells, serial deletion up to 20 zzso acids zzso did not change the calcium zzso activity zzso zzso of 24 zzso acids zzso however, increased the zzso potency approximately zzso zzso of 27 or 28 zzso acids also increased the zzso potency to the same level shown by zzso zzso of 29 zzso zzso however, abolished the zzso activity almost completely showing that at least 3 zzso acid zzso preceding the first zzso at the zzso zzso are essential for the biological activity of zzso Loss of zzso activity was due to impaired binding to zzso In zzso cells, zzso was the only form of zzso zzso that revealed increased zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso modification is a potential mechanism for the regulation of biological activity of zzso
