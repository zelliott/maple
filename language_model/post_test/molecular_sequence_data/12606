We have analyzed differential gene expression in normal versus zzso avian zzso by using zzso zzso acid zzso and differential zzso acid zzso techniques for the isolation of zzso zzso One clone corresponded to a gene that was strongly expressed in a previously established quail zzso zzso zzso zzso line zzso transformed by a zzso zzso zzso but whose expression was zzso in normal quail zzso zzso Furthermore, the gene was expressed in quail or chicken zzso cultures that were freshly transformed by zzso zzso carrying various viral or cellular zzso zzso and in chicken zzso transformed by the avian zzso zzso carrying the original viral zzso zzso However, its expression was zzso in a variety of established avian cell lines or freshly prepared avian zzso cultures transformed by other zzso or a chemical zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso clone were not identical to any sequence entries in the data bases but revealed significant similarities to avian zzso zzso the highest degree of zzso acid sequence identity was zzso The zzso which we termed zzso may represent a direct or indirect target for zzso zzso
