The HAD zzso zzso zzso includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and sugar zzso acting on a remarkably diverse set of zzso The availability of numerous crystal structures of representatives belonging to diverse branches of the HAD zzso provides us with a unique opportunity to reconstruct their evolutionary history and uncover the principal zzso that led to their diversification of structure and zzso To this end we present a comprehensive analysis of the HAD zzso that identifies their unique structural features and provides a detailed zzso of the entire zzso We show that at the highest level the HAD zzso is unified with several other zzso namely the zzso receiver zzso von zzso A, zzso classical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which contain a specific form of the zzso zzso These zzso folds are distinguished from others by the presence of zzso placed zzso zzso zzso including one at the end of the first core zzso of the central zzso The HAD domain is distinguished from these related zzso folds by two key structural signatures, a zzso (a single zzso zzso and a zzso (a beta hairpin zzso located immediately downstream of the first zzso of their core zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso motifs are predicted to provide the necessary mobility to these zzso for them to alternate between the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, most members of the HAD zzso contains zzso termed zzso occurring at either of two positions in the core zzso zzso We show that the cap zzso have been independently inserted into these two zzso positions on multiple occasions in evolution and display extensive evolutionary diversification independent of the core zzso zzso The first group of zzso the C1 zzso is directly inserted into the zzso motif and regulates access of zzso to the active zzso The second group, the C2 zzso forms a roof over the active site, and access to their internal cavities might be in part regulated by the movement of the zzso The diversification of the cap module was a major factor in the exploration of a vast zzso space in the course of the evolution of this zzso We show that the HAD zzso contains 33 major families distributed across the three zzso of zzso Analysis of the zzso patterns suggests that at least five distinct HAD proteins are traceable to the last universal common zzso zzso of all extant zzso While these prototypes zzso prior to the emergence of the zzso the major diversification in terms of both zzso specificity and reaction types occurred after the radiation of the three zzso of life, primarily in zzso Most major diversification events appear to correlate with the acquisition of new zzso capabilities, especially related to the zzso of zzso metabolism in the zzso The newly identified relationships and functional predictions provided here are likely to aid the future exploration of the numerous poorly understood members of this large zzso of zzso
