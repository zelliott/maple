The purple zzso zzso zzso zzso has within its zzso a cluster of zzso genes approximately 41 zzso in zzso In an attempt to identify genes involved in the terminal zzso stage of zzso zzso a previously zzso zzso region of this cluster was zzso Four open reading frames zzso were identified, and each was analyzed by zzso zzso The product of one of these zzso zzso shows close zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in this gene were found to accumulate zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso precursor zzso suggesting that zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso with an alcohol zzso This assignment of function to zzso was verified by the performance of zzso demonstrating the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, to zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso thereby generating zzso This step is pivotal to the assembly of a functional zzso in zzso zzso a model zzso for the study of zzso relationships in zzso A second zzso zzso is a member of a large family of zzso zzso zzso while sequence zzso suggest that a third zzso zzso may zzso an assembly factor for zzso zzso The function of the remaining ORF, zzso is the subject of a separate paper zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hunter, zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso arrangement of the genes is zzso
