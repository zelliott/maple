The zzso cell wall presents significant challenges to zzso that zzso zzso zzso of its unusual structure containing a zzso zzso zzso outer membrane attached to an zzso layer that is in turn linked to the zzso Although little is known about how zzso circumvent these barriers during the process of infection, destroying it for zzso at the end of their zzso cycles requires an unusual set of zzso These include zzso B proteins that cleave the linkage of zzso acids to the zzso layer, zzso required for zzso delivery to zzso zzso that regulate zzso timing, and the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso Because zzso zzso contains zzso features including zzso zzso zzso it is not surprising that the zzso zzso also have zzso zzso We present here a zzso dissection of these zzso and show that they are highly diverse and extensively zzso with an impressive number of domain zzso Most contain three zzso with a novel zzso predicted zzso a centrally located zzso zzso or zzso and a zzso putative cell wall binding zzso
