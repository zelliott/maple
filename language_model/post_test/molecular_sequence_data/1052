In plants, zzso are generated zzso from highly organized structures known as zzso Cell division in the zzso is closely integrated with cell fate zzso and organ zzso The presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso and their partner zzso in plants and other zzso organisms probably reflects the complexity of cell cycle regulation within zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes at least eight zzso and 30 zzso However, no zzso in any zzso have been reported, and the function of the great majority of these genes in plant development is zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso a zzso of zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso and zzso identities and for the proper termination of stem cells in the floral zzso zzso zzso plays a role in cell differentiation in a zzso zzso
