zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso genes are normally terminated within a few zzso of the zzso coding region, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso which are contained within zzso transcripts and thus require zzso by zzso zzso We show that zzso activities capable of removing artificially extended zzso sequences from some zzso zzso are also present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso resulted in the formation of functional zzso zzso The zzso activities were also identified in zzso through analysis of zzso products in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of several zzso zzso showed that the zzso structure played a major role in determining the zzso of a zzso but that the nature of the zzso sequence also modulated the rate of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso sequence was a good zzso for in zzso processing, independent of its zzso A zzso zzso zzso the nuclear zzso zzso gene and a zzso zzso was processed in zzso zzso extract in a zzso zzso into zzso zzso Part of the zzso was due to an zzso which zzso near or precisely at the zzso of the coding region of the zzso A short sequence around this zzso zzso site was crucial for the formation of active zzso zzso in zzso A zzso sequence motif derived from the zzso zzso allowed processing, while sequences derived from zzso or zzso DNA were processed neither in zzso nor in zzso
