Type IV zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso agent of zzso facilitate colonization of the human zzso zzso are assumed to play a key role in the initial adherence to human zzso cells by virtue of the associated zzso protein zzso To examine the structural and functional basis for adherence in more detail, we identified potential genes zzso zzso sharing structural similarities to zzso (the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso We show here that a fiber zzso zzso termed zzso is essential to zzso adherence but zzso for zzso zzso and other zzso zzso including zzso competence for natural zzso and twitching zzso The adherence zzso in zzso zzso cannot be attributed to reduced levels of zzso defects in fiber zzso to the bacterial cell surface, or to unstable zzso expression related to zzso zzso zzso is expressed at low levels relative to zzso and zzso with zzso fibers in a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso contain zzso zzso at reduced zzso Taken together, these data support a model in which zzso functions in adherence by promoting the functional display of zzso in the context of the zzso zzso
