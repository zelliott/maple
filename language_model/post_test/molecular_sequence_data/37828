The zzso gene has been identified in the zzso producer zzso zzso and it codes a zzso zzso that is able to transfer a zzso zzso from zzso zzso to many zzso The zzso coded by the zzso gene has been zzso zzso from a zzso zzso clone expressing this zzso The reaction product was isolated, and its structure determined by zzso zzso The kinetic mechanism of the reaction was analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso The reaction operates via a compulsory order zzso This has been shown by zzso kinetic studies and by zzso exchange reactions at zzso zzso binds first to the zzso followed by zzso A zzso complex is thus formed prior to transfer of zzso zzso is then released, followed by the zzso zzso zzso A pH study of the reaction was performed to determine values for the molecular zzso values, suggesting possible zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso zzso
