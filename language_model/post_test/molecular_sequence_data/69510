We have shown by activity gel that zzso in zzso coli of a zzso zzso 3 open reading frame zzso designated zzso and bearing zzso to zzso DNA zzso beta results in a new DNA zzso in the host zzso The molecular mass of this zzso corresponded to the zzso 67 zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequencing confirmed that the expressed protein was zzso by the zzso zzso This new zzso DNA zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso In a fashion similar to that of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso DNA synthesis on DNA zzso with a zzso template and zzso zzso synthesis on a zzso DNA zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso and resistant to both 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso coli DNA zzso zzso These results, therefore, indicate that zzso encodes a DNA zzso zzso in zzso and we name it DNA zzso zzso zzso strains harboring a deletion zzso of the pol IV gene are viable, they exhibit no increase in sensitivity to ultraviolet light, zzso radiation or zzso agents, and zzso and spore viability are not affected in the zzso
