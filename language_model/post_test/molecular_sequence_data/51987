We have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso protocol for typing both sequence and length variations in an zzso element located in zzso 20 of the human zzso B zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso we simultaneously amplified and zzso labeled the zzso B zzso 20 zzso The zzso tail, which is composed of two zzso of variable numbers of tandem repeats, zzso zzso zzso A or zzso and zzso was separated from the rest of the zzso product by restriction zzso zzso with zzso zzso variation in the zzso tail zzso was thus separated from sequence variation in the zzso body zzso rendering the zzso patterns both zzso to interpret and more zzso In a sample of 242 unrelated individuals from Nancy, France, we observed 11 zzso zzso at the zzso locus that differed only in zzso At the zzso zzso we observed 7 zzso that differed in both sequence and zzso All zzso at both zzso were zzso and zzso One additional zzso that did not undergo a zzso mobility shift in zzso gels was uncovered at each locus during sequencing of the zzso zzso The additional zzso zzso was typed by restriction zzso zzso Although the number of zzso and zzso zzso was large, most were zzso the three most common zzso at each locus represented more than zzso of those zzso We also typed the children of the 242 unrelated French individuals, enabling zzso of the zzso segregation of the two zzso and construction of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
