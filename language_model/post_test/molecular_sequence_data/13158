In the isolated rabbit zzso electrical field stimulation zzso induced contraction that was inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relatively selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso contraction by zzso to zzso with similar zzso zzso zzso These zzso also showed direct zzso effect in the zzso However, the threshold concentration of zzso (3 zzso to augment the electrical field zzso contraction was 100,000 times lower than that needed to directly stimulate smooth zzso In contrast, these zzso did not augment the contraction induced by stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso An ETA zzso zzso zzso was almost ineffective in zzso the effects of zzso zzso and zzso although if zzso antagonized the effects of zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonized the effects of zzso and zzso zzso without changing the effect of zzso and antagonized the effects of only lower zzso of zzso In the trachea in which the zzso zzso was zzso by strong zzso zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective and zzso showed only small effect at higher zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso inhibited the effects of only lower zzso of zzso The effect of zzso in the zzso trachea was zzso but not fully, antagonized by zzso A potent zzso zzso zzso showed similar effects to the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances nervous zzso release by simultaneously zzso the zzso ETA zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is sensitive to both zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso that is sensitive only to zzso
