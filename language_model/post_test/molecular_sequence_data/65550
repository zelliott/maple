zzso zzso regulates how a zzso zzso receives information from zzso zzso The specific patterning of zzso branches is promoted by zzso and intrinsic factors that trigger the zzso of functional signaling zzso However, most of the regulating factors and the zzso mechanisms involved in regulating zzso branching are zzso Our laboratory previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an active role in regulating zzso branching in zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso number are dependent on zzso zzso zzso In order to identify the specific structural role of zzso in zzso zzso branching and zzso zzso activity, we employed zzso zzso modeling techniques to construct a three zzso structural model of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso scaffold of this model identified several zzso and zzso acid zzso responsible for zinc zzso Single substitution zzso in these specific sites completely disrupted the zzso zzso zzso activity and rendered zzso unable to promote zzso branching in rat zzso zzso The specific zinc zzso function of each zzso in the protein scaffold was also confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of our structural model confirmed that zzso and zzso coordinate with the zinc zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso that until now were unknown to play a role in this zzso Furthermore, promotion of zzso branching by zzso is zzso
