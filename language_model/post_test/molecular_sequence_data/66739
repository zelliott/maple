Two zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso via successive hot extraction with water, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and then submitted to zzso The zzso formed by repeated zzso from the zzso zzso zzso extraction zzso was analyzed by determination of its zzso zzso as well as by zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and controlled Smith zzso It was established to be a zzso zzso with a main chain of zzso zzso zzso at zzso by zzso zzso side zzso The zzso formed by repeated zzso from the zzso zzso extraction zzso contained zzso Man, and zzso and was zzso by zzso and extraction with zzso gave a soluble zzso zzso It was homogeneous with a zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the above chemical zzso it was a zzso with Man and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Its main chain consisted of zzso zzso units, mainly zzso at zzso by zzso units or with some zzso zzso
