Three genes zzso to plant zzso genes were identified from the zzso libraries of zzso zzso in order to clarify the function of zzso in zzso zzso genes were isolated using zzso and zzso methods and named zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were prepared from zzso coli cells expressing the corresponding zzso zzso analyses and zzso column zzso of their reaction products showed that zzso codes for zzso against zzso acid and for zzso against zzso acid, and that zzso and zzso code for zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso genes separated from the zzso of higher plants in the early stages of plant zzso zzso analyses suggested that zzso acid and zzso acid were preferred zzso Furthermore, each zzso zzso exhibited highest activity at pH zzso and dependency on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
