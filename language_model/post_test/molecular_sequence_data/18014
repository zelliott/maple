The zzso activity in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso beta can be retained by its zzso zzso in position zzso A series of shorter and longer peptides around this position has been zzso for zzso biological activity, in order to identify the structural requirements for full expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the loop region zzso and up to six zzso acids in the preceding beta strand or up to seven zzso acids in the following beta zzso showed activity comparable or lower than that of the zzso zzso This would indicate that the beta strand sequences are not required for zzso the active zzso of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso did not increase its biological zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso corresponding the exposed loop zzso between two beta zzso had biological activity higher than that of the zzso zzso and fully comparable to that of the entire zzso beta zzso Thus, the highly exposed zzso zzso within the zzso beta zzso may be the structure selectively responsible for the zzso beta zzso capacity in zzso
