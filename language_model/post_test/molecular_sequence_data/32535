zzso zzso from the zzso family of zzso zzso represent an interesting example of the delicate balance between zzso and specificity characteristic of zzso zzso recognition by zzso zzso The development of zzso of therapeutic potential requires a good understanding of the molecular zzso of binding affinity and specificity and relies on the availability of high quality structural zzso Here, we present the first high-resolution crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso from the zzso family revealed significant zzso in the loop zzso In particular, the zzso loop, highly flexible and partially zzso is stabilized in an unusual zzso by the establishment of several zzso hydrogen zzso Additionally, we present here the first report of zzso zzso by an zzso domain from the zzso zzso
