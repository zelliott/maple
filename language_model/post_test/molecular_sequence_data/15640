We have cloned and zzso characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the dog, zzso and zzso The full coding regions of the dog and mouse zzso were obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction, and the rabbit zzso zzso was obtained by screening a rabbit brain zzso zzso It is noteworthy that an additional clone was isolated by library screening that was identical in sequence to the full-length rabbit zzso with the exception of a zzso pair deletion in the region zzso zzso acids 103 to 111 zzso This 9 zzso acid deletion is located in the second zzso loop at the only known zzso junction of the zzso and seems to result from the use of an additional zzso donor site found in the rabbit and dog but not in the human, zzso or mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound with high affinity to zzso prepared from human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and dog zzso Competition binding studies performed with a panel of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified similar potency orders for the zzso zzso although most zzso zzso displayed lower binding affinity for the dog zzso compared with zzso from rabbit and zzso No specific binding could be detected with zzso prepared from zzso zzso cells expressing the rabbit zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso or calcium zzso We conclude that significant differences in zzso pharmacology of the zzso exist between species and that some species express zzso zzso of the zzso due to zzso zzso
