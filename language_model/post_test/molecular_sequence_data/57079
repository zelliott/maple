zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso growth factor zzso family member that acts specifically on cells of zzso zzso Its zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which also binds zzso zzso zzso with equally high zzso and basic zzso zzso with much lower zzso The zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso whose alternative transcript specifies a zzso with high affinity for zzso and zzso but no zzso binding of zzso The only structural difference between these two receptors is a zzso acid segment in the zzso domain that is determined by single alternative zzso We report that a synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to part of the predicted sequence of the zzso alternative zzso blocks zzso zzso activity and the interaction between zzso and its zzso The zzso also blocks the interaction between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso raised against this growth zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso binds directly and specifically to zzso and argue that this region of the zzso constitutes part or all of the zzso binding zzso
