zzso interactions are often important zzso for molecular recognition in chemistry and zzso In order to determine whether the zzso backbone could be important for the zzso preference of zzso channels, we made use of the linear zzso zzso zzso A zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as their zzso zzso A- zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All four zzso form conducting channels in zzso zzso formed from the zzso zzso or zzso zzso or from the zzso zzso The characteristics of channels formed by the two zzso A zzso or the two zzso M zzso in zzso formed by either of the zzso zzso are zzso Similarly, channels formed by either pair of zzso zzso in zzso zzso are zzso We conclude that zzso interactions between zzso channels and the lipids in the host zzso cannot be important zzso of zzso channel structure or zzso The zzso zzso therefore, seems to organize the channel structure because of the general characteristics of the zzso transition at the interface rather than because of specific chemical zzso
