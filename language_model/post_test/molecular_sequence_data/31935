zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso for translation, also regulates vascular zzso This zzso has been linked to the zzso domain added to zzso zzso during zzso However, the significance of two insertions also specific to higher zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we determined the crystal structure of human zzso in complex with zzso an zzso reaction intermediate zzso at zzso zzso Despite a zzso distance, binding of zzso in the zzso domain dramatically zzso the position of zzso I in the zzso binding zzso zzso this leverage is specific to higher zzso and not seen in zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso of zzso I does not affect zzso binding but instead reduce the zzso efficiency of the zzso Thus, a long-range zzso and functional communication specific to higher zzso is found in human zzso possibly to coordinate translation with zzso
