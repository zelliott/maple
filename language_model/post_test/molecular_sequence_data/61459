zzso worldwide resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso to traditional chemotherapy strategies such as zzso and zzso demonstrates the urgent need for the discovery of novel zzso agents in the fight against zzso The recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso invites the possibility of selectively targeting the life cycle of zzso zzso in order to prevent cerebral zzso zzso bears a high degree of sequence identity zzso to a structurally zzso family of zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso are the key regulatory elements governing the ordered progression of the zzso cell zzso With numerous X-ray crystal structures of zzso to provide a structural template, here we present a three-dimensional structural model of zzso constructed using computer-based zzso modeling zzso Our model was used to compare the zzso binding site of zzso with that of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso interactions of zzso with known zzso were investigated and compared to available crystal structures of zzso with zzso zzso The focus of the study is to identify similarities and differences between the zzso binding sites of the two zzso that can be exploited for future rational drug zzso
