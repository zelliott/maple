zzso (ABC) zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso and human zzso cells by zzso the zzso of structurally unrelated zzso drugs from the zzso The molecular basis by which ABC zzso zzso bind and transport drugs is far from zzso zzso analyses during the past 14 years reveal that the replacement of many individual zzso acids in zzso zzso resistance zzso can affect cellular resistance to drugs, but these studies have failed to identify specific regions in the primary zzso acid sequence that are part of a defined zzso zzso The recent publication of an X-ray zzso structure of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso model of human zzso creates an opportunity to compare the original zzso data with the three-dimensional structures of zzso Our comparisons reveal that zzso that alter specificity are present in three-dimensional zzso regions in the membrane zzso of zzso
