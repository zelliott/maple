We have characterized the properties of zzso zzso complexes arrested at a specifically located zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and an in zzso zzso system with zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and initiation zzso To help understand how zzso II zzso between a natural impediment and a zzso in the DNA to initiate a repair event, we have compared the zzso of zzso II complexes arrested at a zzso with complexes arrested at a naturally occurring zzso zzso The footprint of zzso II arrested at a zzso using zzso III and T4 DNA zzso zzso zzso covers approximately 35 base pairs and is zzso located around the zzso A similar footprint is observed when zzso II is arrested at the human zzso zzso arrest zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso to zzso II arrested at a zzso produced shortened transcripts of discrete lengths up to 25 zzso shorter than those seen without zzso After addition of zzso and exposure to visible light, some of the transcripts could be zzso beyond the zzso suggesting that zzso transcript zzso accompanied significant zzso II backup, thereby providing access of the repair zzso to the arresting zzso
