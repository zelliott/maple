Human zzso zzso acid zzso 2 zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the coding region predicts a zzso protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso As zzso of the zzso are identical with those of the mouse zzso zzso acid zzso 2 zzso zzso seems to be a human counterpart of zzso We found no zzso as was present in zzso In Northern zzso analysis, a single zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript was present in various human zzso The highest level of expression was observed in skeletal muscle and the lowest level in the zzso zzso plots indicated that the translated protein is predicted to have 14 zzso zzso with three potential zzso zzso Two patients with zzso protein intolerance zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso but no zzso was zzso The zzso gene was assigned to human zzso zzso
