zzso zzso of zzso zzso is assumed to be among the most zzso features that distinguish the zzso line of descent from other living zzso In order to assess the zzso of this zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso were characterized from four zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso taking advantage of the conditional viability of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Altogether, eight sequences of zzso zzso have been obtained from all the zzso sources which were investigated, either through systematic zzso sequence analysis or through genetic zzso yielding a highly zzso zzso A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found downstream of the zzso gene except in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results argue strongly for the ancestral character of zzso zzso in zzso Most of the wide zzso of zzso acid usage observed in zzso and zzso proteins among species is best accounted for by the zzso composition of zzso Furthermore, the species of origin of each protein appears to be more recognizable than its function, considering only its zzso acid zzso
