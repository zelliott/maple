The zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate with the zzso family of nuclear hormone zzso zzso This association enhances zzso zzso by nuclear zzso We describe a method for identifying zzso zzso zzso using arrayed zzso protein zzso to perform zzso supported zzso reactions in the presence of the zzso donor zzso Using this screen, we identified distinct zzso for zzso and zzso All zzso zzso harbor the expected zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso sequence comparisons of the zzso zzso revealed no such zzso The zzso zzso zzso identified in this screen was zzso We mapped the zzso region of this zzso binding zzso in zzso and demonstrate that zzso is indeed zzso in zzso Prior to these findings, the only known zzso for zzso was zzso zzso We broaden the number of zzso targets and suggest a role for zzso in regulating zzso
