The detection of remote zzso pairs of proteins using zzso methods is a pivotal problem in structural zzso aiming to zzso protein folds on the basis of information in the database of known zzso In the last 25 years, several methods have been developed to tackle this problem, based on different approaches including zzso alignments and/or structure zzso In this article, we will briefly discuss When, Why, Where and How zzso to perform remote zzso search, reviewing some of the most widely adopted zzso zzso The specific aim is highlighting the basic criteria implemented by different research groups and commenting on the status of the art as well as on zzso zzso
