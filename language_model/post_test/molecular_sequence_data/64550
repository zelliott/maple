We describe an optical method for zzso surface tension in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in vertical beam systems as in zzso plate zzso are complicated by the interaction of the light with the curved surface of the zzso If the samples do not all have the same zzso errors in the data zzso to the degree of zzso are produced, which may confound interpretation of the zzso We have harnessed this effect by zzso a zzso plate zzso and show that the apparent optical density zzso correlate very closely with surface zzso The method is much quicker than conventional methods for measuring multiple samples and requires considerably less technical zzso We demonstrate the zzso of the method to the study of zzso by investigating the zzso properties of two peptides zzso and zzso that form zzso zzso in zzso in one case replicating previously published results, and in the other case highlighting the zzso and possibly generic nature, of the zzso properties of these zzso zzso
