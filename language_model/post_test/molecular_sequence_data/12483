Members of the zzso zzso of zzso have been implicated as important components in zzso trafficking in the zzso Individual zzso proteins have a remarkable degree of specific zzso zzso As a first approach to the study of these proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken a survey of the zzso zzso using a strategy based on zzso zzso chain reaction utilizing the zzso and the highly zzso zzso box which comprises part of the zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso partial zzso were obtained from zzso stage zzso and seven of these clones zzso zzso 1, zzso 9) were clearly members of the zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso indicates that zzso 3, 4, and 7 are zzso expressed at low levels in both zzso of zzso zzso By Southern analysis of zzso zzso DNA and specific zzso from an isolated zzso zzso we show that two of the zzso zzso and zzso are adjacent or at least closely linked in the zzso zzso zzso while the other five are zzso These data provide important molecular zzso for zzso the unusual zzso zzso in this zzso
