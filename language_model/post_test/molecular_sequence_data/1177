An zzso zzso was isolated from the cabbage zzso zzso zzso antennae by zzso zzso The full-length zzso designated as zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a predicted protein of 546 zzso zzso This predicted protein presents the structural characteristics of known insect zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of the gene was studied by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso gene from zzso zzso was also cloned to obtain a zzso tool for the comparative gene expression zzso zzso transcripts are specifically expressed in the antennae of males and females and in the zzso of zzso In antennae of both zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role in degradation of zzso zzso compounds, such as zzso as well as plant volatile zzso zzso
