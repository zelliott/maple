The zzso sequences of the zzso gene of 45 new zzso virus zzso derived from different parts of Europe, Canada and USA were zzso A zzso tree was constructed which confirmed the existence of three major zzso While zzso according to geographical origin was clear in some cases each of the major clusters included zzso which were widely separated in zzso The degree of zzso between the sequences of zzso genes of different strains and the ratio of coding to non coding differences were both very high compared to those observed in other genes such as the M and zzso A standardized system of nomenclature of zzso strains was zzso
