The use of zzso zzso has shown an actual clinical benefit in a few inherited zzso However, the occurrence of cases of leukemia after the zzso gene therapy trial raised concerns about the safety of zzso zzso inherent to the biology of the zzso Although the zzso has long been known to integrate into the host zzso and thus have the potential to activate the nearby zzso there has been no convenient method of studying or zzso such a zzso zzso 

In the present study, we report an in zzso zzso system in which the effect of zzso integration on the expression of the zzso gene can be zzso In this system, a zzso zzso and the zzso reporter gene were constructed in a single zzso as if it had integrated into the zzso 

Using this zzso we found that the full-length long terminal repeat zzso could indeed activate the zzso gene expression from a distance and the magnitude of its zzso was highly increased when this zzso was placed in the vicinity of the zzso start site of the zzso whereas the truncated zzso exerted little zzso 

This zzso system might provide a useful tool for selecting the appropriate zzso structure, as well as for studying the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso by the viral zzso
