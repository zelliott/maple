A series of zzso zzso derivatives with an zzso zzso ring were zzso zzso to evaluate their zzso activity against adult female housefly, zzso zzso and affinity to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso the zzso group, the lower was the zzso zzso but the derivatives zzso and zzso at the zzso of the zzso ring were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso relationship zzso analysis of the zzso affinity demonstrated that the introduction of a zzso into the zzso ring was fundamentally zzso but the introduction of a zzso at the zzso was permissible in the case of its small zzso The binding model of the zzso derivatives with the zzso supported the zzso analysis, indicating the existence of space for a short zzso group around the zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, positive correlation was observed between the zzso activity and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso affinity was the primary factor in influencing the zzso activity even if the zzso ring was zzso
