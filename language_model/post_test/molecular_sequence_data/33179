A zzso zzso was isolated from blood of a 3-year-old boy in zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that this zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso % to zzso zzso zzso zzso is clearly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso and also from zzso zzso zzso zzso in that zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is further distinguished from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by being able to use zzso zzso and zzso as sole carbon sources and by lacking the ability to use zzso or zzso as sole carbon zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this novel species, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposal is also made to zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
