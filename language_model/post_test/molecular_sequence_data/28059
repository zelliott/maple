A novel zzso active toward zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso has been zzso zzso to zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which had been isolated from zzso The zzso has a molecular weight of about zzso and is composed of two identical zzso (Mr zzso zzso The optimal pH for activity was zzso It showed strict zzso toward zzso including low molecular weight zzso acid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and peptides with a zzso at the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Generally, the zzso did not act on zzso composed of zzso acid at the zzso zzso although it showed low zzso only toward zzso such as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Comparing the zzso and zzso values for the major zzso it is clear that the zzso prefers peptides to zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso The zzso was tentatively named as zzso zzso and zzso zzso have no effect on the zzso zzso The zzso appears to be a zzso zzso
