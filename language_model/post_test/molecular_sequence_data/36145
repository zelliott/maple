The use of bacterial signal peptides to target zzso zzso proteins to the zzso space of zzso coli (to promote proper zzso bond zzso has met with variable zzso We report the design and use of a bacterial expression zzso to direct zzso fusion proteins to the zzso space of zzso zzso it contains the signal zzso from the zzso gene of zzso zzso linked to a small zzso zzso for an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso in a zzso manner, but the zzso itself does not bind zzso We have used this system to express a biologically active, soluble form of tissue factor, the protein responsible for triggering the blood zzso zzso zzso tissue factor was zzso into the culture medium at 1-2 zzso from which it could be readily zzso using immobilized zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be removed by zzso with zzso or factor zzso although a free zzso zzso was not required for function since soluble tissue factor was equally active with the zzso still in zzso This zzso system permits large-scale expression and zzso of zzso soluble tissue factor and should be generally zzso to the isolation of other zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso binding of the fusion protein to zzso zzso while avoiding the creation of a new metal binding site on the fusion protein zzso zzso can bind in this zzso site near zzso allowing this site to serve as a means of attaching a fluorescent probe to tissue zzso
