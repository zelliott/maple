zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein modification associated with various diseases related to zzso zzso A role for zzso of zzso in protein zzso has been zzso however, few studies have established a direct link between this modification and loss of protein zzso In the present study, we determined the effect of zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso achieved by using zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso activity zzso This treatment resulted in the modification of several zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased in zzso F1 with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating a clear link between zzso at these positions and activity loss, regardless of the presence of other zzso zzso studies indicated that an F1 with one zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or two zzso zzso was sufficient to grant zzso zzso was four times more zzso to zzso due to its lower zzso zzso was attributed mainly to zzso hindrance caused by adding a bulky zzso more than the presence of a charged group or change in the zzso zzso due to the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso at this zzso would be more relevant under conditions of low zzso zzso zzso at high zzso stress conditions, both zzso zzso would contribute equally to zzso zzso
