The region between the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso was zzso and searched for consensus binding sites of zzso acid receptors and other zzso zzso A continuous sequence of zzso zzso covering the zzso zzso genes was then compared to the corresponding region of the mouse zzso zzso Except for the open reading zzso the only highly zzso regions that could be found were stretches extending zzso zzso upstream from the initiation zzso Within the zzso upstream regions of zzso we identified a common 10 zzso zzso which is also present close to the initiation zzso of several other zzso genes and which therefore may be implicated in the control of their zzso
