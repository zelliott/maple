A zzso plant zzso was zzso from zzso leaves challenged with the fungus zzso zzso and shown to possess zzso properties in zzso The corresponding plant zzso gene was induced after treatment of leaves with zzso zzso or zzso but not with salicylic acid or zzso zzso When challenged with zzso zzso the levels of the plant zzso protein and zzso rose both in zzso leaves and in zzso leaves of zzso plants zzso zzso These events coincided with an increase in the zzso zzso acid content of both types of zzso zzso zzso expression of the plant zzso gene was unaffected in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso affected in the salicylic acid response but was strongly reduced in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are blocked in their response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that systemic zzso expression of the plant zzso gene in zzso is independent of salicylic acid but requires components of the zzso and zzso acid zzso
