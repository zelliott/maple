zzso is a small zzso protein that belongs to the zzso small zzso which are important signaling molecules that regulate the dynamics of the zzso zzso and mediate changes in cell zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained from a zzso zzso library zzso In this study, the full-length zzso sequence of zzso zzso was zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of 192 zzso zzso with a putative molecular weight of zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso zzso was highly zzso to previously characterized zzso of zzso zzso and was nearly identical to human zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso demonstrated that the zzso was zzso expressed in all zzso zzso but at different zzso Upon challenge with zzso zzso the expression level of zzso zzso in the liver at different time zzso In the head zzso its expression level decreased to the lowest at 4 zzso and then increased to the background level at 24 zzso The remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation observed in zzso zzso primary structure together with its changing in expression level upon challenge suggested a functionally important role for this zzso family member in the immune zzso
