The zzso coding for calf zzso a zzso protein of the lens fiber cells, has been cloned and zzso The predicted zzso zzso open reading frame shows primary and secondary structure similarity to intermediate filament zzso zzso zzso can be divided into an zzso domain zzso of 38 zzso zzso a middle domain zzso of 279 zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso The head domain contains a zzso zzso acid motif which is also found in the head zzso of various intermediate filament proteins and includes a potential protein zzso A zzso zzso By multiple alignment to all known IF protein zzso the zzso rod, which is the shortest among IF zzso can be subdivided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A 29 zzso acid zzso in the zzso 2 region accounts for the smaller size of this zzso The zzso tail contains 6 1/2 tandem repeats which match analogous motifs of zzso zzso M and H zzso We suggest that zzso is a novel IF protein which does not conform to any of the previously described zzso zzso zzso fails to form regular filaments in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso probably due to the missing segment in the zzso 2 zzso Participation of zzso in a zzso network in zzso may be facilitated by an assembly zzso
