In zzso zzso group proteins play critical roles in the regulation of transcription, cell zzso differentiation and zzso In this work we report the molecular cloning and characterization of zzso a zzso from the conifer zzso pine zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of a zzso group member described in animals and zzso A full-length clone was isolated from zzso prepared from zzso zzso and contained a 1,239 zzso zzso zzso 412 zzso zzso zzso of the isolated sequence revealed that it contains a zzso domain in the zzso zzso A comparison of the pine sequence with zzso proteins from plants, animals and zzso revealed that zzso is zzso related to the zzso group members and not a zzso containing zzso zzso analyses of transcript abundance in pine zzso demonstrated that zzso is particularly abundant in zzso suggesting that this gene could be involved during zzso zzso The spatial zzso of zzso transcripts revealed that gene expression was restricted to the vascular bundle and zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a possible function of this gene in zzso control and vascular bundle zzso This work is the first report of the presence of a zzso group zzso gene in zzso
