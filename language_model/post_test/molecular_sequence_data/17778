The preparation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is zzso These zzso zzso are capable of zzso with zzso DNA via formation of a zzso between the zzso side of the zzso ring and a zzso of the target DNA when the zzso duplex is zzso with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso DNA targets in which the position of the zzso site is varied are characterized and compared to results obtained with zzso zzso with zzso zzso It appears that the zzso ring can stack on the terminal base pair formed between the zzso and its target DNA or can zzso between the last two base pairs of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso efficiently to a zzso located in the last base pair zzso zzso or 3' to the last base pair zzso + 1 zzso of the target, whereas the zzso zzso zzso most efficiently to a zzso located in the zzso + 1 zzso The results show that both the extent and zzso of zzso are influenced by the location of the zzso site in the zzso zzso
