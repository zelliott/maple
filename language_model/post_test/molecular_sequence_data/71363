The ability of zzso zzso zzso to interact with cellular barriers is essential to its zzso With zzso cells, this process has been modeled in two zzso The initial stage of localized adherence is zzso by bacterial zzso After this phase, zzso disperse and lose zzso thus leading to a diffuse zzso At this stage, zzso have disappeared, and zzso interact intimately with cells and are, in places, located on zzso of zzso thus realizing attaching and zzso zzso zzso The bacterial attributes responsible for these latter zzso remain zzso Considering that bacteria are zzso at this stage, zzso cannot be directly responsible for this zzso However, the initial phase of zzso localized adherence is required for the occurrence of diffuse zzso loss of zzso and intimate attachment, because zzso bacteria are not capable of such a cellular zzso In this work, we engineered a zzso in the zzso zzso protein zzso and showed that this zzso increased zzso and abolished the zzso phase of bacterial zzso as well as the loss of zzso Furthermore, no intimate attachment nor zzso zzso were zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso remained adherent as zzso zzso at all zzso Taken together these data demonstrate that the induction of diffuse zzso intimate attachment, and zzso zzso after zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso
