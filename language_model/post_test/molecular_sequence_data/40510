One of the major objectives of the Human Genome Project is to understand the biological function of the gene and zzso as well as to develop clinical applications for human zzso For this purpose, the experimental zzso and zzso trails by using animal models are zzso The mouse zzso zzso is one of the best animal models because zzso is well established in the mouse and embryonic manipulation technologies are also well zzso zzso mouse zzso projects have been conducted to develop various mouse models since zzso zzso the zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been the major efforts internationally then zzso mouse projects and zzso zzso have been zzso At the beginning, simple zzso traits in the experimental condition have been zzso Then, more complex traits with variety of environmental interactions and zzso interactions zzso have been challenged with zzso zzso In addition, zzso substitution strains and collaborative cross strains are also available to zzso the complex traits in the zzso Altogether, mouse models with zzso and various laboratory strains will accelerate the studies of functional zzso in the mouse as well as in zzso
