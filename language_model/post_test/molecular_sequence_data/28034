We have zzso DNA zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to near zzso by a zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso has an Mr zzso 60,000 and shows near zzso zzso peak at 440 zzso and a zzso zzso maximum at zzso zzso indicating that it contains zzso zzso zzso as an intrinsic zzso The zzso binds with high specificity to zzso zzso in DNA with an equilibrium binding constant, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso rate constant, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso Despite zzso higher affinity compared to the zzso zzso coli zzso the two zzso apparently contact the same zzso around the zzso zzso the zzso immediately zzso and the three zzso immediately 3' to the zzso on the damaged strand and the zzso across from the zzso in the minor groove on the complementary zzso The absolute action spectrum of the zzso zzso in the zzso region closely matches the zzso of the zzso zzso The quantum yield zzso over this region is constant and is approximately zzso The value is measurably smaller than the quantum yields reported for other DNA zzso
