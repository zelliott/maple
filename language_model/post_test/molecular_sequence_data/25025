In order to gain a better understanding of the origin and evolution of zzso zzso zzso in radish, sequence analysis was conducted for the zzso zzso zzso using wild and cultivated zzso The zzso sequence of the entire coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso 1 zzso was determined for six radishes with normal and zzso zzso and they were classified into three types zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso region of zzso was further analyzed in 40 additional zzso zzso of the category of radish, plants with zzso zzso zzso contained only the type 1 zzso whereas plants with normal zzso had either type 2 or type zzso The results suggested that the zzso event, which led to the association of zzso with the zzso gene zzso had occurred only once in the history of zzso
