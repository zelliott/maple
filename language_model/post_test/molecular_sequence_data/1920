The zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso including those responsible for zzso maintenance and zzso Additionally, zzso functions as the zzso analog of the zzso zzso zzso The protein structure consists of eight zzso two of which belong to a predicted zzso zzso Each zzso of the zzso operator DNA binds one copy of the protein in the major zzso As confirmed by zzso recognition specificity is based mainly on two side chain interactions outside the zzso motif with two bases next to the central base pair of the zzso pair operator zzso The surface of the zzso zzso domain mirrors the overall acidity of zzso whereas DNA binding occurs via a basic interaction zzso We present a model of zzso including the structure of its zzso domain, and discuss its interactions with the highly basic zzso zzso zzso
