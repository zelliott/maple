zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder that may be associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in regulation of zzso membrane fusion by interacting with zzso zzso and evidence of abnormal zzso membrane protein trafficking has been reported in ARC zzso We zzso clinical and molecular features of ARC syndrome in order to identify potential zzso zzso The clinical zzso of 62 ARC syndrome patients was zzso In addition to classical features described zzso all patients had severe failure to zzso which was not adequately explained by the degree of liver disease and zzso had structural cardiac zzso Almost half of the patients who underwent diagnostic organ biopsy zzso developed life-threatening zzso We found that most patients zzso who suffered severe zzso (7 post biopsy and 4 zzso had normal zzso count and zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso families zzso zzso with ARC zzso Several zzso were restricted to specific ethnic zzso Thus zzso zzso was common in the UK Pakistani families and zzso was consistent with a founder zzso with the most recent common zzso zzso years zzso zzso was found in the zzso locus in some cases of ARC providing the first evidence of a possible second ARC syndrome zzso In conclusion we state that molecular diagnosis is possible for most children in whom ARC syndrome is suspected and zzso zzso analysis should replace organ biopsy as a first line diagnostic test for ARC zzso
