zzso zzso markedly improves plant zzso zzso but the molecular mechanisms underlying this benefit are still poorly zzso We identified two zzso in a zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with significant similarities to zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso and from zzso zzso The full-length zzso corresponding to these two zzso zzso a zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso of zzso influx into zzso expressing either zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were able to mediate zzso zzso with different affinities for zzso zzso values of 55 and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso increased the levels of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso grown in pure zzso zzso levels of zzso were less dependent on zzso zzso The two zzso were expressed in zzso zzso associated with its natural host plant, zzso zzso grown under low or high P zzso The presence of zzso increased net zzso zzso rates into intact zzso zzso roots at low or high soil P zzso The expression patterns of zzso and zzso indicate that the two zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso of zzso from the soil solution under the two soil P availability conditions zzso
