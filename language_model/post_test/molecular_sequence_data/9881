We are building a knowledge base zzso of published structural data on the 30s zzso zzso in zzso Our zzso is distinguished by a standardized representation of biological experiments and their results, in a reusable zzso It can be zzso by computer programs that exploit the rich zzso within the zzso The zzso is designed to support the construction of zzso models of the zzso zzso as well as the analysis and extension of relevant functional and zzso zzso Most published information about the structure of the ubiquitous zzso focuses on zzso coli as a model zzso At the same time, thousands of zzso sequences for the zzso have been gathered and zzso The volume and complexity of these data can complicate attempts to separate structural data peculiar to zzso coli from data of universal zzso We have written an application that zzso queries the zzso and the zzso Database Project, a zzso of zzso zzso sequences from other organisms, in order to assess the relevance of structural data to particular zzso The application uses the zzso alignment to determine whether a set of data refer primarily to zzso mismatched, or gapped zzso For a set of 16 representative articles evaluated over 211 zzso zzso of observations have zzso translations from zzso coli to the other organisms, zzso have somewhat ambiguous zzso and zzso have no zzso There is a wide variation in these numbers over different articles and organisms, confirming that some articles report structural information specific to zzso coli while others report information that is quite zzso
