Marine zzso toxins such as zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso The fate of zzso toxins in the zzso phase, particularly bacterial zzso of the zzso is poorly zzso An inexpensive and easily available zzso structural analog zzso was used for enrichment and isolation of potential zzso toxin degrading aquatic marine bacteria from Florida bay area, and from red tide endemic sites in the South Florida Gulf zzso zzso growth on zzso was observed in most of the enrichment cultures from both regions with colony forming units ranging from 0 to zzso per zzso The zzso zzso efficiency of bacterial zzso determined using zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso bacterial zzso were grown in media with zzso as the sole carbon source to screen for zzso zzso capability using zzso Out of the two efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maximum zzso zzso efficiency of zzso was observed with zzso while zzso was unable to zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso sequence similarity zzso was found have a match with zzso zzso
