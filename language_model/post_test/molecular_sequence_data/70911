The chemical structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso was investigated because it is of biomedical interest in the context of septic zzso a syndrome often encountered in zzso infections with zzso zzso The successive zzso and zzso of zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso which represent the complete zzso zzso Five compounds were separated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by one-dimensional and two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main product was a zzso of the structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wherein all zzso are present as zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso and zzso acid, zzso In addition, two zzso and two zzso were isolated that were partial structures of the zzso In one zzso the terminal zzso was missing and an additional zzso group linked to zzso of the zzso zzso was present, whereas in the other zzso the zzso zzso was zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso was zzso they differed in their zzso zzso Whereas both zzso contained two zzso in the zzso backbone zzso zzso at the reducing zzso and one zzso group at zzso of the first zzso only one of them was additionally zzso with zzso at zzso of the second zzso
