The plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that mediates the exchange of zzso for zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although it has been known that zzso in rat zzso is coupled with the zzso zzso zzso for regulation of zzso zzso concentration zzso it is unclear what kind of zzso zzso are expressed and whether the other two zzso zzso are also present in mouse zzso To clarify the role of zzso during bone zzso we investigated the expression of zzso the zzso transport via zzso and the effects of zzso zzso on zzso activity in mouse zzso Using zzso zzso and Western zzso methods, we detected three zzso zzso of zzso and zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso Low zzso sodium zzso solution increases the zzso zzso concentration via zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso increase was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents in mouse zzso were recorded using the patch clamp method and could be suppressed with zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased the zzso pit area surrounding zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, small interference zzso targeted against zzso zzso and zzso expressed in mouse zzso suppressed zzso pit zzso These results show that three zzso zzso are expressed in mouse zzso and play an important role for zzso transport and regulation during zzso bone zzso
