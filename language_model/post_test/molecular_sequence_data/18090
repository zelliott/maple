We have screened a pea zzso library using a zzso probe derived from pea shoot zzso From this screen, we isolated two closely related zzso designated as zzso and zzso An intriguing property of these two genes is the presence in their coding region of a repeated sequence that is zzso between them in sequence but not in the number of the repeating zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence suggests that these proteins could be exported and zzso 3' zzso analysis reveals that one of the zzso zzso is expressed highly in zzso as expected from previous zzso However, zzso derived from the other zzso zzso is not zzso in stem zzso but is present in tissue derived from pea zzso The zzso upstream sequence of zzso and zzso are zzso identical up to position zzso suggesting that sequences upstream of zzso are responsible for zzso expression of the two zzso
