We report the zzso zzso and characterization of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso The zzso consists of a zzso chain of zzso zzso acids that shares zzso identity with the zzso type A zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso the zzso of zzso while reducing a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso kinetic mechanism has been determined with zzso as an zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and product zzso data suggest that the zzso follows a zzso zzso zzso kinetic zzso The zzso of the active site zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner by zzso with zzso and zzso acid, two competitive zzso with respect to zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso with zzso had no effect on zzso zzso consistent with zzso binding sites for zzso and zzso as suggested from the kinetic zzso The reductive zzso has been shown to be only partially rate limiting, and an attempt to evaluate the slow step in the overall reaction has been made by simulating zzso production under zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso is a zzso segment, while zzso most zzso retains significant affinity for the reduced zzso as suggested by the product zzso zzso
