zzso II is a zzso zzso protein from the sea zzso zzso zzso It readily creates pores in zzso containing zzso Its zzso when bound in zzso zzso has been studied using zzso zzso At approximately every tenth zzso a zzso was zzso zzso single zzso zzso were produced in zzso coli and zzso The accessibility of the zzso groups in zzso zzso zzso was studied by reaction with zzso zzso Most of the zzso were zzso except those with zzso at positions 105 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were modified only at high zzso of the zzso Similar results were obtained if zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso but in this case three more zzso gave a negative zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacted with zzso only after zzso into the zzso suggesting that they were involved in major zzso changes occurring upon membrane zzso These results were further confirmed by labeling the zzso with zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso When labeled zzso were combined with zzso the following zzso exhibited zzso indicating the transfer of zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The overall results suggest that at least two regions are embedded within the zzso zzso the zzso zzso region, probably forming an zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nearby could be involved in making contacts with zzso zzso The association with the membrane appears to be unique and different from that of bacterial zzso proteins and therefore zzso II may serve as a model for zzso zzso zzso
