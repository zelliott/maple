zzso elements zzso are dynamic components of zzso zzso We aimed to characterize zzso to help zzso their impact on the zzso architecture, diversity and evolution of zzso in the zzso zzso cluster of species zzso zzso 

A full TE element of zzso zzso named zzso was identified in a zzso clone available in zzso zzso was further zzso using zzso tools, zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and DNA zzso 

zzso shares several structures in common with zzso an abundant TE found widespread along the zzso zzso The central region of zzso is very dynamic but revealed a disrupted pattern of zzso zzso among its internal tandem zzso The minimal sequence variation in zzso zzso suggests recent zzso zzso accumulates near or at zzso regions of all 6 pairs of zzso especially on the sex zzso with some zzso 

zzso is an abundant type of zzso zzso but with characteristic sequence signatures and probably restricted to the zzso zzso The conservation of different central zzso and association with genes suggests selective zzso Although at or near zzso the distribution of zzso does not overlap with zzso probably a consequence of functional or molecular zzso
