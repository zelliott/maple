We have identified a zzso zzso gene necessary for the step in zzso synthesis in which zzso zzso is added to zzso to form zzso a reaction zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This step should be an effective target for zzso zzso A key element in our experiments was the development of a procedure for zzso zzso defective in steps in zzso synthesis downstream from the first step including a zzso defective in zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso is supported by data showing a failure of the zzso strain to incorporate radioactive zzso or zzso into zzso and, by using an improved zzso a demonstration that the zzso strain lacks zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso accumulates zzso when fed zzso zzso as expected for a strain lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by cell death, suggesting the presence of a zzso death response in zzso A zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso and restores zzso activity and zzso synthesis was zzso zzso in zzso had been shown previously to give resistance to the zzso drug zzso A, leading us to predict that the drug should inhibit zzso zzso zzso Our data show that the drug is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso with an zzso of about zzso zzso zzso pathogens are an increasing threat to human zzso Now that zzso zzso has been shown to be the target for zzso A, it should be possible to develop high zzso screens to identify new zzso of zzso zzso to combat zzso zzso
