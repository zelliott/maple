zzso growth factor, a potent zzso zzso in zzso appears to trigger zzso zzso after partial zzso and after acute liver cell zzso zzso growth zzso and transforming growth zzso 1 may also be involved in the control of liver zzso In this study we assessed possible roles of zzso growth factor, transforming growth zzso and transforming growth zzso 1 on liver cell proliferation in zzso using a model of zzso zzso that is associated with liver cell necrosis and a model of a zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso without liver zzso Male zzso rats were fed a zzso diet or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diet for 6 and 4 zzso zzso zzso were killed periodically, and the expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in the liver, lung and kidney was determined by zzso zzso The levels of transforming growth zzso and transforming growth zzso 1 zzso zzso in the liver were also zzso Feeding a zzso diet for 1 to 6 zzso led to gradual increases in the levels of zzso growth factor, transforming growth zzso and transforming growth zzso 1 zzso zzso in the zzso Feeding a zzso zzso zzso zzso diet for 3 days and 2 zzso induced marked enhancement of liver cell proliferation as judged by zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
