zzso zzso 1 zzso is the zzso zzso in the de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso protein degradation has been reported in animal models of several diseases, including diabetes zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso is zzso remain zzso Here we report a novel zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso binding of zzso to zzso via an zzso domain zzso results in zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso in cultured cells accelerated zzso zzso In cultured cells and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with zzso and targeted it for zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso Finally, direct zzso of an zzso zzso in the zzso patch of the zzso zzso affected its zzso binding and the zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso zzso interacts with zzso via an zzso zzso The zzso binding directs zzso zzso and zzso zzso
