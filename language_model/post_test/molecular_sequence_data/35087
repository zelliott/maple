zzso a zzso resistance zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso had a length of zzso zzso and contained seven coding DNA sequences of which two were zzso as replication zzso one as a zzso protein and one as a zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso B resistance genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso was only associated with zzso and zzso resistance zzso and not with zzso resistance to zzso A region of the zzso zzso the resistance genes zzso and zzso plus the zzso was highly similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso identical to zzso found in a number of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, assessment of the potential host range of zzso revealed that the zzso was able to replicate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso coli zzso and zzso This study reports the first zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso A large potential for dissemination of zzso is indicated by its host range of both zzso and zzso zzso
