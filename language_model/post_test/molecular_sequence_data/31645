The transition to zzso enabled the evolution of large, complex organisms, but early steps in this transition remain poorly zzso Here we show that zzso complexity, including development from a single cell, can evolve rapidly in a zzso zzso that has never had a zzso zzso We subject the zzso zzso zzso to conditions that zzso zzso resulting in the evolution of a zzso life cycle in which clusters reproduce via zzso zzso zzso While a zzso genetic bottleneck during zzso is widely regarded as an adaptation to limit zzso conflict, its appearance very early in this transition suggests that it did not evolve for this zzso Instead, we find that zzso zzso are zzso even in the absence of zzso conflict, maximizing zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso a trait essential for evolving zzso complexity, can arise rapidly via zzso of the ancestral zzso zzso
