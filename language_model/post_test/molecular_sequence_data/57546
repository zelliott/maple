The three-dimensional backbone fold of a zzso zzso from the rat zzso zzso factor was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso This zzso contains an zzso acid sequence that is approximately zzso zzso to the well known zzso but which contains 81 zzso acid zzso as compared with 60 zzso in zzso zzso For the present studies we used a zzso 99 zzso acid zzso containing this sequence in positions zzso which was zzso zzso with zzso and also doubly zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso structure of this zzso contains three zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a loop formed by zzso zzso and a long stretch of zzso secondary structure linking the second and third zzso The relative location and orientation of the zzso is very similar to that in the zzso zzso zzso structure, despite the fact that zzso II is zzso by about one zzso This confirms a recently advanced hypothesis based on sequence comparisons that this zzso segment of zzso might represent a zzso structural zzso The zzso zzso which has been shown to comprise the DNA recognition zzso in the zzso zzso can readily be recognized in the zzso zzso in spite of an extensive modification of the primary zzso The two zzso of the tight turn in the zzso zzso are replaced by a 23 zzso zzso region between the two zzso in zzso which zzso out from the rest of the zzso and thus enables the formation of a zzso zzso zzso
