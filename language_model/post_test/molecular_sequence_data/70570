The genes zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso genes are contiguous, and most probably comprise an zzso also including a zzso zzso a zzso gene of unknown function located downstream of zzso in all four zzso zzso so far zzso zzso comparison confirms that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso A zzso analysis using the available zzso zzso including zzso proteins from zzso zzso suggests a zzso origin of the zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso from zzso zzso forms a separate zzso with zzso from the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso branching together, next to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on an alignment with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, the zzso acid zzso involved in binding of zzso zzso and zzso have been tentatively identified, which is consistent with the binding of two zzso and four zzso per zzso zzso The evolution of zzso and the structural basis for the binding of zzso and zzso are zzso
