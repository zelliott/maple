The use of tick vaccines in zzso hosts has been shown to be the most promising alternative tick control method to current use of zzso which suffers from a number of zzso However, the success of this method is dependent on the zzso zzso and in zzso expression of tick molecules involved in the mediation of key zzso roles with respect to the biological success of a tick as a zzso and zzso We have zzso and characterized a zzso zzso tick zzso zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein is expressed in both zzso and fed immature and mature zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shows high zzso to sequences of some known zzso zzso zzso with the structural conservation similar to all known collagen zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso a significant protective immunity in zzso resulting in reduced zzso weight for adult ticks and up to 40 and zzso mortality in larvae and zzso that fed on the zzso zzso We speculate that this protein is associated with formation of tick zzso a chemical compound that enables the tick to remain attached to the host, and suggest a role for zzso as a candidate tick vaccine zzso for the control of zzso We have discussed our findings with respect to the search of tick molecules for vaccine zzso
