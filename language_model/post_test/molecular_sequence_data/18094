We describe two novel ways in which changes in gene expression in zzso zzso may arise as a consequence of the zzso zzso zzso One involves zzso of zzso from the zzso gene promoter and zzso of two new zzso copies zzso zzso and zzso zzso away, on either side of the zzso zzso One of the new insertions is in the zzso coding region and completely blocks production of an active gene zzso This zzso probably arose by a symmetrical double zzso following zzso zzso The second case involves a small deletion at one end of zzso in the zzso zzso flanked by a sequence typical of a zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the end of zzso was zzso at an early step in an attempted zzso and zzso back to its original zzso zzso The zzso restores some expression to the zzso zzso suggesting that the ends of the intact zzso element contain components which can actively inhibit gene zzso The implications of these findings for the mechanism of zzso zzso and for the effects of zzso on host gene expression are zzso
