A transition from a parallel to an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso is required for zzso zzso signal zzso However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking zzso changes to target gene zzso by zzso are still largely zzso In the present study, we have zzso in more detail than before, two zzso point zzso with zzso acid zzso at both sites of the zzso interface zzso and zzso First, we confirmed that zzso of zzso cells led to enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso as compared to the zzso zzso which consequently resulted in its prolonged nuclear zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that, in contrast to zzso zzso and similar to the zzso zzso also zzso resisted zzso zzso by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso target genes differed between zzso and zzso zzso While expression of genes containing a single classical zzso site zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was virtually unaffected by the presence of either of two zzso acid exchanges, induction of the zzso and zzso gene was significantly zzso The latter two genes both contain an additional zzso binding motif separated by 10 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso superiority of the zzso on these genes was reflected by their increased binding affinity to DNA fragments containing the identified zzso zzso In zzso our data demonstrate that two clinically relevant interface zzso of zzso exhibit zzso effects and point to the rather complex role of the assumed zzso shift between two different zzso zzso for efficient zzso zzso
