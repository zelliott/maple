Comparative zzso studies have revealed that zzso typically possess two or more zzso duplicated copies of the zzso zzso zzso The domestic rabbit represents an exception to this general rule, as this species was found to possess a single zzso zzso Previous zzso surveys of zzso zzso in natural populations of the European rabbit zzso zzso revealed extensive geographic variation in the zzso of three main zzso The variation in frequency of two zzso is mainly zzso between two distinct subspecies of European zzso and a third is restricted to the hybrid zone between the two rabbit subspecies in zzso Here we report the results of a survey of zzso zzso which revealed zzso copy number zzso in zzso populations of the European zzso By characterizing patterns of zzso zzso in populations from the native range of the European zzso we were able to identify the specific zzso zzso that distinguish the previously characterized zzso Within the hybrid zone, we observed the existence of a second zzso gene zzso named zzso that mostly represents a novel sequence zzso which occurs in higher frequency within the hybrid zone, and thus appears to have arisen in hybrids of the two distinct zzso Although this novel gene is also present in other wild zzso zzso it is almost absent from French zzso which suggest a recent zzso associated with the establishment of the zzso contact zone between the two European rabbit zzso
