We sought to understand the genesis of the zzso by characterizing zzso zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso and zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso ALL zzso zzso ALL zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in 54 zzso No evidence for significant zzso and no association with sequence motifs was found except for a zzso deficit in repeat regions within zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, showed differences in the patterns of zzso between zzso and zzso To explore the possibility that zzso gene zzso activity might be involved in zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso for cases with zzso close to potential cryptic zzso signal sequence zzso zzso Of 13 ALL cases tested, zzso with zzso and 1/3 with zzso precisely zzso the forward zzso zzso and zzso with zzso precisely zzso the zzso zzso In contrast, neither of the zzso zzso tested showed functional zzso Thus, although the zzso does not arise from zzso variable zzso joining zzso and diversity zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that in a subset of ALL cases zzso might create one of the initiating zzso zzso
