The zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and transcripts from both genes are found in the maternal zzso pool of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso We have now isolated zzso clones which contain complete coding sequences from both zzso zzso In zzso translation of zzso transcribed in zzso from these clones produces in each case a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 57 zzso The in zzso proteins show identical zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the coding regions of the two zzso revealed that they both produce zzso acid zzso which differ from each other at only eight zzso Analysis of silent site changes between the two coding sequences suggests that the two genes began zzso about 25 million years zzso zzso with zzso specific for each of the two zzso zzso indicates that the two genes are zzso in zzso and in at least some adult zzso as well as during zzso Finally, expression of each of the zzso clones in zzso causes the appearance of proteins which are recognized by an zzso which binds to zzso
