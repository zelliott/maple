zzso studies of zzso interactions are constrained by the methods available for rapid species identification of the interacting zzso The resolution of data required to characterize species interaction networks at multiple zzso scales can be zzso and therefore zzso and costly to zzso We explore the utility of high-resolution DNA zzso analysis zzso as a rapid species identification zzso An approach was developed to identify organisms at the zzso interaction level, with particular application to cryptic species interactions that are traditionally difficult to zzso Here, we selected a challenging zzso to identify the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transported by bark zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The technique was able to distinguish between different species of DNA within a single, pooled zzso In test applications, zzso was effective in the mass screening and identification of zzso zzso species carried by many individual bark zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across large geographic zzso For two of the zzso species, there was no difference in the frequency of association with either of their zzso but for the third zzso species there was a shift in zzso associations across zzso This technique allows zzso mass screening and characterization of species interactions at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional zzso It is anticipated that this method can be readily applied to explore other cryptic species zzso or other studies requiring rapid generation of large data sets and/or zzso zzso
