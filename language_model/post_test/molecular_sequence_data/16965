zzso alignment of zzso b of the zzso zzso complex from various sources reveals that bacterial zzso b contain an extra zzso at the C zzso To study the role of this zzso in bacterial zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso complexes with progressive deletion from this zzso zzso zzso were generated and zzso The zzso zzso complex, in which 13 zzso from the zzso end of this zzso are deleted, has electron transfer activity, zzso zzso and physical properties similar to those of the complement complex, indicating that this region of the extra zzso is not zzso In contrast, the electron transfer activity, binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso IV to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso b and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, in which 19, 21, or all zzso of this zzso are deleted, decrease zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cluster and the zzso b in these three deletion zzso zzso complexes are also zzso the extent of spectral zzso increases as this extra zzso is zzso These results indicate that the first 12 zzso zzso zzso from the zzso end of the zzso extra zzso of zzso b are essential for maintaining structural integrity of the zzso zzso
