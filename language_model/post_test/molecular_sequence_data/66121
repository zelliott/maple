The zzso zzso family member BAD resides in a zzso complex that regulates zzso zzso zzso Here, we present genetic evidence of a zzso role for BAD in zzso insulin zzso by beta zzso This novel function of BAD is specifically dependent upon the zzso of its zzso zzso previously defined as an essential death zzso We highlight the zzso relevance of zzso BAD zzso by using zzso zzso BAD zzso zzso that target zzso restore zzso zzso zzso and correct the insulin zzso response in zzso zzso Our studies uncover an alternative target and function for the BAD zzso domain and emphasize the therapeutic potential of zzso BAD zzso zzso in selectively restoring beta cell zzso Furthermore, we show that BAD regulates the zzso adaptation of beta cell mass during high-fat zzso Our findings provide genetic proof of the zzso activities of BAD in both beta cell survival and insulin zzso
