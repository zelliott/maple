zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso factor responsible for promoting the zzso expression of a family of genes referred to as middle zzso zzso Many members of this gene family are essential for the completion of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is essential for the completion of zzso zzso is highly regulated both zzso and zzso To facilitate zzso analysis of zzso we have expressed the DNA binding domain in zzso coli and zzso the zzso protein with an affinity zzso zzso In addition we have dissected the zzso of zzso to zzso the functional DNA binding zzso This analysis shows that the zzso 40 zzso of zzso although not essential for its DNA binding activity, do have an effect on its ability to bind specifically to its target DNA zzso In addition, we show that the zzso DNA binding domain can be zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso but contrary to our initial hypothesis this zzso does not significantly affect the affinity of zzso for its target DNA zzso
