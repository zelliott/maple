We have determined the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso contains a zzso open reading frame that is zzso identical to the open reading frame of the zzso zzso from the zzso strain of zzso zzso which is known to zzso a zzso DNA zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso studies, the high degree of identity with the zzso zzso zzso and the observation that the zzso zzso activity in a reaction utilizing zzso template is not affected by removal of zzso suggest that the zzso zzso also encodes a zzso DNA zzso zzso of regions of zzso acids that are highly zzso in the two zzso zzso to family B zzso reveals good zzso for the three major zzso motifs and suggests that previously identified motifs characteristic of reverse zzso found in the zzso sequence are not zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso plasmids are unusual in that the zzso acid sequence zzso which forms the core of the third motif in family B zzso is not present in either zzso or zzso A version of the motif containing zzso exists in both zzso
