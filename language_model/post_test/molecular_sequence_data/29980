The zzso gene coding for a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been located on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have determined zzso zzso of DNA zzso including 97 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso 84 zzso zzso and 67 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is of the same polarity as the zzso zzso The organization of the zzso and zzso genes resembles the zzso coli zzso and higher plant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso encodes a zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso The zzso gene is interrupted by seven Group III zzso of 93, 95, 94, 99, 101, 110 and 99 zzso respectively and a Group II zzso of 309 zzso All other known zzso genes lack zzso All the zzso junctions were zzso determined by zzso cloning and sequencing or direct primer extension zzso zzso zzso from the zzso locus were characterized by Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
