To study the processing of zzso II zzso by the zzso zzso zzso we have generated a stable zzso cell line which expresses mouse zzso We here present the characteristics of the zzso cell line and demonstrate that the zzso zzso is sorted and stored in zzso zzso in the zzso cell line as efficiently as the zzso zzso By indirect zzso with zzso specific for zzso B zzso and zzso we were able to establish that the zzso is stored in zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso After zzso zzso followed by zzso the mature 68 zzso form of zzso was found zzso with zzso in zzso containing zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to characterize a zzso zzso fraction obtained from the zzso cells, and a comparison was done of the zzso pattern obtained from the zzso cells with the parent cell line zzso The products derived from the processing of zzso by zzso were identified by zzso with a panel of zzso directed against zzso Using zzso to label the newly zzso zzso we performed a time course to monitor the appearance of the zzso fragments of zzso beginning 15 zzso after a 5 zzso pulse of zzso we were able to detect the first zzso zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is zzso processed by zzso in the immature zzso zzso into several zzso zzso the major ones being an 18 zzso zzso zzso and a 28 zzso zzso
