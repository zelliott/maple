zzso cells require intimate associations and signals from the surrounding zzso cells throughout zzso The zero population growth zzso locus of zzso encodes a zzso gap junction zzso zzso 4, that is required for survival of zzso early germ cells during zzso in both zzso Animals with a zzso zzso in zzso are viable but sterile and have tiny zzso Adult zzso zzso contain small numbers of early germ cells, resembling stem cells or early zzso or zzso but lack later stages of germ cell zzso In the male, zzso protein zzso to the surface of zzso primarily on the sides adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso In the female, zzso protein zzso to germ cell surfaces, both those adjacent to surrounding zzso cells and those adjacent to other germ zzso We propose that zzso gap zzso zzso in the germ cell plasma membrane may connect with zzso made of other zzso zzso on adjacent zzso zzso Gap zzso zzso communication via these channels may mediate passage of crucial small molecules or signals between zzso and zzso support cells required for survival and differentiation of early germ cells in both zzso
