The insect Toll family of proteins and their zzso counterparts seemingly shared one common zzso and evolved zzso Here we demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso zzso Toll family is shared by the fish and zzso According to the draft of the zzso zzso zzso project, the signature zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso has been zzso during zzso zzso 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 members zzso structurally to respective zzso zzso One zzso zzso showed equally high zzso acid identity to human zzso 6 and 10, and we named it zzso zzso zzso has genes for zzso and 22, which are unique to zzso One possible interpretation of these findings is that zzso 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 21 and 22 existed in the ancestral zzso common to fish and zzso and that zzso was lost in the fish zzso while zzso and 22 were lost in the zzso zzso zzso a solitary zzso zzso zzso has only a few zzso zzso which, like zzso zzso zzso represent primitive ones before the expansion of the Toll zzso zzso the expansion of zzso genes should have occurred earlier than fish, but not zzso zzso separated zzso from zzso These results zzso that the appearance of the zzso innate system was completed before or zzso with the appearance of acquired zzso We interpret the present data to mean that the differences of zzso identified in this study between zzso and humans may be rather zzso partially due to selection pressure exerted by pathogens in distinct zzso
