We report the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso to human and chicken zzso membrane protein zzso transcripts and their prevalent expression patterns during zzso zzso transcripts code for proteins zzso in and specific for the zzso zzso The function of these proteins is still under zzso Other than in the zzso zzso zzso proteins have been detected at the plasma membrane of cells in a differentiation dependent and zzso dependent zzso They were also observed at the plasma membrane of cells, which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cell zzso during such events has been zzso A study of the zzso expression patterns of zzso transcripts was undertaken to help zzso possible functions of their respective zzso The zzso transcript was prevalent in neural crest derived zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts were similarly expressed in structures containing neural crest derived tissue with the strongest signals detected in zzso However, zzso and zzso transcript expression differed in zzso or zzso derived zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was pronounced in zzso early in development, in limb zzso zzso and in lung zzso whereas zzso was prevalent in the liver, the zzso and in zzso kidney zzso and became increasingly prominent in the zzso lining of the zzso and the respiratory tract during zzso These results correlated with the detection of zzso protein in these zzso In conclusion, all zzso transcripts were detected in zzso undergoing zzso during development requiring zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso transcripts were observed in zzso and zzso during the time of zzso interaction, zzso zzso and zzso Their expression pattern became more tissue and cell type specific as differentiation zzso These patterns indicate a possible involvement of zzso proteins in zzso or zzso zzso interaction, and appear to reflect tissue and cell type specific roles of zzso during zzso
