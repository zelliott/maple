A zzso with apparent molecular weight in zzso gels of 37 zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso products of the adult stage of zzso zzso a zzso zzso This protein is the major zzso product recognized in zzso by zzso from a naturally infected zzso A synthetic zzso based on zzso sequence data from a digest of the zzso protein was used to successfully screen a zzso zzso A zzso clone was isolated which zzso a zzso protein precursor of 220 zzso acids that contained a 63 zzso acid region of which more than zzso of the zzso were zzso three zzso sequences determined from the natural zzso and three potential zzso sites, consistent with the protein being isolated from the zzso fraction of the adult zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso clone was preceded by a zzso zzso region of 16 zzso zzso
