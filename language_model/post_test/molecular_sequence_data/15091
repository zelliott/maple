A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was established using the high affinity zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a series of zzso zzso containing zzso prepared as zzso zzso zzso showed that the highest affinities were obtained by replacement of the original zzso zzso with N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This provided zzso hybrids of the form zzso Depending on the zzso zzso certain of these hybrids exhibited up to zzso higher zzso zzso zzso affinity than the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso 248 zzso (for example, for zzso analogue 50, zzso zzso 6 zzso To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful example of the application of zzso hybrids in the design of zzso zzso zzso These results could provide a foundation for further structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
