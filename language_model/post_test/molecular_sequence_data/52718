zzso zzso were originally identified because of their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can also target other proteins such as zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso We asked whether the zzso zzso protein zzso could zzso proteins not directly involved in zzso A large panel of zzso involved in a variety of cellular zzso were tested as zzso for zzso zzso This screen identified two proteins involved in nuclear import, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as targets for zzso The zzso site within zzso was mapped to a single zzso zzso By comparing the context of zzso with the sequences of other known zzso of zzso and the closely related zzso zzso we identified zzso (in the zzso zzso acid zzso as a consensus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso as well as the zzso severely impaired zzso zzso supporting the view that zzso is part of a recognition motif for zzso by zzso Using an zzso raised against an zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso was zzso at zzso in zzso and that zzso or zzso could mediate this zzso zzso lies within the binding site for a second nuclear import factor, zzso zzso of zzso promoted interaction with zzso in zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso is not unique to proteins involved in zzso zzso may regulate a variety of biological zzso including nuclear zzso
