Using the zzso trap approach we have searched for genes with important functions in zzso We selected a line of flies with a P zzso carrying the zzso coli zzso Z zzso which showed zzso expression in the nurse cell zzso during zzso zzso the P zzso we discovered a cluster of zzso units with enriched expression in the zzso One of these encodes a protein with extensive sequence similarity to the human and zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso Analysis of a fusion protein including the putative zzso zzso terminal zzso indicated that this protein does have the appropriate zzso activity, and the gene was assigned the name zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso The expression of this gene is enriched in the nurse cells and transcripts are transported to the zzso zzso are abundant for the first few hours of zzso The transcripts are found to be enriched on the zzso side of the zzso and nurse zzso Rather little is known about the zzso zzso in zzso and the discovery of this gene enables us to make predictions as to the roles it may play during early zzso
