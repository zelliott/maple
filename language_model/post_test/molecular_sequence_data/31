zzso zzso are involved in many aspects of plant development, including shoot growth, flowering and wood zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso are known to induce zzso and zzso fiber zzso in zzso However, there is currently little information on the response zzso that mediate zzso effects on wood zzso Here we characterize an important element of the zzso zzso in hybrid zzso the zzso zzso zzso Four zzso of zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These were functional when expressed in zzso zzso and appear to present a degree of zzso in hybrid zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in independent lines of hybrid zzso using either the zzso promoter or a zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso shared several zzso traits previously described in zzso zzso including rapid growth, increased zzso and increased zzso However, their zzso fibers were not zzso unlike those of zzso zzso Similar differences in the zzso fiber zzso were observed when zzso zzso or zzso were expressed under the control of the zzso promoter, suggesting either that zzso and zzso play no role in fiber zzso or that zzso zzso is strongly controlled when zzso signaling is zzso Our data suggest that zzso are required in two distinct zzso processes that have zzso signaling zzso zzso as zzso by zzso signaling in the zzso and fiber zzso in the developing zzso
