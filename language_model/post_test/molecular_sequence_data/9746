zzso zzso also known as zzso or zzso is an independently expressed protein product derived from a gene within the gene for zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso smooth muscle zzso filaments and zzso them against zzso zzso in zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding to myosin, suggesting that both proteins bind to zzso by the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated which regions of zzso and zzso interact in zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that zzso binds to zzso zzso with a zzso of 1 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and an affinity of zzso zzso zzso slows the rate of zzso zzso of the zzso junction of heavy zzso by zzso and zzso suggesting it is binding to this region of zzso In addition, competition experiments, using soluble zzso fragments of zzso myosin, confirmed that zzso interacts with the regulatory light chain binding region of zzso The regions important for zzso binding to zzso were investigated using zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso We determined that the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso of zzso is required for high affinity zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso interact with zzso All zzso zzso at zzso comparable to their zzso values, exhibited some stabilization of zzso filaments against zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso ability to stabilize zzso filaments is commensurate with its zzso binding zzso zzso weakened the zzso but not the zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso demonstrating that bound zzso does not prevent zzso from zzso zzso
