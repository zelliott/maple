Twenty six zzso zzso resistant bacterial strains were isolated from As contaminated zzso soil of West zzso zzso Among them, 10 zzso exhibited higher As resistance capacity and could grow in concentration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and 2000 zzso zzso of zzso zzso in growing zzso zzso growth was observed at 1000 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso in case of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of incubation study carried out in zzso salt minimal media zzso containing 25 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso separately showed that the zzso could accumulate zzso - zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso - zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso The bacterial isolate zzso showed highest As accumulating capacity both for zzso zzso and zzso zzso under laboratory zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed highest sequence similarity zzso with zzso zzso and could be used as a potential zzso in future to combat with zzso zzso
