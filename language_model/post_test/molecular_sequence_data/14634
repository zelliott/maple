zzso systems for zzso cell isolation have emerged as a promising approach for the isolation of specific cells from complex zzso zzso circulating tumor cells in whole zzso However, these technologies remain limited by the lack of reliable methods for the innocuous recovery of surface captured zzso Here, we present a zzso zzso zzso coating for zzso chips that enables the highly efficient release of isolated cells zzso zzso zzso following gel zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso system is stable in a wide variety of zzso solutions (including zzso treated whole zzso and may be rapidly zzso via backbone zzso with zzso zzso The capture and release of zzso expressing cancer cells using this approach was found to have no significant effect on cell viability or zzso potential, and recovered cells were demonstrated to be compatible with downstream zzso and FISH zzso
