zzso of the zzso growth hormone zzso gene is zzso and controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso protection experiments allowed us to identify four zzso binding sites in the zzso - zzso + 19 zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the - zzso 19 region, containing two zzso sites, or four copies of the most zzso site zzso fused to the zzso zzso promoter, zzso high level expression in rat zzso cells and direct zzso in zzso cells only after expression of rat zzso We show that a zzso zzso factor specifically binds to site zzso and obtained a partial zzso sequence coding for zzso zzso The zzso stimulation is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 31) promoter zzso It is zzso and requires the zzso zzso In addition, four copies of this site zzso zzso zzso to the zzso promoter in zzso zzso
