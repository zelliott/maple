A novel zzso domain, named the zzso zzso was recently identified by a zzso zzso The zzso ACT domain is the zzso regulatory domain of zzso zzso zzso which folds with a zzso zzso zzso A pair of ACT zzso form an zzso zzso sheet with two molecules of the zzso inhibitor zzso bound in the zzso The ACT domain is found in a variety of contexts and is proposed to be a zzso regulatory zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso has a regulatory domain with a similar fold, but different zzso zzso zzso ACT zzso in some proteins of unknown structure zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso may also fold like the zzso regulatory zzso The regulatory domain of zzso zzso although not a member of the ACT sequence family, is similar in structure to the paired zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso can create zzso zzso sites with the potential for complex regulatory zzso The structures and mechanisms of such systems have only begun to be zzso
