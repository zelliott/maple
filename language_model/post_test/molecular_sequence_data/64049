zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso toxic zzso of ecological and economic zzso Here, we report the results of sequencing and analyzing the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso that zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is related to zzso zzso but does not belong within any currently defined virus zzso This is based on the zzso organization and sequence comparisons of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso sequence predicts a single open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso that contains zzso zzso protein zzso with putative zzso protein zzso present in the zzso and the structural proteins in the zzso of the zzso We have analyzed and compared the virus structural proteins from infectious and zzso zzso In this way, we identified structural protein zzso sites as well as protein processing events that are presumably important for maturation of virus zzso The combination of zzso structure and sequence relationships to other viruses suggests that zzso is the first member of a proposed new virus family zzso related to zzso zzso
