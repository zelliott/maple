Only one bovine zzso corresponding to the human cluster of genes zzso was found by Southern zzso zzso The zzso bovine zzso shares zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identities with human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As revealed by protein sequence zzso potential sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso the bovine zzso is an intermediate between zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso into zzso cells, the bovine gene induced the synthesis of an zzso zzso zzso with type 2 zzso zzso pattern specificity and induced expression of zzso type 2 zzso zzso and zzso but not of type 1 structures zzso or zzso suggesting that it has an zzso specificity similar to the human plasma zzso However, no zzso activity was detected in bovine zzso Gene transcripts are detected on zzso such as bovine liver, zzso zzso and zzso The type 2 zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and Lex and zzso zzso were detected on the brush border of zzso cells of small and large zzso suggesting a tissue distribution closer to human zzso but zzso type 1 structures zzso zzso or zzso were not detected at all in any bovine zzso Analysis of genetic distances on a combined zzso tree of zzso genes suggests that the bovine gene is the zzso zzso of the zzso of human genes zzso the present zzso zzso
