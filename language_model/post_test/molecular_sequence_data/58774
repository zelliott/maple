zzso zzso is a key zzso in zzso metabolism that zzso the second reaction specific for zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to produce zzso To obtain insight into the zzso properties of the plant zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was used to construct an zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso was isolated at high yield (29 zzso of pure zzso of cell zzso using an efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso were similar to those previously reported for the bacterial zzso In particular, the native zzso protein is a zzso composed of four identical zzso of 46 zzso each being associated with one zzso of zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso is extremely tight, being characterized by a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso established that Schiff base formation between the zzso and the zzso occurs at zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso zzso resembles that of the zzso isolated from other sources, zzso and zzso being the most effective zzso The zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is accompanied by dramatic modification of the spectral properties of the zzso that can be attributed to the attack of the zzso linkage between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso by zzso
