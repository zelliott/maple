zzso belonging to zzso family of DNA dependent zzso are important members of the zzso zzso complexes that are implicated in zzso control of gene zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex, is the most recently described member of the zzso zzso Outside the zzso zzso domain, it has very little similarity with other zzso zzso proteins hence it is believed to represent a new zzso We have identified new members of this zzso in different organisms and have detected characteristic features of this zzso Using various data mining tools we have identified a new, previously zzso domain in all members of this zzso This domain designated zzso is characteristic of the zzso zzso and is predicted to have zzso zzso The presence of this domain in all the zzso zzso proteins from different organisms suggests its zzso function in zzso
