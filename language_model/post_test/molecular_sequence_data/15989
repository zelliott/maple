The zzso zzso fetal rat zzso line grown at the zzso temperature (40 degrees C, normal zzso produces authentic rat zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso by a zzso zzso These cells also produce low levels of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso when grown at the zzso temperature zzso degrees C, transformed zzso zzso translation demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso lacks sequences present in the first seven zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso share common sequences extending from the beginning of the eighth zzso zzso to zzso 873 of the fetal zzso zzso to the 3' zzso zzso extension analysis suggests that the zzso zzso contains additional sequences zzso to the common regions shared by both zzso zzso We have previously shown that adult rat liver produces a zzso zzso zzso we now report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso from an adult rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and sequence analysis of zzso confirm that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso share similar sequences at the 3' region zzso zzso zzso However, zzso contains an additional 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence which is located in the seventh zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
