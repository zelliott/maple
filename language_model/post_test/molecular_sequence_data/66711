An zzso zzso gene named zzso involved in basic zzso and zzso mechanisms was cloned from zzso zzso The deduced translation product has similar characteristics to zzso from other species, such as zzso and rice, in terms of zzso The zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso hypersensitivity and demonstrated the function of zzso as an zzso zzso tobacco zzso zzso had zzso greater dry weight than zzso tobacco at 300 zzso zzso and higher viability of zzso zzso under salt shock stress zzso zzso and zzso another zzso from zzso were zzso expressed separately in both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The salt tolerance of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and transgenic tobacco were improved to almost the same zzso The zzso transgenic tobacco lines zzso and zzso with the highest zzso zzso activity were studied zzso These transgenic tobacco plants accumulated zzso more zzso than zzso plants without zzso stress and zzso more zzso under salt stress zzso Although transgenic tobacco lines zzso and zzso accumulated more zzso in leaf zzso the zzso content and cell membrane damage were less than those of the wild type under salt stress zzso Presumably, zzso of zzso in zzso reduces its toxic effects on plant zzso This result supports the hypothesis that zzso of zzso causes the zzso of zzso in zzso instead of in the zzso and avoids the toxicity of excessive zzso in plant zzso
