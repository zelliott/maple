Recently a zzso part of zzso zzso from zzso type 1 zzso was reported to bind to the zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso with an zzso value of 180 zzso This zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso A replacement of zzso with Ala in the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso results in the prevention of the packaging of zzso into zzso We found only two zzso of this zzso among 16 possible expected zzso zzso to zzso zzso of four zzso zzso Although this finding implicates the existence of a stabilizing structure, we were not able to detect secondary structure formation by zzso and CD zzso We characterized the zzso as a zzso for zzso by two-dimensional exchange zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found similar binding characteristics for a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso to Ala zzso
