zzso deposits in the zzso of zzso occur in association with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso in humans and cats and consist of a zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to find an explanation for the situation that zzso zzso zzso does not develop in common zzso species, we have deduced the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso in zzso rat and zzso We find that a specific region of the zzso zzso to a high zzso zzso peptides corresponding to this region of human and zzso zzso were compared for their ability to form zzso zzso in zzso Whereas the human zzso readily formed zzso with zzso character, the zzso zzso completely lacked this zzso We suggest this to be a likely explanation for the differences in zzso formation between humans and zzso and discuss our findings in relation to the type 2 zzso zzso
