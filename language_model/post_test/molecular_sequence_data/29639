zzso is a zzso protein that recently was isolated from zzso zzso zzso In this work, the cloning and expression of the zzso zzso for zzso is zzso From the zzso the zzso sequence was zzso which correlated with the primary sequence data obtained by zzso sequencing on the native zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso the first 26 of which act as a leader signal while the 29 zzso zzso acids are zzso during processing of the zzso The mature protein consists of 250 zzso zzso Using the zzso sequence zzso the mature protein of 250 zzso zzso a zzso protein was zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso had similar activity in a zzso protein synthesis zzso and had comparable toxicity on living cells as compared to the isolated native zzso
