A zzso starch zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by its ability to zzso and zzso starch zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso 51, zzso was also found to possess activity towards raw zzso zzso of these activities in the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso supported by zzso zzso studies and the isolation of zzso based on zzso screens for the zzso of particular zzso forms revealed the zzso starch zzso zzso as their zzso zzso sequence analysis further revealed that the zzso zzso was the zzso product of the precursor zzso zzso cross zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso raised against the precursor zzso but not with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggested that this zzso activity is represented by the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso protein showed similarity to the reported zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso described these proteins as products of the zzso zzso Identification of only the precursor starch zzso zzso in the protein extracts of zzso zzso suggested zzso processing in the cellular zzso space as the cause for the zzso of multiple forms of zzso by zzso zzso
