zzso are able to form stable zzso zzso with diverse zzso To extend our understanding of adaptations imposed by plant zzso two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso zzso were used for comparative protein expression profiling of a zzso zzso dwelling in leaf cavities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein identification using zzso mass zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight zzso tandem zzso zzso and sequence zzso searches resulted in an identification success rate of zzso of proteins zzso in the zzso zzso Compared with a zzso strain, processes related to energy production, nitrogen and carbon zzso and stress-related functions were zzso in the zzso while photosynthesis and zzso turnover rates were zzso stressing a slow zzso mode of growth, as well as high zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first molecular data set on the nature of the zzso zzso modification in zzso was also zzso zzso mass zzso of the protein demonstrated the presence of a zzso Da protein modification localized to a specific 13 zzso acid zzso within the part of the protein that is zzso in other bacteria and close to the active site of zzso Furthermore, the distribution of the highest scoring database hits for the identified proteins points to the possibility of using zzso data in zzso
