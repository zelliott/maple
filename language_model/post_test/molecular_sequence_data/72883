The protein that activates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox, was zzso Native Cox consists of four zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso to zzso the apparent zzso constant was 8 zzso zzso suggesting that under reaction conditions Cox is largely zzso Cox binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus motif zzso one Cox zzso binds to each zzso Cox binding zzso with the interaction of zzso zzso with one of its binding sites, zzso This competition is central to directional control, as shown by studies on zzso zzso Both Cox binding sites were necessary for Cox to fully inhibit integration and activate zzso although Cox continued to affect zzso when the single binding site zzso to zzso remained zzso zzso the zzso site completely prevented integration but greatly enhanced zzso zzso zzso continued to require Cox even when zzso was zzso Cox must therefore play a positive role in assembling the zzso complexes producing zzso zzso by inducing the formation of a critical zzso in those zzso
