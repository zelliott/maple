Triple zzso zzso zzso influenza viruses cause varying degrees of loss in egg production in breeder zzso In this study we characterized zzso zzso viruses isolated from three breeder turkey farms diagnosed with a drop in egg zzso The eight gene segments of the virus isolated from the first case submission zzso were all of zzso zzso zzso However, viruses from the two subsequent case zzso zzso and zzso were unique zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene segments from 2009 pandemic zzso and the remaining gene segments from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes placed the 3 virus zzso in 2 separate zzso within cluster IV of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the latter two affected farms had been vaccinated with a zzso oil emulsion vaccine prior to the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso vaccine strain had only a predicted zzso acid identity of zzso with the isolate from zzso and zzso for the zzso from zzso and zzso By comparison, the predicted zzso acid sequence identity between a zzso zzso zzso cluster IV virus zzso and the three turkey zzso from this study was zzso while the identity between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso When the previously identified zzso sites A, B, C, D and E of zzso were zzso zzso from zzso and zzso had a total of 19 and 16 zzso acid zzso respectively when compared with the zzso vaccine zzso These changes corresponded with the failure of the zzso collected from zzso that received this vaccine to neutralize any of the above three zzso in zzso
