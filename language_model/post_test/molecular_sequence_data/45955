zzso is a zzso zzso we originally identified as a zzso zzso expressed by mouse zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso revealed that zzso is indeed on the surface of some zzso zzso 8- zzso and zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso is the functional zzso of human zzso zzso a zzso that both enhances T cell responses and zzso zzso zzso We assessed if zzso and zzso exhibit functional zzso zzso is zzso upon zzso but unlike zzso incubation with zzso and zzso did not enhance zzso zzso indicating differences in gene zzso Like zzso zzso bound zzso zzso However, we could detect no role for zzso in T zzso interactions and the protein did not bind to pathogens known to interact with zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso particles bearing the zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso was not rescued when zzso was engineered to express the stalk region of zzso We conclude that there are significant differences in the fine specificity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and that these two molecules may not be functional zzso
