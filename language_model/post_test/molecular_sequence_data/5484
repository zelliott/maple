zzso is a novel zinc zzso zzso factor that binds to the zzso and zzso collagen gene zzso The gene coding for zzso is a new member of a family of early growth response zzso that play important roles in zzso In the zzso zzso is zzso beginning at zzso days of gestation and at zzso days in regions destined to become zzso In adult animals, expression is predominantly in skin, one of the two major zzso where type I collagen is zzso We have isolated zzso clones for human zzso zzso translation of the zzso acid sequence reveals zzso conservation of zzso acids between the mouse and human zzso however, the human gene product contains a zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso DNA binding zzso of mouse and human zzso are zzso zzso analysis of human zzso indicates zzso low-level expression of zzso which can be zzso elevated by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, and zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that zzso binds to both the human and zzso promoter zzso zzso derivatives of zzso demonstrate zzso potential that is zzso zzso cells permanently expressing zzso demonstrate a zzso and zzso decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, respectively, compared to control zzso zzso with this finding, a zzso promoter reporter construct is zzso more than zzso by zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso collagen zzso directly, and it may function as a zzso of zzso and possibly other zzso zzso
