zzso structural stability and biological functionality are dictated by the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the intricate zzso zzso in the packing of protein zzso and zzso remain difficult to zzso due to the zzso of enumerating all packing possibilities and assessing the consequences of all the zzso In this work, groups of zzso strand zzso of model zzso variable zzso were zzso with saturated zzso and the functional zzso were selected for zzso sequencing and zzso zzso stability zzso The results show that the sequence preferences of the zzso zzso core zzso are zzso flexible among zzso zzso zzso that these zzso are coupled indirectly with zzso binding through energetic stabilization of the protein zzso By contrast, the zzso interface zzso are directly coupled with zzso zzso The zzso interface should be treated as an integral part of the zzso zzso
