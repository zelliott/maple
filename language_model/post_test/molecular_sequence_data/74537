zzso zzso proteins zzso are receptors that play an important role in bacterial zzso zzso of zzso the zzso that mediates zzso towards zzso in zzso coli, is thought to be facilitated by binding of the zzso to a flexible zzso region at the zzso end of zzso This study zzso natural length zzso of the zzso that occur in zzso coli due to genetic instability in tandem repeat DNA sequences that code for zzso zzso zzso creating zzso sequences of variable lengths in the zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso codes for zzso at the beginning of its 35 zzso zzso zzso The zzso varies in length from 35 to 47 zzso among zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among previous zzso zzso and zzso mostly have zzso and zzso zzso and one strain zzso coli zzso has zzso In zzso coli isolated from 50 humans and 75 animals zzso zzso horses, birds, zzso zzso up to zzso (44 zzso zzso were identified (6 zzso relative zzso were zzso ( approximately 77 % of the total) zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso coli strains with zzso or zzso largely fell within two zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different among zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was comparable to zzso in the frequently studied K-12 zzso These results are consistent with models indicating that zzso sequences from zzso to zzso are flexible, and that longer zzso within this range, would not change the precision of adaptation zzso by zzso Studies of this naturally variable zzso region in zzso coli may also have relevance to mechanisms that mediate zzso instability in human genetic zzso
