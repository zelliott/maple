zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso proteins zzso of immune recognition zzso and zzso that zzso cell surface molecules zzso zzso and zzso involved in the immune recognition of infected zzso This zzso results from enhanced zzso and subsequent zzso degradation of the target zzso Here, we show that expression of zzso and zzso leads to zzso of the zzso tail of their target proteins and that zzso is essential for their removal from the cell zzso zzso and zzso both contain zzso zinc fingers of the zzso zzso and these structures are required for this zzso In zzso addition of a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein to zzso E1 and zzso zzso leads to transfer of zzso zzso to zzso targets in an zzso and zzso zzso this reaction is abolished by zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso defines a novel class of zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the trafficking of host cell membrane zzso
