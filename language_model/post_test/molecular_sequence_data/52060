Two new human zzso cell lines from sporadic zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso are zzso Both cell lines have extended growth capacities in zzso reaching passages 38 and 40 respectively and show no sign of zzso zzso and zzso cell lines have retained the ability to differentiate in zzso as shown by zzso production from zzso zzso zzso was derived from a large zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 to 4 zzso whereas zzso was derived from a small zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and may represent a relatively zzso zzso The parent zzso cell line has given rise to a zzso zzso designated zzso which also has shown no sign of zzso and has currently reached passage zzso Both the zzso and the zzso cell lines had zzso in zzso 12 of the zzso zzso while retaining one normal zzso The presence of this zzso particularly in the cell line zzso derived from a small zzso is consistent with zzso zzso being a relatively early event in zzso zzso and is perhaps involved in the ability of the zzso cells to progress and to give rise to an zzso cell line in zzso The zzso derivatives of the zzso cells have an zzso zzso and abnormalities of zzso 13 which include an zzso zzso The zzso cells have a deletion on the short arm of zzso 1 and zzso zzso The common zzso for zzso and zzso cells involves zzso zzso The involvement of different zzso in the 2 cell lines also suggests different pathways for zzso progression of the zzso zzso zzso
