zzso green algae have developed a visual system, the zzso apparatus, which allows the cell to zzso In a recent zzso approach, we identified 202 proteins from a fraction enriched in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Among these zzso five protein zzso and two protein zzso were present, indicating that zzso protein zzso occurs in the zzso About 20 major zzso bands were detected in zzso of zzso proteins with an zzso zzso Toward the profiling of the targets of protein zzso in the zzso zzso we analyzed its zzso The zzso proteins of the zzso fraction were treated with the zzso zzso and zzso prior to enrichment of zzso with immobilized zzso affinity zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso We were able to identify 68 different zzso along with 52 precise in zzso zzso sites corresponding to 32 known proteins of the zzso zzso Among the identified zzso are zzso of zzso and fatty acid zzso putative signaling zzso such as a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and an unusual protein zzso but also several proteins with unknown zzso zzso two unique zzso zzso and zzso contain three and one zzso sites, zzso zzso of both zzso occurs in the zzso loop next to their seven zzso regions in a similar distance to that observed in zzso zzso zzso functional importance for regulation of these directly zzso zzso channels relevant for the zzso of zzso zzso
