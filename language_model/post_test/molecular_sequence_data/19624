zzso and zzso zzso zzso are DNA end processing factors that are recruited into the DNA zzso and zzso break repair machinery through zzso interactions with zzso and zzso zzso These interactions are zzso through a divergent class of zzso zzso domain that binds to zzso sequences in zzso and zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso 2 zzso Here, we identify the product of the zzso open reading frame zzso as a novel member of this zzso domain family of proteins and we zzso this protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso in a manner that is zzso by zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso also interacts with the zzso break repair proteins zzso and zzso zzso We also show that zzso and yellow fluorescent zzso zzso accumulates at sites of zzso or UVA zzso zzso DNA damage and that this is achieved through at least two zzso one that requires the zzso zzso interaction with zzso and a second that is independent of zzso but requires a novel type of zinc finger motif located at the C zzso of zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso in a DNA zzso and zzso manner and that the depletion of zzso from zzso human zzso zzso cells reduces rates of zzso DNA strand break repair following zzso zzso These data identify zzso as a novel component of the cellular response to DNA strand breaks in human zzso
