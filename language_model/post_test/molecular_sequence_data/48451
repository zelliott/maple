zzso zzso factors associate with zzso zzso II and aid its zzso through zzso One such factor is the zzso zzso complex zzso which regulates gene expression through several mechanisms, including the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies revealed a prominent role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso II zzso zzso Here, we investigated the mechanism by which zzso couples zzso to active zzso We show that a highly zzso domain of zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso a physical interaction between zzso and the essential zzso zzso factor zzso zzso that alter this zzso domain or delete the zzso zzso repeat domain zzso disrupt the interaction between zzso and zzso and release zzso from zzso When expressed in cells as the only source of zzso the zzso domain of zzso can associate independently with active genes in a pattern similar to that of full-length zzso and in a manner dependent on the zzso zzso In zzso experiments indicate that the interaction between the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso is zzso zzso our results provide molecular insight into a key attachment point between zzso and the zzso zzso II zzso zzso
