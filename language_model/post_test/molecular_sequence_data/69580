The zzso zzso and zzso genes code for zzso linked proteins zzso or zzso beta and zzso or zzso zzso zzso associated with membrane zzso in the zzso zzso complex on B zzso We have functionally analyzed the upstream region of the zzso gene and have identified a zzso region which comprises the minimal promoter responsible for zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso of this minimal promoter has established that both the previously identified zzso motif and a DNA motif that binds an unknown protein factor are critical for zzso gene expression in a zzso and zzso zzso Further zzso showed that binding motifs for zzso zzso and zzso also significantly contributed to the overall activity of the minimal zzso zzso However, the relative contribution of certain motifs to promoter activity was different in a zzso versus a zzso zzso The zzso motif was necessary for full promoter activity in the zzso cells but was not required in the B zzso
