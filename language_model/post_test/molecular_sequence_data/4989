zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso zzso We cloned and zzso zzso and found that it is identical to zzso This gene is required for growth at high temperature, viability in the absence of zzso polarization of the cortical zzso zzso and zzso We used a zzso analysis of zzso to correlate in zzso functions with regions of zzso and we found that two regions of zzso participate in zzso but that the zzso domain of zzso is zzso The zzso domain of zzso is required for growth at high temperature, zzso and zzso zzso A central zzso domain of zzso is necessary for formation of a soluble zzso zzso Furthermore, this domain has an zzso function that is redundant with the zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso function of zzso depends on its zzso zzso In addition we have isolated a zzso negative zzso of zzso that is defective for zzso Combined zzso functional, and genetic analysis lead us to propose that zzso may mediate zzso through interaction with other zzso zzso perhaps zzso a protein essential for zzso
