zzso is a highly zzso zzso degradation product formed from zzso zzso during zzso zzso forms stable zzso primarily with zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso role of this zzso modification in regulating cell function is not zzso Here, we report that in retinal zzso cells, increased zzso flux causes increased zzso modification of the zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso results in increased recruitment of zzso zzso to an zzso complex, with zzso increased modification of zzso by zzso zzso This modification of zzso causes decreased binding of the zzso complex to a zzso zzso box in the zzso promoter, resulting in increased zzso zzso A similar mechanism involving zzso of other zzso proteins may play a role in the zzso of a variety of conditions associated with changes in zzso zzso including cancer and diabetic vascular zzso
