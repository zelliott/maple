Two genes which zzso the zzso lycopene zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso have been cloned and zzso The gene for lycopene zzso designated zzso was expressed in a strain of zzso coli which contained the zzso B, I and Z genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a result, zzso production was observed in zzso coli zzso In addition, expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso in zzso coli containing zzso and B resulted in the zzso of lycopene in zzso zzso and lycopene were also determined by mass zzso zzso sequence similarities between zzso zzso zzso gene and other microbial lycopene zzso genes are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and those between zzso zzso genes are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
