The diversity of zzso associated with zzso rumen zzso zzso zzso in long term in zzso culture was investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accomplished directly from DNA extracted from a single zzso cell and from total community zzso DNA and the obtained fingerprints were zzso The analysis indicated the presence of a solitary intensive band present in zzso zzso single cell DNA, which had no counterparts in the profile from total zzso The identity of zzso represented by this band was determined by sequence analysis which showed that the sequence fell to the cluster of zzso symbiotic zzso identified recently by zzso gene library zzso
