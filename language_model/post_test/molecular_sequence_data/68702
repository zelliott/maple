The zzso zzso zzso for the assembly of the zzso and zzso genes is zzso by the zzso signal sequences zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso expression library made from mouse zzso zzso zzso using the zzso as a zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso designated zzso component zzso reveals a pair of zzso zinc fingers followed by a zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, there are five copies of the zzso zzso which are putative DNA binding zzso The zinc zzso domain structures present in zzso are also found in several zzso binding zzso such as those for the zzso B motif of the zzso zzso light chain zzso or related zzso zzso fusion proteins for zzso bind zzso to the zzso zzso and to the zzso B zzso The dual affinities of zzso for the zzso zzso and the zzso B motif suggest a possible link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The formation of multiple zzso zzso complexes for zzso and its DNA zzso suggests that these complexes tend to zzso
