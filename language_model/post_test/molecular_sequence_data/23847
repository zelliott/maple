It has been speculated that zzso zzso zzso in zzso is a consequence of DNA zzso However, this hypothesis does not adequately explain zzso zzso in zzso The hypothesis based on DNA structure constraint as an alternative explanation was therefore zzso 

By comparing real bacterial zzso and zzso artificial zzso in the second order, we found that the core structure of a restricted pattern, the zzso pattern, was under represented in low zzso content bacterial zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso This is in contrast to the zzso pattern, indicating that the zzso is zzso Further study discovered nine underrepresented patterns that were supposed to be capable of inducing DNA structure zzso In zzso most of them are in zzso and zzso patterns in both DNA zzso An explanation is also proposed for the strong correlation between zzso content and zzso zzso The result of random sequence simulation showed that the zzso of these patterns were correlated with zzso content, as well as the percentage of zzso zzso being trapped in these zzso Finally, we suggest that the degree of zzso against these restricted patterns could be influenced by global zzso content of a zzso
