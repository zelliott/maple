zzso release is thought to occur under the zzso regulation of two zzso zzso zzso releasing hormone zzso and zzso via their engagement with specific cell surface receptors on the anterior zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso such as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso release through their zzso of a distinct zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The recent cloning of the zzso from human and zzso zzso zzso identifies yet a third G zzso zzso zzso involved in the control of zzso release and further supports the existence of an undiscovered hormone that may activate this zzso Using the human zzso as a probe, we report the isolation of a rat zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso precursor zzso The rat zzso encodes a protein of 364 zzso acids containing seven zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence identity to both the human and zzso zzso A single zzso of approximately 2 zzso divides the open reading frame into two zzso zzso TM zzso and TM 6-7, thus placing the zzso into the zzso class of zzso The zzso maps to the site of sequence divergence between the human and zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, determination of the zzso sequence for the human zzso gene confirmed the position of an zzso in the human zzso gene at this zzso A full-length zzso zzso from rat zzso was isolated and shown to be identical in its zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence to the rat zzso zzso The cloned rat zzso binds zzso with high affinity zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso and is functionally active when expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso was observed specifically in the zzso and zzso when compared with control zzso
