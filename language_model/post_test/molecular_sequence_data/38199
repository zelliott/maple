The human zzso gene encodes the ubiquitous zzso of zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is located in a zzso island on zzso zzso We compared the zzso gene with the published zzso and several zzso and concluded that zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso as are other zzso zzso The same zzso start sites were identified by primer extension analysis of human brain and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter revealed several zzso sequence elements found in other zzso zzso namely binding sites for nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso nuclear respiratory factor zzso binding protein zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso These zzso elements were shown to bind nuclear proteins from zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a human brain zzso library, and the sequence was identical to that of human zzso The expression of this gene was demonstrated by zzso zzso in monkey brain sections with our human brain zzso zzso impulse blockade in adult monkeys induced a zzso of zzso expression in deprived visual zzso suggesting that this zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso
