Two major infectious forms of zzso virus zzso have been zzso the zzso mature zzso zzso and the zzso enveloped zzso zzso Due to their stability in the environment, zzso play a zzso role in zzso transmission, whereas zzso play an important role in dissemination within the zzso In a previous report, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were protected from a lethal zzso zzso zzso with a combination of both genes zzso greater protection than either gene alone, suggesting that an immune response against both zzso and zzso is zzso Here, we report that in mice individually administered DNA vaccines with two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso failed to significantly zzso however, vaccination with a combination of both genes zzso a high level of zzso Mice were completely protected when vaccinated with a combination of four zzso genes zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso vaccinated with this zzso developed appropriate zzso responses to each zzso zzso responses zzso by this vaccine zzso with zzso virus zzso zzso These data indicate that a zzso vaccine comprised of the zzso zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso genes may be a useful candidate to protect against other zzso including those that cause zzso and zzso
