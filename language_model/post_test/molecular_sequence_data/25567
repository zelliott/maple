zzso arising zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso strain deficient for DNA zzso I were zzso at the DNA sequence zzso We screened approximately 150,000 colonies and isolated 106 zzso zzso Of these, 98 were unstable zzso zzso 12 representative zzso zzso were shown to have arisen by the zzso of a single zzso repeat in the sequence zzso Of the eight zzso at other sites, three zzso deletions and one zzso deletion occurred as a consequence of zzso of zzso repeated zzso zzso or zzso zzso A single zzso point zzso was found to be a zzso zzso Two extended zzso covering the his zzso were not zzso We could not identify the zzso deletion by zzso We conclude that zzso is a strong zzso that zzso zzso mostly of the minus zzso and deletion type by a zzso of zzso in repetitive DNA zzso Finally, the possible role of a zzso sequence and its zzso or direct zzso which are found in the vicinity of all the deletions and zzso is zzso
