The zzso pathogen zzso zzso produces a family of antibiotics and zzso termed zzso which inhibit plant and bacterial DNA zzso zzso activity, with a 50% zzso concentration zzso zzso comparable to those of zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso has an unusual, zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are not clustered with previously described zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso products differ from zzso coli zzso through several insertions and through changes in several zzso acid zzso implicated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso showed zzso to zzso resistance than zzso coli DNA zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso resistance to zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso is unusual in showing a high degree of zzso zzso and little DNA relaxation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a functional zzso zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso and can account for zzso and zzso resistance and low levels of relaxation zzso zzso probably contributes to both zzso resistance and the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso shows fewer apparent changes relative to zzso the zzso hybrid relaxed DNA in the presence or absence of zzso and was unable to zzso A fuller understanding of structural differences between zzso and zzso zzso may provide new clues into features of the zzso amenable to interference by novel zzso
