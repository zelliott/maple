We have produced transgenic mice that carry a foreign gene construct consisting of the zzso zzso driven by the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso long terminal zzso zzso of the normal zzso gene is associated with development of zzso and tumors in a variety of zzso The tumors are clearly zzso as evidenced by the presence of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the foreign zzso gene in these tumors by use of zzso chain reaction and sequencing demonstrates in all cases the absence of zzso acquired zzso at those zzso normally associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, these tumors develop from zzso of the zzso rather than the presence of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso of a zzso of the zzso family can zzso cells in zzso to fully zzso zzso
