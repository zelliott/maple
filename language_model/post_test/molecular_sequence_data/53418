zzso from seven different species of the zzso zzso have been recently isolated and characterized in terms of their zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Santos, zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Brewer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso included those from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of the zzso exhibited specificity for Man and zzso zzso but much higher affinities for the zzso chain zzso zzso which is found in the core region of all zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso is used to determine the binding thermodynamics of the above zzso including a new zzso from zzso zzso to a complete series of zzso zzso of the core zzso From losses in the affinity zzso and zzso of binding of certain zzso zzso assignments are made of the zzso zzso on the zzso that are involved in binding to the zzso The pattern of binding of the zzso zzso is similar for all seven zzso and similar to that of zzso A which is also a member of the zzso zzso However, differences in the magnitude of the zzso binding parameters of the zzso are observed, even though the zzso possess zzso contact zzso in many cases, and highly zzso primary zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso in the zzso even those distant from the binding sites, zzso their zzso binding zzso
