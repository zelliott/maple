zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso have become an important target for the pharmacological zzso One among those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso and zzso zzso The present study provides the molecular insights into the zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso was modeled based on the crystal structure of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulation was performed to identify the zzso stability of zzso with and without its zzso zzso Based on the zzso properties and the zzso scores of zzso from four databases zzso zzso zzso and Technology for Organic zzso zzso zzso for the screening of zzso we identified four potential zzso molecules for zzso From the molecular zzso results, we proposed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are consistently involved in strong zzso interactions and play a vital role in the zzso zzso From the results of molecular dynamics zzso the zzso molecules are found to bind appropriately to the target zzso However, the structure of zzso needs to be determined zzso to confirm zzso
