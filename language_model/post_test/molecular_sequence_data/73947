zzso fragments of a zzso zzso protein were used to isolate the zzso of a related human zzso The zzso encodes a zzso of 312 zzso acid zzso that is zzso to a bacterial zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso in human embryonic kidney cells confirmed that it encodes human zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed a zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso and was inhibited competitively by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that bound to the zzso zzso protein also exerted a potent zzso effect on human zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene were zzso in all human zzso zzso and were particularly abundant in the zzso The gene is localized on zzso zzso and represents a candidate gene for at least one genetic disorder that has been mapped to this region zzso zzso disease type zzso
