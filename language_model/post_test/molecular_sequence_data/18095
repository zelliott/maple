We have characterized three zzso clones corresponding to proteins zzso zzso and zzso which represent the three types of zzso of the wheat zzso inhibitor of insect zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the mature zzso are zzso to those of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso The mature zzso are preceded by typical signal zzso Southern zzso analysis of appropriate zzso using the cloned zzso as zzso has revealed the location of genes for zzso of the zzso and of the zzso type within a few zzso of each other in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and those for the CM 1 type of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Known zzso of the zzso inhibitor corresponding to genes from the B and D zzso have been previously zzso No proteins of this class have been found to be zzso by the A zzso in zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso and no anti zzso activity has been detected in the latter, so that the zzso genes must be either silent zzso or expressed at a much lower zzso
