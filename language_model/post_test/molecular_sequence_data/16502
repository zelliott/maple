Type IV zzso zzso surface zzso primarily composed of a single protein zzso termed zzso play a crucial role in the initiation of disease by a wide range of zzso zzso Although previous electron microscopic studies suggested that zzso might be present on the surface of zzso zzso zzso detailed molecular and zzso analyses of these structures have not been reported to zzso We identified and cloned the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso through which the zzso filament is zzso and zzso the zzso that mediates zzso zzso and zzso To initiate investigation of the role of this surface zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed in zzso zzso strain zzso Comparative analyses of the zzso zzso strain and three zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso expresses type IV zzso that are essential for natural genetic zzso Our studies suggest type IV zzso production by zzso zzso is zzso and zzso although zzso expression was demonstrated to be iron responsive and zzso zzso These data indicate that additional studies aimed at zzso the prevalence and role of type IV zzso in the zzso and host response to zzso zzso infections are zzso
