zzso zzso is the major cause of bacterial zzso in developing zzso zzso zzso is divided into at least 19 zzso the majority of which are modifications of the same basic zzso by zzso and/or zzso of its sugar zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso zzso modification of the zzso has been reported, which is responsible for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and results in conversion of traditional zzso X, zzso and Y to novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we characterized 19 zzso zzso strains isolated in zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene opt (formerly called zzso carried by a zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso which specifies the zzso pattern on the zzso of this zzso For the majority of the zzso units, the zzso modification occurs on zzso while for a minority, modifications occur on both zzso and zzso zzso gene detection and zzso analysis suggested that these zzso zzso zzso were originated from zzso Y, zzso and zzso by acquisition of an zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso gene zzso or zzso These data, combined with those of zzso zzso and zzso reported earlier, demonstrate that the zzso zzso modification is an important zzso conversion mechanism in zzso zzso in addition to zzso and zzso
