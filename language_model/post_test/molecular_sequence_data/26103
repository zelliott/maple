The zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso gene zzso that function in the cell interactions of zzso zzso cells with zzso In this paper, we have characterized the structural features of these zzso The disposition of zzso in the zzso as a type 1 integral membrane protein (with an zzso disposed zzso zzso single zzso segment, and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso protection studies of zzso zzso inserted into zzso in zzso and in zzso studies with site specific zzso A genetically engineered zzso zzso which lacks the putative membrane spanning segment, was constructed and shown to zzso a zzso zzso These results confirm the identify of this zzso sequence as the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein demonstrated the presence of a zzso signal sequence and the site of signal zzso zzso To characterize the zzso linkage pattern of the zzso we zzso zzso with zzso zzso and used a panel of zzso to zzso specific fragments under zzso zzso These studies provide support for a novel zzso linkage between two of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, we report that zzso is zzso zzso via an zzso zzso zzso Based on these studies, we propose a model for the zzso of zzso including its zzso zzso which is considered with regard to its function as a cell zzso zzso
