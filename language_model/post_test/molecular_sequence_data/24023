Eight traditional subspecies of tiger zzso zzso which three recently became zzso are commonly recognized on the basis of geographic isolation and zzso zzso To investigate the zzso evolutionary history and to establish objective methods for subspecies recognition, voucher specimens of blood, skin, hair, and/or skin zzso from zzso zzso with verified geographic origins or heritage across the whole distribution range were examined for three molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso variation in the nuclear major zzso complex class II zzso zzso and zzso composite nuclear zzso zzso based on 30 zzso Relatively low genetic variation with zzso zzso zzso was found, but significant population subdivision was nonetheless apparent among five living zzso In addition, a distinct partition of the zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso in to northern zzso and zzso Peninsula populations was zzso zzso genetic structure would suggest recognition of six zzso units or zzso zzso zzso tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso northern zzso tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso South China tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tiger zzso zzso zzso named for the tiger conservationist Peter zzso zzso zzso tiger zzso zzso zzso and zzso Bengal tiger zzso zzso zzso The proposed South China tiger lineage is tentative due to limited zzso The age of the most recent common zzso for tiger zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso relatively younger than some other zzso zzso A combination of population expansions, reduced gene flow, and genetic drift following the last genetic zzso and the recent anthropogenic range contraction, have led to the distinct genetic zzso These results provide an explicit basis for subspecies recognition and will lead to the improved management and conservation of these recently isolated but distinct geographic populations of zzso
