zzso is a zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso that has zzso the zzso of the human blood fluke, zzso zzso Previous studies have indicated that more than 1000 copies of zzso reside within the zzso zzso zzso although many of them may be zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcribed from zzso copies of zzso were investigated by reverse zzso zzso Overlapping zzso products corresponding to the gag and pol zzso of zzso along with relevant sequences of zzso fragments of zzso were assembled into zzso Consensus sequences from these zzso were used to predict the sequence and structure of zzso active copies of the zzso zzso They verified that zzso has a zzso zzso box motif at the active site of its gag zzso a classic zzso motif as the active site of the zzso domain of the pol zzso and indicated a zzso zzso domain at the zzso of pol with strong identity to zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as to the zzso zzso core domain, zzso zzso zzso Models of the secondary structure of the zzso transcript suggested that the first zzso was zzso by a stem loop structure, which in turn suggested a method of regulation of zzso at the level of translation, of zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis targeting discrete zzso of zzso revealed a generalized radiation in sequences among the multiple copies of zzso resident in the zzso zzso
