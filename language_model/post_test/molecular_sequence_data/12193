This paper describes a zzso zzso study designed to investigate the biological efficacy and safety profile of second-generation zzso for zzso gene transfer into the zzso zzso This second-generation virus is deleted of E1 and contains a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a defective zzso zzso Two distinct projects were zzso Group A animals received a first-generation zzso zzso deleted of zzso in an upper lobe at the time a second-generation virus was instilled into the zzso upper zzso The goal of study A was to compare the biology of each construct directly and to determine if an immune response to the first-generation virus affected the performance of the second-generation zzso Group B animals received a zzso second-generation virus in an upper lobe at the same time the zzso second-generation virus was instilled in the other upper zzso zzso were performed 4 or 21 days after gene transfer and zzso were evaluated for zzso gene expression and zzso Using a second-generation zzso zzso gene stability was prolonged and associated with a diminished level of zzso inflammation as compared to first-generation zzso zzso diminished levels of zzso protein were present in zzso infected with second-generation as compared to first-generation zzso No evidence of viral shedding was zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and second-generation zzso did not affect the stability of zzso expression from the second-generation zzso These data suggest that second-generation zzso zzso provide an improved gene delivery vehicle, and thus may be useful in gene therapy for zzso zzso
