The zzso zzso is one of the most abundant and zzso proteins in zzso It is the primary zzso for the zzso actions of the drug zzso in whose presence zzso binds to and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso The zzso functions of zzso are less clear, although the protein has been demonstrated to zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the type 1 transforming growth factor beta zzso We now report that zzso binds the zzso at zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that structurally resembles zzso We further demonstrate that binding to zzso at this site enables zzso to interact with zzso presumably to anchor the zzso to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso promotes an zzso interaction by mimicking structurally similar zzso zzso present within proteins that use zzso to anchor zzso to the appropriate zzso zzso
