We constructed six new models to analyze the DNA zzso First, we regarded a DNA primary sequence as a random process in zzso and gave three ways to define zzso random distribution zzso We extracted some parameters from the linear model and analyzed the changes of the zzso zzso In order to facilitate the comparison of DNA zzso we proposed two ways to measure their zzso Finally, we compared the six models by analyzing the similarities of the DNA primary sequences presented in Table 1 and selected the optimal zzso
