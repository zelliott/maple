The coat protein gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso was over expressed in zzso coli using zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to self assemble into zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso had an apparent s value of zzso S and a diameter of zzso zzso In order to establish the role of zzso and zzso regions in zzso zzso two zzso deletions clones lacking the first 11 and 26 zzso acid zzso and two zzso deletions lacking the last five and ten zzso acid zzso were constructed and zzso The proteins lacking zzso 11 zzso and 26 zzso zzso acid zzso self assembled into zzso zzso in zzso as evident from electron zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were as stable as the empty zzso formed in zzso and zzso a small amount of zzso The zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso within region 22 to 36, failed to react with zzso zzso while it recognized the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso upon treatment with zzso showed that zzso zzso were most zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso 26 zzso acid zzso are not essential for zzso zzso assembly in zzso In contrast, both the proteins lacking the zzso five and ten zzso acid zzso were present only in the zzso fraction and could not assemble into zzso suggesting that these zzso are crucial for folding and assembly of the zzso
