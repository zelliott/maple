The two zzso zzso and zzso zzso of buffalo zzso have been produced by limited zzso using zzso zzso zzso is a single chain zzso of molecular mass 80 zzso with two zzso sites and two structural zzso connected by a short zzso zzso samples of zzso isolated from buffalo zzso were subjected to zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first three zzso produced two major fragments of approximately 35 and 23 zzso together with small molecular mass zzso zzso and zzso partly zzso zzso while zzso converted all the intact zzso into zzso zzso zzso produced fragments of 40 and 26 zzso together with low molecular mass zzso However, zzso of the zzso K zzso product gave a clear band at 40 zzso together with a band indicating a substantial quantity of low molecular mass peptides zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso this product gave two major zzso which were further zzso by gel zzso and identified as the C and N zzso from their zzso zzso Thus, the 40 zzso band in zzso of the zzso K zzso product contained two fragments of equal molecular zzso On further zzso with zzso K, the N lobe was completely zzso into low molecular mass zzso while only a small fraction of the C lobe was converted into small zzso This suggested that an zzso zzso was present in the C lobe that was released on zzso to small fragments and prevented complete zzso of the C lobe by zzso binding to the active site of zzso zzso This zzso was isolated from the zzso K complex and its sequence determined to be zzso zzso zzso studies indicated a high zzso content in the native zzso while comparatively lower zzso structures were present in the N and C zzso In addition, the iron zzso of the N and C zzso appeared to be lower than that of the native zzso
