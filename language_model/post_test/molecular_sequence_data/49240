The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in which faster growth in seawater zzso and freshwater zzso has been zzso In this study, zzso clones zzso growth hormone zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso were isolated from this species to examine the involvement of the zzso axis in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso predicted from zzso was highly similar to those of other fish species, zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The predicted sequence of zzso was also exhibited high similarity to those of other fishes, zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso and zzso zzso in fish reared in zzso and SW was examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso zzso The major site of zzso zzso expression was the liver while minor signals were detected in various zzso including the zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso The expression level of zzso zzso in the zzso was not different between zzso and zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso in the liver of zzso fish was significantly higher than that of zzso zzso These results suggest the possible involvement of zzso zzso in SW adaptation of this zzso
