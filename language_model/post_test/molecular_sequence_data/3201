zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates zzso programs important for energy zzso We describe here a novel zzso zzso that is expressed in a similar zzso manner as zzso with the highest levels in heart and skeletal zzso In contrast to zzso the new zzso shows high zzso zzso It enhances zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso while having only small effects on other zzso Because of its nuclear zzso zzso we have termed the new protein zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso function of zzso relies on a zzso zzso zzso domain and two zzso motifs that interact with the zzso domain of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso are likely to have different functions in zzso zzso Whereas zzso acts selectively on zzso and not on the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly both zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso show distinct preferences for enhancing zzso in different promoter zzso Finally, zzso enhances the zzso response to the partial zzso zzso while zzso modestly zzso zzso The two zzso are likely to mediate zzso zzso responses to zzso
