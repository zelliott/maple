We determined the zzso sequence of a zzso region of the bovine zzso 1 zzso zzso which contained the complete zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso and zzso open reading frames zzso scaffold proteins upon which viral zzso are zzso The zzso protein is also a zzso and specifically zzso both itself and the zzso zzso The overall zzso zzso acid sequence showed only zzso identity to the zzso sequences and was most divergent in the regions defined to be involved in the scaffolding zzso We zzso the proteins zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso open reading zzso expressed in zzso for the corresponding zzso proteins in an in zzso zzso zzso assembly zzso The proteins expressed from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso facilitated the formation of hybrid type B zzso indistinguishable from those formed entirely with zzso zzso
