zzso cells and the derived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso induced cell death zzso when zzso with zzso zzso Since zzso cells do not express zzso zzso we searched for the molecules that could be zzso by zzso and induce zzso in this cell zzso We show here that the zzso linked zzso zzso is expressed at the surface of zzso and zzso cells, and when zzso by specific zzso can induce cell zzso The toxicity of zzso from zzso zzso or zzso cells was prevented by a combination of the blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 and zzso zzso TRAIL zzso zzso However, toxicity of zzso from zzso zzso cells was specifically prevented by the zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso induced zzso also in normal human T cell zzso which zzso toxic molecules into the zzso The toxicity of these zzso on zzso cells was fully prevented by the zzso blocking zzso showing that zzso zzso zzso the preferential release of zzso also in normal T zzso The possible zzso and zzso or pathological consequences of this observation are zzso
