zzso in, and zzso expression of, the zzso tumor zzso gene were assessed in 17 cell lines derived from human zzso brain tumors zzso zzso zzso 5 through 8 were screened by single strand zzso zzso analysis zzso followed by direct DNA zzso zzso were found in 6 of 17 zzso cell lines, zzso at a frequency similar to that found in primary zzso zzso Loss of the wild type zzso was observed in 4 of the zzso cell zzso Two cell lines had the same zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Five of 6 zzso were zzso 4 of which occurred at zzso zzso In one cell line a zzso deletion at the zzso zzso 5 junction was zzso Five of 6 zzso cell lines contained a zzso identical to that in the respective primary tumor despite prolonged in zzso culture zzso zzso Thus, the acquisition of zzso zzso during culture appears to be zzso Two cell lines derived from zzso tumors maintained the wild type zzso zzso during long term zzso zzso protein levels were assessed by zzso zzso and zzso followed by Western zzso analysis and revealed elevated levels of the zzso zzso although to a variable extent, in all cell lines with zzso zzso A marked zzso protein zzso was also observed in two cell lines lacking zzso zzso in zzso 5 through 8, indicating that a prolonged half life of the gene product is not solely dependent on an zzso coding zzso The remaining cell lines had either low levels or no zzso zzso zzso one of the latter contained a gross zzso of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that with respect to zzso gene status, zzso cell lines usually resemble the original tumors and may, therefore, be suitable for studying the biological changes associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso
