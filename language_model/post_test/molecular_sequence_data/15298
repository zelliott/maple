The 3' end of the zzso gene was amplified from 50 zzso of 45 species in zzso The analyses included a representative selection of all families except zzso and zzso zzso analyses excluded three zzso regions at the same relative positions in all species due to sequence and length zzso The zzso gene zzso was similar to the zzso zzso gene zzso at the family and species level, but it was not zzso at the order zzso Species in zzso and zzso grouped together but without statistical zzso zzso sequences in zzso species likely contributed to zzso zzso Trees generated using different zzso zzso as zzso yielded a zzso zzso Family relationships within the zzso did not change regardless if the third zzso position was included or excluded from the zzso Multiple clones from three zzso of zzso zzso yielded divergent zzso However, zzso patterns suggested that only a single copy of the zzso gene was present, with variation attributed to zzso sequence zzso
