Herb zzso have great potential for rehabilitation of semi-arid zzso zzso in zzso zzso as they establish zzso zzso with zzso zzso A zzso analysis was performed for 78 root zzso bacteria associated with the common zzso herb zzso zzso zzso zzso ex DC in zzso Based on ITS zzso and zzso zzso these strains were shown to belong to the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this latter, although zzso formed small and ineffective zzso and suggested a zzso rather than a symbiotic zzso A potential negative effect of zzso on zzso growth was tested for when zzso alone or in association with a zzso zzso zzso zzso were distributed in four zzso Groups A and B were two sister zzso in a larger zzso group also including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cluster D fell in a sister zzso of the zzso zzso zzso group, including zzso whereas group C appeared to be divergent from all known zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso was zzso with ITS and zzso zzso but displayed much more zzso However, within the main zzso zzso no obvious relationship could be detected between zzso and geographical origin of the zzso Each zzso included strains sampled from different zzso zzso zzso strains showed a tendency in the zzso to group together according to the site of zzso The predominance of ineffective zzso strains in the zzso of zzso roots, the large zzso genetic diversity and the geographical genetic diversity pattern are zzso
