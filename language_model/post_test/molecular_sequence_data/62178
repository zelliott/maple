zzso zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a single, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 330 zzso The zzso nature of zzso is unique to zzso and is shared by at least three zzso The zzso contains four zzso regions ranging in size from 39 to zzso zzso The significance of the zzso zzso for activity and zzso interactions of the zzso protein was investigated by a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in the zzso protein diminished the corresponding zzso activity and in some instances also decreased the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso appear to be vital for optimal zzso zzso Similar results have been reported for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taylor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso approximately 150 zzso zzso domain with the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso 180 zzso produced an active hybrid complex of 330 zzso The hinge region is required for zzso complex formation and only indirectly for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso most structured and zzso insert in the zzso domain had the biggest impact on the activities of both zzso zzso zzso arrangement and hybrid complex zzso The remaining large zzso are predicted to be zzso regions located on the surface of these zzso The large insert in zzso in contrast is not implicated in hybrid complex formation even though distinct interactions between this insert and the two zzso are zzso from the effect of its removal on both zzso zzso zzso with essential zzso interactions zzso by zzso regions therefore appears to be a viable strategy to aid the design of selective zzso of zzso metabolism of zzso zzso
