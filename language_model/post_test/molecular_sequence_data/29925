zzso studies have indicated that integration of zzso DNA into the host zzso depends on the presence of the zzso repeats at the free zzso of the long terminal repeats on the zzso DNA and on the product of the 3' end of the pol gene (the zzso zzso zzso While the precise function of the zzso zzso leukemia virus IN protein is uncertain, others have shown that it is a zzso protein and functions in the processing of the zzso repeats prior to zzso By using zzso zzso we cloned and expressed the IN protein in zzso zzso Crude extracts of total cellular protein were zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso transferred to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso linear viral DNA were specifically bound by the IN protein in this zzso These data suggest that the role of the zzso IN protein in the early steps of integration involves zzso recognition of the DNA sequences found at the ends of the long terminal zzso
