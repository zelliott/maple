Severe acute respiratory coronavirus zzso spike zzso zzso fusion core consists of a zzso bundle with the three zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso packed against a central zzso of the other three zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso Each of the three peripheral zzso zzso shows prominent contacts with the zzso surface of the central zzso zzso The concerted zzso interactions among the zzso zzso are responsible for the fusion event that leads to the release of the zzso zzso into the target zzso In this investigation, we applied zzso protein and synthetic zzso zzso zzso to characterize the biological activities of the zzso zzso In a parallel experiment, we employed a zzso zzso virus entry zzso zzso to screen for potent zzso activities on zzso peptides derived from the zzso S protein zzso regions and a series of other zzso zzso Three zzso peptides and five zzso drugs were identified as potential zzso zzso which has been used to interfere with the zzso of zzso onto zzso cells, demonstrated the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso activity among the other zzso zzso zzso modeling analysis suggested that zzso may bind to the deep pocket of the zzso groove on the surface of the central zzso of zzso S zzso protein and prevent the entrance of the zzso into the host zzso
