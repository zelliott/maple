zzso protein zzso is a member of the AAA family zzso which plays various important roles in cells by using its zzso zzso But mechanism of regulating its zzso activity is mostly zzso We report here that zzso is highly modified throughout the protein via zzso and zzso In addition to six previously identified zzso sites, we identified at least 14 zzso 14 zzso 6 zzso and 22 zzso as potential modification zzso Interestingly, these sites included zzso and zzso which are very critical for the zzso binding in Walker A motif of D1 and zzso zzso zzso It is notable that 16 sites are in the zzso region and 16 sites are clustered in zzso domain (from zzso to zzso Indeed, zzso acid substitution of zzso and zzso profoundly affect zzso zzso zzso From these results, we propose that zzso domain acts as a zzso zzso Regulatory domain or zzso zzso zzso modifications including those in this zzso domain may endorse zzso and multiple functions to zzso in different cell conditions such as in the cell cycle and with abnormal protein zzso
