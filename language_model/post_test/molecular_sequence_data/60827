We recently reported that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection zzso by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso effectively zzso replication of zzso zzso including primary zzso but not of zzso zzso By using a panel of zzso viruses between zzso and zzso zzso zzso viral zzso for zzso zzso were mapped to the zzso loop region of zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso with zzso zzso interactions in a competitive zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso suggested that the zzso interacts with the N zzso and two of the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso fusion in cells expressing zzso zzso receptors suggested that zzso for sensitivity of zzso to zzso include the three zzso zzso of the zzso
