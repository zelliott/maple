zzso is reported to be one of the target zzso for zzso in various zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso production, we compared the several properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of mouse zzso which reported to react with zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of rat zzso which we found to be susceptible to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is recognized by zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were similar among both zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas that of zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were similar among zzso zzso but differed from zzso zzso zzso Based on local relative rates of evolution, these zzso zzso were divided into 5 zzso zzso included a faster evolving region, whereas zzso and zzso included a slowly evolving zzso zzso and zzso comprised a slowly evolving patch within a faster evolving zzso In conclusion, although zzso and zzso of zzso have been reported to contribute to zzso responses in animals infected with zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to have a different mechanism for zzso zzso
