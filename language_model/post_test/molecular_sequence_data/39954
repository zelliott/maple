The zzso zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso form a zzso complex that functions in zzso zzso zzso In this process, zzso serves as a zzso by binding to guide zzso and zzso their zzso with zzso zzso zzso To understand the mechanism by which this complex performs zzso zzso we determined structures of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The structures show that zzso is a zzso and, despite little sequence zzso each zzso zzso exhibits the same zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to the highly basic beta sheet surface of the zzso complex via zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso II base is anchored to the basic surface, zzso I (the anchor zzso is unfolded and its bases exposed to zzso Thus, zzso acts as an zzso zzso by stabilizing the zzso zzso in an unfolded zzso suitable for zzso zzso
