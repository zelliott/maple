The zzso intermediate in zzso action has long been considered to be an zzso zzso although precedent from other zzso and theoretical considerations suggest it should be a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso 26 to zzso acid in the active site zzso of zzso T4 zzso zzso produced an zzso that zzso the cell wall of zzso coli but left the product zzso bound to the zzso The zzso complex was zzso with zzso zzso and analysis of its structure showed a zzso linkage between the product and the newly introduced zzso acid zzso The zzso linked sugar ring was substantially zzso suggesting that distortion of the zzso toward the transition state is important for zzso as originally proposed by zzso It is also zzso that the zzso formed by the zzso is an zzso consistent with a double displacement mechanism of action in which the zzso linkage is zzso with retention of zzso as originally proposed by zzso The zzso part of the cell wall zzso displays extensive zzso interactions with the zzso domain of the zzso consistent with previous studies of zzso in zzso
