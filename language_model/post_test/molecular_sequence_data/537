zzso is one of the most important zzso traits of zzso In order to explore the molecular mechanism of rice zzso a zzso dwarf 1-2 zzso zzso was isolated from the offspring of the zzso rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variety zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both high zzso and dwarf zzso of zzso were controlled by a single zzso nuclear zzso By means of molecular marker technique, the zzso zzso gene was mapped between two zzso markers A6 and zzso on zzso 4 within 116 zzso Within this region, there is a cloned gene zzso zzso which controls rice zzso By comparing sequences of zzso between zzso and zzso in combination with the results from zzso analysis, we believed that zzso is an zzso of the gene zzso Because of different genetic backgrounds, zzso and zzso have different zzso although they are the zzso zzso Furthermore, removal of zzso buds proved that zzso of zzso zzso is partly attributed to its excessive zzso
