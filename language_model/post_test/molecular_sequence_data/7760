A novel zzso zzso zzso enhanced gene zzso has been identified in zzso It does not belong to any known gene family of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the gene and a bacterial protein of unknown function show low but significant zzso and very similar zzso zzso Two different transcripts of zzso occur, which are due to alternative usage of two zzso zzso The presence of a nuclear targeting motif indicates that the gene product might zzso to the zzso The zzso gene maps to human zzso zzso and belongs to a zzso group, which is zzso in human, zzso and zzso
