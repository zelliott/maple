zzso zzso factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a approximately zzso zzso protein that has been shown in zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role in the physiology of normal zzso To further zzso the natural functions of zzso in zzso the expression of zzso in normal zzso was examined using Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the brain, zzso liver, zzso and zzso of the healthy adult zzso On Northern zzso the relative abundance of zzso zzso observed in these zzso was highest in the lung and lowest in the zzso As determined by in zzso zzso the patterns of zzso expression are organ zzso zzso of an zzso zzso probe was concentrated in the zzso zzso cell layer of the brain and in the zzso and zzso of the zzso In the liver and zzso intense zzso was observed zzso throughout both zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is present in virtually every zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso zzso to the zzso was weaker and more zzso The widespread expression and zzso distribution of zzso zzso in normal rat zzso supports the suggestion of an extensive role for this factor in the physiology of normal zzso
