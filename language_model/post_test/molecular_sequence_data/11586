zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein with intrinsic zzso zzso This protein is important in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in a number of different cell zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to examine the role of zzso and regulators of its activity in the differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by the zzso activity of type I zzso and zzso zzso differentiation of the two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso was closely related to growth zzso zzso induced by zzso resulted in an increase in both type I zzso and zzso zzso This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the zzso of zzso These results suggest that, in zzso zzso of zzso is not associated with zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso proteins type I zzso and zzso may have zzso functions in zzso differentiation of zzso
