zzso zzso activity is readily induced when the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso is grown on cellulose zzso as the sole carbon zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso strain rendered zzso due to zzso infection failed to zzso zzso zzso activity when grown under parallel zzso Efforts to identify zzso zzso zzso genes resulted in the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene designated zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed an increase in zzso transcript zzso in a zzso virulent zzso zzso strain zzso with the induction of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, induction of zzso transcript zzso was suppressed in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains rendered zzso by transgenic zzso of a zzso protein alpha zzso were also found to be deficient in the induction of zzso transcript zzso
