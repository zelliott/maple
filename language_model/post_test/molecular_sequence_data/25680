A series of zzso zzso single and multiple zzso zzso and extensions within the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso These zzso generally affect the affinity of zzso for specific and zzso zzso Additionally, substitution of the zzso zzso with several zzso acids capable of zzso interactions leads to improved specific binding zzso A zzso is also described zzso zzso links the two zzso zzso by a zzso zzso As a consequence, a significant improvement in zzso binding and a zzso reduction in specific binding are observed with this zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an important DNA binding domain and that a flexible connection between the two zzso zzso is a critical factor in modulating the affinity of zzso zzso for zzso
