zzso zzso is a zzso fungus commonly found in agricultural environments in many parts of the world and is suspected to be a zzso agent of zzso lung zzso The fungus grows slowly on commonly used culture media and is often obscured by the fast-growing zzso Thus, its occurrence in different environments has often been zzso In this study, we developed two sets of zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso that can be applied in either conventional zzso or real-time zzso for rapid detection and zzso of the fungus in environmental zzso Both zzso systems proved to be highly specific and sensitive for zzso zzso detection even in a high background of other zzso zzso These methods were employed to investigate the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso of a zzso The results revealed a high concentration of zzso zzso spores, zzso zzso by real-time zzso and zzso zzso by zzso which indicates the prevalence of zzso zzso in farms handling hay and grain and in cow zzso The methods developed in this study could serve as zzso specific, and sensitive means of detecting zzso zzso in zzso and surface samples and could thus facilitate investigations of its distribution, zzso clinical diagnosis, and exposure risk zzso
