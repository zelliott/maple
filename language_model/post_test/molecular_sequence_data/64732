zzso and sugar transport by zzso zzso is thought to occur as a series of ordered zzso zzso zzso To zzso these zzso changes in a bacterial zzso zzso we have employed a combination of zzso and zzso zzso Single or pairs of zzso zzso were introduced into the external face of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for expression in zzso coli, and each zzso was zzso using affinity zzso All the zzso proteins retained transport activity in bacteria and zzso Each zzso was exposed to two different zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso that are essentially zzso until they react with a zzso Fluorescence was recorded as a function of time and zzso zzso The zzso specifically labeled six of the seven zzso zzso but only in zzso 423 was the zzso affected by zzso The rate of labeling of zzso by zzso or zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso but only in the presence of zzso This zzso was not accompanied by a zzso shift and was not produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the sodium concentration from 200 to 10 zzso decreased the apparent affinity for zzso without altering the maximum zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso concentration from 20 to zzso zzso reduced both the apparent affinity for zzso and the maximum zzso at zzso zzso These results suggest an ordered reaction scheme with zzso binding zzso The zzso results with zzso zzso indicate that zzso changes underlying zzso zzso occur at or near the zzso domain between zzso zzso 10 and zzso
