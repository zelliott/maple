In bacteria, several proteins have been shown to zzso on zzso zzso but little is known on the molecular mechanism of this zzso To get more information on this matter, we have analyzed in detail the zzso of a particular zzso protein zzso from zzso coli zzso The analysis of the zzso profile of this protein indicates that it is composed of two main zzso an zzso domain, including two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain alone can undergo zzso and thus appears to harbor the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso domain is not zzso when incubated either alone or in the presence of the zzso and does not influence the extent of zzso of the zzso The zzso contains six different sites of zzso Among these, five are located at the zzso end of the zzso in the form of a zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one site is located upstream, at zzso The zzso zzso can zzso through an zzso process, whereas the zzso cluster zzso The zzso of zzso results in an increased protein zzso activity of zzso which can, in turn, zzso the five terminal zzso through an zzso zzso It is concluded that protein zzso zzso by using a cooperative zzso mechanism that involves both zzso and zzso This mechanism may be of biological significance in the signal zzso zzso by zzso
