zzso zzso have three or four identifiable primary zzso per zzso We previously reported that, while several zzso cells initially express the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene family, the expression of this gene becomes restricted to a single or a pair of cells slightly anterior to each segment border by 16 zzso after zzso Double zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso strongly suggested that these cells were mainly zzso primary zzso Here, we have isolated two novel zzso zzso clones for more zzso family zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso zzso starts to be expressed in the zzso zzso cells per zzso around 15 zzso Double labeling experiments have shown that these zzso cells are the zzso primary zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed the zzso in the expressed genes among primary zzso before the fates of the primary zzso are zzso determined, and further suggest the involvement of the zzso and zzso genes in the determination of cellular identities by primary zzso in embryonic zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso but is expressed at 17 zzso mainly in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may be involved in the regional zzso of the zzso and also in target recognition by zzso zzso is also expressed throughout the developing eye and zzso region of the zzso the target for the retinal zzso In the zzso spinal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which has defects in the zzso the cells expressing zzso zzso significantly decreased in number in contrast to the increase in cells expressing zzso zzso suggesting the influence of the zzso on the expression of both zzso
