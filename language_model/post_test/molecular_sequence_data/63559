zzso include the zzso zzso Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and West Nile and the zzso encephalitis zzso They are responsible for considerable zzso morbidity and zzso zzso entry is zzso by a zzso fusion zzso containing 16 zzso acids located in domain II of the envelope protein zzso zzso orchestrated zzso changes initiated by exposure to zzso pH accompany the fusion process and are important factors limiting zzso acid changes in the fusion zzso that still permit fusion with host cell zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso related agents, growing only in mosquitoes or insect cell lines, possess a different zzso zzso 

Analysis of 46 named zzso deposited in the zzso zzso database extended the constancy in the zzso fusion zzso sequences of zzso zzso and viruses with no known zzso to include more zzso zzso The zzso signature zzso acid, zzso was also found in zzso with no known zzso and with the zzso related zzso Despite the constancy in the zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso were surprisingly frequent with a zzso prevalence of zzso zzso in yellow fever virus fusion zzso zzso and 0 to zzso prevalence in the zzso Six of seven yellow fever patients whose virus had fusion zzso zzso zzso In the zzso related agents, not enough sequences have been deposited to estimate reliably the prevalence of fusion zzso zzso However, the zzso sequences zzso to the fusion zzso and the pattern of zzso linkages in protein E differed significantly from the other zzso 

The constancy of the zzso fusion zzso sequences in the zzso zzso contrasts with the high prevalence of zzso in most individual zzso The zzso may be the result of a survival advantage accompanying sequence diversity zzso involving the fusion zzso Limited clinical data with yellow fever virus suggest that the presence of fusion zzso zzso is not associated with a decreased case fatality zzso The zzso related agents may have substantial differences from other zzso in their mechanism of viral entry into the host zzso
