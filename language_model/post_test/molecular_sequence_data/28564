The structural features of the zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso have been characterized by zzso A comparison with the structures of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso illustrates significant differences, which may account for the unique binding properties of these zzso zzso Within the zzso density, zzso functions as a molecular scaffold with a number of the zzso interactions zzso through the zzso zzso Here, using zzso zzso and zzso chemical shift analysis, we have characterized the association of zzso to the zzso peptides of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso protein zzso all of which are known to associate with zzso The latter two, which possess the consensus sequence for binding to zzso zzso zzso have low zzso binding affinities zzso zzso The C zzso of zzso zzso lacking the consensus zzso binds to zzso of zzso with an affinity of 160 zzso The zzso data illustrate that although all three peptides occupy the binding groove capped by the zzso loop of zzso specific differences are present, consistent with the variation in binding zzso
