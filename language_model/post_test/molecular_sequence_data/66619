zzso are water channel proteins that facilitate the movement of water and other small zzso across biological zzso Plants usually have large zzso families, providing them with many ways to regulate the water zzso Some zzso are regulated zzso by zzso We have previously shown that the water channel activity of zzso an zzso in the plasma membrane of spinach leaves, was enhanced by zzso at zzso and zzso These two zzso zzso are highly zzso in all plasma membrane zzso of the zzso zzso In this study we have zzso and characterized two protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso By zzso exchange zzso the zzso zzso was zzso from the soluble protein fraction isolated from spinach zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso affinity zzso using plasma zzso isolated from spinach zzso When zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and had a zzso at zzso In accordance with previous studies using the zzso expression system, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso but not of zzso was increased in the presence of zzso zzso while zzso zzso decreased the zzso of both zzso and zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso was approximately 50 zzso The identification and characterization of these two protein zzso is an important step towards zzso the signal zzso zzso for gating of the zzso zzso
