Lung zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso peptides derived from zzso were studied in model lung zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso were formed by zzso a zzso film on the glass viewing port of a temperature controlled flow zzso zzso associated peptides were detected by zzso optical zzso of the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso secondary zzso added to buffer contained in the flow zzso zzso were bound by zzso to zzso zzso of zzso if formed from zzso films containing the zzso zzso zzso or if zzso was added to already formed zzso in buffer zzso The distribution of zzso complex was temperature dependent with zzso occurring at greater than or equal to 30 degrees zzso Surface association was not detected in zzso formed from zzso films containing the zzso peptides zzso using an zzso to the zzso zzso or to a synthetic version of the zzso zzso zzso using both zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The detection of zzso with zzso to the zzso sequence was only possible after reducing zzso with zzso suggesting that the zzso of the full zzso protein is accessible to the bulk zzso environment unlike the zzso zzso The size, number of zzso and fluidity of the zzso were not altered by protein or zzso although they were affected by zzso composition and zzso
