A base zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso liver zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso The sequence study and comparison of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso and chicken liver suggested that the zzso zzso consisted of two zzso large protein fraction zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso 2 (20 zzso acid zzso or zzso 1 (18 zzso acid zzso and that both components bind with zzso zzso The zzso preparation was probably formed from a single zzso protein by processing with some zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso showed that the zzso belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso family and its sequence most resembles chicken liver acid zzso In zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso which consist of the active site and major base recognition site of zzso zzso a typical zzso of zzso zzso family, are very well zzso except for zzso zzso zzso zzso and part of the zzso acid zzso of the minor base recognition site zzso and zzso are also zzso
