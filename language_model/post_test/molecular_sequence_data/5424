Human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been prepared using an zzso coli expression zzso zzso is thought to be an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso because there is a zzso identity between their zzso acid zzso The present investigation has revealed that like zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with one zzso prosthetic group per zzso Interestingly, zzso uses zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso as an electron zzso It zzso a zzso reduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso cannot be reduced by zzso This zzso also zzso a zzso reduction, using zzso red as the electron zzso The zzso red zzso activity of zzso is 11 times the zzso red zzso activity of zzso In addition, through a zzso reduction reaction, zzso can catalyze zzso of zzso compound CB 1954 zzso zzso is zzso times more effective than zzso in the reduction of CB zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso two- and zzso reduction zzso zzso is resistant to typical zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso blue, and zzso zzso are zzso of zzso However, structural requirements of zzso for the zzso of zzso are different from those for zzso The most potent zzso inhibitor tested so far is zzso zzso zzso It has been found that zzso is a competitive inhibitor with respect to zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso is 43 zzso acids shorter than zzso and it has been suggested that the zzso zzso of zzso plays a role in zzso binding zzso Chen et zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso In order to understand better the basis of zzso differences between zzso and zzso a human zzso with 43 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso still uses zzso as an electron zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso but not zzso These results suggest that additional zzso in these zzso is involved in zzso zzso from zzso
