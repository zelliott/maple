In zzso pneumoniae, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, form an zzso zzso has the features of a so-called zzso zzso whereas zzso protein is membrane zzso Here we provide the first genetic and zzso evidence that zzso and zzso with zzso zzso activities, constitute a signaling zzso The zzso couple signals competence upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso stimulating zzso We show that zzso activity is essential in a zzso genetic background, suggesting tight control of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the cell membrane zzso fraction and likely belong to the same complex, as revealed by zzso in cellular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso and zzso zzso proteins by zzso zzso demonstrates direct interaction between these zzso zzso flow zzso analysis allowed the determination of the zzso zzso of zzso and of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso A signaling route involving interplay between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is thus described for the first time in this human zzso
