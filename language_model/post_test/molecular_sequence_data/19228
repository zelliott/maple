zzso zzso is tightly regulated in zzso zzso the target of regulation is primarily the activity of the key zzso zzso zzso that is regulated by zzso zzso modification by zzso groups in reactions zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The properties and regulation of zzso from zzso coli have been studied in great zzso We have investigated the regulation of zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso is regulated at the zzso level in addition to the zzso regulation operating in all zzso bacteria, which makes understanding the regulatory features of nitrogen zzso even more zzso We show that in zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso coli system, zzso is primarily regulated by zzso and that zzso has no effect on neither the zzso nor the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the role of the regulatory zzso proteins is only to stimulate the zzso reaction, as there is no effect on the reverse zzso We propose that in zzso zzso and possibly other zzso zzso plays the central role in the regulation of zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso
