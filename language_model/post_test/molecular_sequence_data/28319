The zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso sequence and zzso probe analysis of zzso amplified DNA zzso zzso beta chain zzso and zzso beta chain zzso henceforth zzso is omitted from zzso we showed previously that the zzso zzso was associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the mixed zzso culture zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso similarly was shown to be associated with a rare zzso zzso zzso which differed from another zzso zzso by only a zzso acid substitution at position zzso Given the linkage zzso that characterizes zzso zzso it is difficult to assign disease zzso to a specific locus rather than to a closely linked zzso on the same zzso To address this problem, we have analyzed all of the zzso zzso of the class II zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso in patients and zzso In 22 zzso patients, 4 different zzso zzso were found that zzso the same zzso beta chain zzso but contained silent zzso differences at the zzso locus as well as coding sequence differences in the zzso and zzso zzso These results, obtained by using a method for zzso zzso chain reaction amplification, strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is correlated with the zzso zzso specificity and is associated with two different zzso zzso (the common zzso associated with zzso and the rare zzso associated with zzso Since zzso (19 of zzso of zzso patients contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso we conclude that most of the zzso zzso to zzso can be accounted for by the zzso beta zzso
