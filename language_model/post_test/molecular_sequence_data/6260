Analysis of the zzso and zzso sequences indicates that they both consist of two structural zzso of which the zzso domain can bind to zzso zzso while the zzso domain probably binds to a zzso zzso Both additional zzso probably bind zzso but lack zzso activity, while their synthesis requires the zzso zzso but is not zzso Although these properties resemble those of zzso the low sequence identity zzso I) demonstrates that the zzso zzso and zzso should be zzso as different members of the zzso zzso The identification of these additional members is zzso zzso of the cellular expression and distribution of the zzso and zzso and whether other organisms contain zzso zzso may reveal further features of the zzso zzso
