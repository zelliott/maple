zzso zzso zzso expand in systemic lupus zzso zzso in a zzso fashion and react with different lupus zzso including B cell zzso and zzso zzso Their shared use of zzso represents a unique system to understand the molecular basis of lupus zzso In this study, a large panel of zzso zzso zzso from single zzso and memory cells was generated and tested against B cells, zzso cells, and other zzso zzso eliminated the zzso zzso patch zzso responsible for the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso in zzso zzso cells was assessed by deep zzso We found that zzso zzso recognize several zzso following two distinct structural zzso B cell binding is dependent on the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso binding are zzso independent and correlate with positively charged H chain third zzso The majority of zzso zzso memory cells retain the zzso thereby suggesting selection by zzso that require this zzso zzso Our findings show that the zzso zzso is compulsory for the zzso cell zzso largely associated with zzso zzso in zzso but is not required for zzso against zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Given that the lupus memory compartment contains a majority of zzso zzso cells but decreased B cell zzso additional zzso zzso must participate in the selection of this zzso This study represents the first analysis, to our knowledge, of zzso zzso B cells specifically expanded in zzso and provides the foundation to understand the zzso forces at play in this zzso
