The zzso of zzso cartilage zzso a number of zzso which are capable of degrading the component molecules of this specialized zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso indicates that major activities responsible for zzso of zzso zzso and collagen are attributable to zzso zzso In this study, we have compared the zzso expression profiles of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso from fresh cartilage and in cartilage zzso cultures and isolated cells cultured in zzso or in zzso zzso Such cultures were maintained in the presence or absence of zzso zzso or zzso acid, two agents which promote cartilage zzso degradation in zzso Whereas transcripts for all zzso examined were detected in zzso from human zzso cartilage in zzso cultures, zzso for zzso and zzso were not present in fresh zzso human cartilage or zzso zzso Similarly, expression of zzso and bovine zzso zzso varied with different culture zzso Novel zzso sequences obtained for zzso and bovine zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso and zzso zzso confirmed expression of zzso for these molecules by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the effects of zzso and zzso acid on zzso zzso levels in human zzso cultured in zzso and in zzso zzso cultured in zzso For the zzso zzso treatment resulted in an approximately two to zzso increase in human and zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso acid treatment caused a statistically significant increase in human zzso zzso levels, but no significant change in transcript levels for zzso zzso nor human or zzso zzso The zzso levels for zzso were elevated in human zzso zzso exposed to zzso or zzso acid, while transcripts levels for zzso converting zzso were increased in response to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels were decreased in human zzso zzso exposed to zzso or zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso expression can vary dependent on cell environment in zzso and in zzso and information on zzso zzso and zzso gene expression following zzso zzso or zzso zzso
