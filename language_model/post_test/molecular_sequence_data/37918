The recently identified zzso zzso zzso channels zzso from zzso zzso have the ability to bind zzso Using two different methods, we mapped the binding site of zzso to the last predicted alpha zzso of the zzso zzso binding zzso This is in contrast to zzso from animals, where the zzso binding site is located in the zzso zzso that different mechanisms for zzso zzso have evolved in animals and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso have different zzso binding affinities and we provide evidence for target zzso among zzso zzso
