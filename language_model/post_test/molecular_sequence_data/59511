Plasma factor zzso zzso is a regulator in balancing the opposing zzso and zzso zzso Its zzso activity is to catalyze zzso bonds between certain zzso molecules to link them by strong zzso The primary zzso zzso are zzso between the gamma and alpha chains of zzso that produce zzso and zzso between alpha zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and alpha chains of zzso and between zzso and zzso We have characterized a unique factor zzso zzso that is specific for the middle zzso section of zzso It does not react with the zzso zzso or the inactive intermediate zzso and it does not inhibit the active center, as do most patient zzso to factor zzso This zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso Because of this zzso the zzso was used to study other zzso zzso It inhibited formation of zzso zzso complexes, similarly to zzso and there was very little zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso However, the amount of alpha zzso zzso to a zzso zzso was zzso It was concluded that this zzso interferes with zzso binding of zzso and zzso interferes with zzso binding of zzso and zzso in a similar way, while at least one critical zzso binding domain for alpha zzso is different from those of the other two zzso Furthermore, with this zzso it was shown that both alpha zzso chain zzso and zzso formation are necessary to zzso the rate of zzso
