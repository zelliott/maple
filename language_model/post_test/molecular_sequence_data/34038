The presentation of identical peptides by different major zzso complex class I zzso zzso termed zzso is a controversial feature of T zzso immunity to zzso The astounding diversity of zzso molecules in human zzso presumably to enable binding of equally diverse zzso implies zzso would be a rare zzso However, if it occurs, it would have important implications for zzso We screened 77 animals for responses to peptides known to bind zzso molecules that were not expressed by these zzso Some cases of supposed zzso were determined to be the result of either zzso optimal peptides or were simply not mapped to the correct zzso zzso in previous zzso Cases of zzso however, were associated with zzso of zzso zzso either in terms of the repertoire of peptides presented by the different zzso molecules or in the magnitude of the responses directed against the zzso zzso Specifically, we found that the zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso were also presented by zzso and targeted by an animal expressing that zzso We also found that the normally zzso zzso presented zzso zzso zzso was also presented by zzso Both zzso and zzso are molecules typically or exclusively expressed by animals of Chinese zzso These data clearly demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso though rare, might have important implications for zzso and for the transmission of escape zzso depending on the relative zzso of the given zzso in a zzso
