The zzso and derived zzso acid sequences for the two major zzso proteins of the mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso The zzso for zzso predicts a protein of zzso Da with 33 potential zzso sites, and that of zzso a smaller protein of zzso Da with 4 consensus zzso zzso Southern and Northern zzso analysis indicate zzso and zzso are single copy genes only expressed in the inner ear, and in zzso zzso shows they are expressed by cells both in and surrounding the zzso zzso Both sequences terminate with a zzso zzso zzso preceded by a potential zzso zzso site suggesting the zzso are zzso as zzso membrane bound zzso targeted to the zzso surface of the inner ear zzso by the zzso and zzso released into the zzso zzso The mouse zzso sequence contains a single zzso zzso domain, whereas zzso is composed of three distinct zzso an zzso region similar to part of the zzso zzso domain, a large central segment with three full and two partial von zzso factor type D repeats, and a zzso region which, like zzso contains a single zzso zzso zzso The central, high molecular mass region of zzso containing the von zzso factor type D repeats has zzso with zzso a zzso membrane protein that binds to the zzso zzso These results indicate the two major zzso proteins of the zzso membrane are similar to components of the zzso zzso system, and, as such may interact in the same zzso
