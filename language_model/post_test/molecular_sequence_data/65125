A zzso clone for zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of an zzso zzso zzso by a plaque zzso method using a zzso zzso for the soluble form of human zzso zzso The zzso is composed of zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso pair coding zzso The zzso sequence contains zzso signal zzso The zzso acid sequence of 132 zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso showed zzso identity and zzso similarity to the zzso zzso of another zzso species, zzso zzso which we previously zzso The zzso zzso domain of 98 zzso contains zzso structures around two zzso zzso for zzso zzso A zzso expression system was constructed to prepare a putative soluble form of zzso zzso zzso The zzso soluble zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso spectrum at zzso zzso as is shown by zzso zzso zzso upon reduction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced by zzso zzso zzso with an apparent zzso value of zzso zzso This value is similar to that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso during development was examined by an in zzso zzso method and ubiquitous expression in embryonic zzso was zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso plays important roles in various zzso processes during zzso
