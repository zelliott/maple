The heat shock response zzso zzso the production of heat shock proteins zzso through the zzso of heat shock factors zzso zzso binding protein zzso is reported to zzso the function of zzso by binding to their zzso and hence to regulate zzso This report describes the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of the zzso and seed development of zzso Both genes expressed zzso in all zzso under normal growth conditions while their expression levels were significantly increased during recovery after heat shock zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in onion zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso depicted the zzso ability of both zzso Both genes were also important for seed development, as their zzso lines were associated with significant seed zzso The zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are negative regulators of zzso and involved in acquired zzso but not in zzso zzso since their zzso transgenic lines zzso at zzso temperature, showed significantly decreased zzso survival after heat shock zzso Furthermore, zzso activity and gene expression of zzso and zzso was significantly increased in zzso transgenic zzso of zzso and zzso after heat stress compared with the wild zzso The expression of heat specific zzso was also increased significantly in zzso line of both genes but in a specific manner, suggesting the involvement of zzso genes in different zzso Overall, the present study reveals the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of the zzso and seed development of zzso
