In order to provide a rational research basis for detection of resistance of zzso zzso to zzso zzso agents and study on the resistant mechanism of multiple zzso resistance zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was constructed and the related target protein was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The fragments of zzso gene of zzso zzso from the standard strains were amplified and cloned into zzso expression zzso zzso with restriction zzso to construct zzso zzso which was verified by restriction zzso and DNA zzso The zzso was transformed into zzso coli zzso to express the protein zzso induced by zzso The results showed zzso DNA zzso was proved correct through restriction zzso and DNA zzso Its sequence was zzso zzso to that published on zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein which was induced by zzso was detected by zzso It was concluded that the construction of zzso expression zzso of zzso protein of zzso zzso was correct and the fusion protein was successively expressed in zzso zzso
