zzso of a zzso T cell requires specific binding of zzso peptides to major zzso complex zzso zzso This paper reports a study of peptides binding to members of the zzso zzso using a recently developed zzso method, called the additive zzso Four zzso with high zzso frequency were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The influence of each of the 20 zzso acids at each position of the zzso on binding was zzso A refined A3 zzso motif was defined in the zzso
