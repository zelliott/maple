To determine the changes in expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells on exposure to zzso and calcium zzso zzso 

This study used reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to examine zzso zzso expression levels in zzso cells exposed to zzso or calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated directly from zzso zzso cells, then converted to zzso with random zzso and reverse zzso To zzso the expression level zzso zzso we developed a competitive DNA template for competitive zzso zzso The zzso products were resolved by zzso on zzso zzso gel and zzso with zzso zzso In this system, we could zzso the exact number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat liver was expressed as a positive zzso 

zzso zzso and competitive templates from zzso zzso cells were expressed in all samples as 434 zzso and 312 zzso bands, zzso zzso expression was significantly increased in zzso exposed zzso zzso exposed to calcium zzso zzso zzso or latex beads showed no significant change in expression of zzso Western zzso analysis also showed increased expression of zzso and zzso proteins in the culture medium of zzso exposed zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso cells express zzso gene and have the capability to produce zzso when zzso by certain agents such as zzso This increased expression and production of zzso may represent a protective response of zzso zzso cells to zzso challenges of zzso
