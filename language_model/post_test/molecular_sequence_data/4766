The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 zzso is a potent zzso of zzso from the viral zzso zzso Previous zzso studies have identified zzso within zzso responsible for binding to its zzso zzso target and for zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso domain is composed of the zzso 48 zzso and zzso analyses identified a cluster of critical zzso The importance of four highly zzso aromatic zzso acids within the zzso domain has not been thoroughly zzso We have systematically zzso these aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein with other aromatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso zzso was measured in different cell lines by zzso with a zzso reporter zzso The range of zzso activities measured for this set of zzso zzso allowed careful assessment of the level of zzso activity required for optimal viral zzso To test this, the zzso zzso genes were introduced into the zzso infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a zzso zzso We found that a twofold reduction in zzso activity already affects viral zzso and no virus replication was measured for zzso zzso with less than zzso zzso This strict correlation between zzso activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the zzso function to viral zzso Interestingly, a less pronounced replication zzso was observed in primary cell zzso This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of zzso with zzso zzso in clinical zzso
