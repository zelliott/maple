To investigate the genes related to the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression patterns in the liver from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared by zzso arbitrarily primed reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso with fish bearing different zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso provided a zzso zzso zzso zzso and its transcripts were higher in toxic than zzso zzso zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence was similar to those of zzso proteins reported for other zzso Northern zzso analysis and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was composed of at least three zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Relative zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso showed a linear correlation with toxicity of the liver for two zzso zzso
