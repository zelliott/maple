zzso zzso expression has been implicated as a major contributor to numerous zzso Single zzso zzso zzso within the functional consequence of the novel zzso promoter region remains zzso zzso we aimed to establish the extent of genetic zzso within the promoter region of zzso gene as well as their association with zzso zzso Women were divided into two groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Total DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of zzso The DNA zzso containing zzso promoter regions zzso approximately zzso zzso were obtained by amplification of zzso chain zzso The variations of DNA fragments were detected by DNA sequencing or restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso alignment was used to identify sequence variations in zzso promoter zzso zzso were analyzed by method of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and control groups were zzso A total of 15 sequence variations within zzso promoter region were identified, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among these variations, four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso group and control group zzso and zzso zzso Two of them zzso and zzso are associated with higher zzso zzso We concluded that some sequence variations were observed within the promoter region of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso among the identical sequence variations are associated with zzso zzso
