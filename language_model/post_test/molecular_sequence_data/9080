Many bacterial pathogens can enter various host cells and then survive zzso zzso evade zzso zzso and further zzso to other cells and zzso When bacteria enter host cells and replicate zzso the host cells sense the invading bacteria as zzso molecular patterns zzso and zzso molecular patterns zzso by way of various pattern recognition zzso As a result, the host cells induce alarm signals that activate the innate immune zzso zzso bacteria must zzso host inflammatory zzso and dampen these alarm zzso How pathogens do this after invading zzso cells remains zzso zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso on the large zzso and delivered by the type zzso zzso system, zzso acute inflammatory responses during bacterial invasion by suppressing the zzso factor zzso factor 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that selectively zzso the zzso zzso at position 100 in zzso to a zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity required for zzso zzso is zzso allowing zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined the zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso which contains a putative zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso analysis showed this zzso zzso to be essential for the zzso of zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso acute inflammatory responses in the initial stage of infection by targeting the zzso zzso
