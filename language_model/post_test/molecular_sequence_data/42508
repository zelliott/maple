The synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso strategy on a zzso zzso is zzso The crude zzso preparations were extremely complex when analyzed by zzso zzso zone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that the most effective strategy for zzso included zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso peptides zzso greater than zzso were characterized by zzso size exclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso acid analysis, and zzso sequence analysis (for zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate the zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso synthesis of long peptides zzso zzso zzso in length in this zzso as well as the efficacy of an zzso approach for the zzso of very long, zzso crude zzso allowing a true assessment of the biological properties of these zzso to be carried zzso zzso zzso zzso was less than zzso as potent as zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were inactive at the doses tested zzso zzso
