The process of zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene segments precedes zzso zzso and the correlation between zzso zzso and accessibility for zzso is zzso thus it has been suggested that zzso zzso may be required for zzso If zzso zzso is essential for zzso then the level of zzso of individual gene segments might affect the relative frequency of zzso of those zzso Also, since the zzso zzso zzso is very distant from zzso genes before they zzso then any promoters which were zzso dependent might have a zzso zzso Here we study in zzso zzso the promoters of three functional genes of the zzso family, and compare them to that of the most frequently rearranging gene in the mouse zzso zzso zzso and to a zzso zzso Within the zzso family, the three zzso genes rearrange with very different relative zzso with zzso rearranging the most, and zzso seldom zzso We show that only the strong zzso promoter has significant zzso reporter gene activity in the absence of zzso zzso has only zzso as much activity as zzso in the absence of zzso and the other promoters have less than zzso of the activity of zzso zzso the zzso promoter has essentially no zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso has equivalent activity to zzso while the other promoters show much less zzso Again, zzso is the weakest promoter of all, despite being the most frequently rearranging zzso Finally, we show that the steady state level of zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in zzso is very zzso Thus, these data show little correlation between the strength or zzso of these zzso promoters and the relative frequency of zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso In addition, the data show that individual zzso promoters have different strengths even in the presence of zzso demonstrating that even promoters within a single zzso family can be quite zzso
