zzso is described as a zzso phenomenon where zzso zzso with a basic pH optimum play a key zzso Recently zzso with an zzso pH optimum were identified in the zzso and associated with zzso zzso zzso D and the stratum zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate if human stratum zzso contains zzso different from the above, exhibiting similar zzso After gel zzso we identified four distinct zzso activities in a human stratum zzso zzso a zzso activity zzso zzso a zzso activity (40 zzso a yet unknown zzso form zzso zzso exhibiting the highest zzso activity, and a zzso protein (24 zzso containing the zzso activity of the well described stratum zzso zzso zzso We named the new 28 zzso zzso stratum zzso zzso zzso zzso of stratum zzso zzso zzso provided clear evidence that this new zzso despite its membership to the zzso family, is distinct from zzso L and from the recently described stratum zzso zzso zzso Its ability to zzso zzso a marker of zzso cohesion, was in favor of a role of stratum zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A more detailed analysis did not allow us to identify stratum zzso zzso zzso at the molecular level but revealed that stratum zzso zzso zzso is identical with the recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction studies and the use of a specific zzso revealed that, in contrast to earlier reports, expression of stratum zzso zzso zzso in human zzso is not related to zzso zzso Our results indicate that the stratum zzso zzso zzso is probably expressed as a zzso in the lower layers of the zzso and in part activated by a yet unidentified mechanism in the upper layers during zzso zzso
