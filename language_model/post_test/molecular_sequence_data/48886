zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 6 zzso are drivers for the development of zzso Here, we zzso a panel of zzso zzso in zzso and find that these generally compromise assembly of the zzso zzso and zzso activity towards a model zzso zzso analysis of one zzso zzso in both primary melanoma and engineered cell lines reveals it is zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso Global analysis of zzso zzso by mass zzso identifies the zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso that is zzso under these zzso zzso cells lacking zzso or carrying the zzso zzso have elevated zzso zzso activity and display zzso instability with associated zzso zzso zzso zzso to these zzso are zzso stained by the DNA damage marker zzso suggesting that loss of zzso promotes both zzso instability and DNA zzso These findings support the view that formation of zzso rather than zzso instability alone explains how loss of zzso and more generally zzso zzso and zzso zzso can act as drivers for zzso instability in melanoma and other zzso
