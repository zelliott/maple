The zzso zzso factor is a crucial regulator of zzso and its expression is altered in various zzso zzso It has been shown that expression of zzso is severely impaired in patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso but the mechanism underlying this effect remains zzso Through zzso sequencing, zzso zzso and indirect zzso and Western zzso techniques, we found zzso zzso in the promoter region of zzso factor zzso in zzso patients both in the chronic and blast crisis zzso as well as in the zzso blast zzso cell zzso Of these, several zzso sites were more highly zzso in blast crisis than chronic phase, while no zzso of these sites was observed in healthy zzso Interestingly, zzso patients achieved complete zzso zzso under zzso zzso treatment, but the zzso zzso status of zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso expression at the zzso and protein levels was also observed in association with zzso zzso Thus, for the first time, we have revealed a potential zzso modification of zzso in zzso which may be responsible for the zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso may play a role in zzso zzso and may therefore serve as a useful zzso and potential target for zzso zzso
