This article presents the results of a detailed analysis of zzso interactions in membrane and soluble zzso A data set of interacting pairs of zzso in membrane proteins of known structure was constructed and a structure alignment zzso was used to identify pairs of zzso in soluble proteins that zzso well with pairs of zzso in the zzso data zzso Most zzso pairs in membrane proteins are found to have a significant number of structural zzso in soluble zzso although in some cases, primarily involving irregular zzso no close zzso zzso An analysis of geometric relationships between interacting zzso in the two sets of proteins identifies some differences in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso area, packing angle, and distance between the zzso zzso However, a subset of zzso zzso pairs that are close structural zzso to zzso zzso pairs exhibits zzso that mirror those observed in membrane zzso The larger average interface size and smaller distance of closest approach seen for zzso in membrane proteins appears due in part to a relative enrichment of zzso and zzso particularly as components of the zzso and zzso zzso It is argued that membrane zzso are not on average more tightly packed than zzso in soluble zzso they are simply able to approach each other more zzso This enables them to interact over longer zzso which may in turn facilitate their remaining in contact over much of the zzso of the zzso zzso The close structural similarity seen between some pairs of zzso in membrane and soluble proteins suggests that packing patterns observed in soluble proteins may be useful in the modeling of membrane zzso Moreover, there do not appear to be fundamental differences between the magnitude of the forces that drive zzso packing in membrane and soluble zzso suggesting that strategies to make membrane proteins more soluble by mutating surface zzso are likely to encounter success, at least in some zzso
