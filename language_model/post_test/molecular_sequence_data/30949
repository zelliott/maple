The zzso gene belongs to the zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is zzso to the zzso zzso found in the avian leukemia virus zzso The zzso gene products were characterized using a specific zzso zzso developed against a zzso expressed zzso zzso The zzso gene product in the human zzso line zzso was found to consist of at least six zzso four major species with apparent molecular weights of 51 zzso zzso 48 zzso zzso 42 zzso zzso and 39 zzso zzso and two minor species of 52 zzso zzso and 49 zzso zzso which are demonstrated to be the zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso All of the zzso proteins are related to each other and are considered products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso are found mainly in the zzso while zzso and zzso are found mainly in the zzso zzso zzso against various zzso of zzso showed that both zzso and zzso lack a region corresponding to zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of an additional zzso product that zzso to zzso lacking zzso zzso These results suggest that the human zzso gene encodes multiple proteins that are generated by at least two distinct zzso alternative zzso of zzso and protein zzso
