zzso zzso activity was studied in zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso profiles showed that zzso and zzso contain a zzso activity that has an optimum at pH zzso In addition, there is an activity that is not activated by zzso in zzso and which shows a peak at pH zzso This suggests there are two distinct zzso zzso in zzso zzso A gene for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Proof that the cloned zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso in zzso was based on several zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity which was zzso by partial zzso zzso the zzso zzso incorporation of zzso from the zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis showed zzso of a zzso zzso zzso probe only with zzso zzso DNA and not with zzso zzso zzso zzso pH profiles of the cloned zzso showed an optimum at pH zzso This zzso with the zzso profiles for zzso zzso measured in zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso Thus, zzso encodes only part of the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso A gene for a second zzso zzso in zzso zzso with a pH optimum at zzso is zzso DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso which predicts a zzso of Mr zzso with zzso zzso zzso The alignment of derived zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso
