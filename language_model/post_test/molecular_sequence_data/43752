A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for its ability to specifically detect and differentiate DNA of two zzso zzso A pair of consensus zzso that target a DNA segment of the zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso each zzso with a different fluorescent reporter dye and the same zzso zzso were used in a zzso zzso The zzso is based on the zzso zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generates specific fluorescent signals whose intensity can be zzso by zzso After evaluating the effects of various zzso temperatures and probe zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of the reporter zzso it was possible to detect and differentiate zzso and zzso virus zzso on the basis of a zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is comparable to the sensitivity of zzso zzso gels, but the zzso provides higher specificity and virtually eliminates the need for zzso zzso zzso
