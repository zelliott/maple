zzso of the isolated reaction center of zzso II generates a protein of 41 zzso molecular zzso Using zzso it is confirmed that the protein is an zzso of the D1 protein and the zzso of zzso zzso Its formation seems to be zzso zzso being independent of temperature between 4 and 20 degrees C and unaffected by a mixture of zzso zzso The maximum levels are detected when the pH is in the region zzso and when zzso zzso are zzso Although higher light zzso induce a higher rate of formation, the zzso of elevated levels of the zzso protein does not occur due to zzso zzso This degradation is also unaffected by the presence of zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso sequencing indicates that the zzso process involves the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and D1 zzso in the zzso zzso motif close to the QB binding zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that the N zzso of the zzso is exposed on the zzso side of zzso II in such a way as to undergo zzso zzso in the QB region of the D1 zzso They also suggest that the zzso zzso may be an intermediate before the zzso zzso of the D1 protein in the zzso zzso
