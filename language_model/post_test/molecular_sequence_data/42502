zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso were used to screen an expression library of zzso zzso zzso DNA constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso Following several cycles of zzso using the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso clone containing zzso zzso pairs zzso of zzso zzso DNA was identified and isolated from the expression zzso zzso of the zzso clone zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of the crude zzso coli zzso revealed the presence of two novel zzso Two zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with both proteins on zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso DNA in clone zzso and computer comparison of the predicted zzso sequences with existing protein sequence files revealed zzso with the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso
