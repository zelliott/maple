zzso has become a model system for functional zzso in woody zzso Here, we report the sequencing and zzso of the first large zzso stretch of zzso sequence (95 zzso of poplar, corresponding to a bacterial artificial zzso clone mapped zzso zzso from the zzso zzso resistance zzso The zzso revealed 15 putative genetic objects, of which five were classified as hypothetical genes that were similar only with expressed sequence tags from zzso Ten putative objects showed similarity with known zzso of which one was similar to a zzso Three other objects corresponded to the zzso zzso zzso repeat class of plant disease resistance zzso of which two were predicted to zzso an zzso terminal nuclear zzso zzso Four objects were zzso to the zzso zzso family of class I zzso zzso one of which was designated zzso and interrupted one of the disease resistance zzso Two other objects constituted a novel zzso class II zzso element, which we designated zzso
