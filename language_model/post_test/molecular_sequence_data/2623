We have previously shown that treatment of zzso human zzso zzso zzso with zzso results in loss of the ability of the zzso zzso to interact with zzso acid and in fragmentation of the link proteins zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show the zzso zzso zzso acid in zzso zzso is also fragmented by treatment with zzso zzso Although zzso treatment results in loss of the ability of the zzso zzso to interact with zzso acid, the loss of this function is not attributable to substantial zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, link proteins retain the ability to bind to zzso acid following treatment with zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso zzso and link protein is, however, zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the first eight zzso of the major product of link protein resulting from zzso treatment revealed that zzso occurred between zzso 13 and 14, so that the new zzso zzso acid is zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso is converted into zzso and an zzso zzso zzso is converted into zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso link protein showed no zzso or modifications in similar positions under identical zzso zzso This species variation may be related to the different availability of zzso zzso required for the zzso of the transition metal zzso involved in zzso generation from zzso zzso Changes in function of these structural zzso as a result of the action of zzso may be consequences of both fragmentation and chemical zzso
