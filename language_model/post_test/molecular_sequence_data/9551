zzso adoption of transgenic zzso corn in recent years for stalk zzso control has increased risk of resistance evolution in the target zzso zzso A zzso strain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso more tolerant to zzso toxin than the susceptible zzso To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso resistance, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso were subjected to a zzso zzso 

zzso showed that the expression levels of many genes were significantly different between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso expressed zzso A total of 273 genes were significantly zzso zzso and 111 genes were significantly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of three potential zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso was confirmed using real-time zzso indicating a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that more than twice the number of zzso genes were zzso compared with zzso genes with the same biological zzso Up to zzso of the zzso genes in the resistant strain were associated with zzso activity, while only zzso of the zzso genes were related to the same zzso molecular zzso 

The large portion of zzso or zzso genes with significant zzso indicated a potential large increase in zzso or zzso activities in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso gene expression data could be used to characterize and identify new genes that may be associated with zzso resistance in zzso zzso
