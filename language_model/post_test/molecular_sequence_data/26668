To investigate the composition of zzso bacteria from soil of Grove zzso East zzso and analyze the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso activities of these zzso zzso 

We used spread plate method to obtain zzso zzso zzso relationship was zzso based on their zzso zzso gene zzso We used plate method and zzso block method to detect the production of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso activities of these bacteria, zzso 

We obtained a total of 39 zzso from all the soil zzso They belonged to 20 zzso and grouped into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which each group occupied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the total, zzso zzso was zzso We isolated different strains from soil stored at different temperatures, and this may be explained as viable bacteria were different at diverse zzso Of the 39 zzso 33 showed the activity of producing at least one zzso zzso zzso strains were the most zzso 6 strains were able to inhibit the growth of at least one tested zzso or zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso activity and zzso and zzso activity would contribute to the exploration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso material in zzso
