The mouse zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso inserted into zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli as a zzso terminal extension of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the amount of the expressed fusion protein zzso was over 50% of total cellular zzso After the fusion protein had been zzso with zzso on a zzso zzso affinity zzso column, zzso zzso was zzso by gel zzso on zzso zzso The results of molecular mass, zzso acid composition and sequence of 10 zzso acids at the zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso protein is the one we zzso The ratios of zzso and zzso are the same as those of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which are in agreement with those from native rabbit zzso The ultraviolet zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and pH zzso were all similar to those of native zzso indicating that they have the same zzso structure even though six zzso acid zzso have been added at the zzso of the zzso zzso
