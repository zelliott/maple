We describe the isolation and preliminary characterization of a new G alpha gene zzso in zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso yielding two putative zzso both of which contain zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso and share 50% identity with zzso and other G zzso These proteins represent a new class of G alpha zzso because they lack both high zzso acid identity with other G alpha proteins and the zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is detected by zzso Northern zzso in zzso heads but not in zzso bodies or in the zzso eyes absent zzso zzso in zzso zzso detects zzso expression only in the zzso and zzso of the adult head, making it a prime candidate for zzso the zzso zzso zzso the G protein required for zzso
