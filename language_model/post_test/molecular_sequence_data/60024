To determine the minimum requirement in the zzso leader sequence of zzso necrosis factor zzso for membrane zzso across the zzso zzso zzso and for the maturation of zzso we constructed zzso zzso in which a part of the zzso domain of zzso was directly linked to the zzso of the mature domain, and evaluated their zzso behavior across the zzso and their zzso from the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso zzso involving a canine pancreatic zzso membrane system including a zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso half of the zzso domain of zzso consisting of 14 zzso functioned as a zzso signal zzso it generated a zzso form of zzso having a molecular mass similar to that of mature zzso Analysis of the zzso site by zzso zzso indicated that the site was inside the leader sequence of this zzso When the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells, efficient zzso of a biologically active soluble zzso was zzso Further deletion of the zzso domain from this zzso inhibited the zzso indicating that some extent of zzso is indispensable for the membrane zzso of the mature domain of zzso Thus, the zzso half of the zzso domain of zzso could function as a zzso signal sequence when linked to the mature domain of zzso and zzso of a biologically active zzso form of zzso could be achieved with this zzso zzso zzso In intact zzso however, this zzso sequence could not function as a zzso signal sequence during zzso processing, indicating that the remainder of the zzso leader sequence of zzso zzso the signal zzso zzso and thus enables the leader sequence to function as a type II zzso sequence that generates a zzso form of zzso
