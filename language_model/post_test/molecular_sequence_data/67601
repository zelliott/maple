zzso proteins zzso have been implicated as regulatory proteins involved in the zzso processes of gene expression in plants under various stress zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a zzso designated as zzso zzso a member of the plant zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso family from oil palm zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso recognition motifs and a zzso domain at the zzso The upstream region of zzso has multiple zzso zzso regulatory elements and regulatory elements associated with flower zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso was expressed in oil palm zzso tested, including zzso shoot zzso zzso zzso female zzso male zzso and zzso with the lowest transcript level in the zzso zzso protein zzso with transcripts associated with transcription, translation and stress responses using pull-down zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso The zzso of zzso and its interacting transcripts were induced by zzso zzso including zzso drought, zzso cold and heat stresses in leaf zzso zzso the data suggested that zzso is a zzso which responds to various zzso stresses and could be advantageous for oil palm under stress zzso Key message zzso may be involved in the zzso regulation of stress-related genes important for plant stress response and zzso
