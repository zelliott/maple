zzso growth zzso zzso binding to the zzso type I zzso and type II zzso receptors delivers a plethora of zzso specific zzso Moreover, the responses to zzso are tuned by regulatory mechanisms at the zzso level zzso To further zzso zzso family signal zzso in zzso we therefore cloned the first complete set of a putative zzso zzso complex in zzso Rainbow trout zzso and zzso are zzso proteins with a zzso zzso domain and are highly zzso within zzso High expression levels in muscle and brain indicate regulation of the zzso system in muscular and nervous zzso zzso zzso induced expression of both zzso chains in zzso cells while bacterial and viral mimics modulated the two receptors zzso in head kidney zzso zzso In addition, T cell zzso lowered zzso levels in zzso zzso These data provide the first insights into zzso type I and II zzso zzso during immune responses in zzso zzso
