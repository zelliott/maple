Using a zzso zzso technique, a novel member of the zzso family was isolated from human zzso zzso This gene encodes a zzso protein containing tandem head to tail zzso zzso with the conservation of key functional zzso zzso of this zzso zzso was restricted to zzso cells and B cells, with strong expression in mature B zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that a single copy of this gene is zzso In zzso zzso on zzso tissue showed expression in zzso cells and isolated cells within the zzso zzso With respect to an zzso tag zzso this zzso could be localized to the major zzso complex class I region of zzso zzso Comparative analysis and the expression pattern of this gene suggests a function in zzso processing and zzso
