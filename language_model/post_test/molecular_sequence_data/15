We use single silicon zzso zzso to study zzso partially zzso and unfolded single proteins by measuring their excluded zzso The zzso zzso signals of zzso and zzso zzso protein match zzso with that predicted by a simple sum of the partial volumes of the zzso acids in the zzso segment inside the pore when zzso zzso due to the primary charge zzso Our analysis suggests that the majority of the protein molecules were linear or zzso during zzso and that the electrical forces present under zzso relevant zzso can unfold zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso signals are sensitive enough to distinguish the folding state of a protein and distinguish between proteins based on the excluded volume of a local segment of the zzso chain that zzso zzso in the zzso due to the primary sequence of zzso
