Human zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso copies per zzso human zzso At least one of these zzso is capable of producing full-length zzso zzso high amounts of which have been detected in germ cell tumors and derived cell zzso The latter display zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we employed the protein zzso test zzso in combination with a zzso hybrid mapping panel to identify the human zzso harboring zzso gag genes with an open reading frame for zzso zzso Eight human zzso were found to contain intact zzso gag zzso zzso results were zzso by partial sequencing of zzso from different zzso gag zzso The high number of zzso zzso open reading frames supports the idea of zzso sequences retaining a biological benefit in the human zzso
