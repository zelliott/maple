zzso zzso in the early zzso requires the integration of spatial information at the promoters of zzso important zzso Although several response elements for zzso pathways have been identified in zzso zzso it is not yet understood what defines the sharp borders that restrict expression to a specific zzso Here we use transgenic zzso zzso to study the spatial and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso analysis and point zzso in putative zzso zzso sites identified two zzso zzso which exert their main effects at different stages during zzso One module is defined by a zzso binding site for a zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso family and acts to zzso expression to the marginal zone early in zzso The other module is defined by two zzso sites and is responsible for repression in zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso In addition, an upstream region of the promoter is necessary to repress expression in neural zzso later in zzso Together, our results show that repression plays an important role in the restriction of zzso expression to the zzso and we suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in the spatial regulation of other genes in early embryonic zzso
