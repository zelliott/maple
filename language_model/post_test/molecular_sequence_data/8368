zzso zzso zzso zzso five major zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, a new set of zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso deleted of those zzso zzso We cloned the zzso zzso zzso one of these secondary zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from a zzso bank of a strain deleted of the five major zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the region containing the zzso gene was zzso The zzso reading frame is zzso bases long, corresponding to a protein of 425 zzso acids including a typical zzso signal sequence of 25 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed a low zzso limited to 220 zzso of the central part of the zzso No zzso was detected with other bacterial zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso using gene zzso As shown for the other zzso zzso the zzso of zzso is dependent on various environmental zzso It is induced by zzso zzso products and affected by growth phase, temperature, iron zzso zzso zzso nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression appeared to be independent of the zzso zzso which controls all the steps of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which is involved in regulation of the synthesis of the major zzso zzso and of zzso also appeared to be involved in zzso zzso The zzso protein is able to zzso plant zzso This zzso has a basic zzso point, presents an zzso activity on zzso or partially zzso zzso with a basic pH optimum and an absolute requirement for zzso The zzso zzso displayed a reduced zzso on potato zzso and zzso zzso plants, demonstrating the important role of this zzso in zzso zzso
