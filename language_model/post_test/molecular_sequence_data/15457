zzso zzso zzso screens were used to test for interactions between zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and a liver zzso expression library of zzso zzso zzso Of the 9 independent interacting clones identified, 7 were identical and closely related to zzso zzso genes of fish, while the other two were related to zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by in zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso using different parts of the two proteins showed that the segment zzso was not involved in the interaction with mature zzso while the transit zzso of zzso couldn't interact with entire zzso Computer analysis revealed that zzso which contained two iron binding zzso zzso and zzso was located at the zzso of zzso zzso Strong interactions were also determined between zzso and zzso from the same animal, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso interactions were zzso Based on published data, the zzso interaction is suggested to be most possibly involved in the body's defense against zzso
