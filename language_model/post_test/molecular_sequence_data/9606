zzso zzso C zzso is a key zzso family involved in cellular signal zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain zzso of zzso is associated with normal cell signaling and zzso In contrast, the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso is considered to be a key initiating event in tumor zzso Conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso beta I, beta II, and zzso contain two zzso both of which are candidates for the zzso zzso binding zzso In order to zzso the binding requirements of zzso zzso and to obtain information on the zzso zzso binding site in native zzso zzso several key chemical characteristics of the first and the second zzso consisting of zzso 50 zzso acids of rat zzso gamma zzso and zzso were zzso In the presence of zzso and zzso zzso both zzso gave similar zzso values zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso binding zzso In comparison, the binding affinity of zzso for native rat zzso gamma was found to be zzso zzso zzso was shown to play an important role in the folding and zzso binding of both zzso A zzso zzso change was observed for the first time by CD zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso Relative to the pronounced zzso effect, most zzso first row transition metal zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective in folding either zzso zzso however, zzso exhibited a zzso effect, suggesting that metal zzso not unlike extensively used organic zzso might also become effective tools for controlling zzso selective zzso of zzso Moreover, group zzso zzso and zzso and group zzso element zzso other than zzso zzso and zzso were found to abolish zzso binding of both zzso zzso these zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were also observed with native zzso zzso These results indicate that recent reports on the zzso of conventional zzso by heavy metal zzso could be explained by their coordination to the zzso While the similar affinities of zzso and zzso for zzso suggest that either site qualifies as the zzso binding site, new molecular zzso of these zzso have now been identified that provide information on the preferred zzso These novel zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso These compounds did not significantly affect the specific zzso binding of zzso but did inhibit that of zzso with similar potency to zzso Moreover, these new zzso did not significantly inhibit the zzso binding of native zzso zzso zzso itself bound almost equally to zzso zzso and native zzso zzso These results suggest that the major zzso binding site in native zzso gamma is the first zzso not the second zzso unlike the novel zzso
