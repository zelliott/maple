zzso from plants of zzso zzso exhibiting typical zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso were examined for the presence of plant zzso zzso by zzso amplification using universal zzso zzso All affected plants yielded positive zzso zzso analyses of zzso gene products indicated that the zzso detected were different from those described zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences confirmed that zzso represents a distinct lineage and shares a common zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that the zzso zzso gene sequences of the four zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified in symptomatic zzso zzso samples were nearly identical zzso % zzso The closest relatives were members of the pigeon pea zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso % sequence zzso On the basis of unique zzso zzso gene sequences and biological properties, the zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso in zzso represents a coherent but discrete novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso number zzso representing the reference zzso
