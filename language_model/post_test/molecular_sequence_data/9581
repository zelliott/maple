We examined the association between zzso in the core promoter element 1 zzso of the human zzso gene zzso which acts as a critical regulator of zzso transcription, and the risk for zzso One hundred and zzso patients with documented essential hypertension and a family history of hypertension and zzso control subjects without hypertension were selected and frequency matched by age and zzso zzso DNA from zzso was analyzed for genetic zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso The zzso in zzso was significantly associated with increased risk of essential hypertension zzso The frequency of subjects with zzso C zzso at position zzso was significantly higher in case patients than in control subjects zzso and the evaluated odds ratio for hypertension was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso versus zzso The zzso zzso zzso at zzso 235 zzso in zzso 2 of zzso was also associated with hypertension zzso odds ratio, zzso versus other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso According to zzso analysis between zzso zzso we identified linkage zzso between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in zzso is a genetic risk factor for essential hypertension in the Japanese and is more tightly and directly associated with hypertension than zzso
