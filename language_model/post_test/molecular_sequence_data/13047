Two groups of zzso box proteins are zzso zzso in the first group contain multiple zzso boxes, are zzso and recognize structural features as found in zzso DNA and zzso zzso The abundant zzso protein zzso belongs to this zzso zzso in the second group carry a single zzso box with affinity for the minor groove of the zzso motif zzso or variations zzso A solution structure for the zzso zzso zzso box of zzso has recently been zzso Now, we report the solution structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso connected by loop regions zzso and zzso zzso I and II are positioned in an zzso mode and form one arm of the zzso zzso zzso III is less zzso makes an average angle of about 90 degrees with zzso I and II, and constitutes the other arm of the zzso As in zzso the overall structure of the zzso zzso box is L-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of zzso mainly aromatic zzso
