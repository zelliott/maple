Like other types of zzso zzso have essential zzso and zzso activities which may be regulated via zzso zzso such as zzso of their resident zzso We here report a zzso mapping of in zzso zzso sites in zzso samples prepared from sweet orange zzso zzso zzso zzso at different zzso stages by titanium zzso affinity zzso for zzso enrichment with zzso A total of 109 zzso zzso candidates were identified that zzso to 179 unique zzso sites in 135 zzso On the basis of zzso analysis, two distinct types of zzso sites, one as zzso zzso motif and the other as zzso zzso II zzso can be generalized from these identified zzso While most identified zzso show high zzso to those already identified in zzso approximately zzso of them are novel based on zzso search using the public databases zzso and zzso zzso A close comparative analysis showed that approximately 50% of the zzso identified in citrus zzso find obvious counterparts in the zzso zzso suggesting a rather high-level of conservation in basic zzso activities in these two types of zzso Not surprisingly, the zzso of citrus zzso is also characterized by the lack of zzso involved in photosynthesis and by the presence of more zzso implicated in zzso zzso This study presents the first comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso and may help to understand how zzso regulates differentiation of citrus zzso during fruit zzso
