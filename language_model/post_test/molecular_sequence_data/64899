The zzso zzso channel has very unusual kinetic zzso that includes slow zzso but rapid zzso These features are critical for normal cardiac zzso as well as in preventing lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channel has allowed identification of which regions of the channel are important for the unusual kinetic zzso of the zzso Furthermore, structural studies on scorpion toxins that zzso inhibit zzso are beginning to provide clues as to the structural differences between zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
