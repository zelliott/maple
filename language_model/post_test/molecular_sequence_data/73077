The 70 zzso heat shock proteins zzso are a family of molecular zzso which promote protein folding and participate in many cellular zzso The zzso zzso are composed of two major zzso The zzso zzso domain binds to and zzso zzso whereas the zzso domain is required for zzso zzso Cooperation of both zzso is needed for protein zzso The crystal structure of bovine zzso zzso domain zzso has been determined and, more recently, the crystal structure of the zzso domain of a related zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso has been zzso The molecular zzso activity and zzso switch are functionally linked with zzso zzso A high-resolution structure of the zzso domain is required to provide an understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso and how it affects communication between zzso and zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of the human zzso zzso domain zzso has been determined and refined at zzso 84 A, using zzso radiation at zzso Two calcium sites were zzso the first calcium binds within the zzso pocket, bridging zzso and zzso zzso and the second calcium is tightly coordinated on the protein surface by zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso Overall, the structure of zzso is similar to zzso zzso between them are found in the zzso the sites of zzso acid substitution and the zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso calcium being the most zzso 

The structural similarity of zzso and zzso and the sequence similarity within the zzso zzso family suggest a universal mechanism of zzso zzso among all zzso molecular zzso Two calcium zzso have been found in the zzso zzso One zzso to the zzso site in zzso and appears to be important for zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Local changes in protein structure as a result of calcium binding may facilitate zzso A small, but zzso movement of metal zzso and zzso could position zzso important zzso zzso for zzso The second calcium site represents a new zzso motif that can play a role in the stabilization of protein zzso We discuss how the information about zzso events in the active site could be transmitted to the zzso zzso
