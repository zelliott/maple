A zzso zzso zzso containing the upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso I gene zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso contains eight zzso sites having an identical or similar sequence to the consensus sequence for binding a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of binding zzso with the zzso zzso fusion protein zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso upstream region revealed that a zzso zzso zzso zzso position zzso to zzso bearing three zzso sites, zzso zzso and A3, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso position zzso to zzso bearing three zzso sites, zzso zzso and zzso were shifted in the zzso mobility shift zzso zzso I zzso experiments showed that the zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and B3 were protected from zzso I zzso
