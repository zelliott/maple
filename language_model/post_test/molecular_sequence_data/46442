zzso zzso peptides zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and fishes, and these animals have several zzso that consist of different numbers of zzso acids such as 20, 31 and zzso In the present study, we identified the zzso zzso chicken zzso which can generate putative zzso and cloned and zzso zzso zzso for the coding region suggested the occurrence of putative zzso of 20, 31 and 32 zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of chicken zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso identity with those of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, chicken zzso showed approximately zzso and zzso zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Native chicken zzso were zzso from an acid extract of chick brain by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Milford, MA, zzso affinity zzso using zzso zzso serum, and reverse phase zzso liquid zzso zzso on an zzso column zzso Tokyo, zzso The existence of chicken zzso and zzso in the brain was demonstrated by comparing them with the synthetic peptides using zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso Chicken zzso increased plasma zzso concentration when administered zzso whereas central administration decreased the zzso suggesting that chicken zzso has a distinct effect on zzso zzso between zzso in zzso On the other hand, plasma growth hormone concentration decreased with both peripheral and central administrations of chicken zzso Furthermore, central administration of chicken zzso increased food intake in zzso compared to those observed in zzso and zzso Taken together with the results indicating that chicken zzso did not show zzso and zzso effects, we showed that chicken zzso has a similar zzso acid sequence to zzso zzso zzso and zzso although the actions were variable among zzso
