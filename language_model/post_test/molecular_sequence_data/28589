zzso of the immune status of individuals to zzso diseases requires an zzso that can detect zzso that may be present at very low levels, especially when natural or vaccine exposure may have been many years zzso zzso zzso has recently been described as an zzso method for the detection of zzso and we have adapted the method for the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso The procedure used was similar to an indirect zzso except that the detecting zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso to a short capture zzso rather than an zzso The capture zzso was then detected by the addition of target DNA, which was designed to zzso to the capture zzso and function as a template for real-time zzso The quantity of target DNA detected by the zzso depended upon the level of specific zzso in the test zzso We found that the sensitivity (and zzso of the zzso zzso did not exceed that of the conventional zzso The sensitivity was limited by zzso binding of human zzso to the solid zzso Further development of zzso and zzso formats is necessary to fully exploit the potential of quantitative zzso so that potential improvements in the sensitivity of zzso zzso detection can be zzso
