The sequential timing of zzso transitions is primarily governed by the availability and activity of key zzso zzso Recent studies in zzso have identified a class of zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso complexes, which regulate the abundance of proteins that promote and inhibit zzso progression at the zzso phase zzso zzso complexes consist of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and a variable zzso protein that recruits a specific cellular protein to the zzso zzso for zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso development and zzso regulation, we generated mice deficient for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso We show that zzso is required for early mouse development and that zzso zzso fail to regulate the abundance of the zzso zzso zzso E zzso by zzso during zzso
