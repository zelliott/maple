zzso strains have been classified into 24 groups zzso by letters A to zzso by similarity in activity zzso and zzso zzso in primary structure among these groups can be revealed using DNA zzso The zzso acid sequences of four zzso zzso zzso III and zzso zzso were used to design two DNA zzso in order to detect similar genes among groups of zzso zzso strains demonstrating zzso zzso In addition to the appropriate parent strain, each probe zzso with the total DNA from only two out of the 24 zzso group type zzso Thus, the remaining 18 groups of strains produce zzso that differ from the zzso zzso to zzso In order to explore the similarity between genes coding for zzso zzso and zzso the group B specific probe was zzso to detect a DNA zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso The sequence of the cloned zzso codes for three open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso similar to those of strains zzso and zzso The gene zzso is strongly similar to the structural gene zzso zzso but only one zzso transcript of about 300 bases was detected by Northern zzso using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone was verified by zzso
