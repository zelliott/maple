Spinal muscular zzso zzso one of the most common fatal zzso zzso diseases, is characterized by zzso of motor zzso and muscular zzso The zzso disease zzso termed Survival of Motor zzso zzso is deleted or zzso in over zzso of zzso zzso The function of the zzso protein is zzso We found that zzso is tightly associated with a novel zzso zzso and together they form a specific complex with several zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts directly with several of the zzso zzso core zzso including B, zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso has significant sequence similarity with zzso a zzso protein critical for zzso zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and function and provide a likely molecular mechanism for the cause of zzso
