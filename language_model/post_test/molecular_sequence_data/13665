We report the cloning and sequencing of zzso DNA zzso a zzso zzso heavy chain from the zzso zzso zzso In a zzso stretch of zzso zzso of DNA from the left arm of linkage group I, we have found a gene that is predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso This gene is composed of 15 zzso and 14 relatively short zzso and it has significant zzso to the other zzso heavy chains in the zzso The deduced molecular mass of the derived zzso is zzso zzso As with other zzso heavy chains that have been zzso to date, it contains four zzso motifs that form part of a consensus sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso heavy chains shows that regions of zzso among all zzso are clustered in the zzso terminal two-thirds of the zzso whereas the zzso terminal one-third of the heavy chains may contain zzso that specify functions that differ between the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso heavy zzso
