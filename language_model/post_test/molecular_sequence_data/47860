zzso genetic markers from zzso aligned zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso DNA were developed for the four closely related species of zzso and zzso zzso that have invaded North America; the zebra zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the dark false zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the Asian clam zzso zzso of the sister zzso zzso zzso relationships were examined among the four zzso and comparisons were made with native zzso populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Tests were conducted for zzso zzso zzso which occur in some other zzso zzso zzso and divergence rates were tested between stem zzso and loop zzso regions of secondary zzso There were 251 variable zzso sites, of which 99 were zzso zzso zzso transition to zzso ratio was zzso and both accumulated zzso in stem and loop regions, suggesting appropriate zzso zzso zzso distance zzso with the fossil record estimated the zzso sequence divergence as zzso zzso zzso zzso per million zzso zzso and zzso appear to have zzso about zzso zzso zzso million years zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear separated by about zzso zzso zzso million zzso No zzso variation was found, including between zzso and North American zzso among shallow and deep zzso of zzso zzso and between the zzso zzso zzso markers were developed to distinguish among the species at all life history zzso allowing rapid identification in areas of zzso zzso
