zzso tuberculosis zzso harbors an intervening sequence in its open reading frame, presumed to zzso an zzso zzso required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso ability of zzso has been zzso the identification of its putative zzso activity has remained zzso To investigate whether zzso possesses zzso activity, zzso intervening sequence was zzso zzso and zzso to zzso Here we show that zzso bound both zzso and zzso DNA with similar affinity but failed to cleave DNA in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in the presence of alternative zzso but required both zzso and zzso to generate linear zzso zzso We observed that zzso was able to inflict a staggered zzso break 24 zzso upstream of the zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso Similar to a few zzso zzso DNA zzso by zzso was specific with an exceptionally long zzso site spanning 22 zzso The kinetic mechanism of zzso promoted zzso supports a sequential rather than concerted zzso of strand zzso with the formation of zzso zzso DNA as an zzso Together, these results reveal that zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso specific zzso which is likely to be important for zzso process in zzso
