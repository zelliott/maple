The activity on zzso of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso depends on its membrane zzso induced by binding of its zzso domain to zzso A zzso zzso extension to the zzso domain might also contribute to its specific binding to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso binding to other zzso zzso We have analyzed in zzso the relative contributions to zzso binding of the zzso domain and zzso extension by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso including or not including the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso made of equal proportions of the neutral lipids zzso and zzso and supplemented or not with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of various zzso zzso was measured as a function of the zzso concentration and of the medium zzso zzso Both proteins bound with higher affinity to zzso than to zzso the selectivity for zzso being highest for the nominal zzso zzso We observed also a clear selectivity of zzso over zzso for stimulating the activity of zzso on zzso with zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso Our data suggest that the zzso domain provides the specific zzso binding site and some unspecific zzso interaction with zzso zzso whereas the zzso C domain contributes to binding mainly by unspecific zzso interactions zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso C of a zzso in the C domain reduces the zzso affinity of the zzso domain for zzso but does not affect the zzso zzso
