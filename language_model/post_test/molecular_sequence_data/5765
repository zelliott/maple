zzso in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso cause abnormal forward locomotion and an zzso zzso zzso zzso also reduce the zzso sensitivity to zzso and block a form of hypersensitivity to volatile zzso We report here the cloning and molecular characterization of zzso and show that it encodes a member of the zzso family of proteins that is zzso identical to another zzso zzso zzso It is significant that zzso zzso share all zzso with zzso zzso zzso in another zzso zzso also share all tested zzso with zzso zzso including identical zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that multiple genes are required for the same zzso zzso zzso proteins are implicated in the function of zzso gap zzso and, based on a new alignment including 24 members from zzso zzso we present a refined model for the structure of zzso proteins suggesting that zzso could form a zzso zzso We also show that zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso leads to a cold sensitivity that likely affects a step in protein expression rather than zzso Finally, we speculate on the basis of the zzso resistance and zzso response zzso
