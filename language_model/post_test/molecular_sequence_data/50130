The zzso of zzso cells is formed by zzso zzso proteins characterized by a central zzso rod flanked by zzso head and tail zzso of variable zzso Most zzso described in 18 distinct zzso disrupt highly zzso regions at the boundaries of the rod, which have been recognized as zones of overlap during zzso alignment and assembly into intermediate zzso We recently reported the first zzso located in a zzso tail domain zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report two novel zzso zzso that are predicted to alter the tail of zzso 1 or zzso 5, leading to an zzso form of zzso zzso and a mild form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the patient with zzso zzso revealed a de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 9 of zzso predicted to result in an zzso 69 zzso zzso 1 zzso In the patient with mild zzso zzso zzso we identified a single zzso deletion zzso in zzso 9 of zzso leading to zzso and translation of an abnormal V2 domain, 35 zzso acids longer than the native zzso 5 zzso Our results, together with previous zzso establish the existence of a zzso of zzso disorders due to zzso zzso altering the zzso tail zzso that are characterized by zzso zzso
