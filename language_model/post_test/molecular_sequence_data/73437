The function of the human zzso zzso zzso proteins is zzso In cultured zzso cells the proteins associate with the zzso intermediate filaments zzso and, for some zzso types, zzso zzso type 16 zzso induce collapse of the zzso zzso An zzso zzso motif zzso is a zzso feature of many zzso zzso In a previous study we showed that deletion of this region from the zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso the zzso of the zzso proteins to the zzso zzso in a zzso virus zzso human zzso cell line zzso Roberts, zzso zzso zzso zzso Gibson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Barton, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins of zzso and zzso have little sequence zzso except at the N zzso zzso to establish the role of sequences other than those at the N zzso we have performed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso The results of the analysis were as zzso zzso similar to findings for the zzso zzso no zzso of zzso zzso sequences zzso than the zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso protein which fails to zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso 61 to zzso is not essential for association with the zzso and zzso deletion of zzso sequences zzso 84 to zzso zzso corresponding to part of a domain zzso between zzso zzso proteins affects the ability of the zzso protein to induce zzso collapse, despite zzso with the zzso zzso Further analysis of this region showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso 86 and 88 are zzso In addition, we show that the zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso and exists as several zzso zzso complexes which could represent zzso The zzso sequences zzso 84 to zzso in particular zzso 86 and 88, are important in the formation of these zzso zzso The results of this study support our zzso that the zzso proteins include functional zzso at the N zzso and the C zzso with the intervening sequences possibly acting as a flexible zzso
