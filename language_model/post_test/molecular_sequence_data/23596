zzso made a resurgence in the mid-1980s and now kills approximately 3 million people a zzso The zzso of tuberculosis as a public health threat, the high zzso of zzso persons and the proliferation of zzso strains have created a need to develop new zzso zzso zzso and other zzso in the zzso zzso are attractive targets for development of zzso zzso agents, zzso and zzso drugs, because the zzso is essential in these species whereas it is absent from zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acid zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution, clearly revealing the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso This is the first three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso In zzso the zzso zzso that is strictly zzso in zzso zzso forms a hydrogen bond and salt bridge with zzso and assists in positioning the zzso group of zzso for zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso groups interact with zzso and zzso The crystal structure of zzso will provide crucial information for the zzso of the mechanism of the zzso zzso reaction and for the development of a new generation of drugs against zzso
