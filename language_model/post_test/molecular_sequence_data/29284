zzso elements belonging to the previously identified zzso zzso are thought to have inserted in the human zzso after the divergence of humans from zzso primates and therefore should not be present in zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso based screening of over 500 zzso zzso zzso resulted in the recovery of a few zzso zzso elements that also resided at zzso positions in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated these zzso zzso insertions represented gene conversion events of pre-existing ancient zzso elements or independent parallel insertions of older zzso elements in the same zzso zzso The level of gene conversion between zzso elements suggests that it may have a significant influence on the single zzso diversity within the zzso All the instances of multiple independent zzso insertions within the same small zzso regions were recovered from the zzso monkey zzso indicating a higher zzso amplification rate in zzso monkeys relative to many other zzso This study suggests that the majority of zzso insertions in zzso zzso are the products of unique evolutionary zzso
