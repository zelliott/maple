The zzso zzso of five zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in rat pancreatic zzso was studied by zzso using rabbit zzso zzso against mouse or rat zzso zzso Animals were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were zzso Some specimens were embedded in zzso serially zzso and zzso for zzso insulin, zzso and the zzso for light microscopic zzso Others were prepared for zzso zzso by the zzso zzso By these methods, zzso zzso was observed on the lateral zzso of pancreatic zzso whereas zzso zzso was predominantly localized in the zzso of zzso and was not found in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was zzso localized in the zzso of zzso compared to that of zzso However, zzso and zzso were either barely or not at all zzso in any zzso These results suggest that rat zzso take up zzso by at least three different processes and that blood zzso levels could be modulated zzso zzso a high zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by a low zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and by a low zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
