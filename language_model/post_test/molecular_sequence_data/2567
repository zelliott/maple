zzso mice were zzso with zzso and zzso 2 days later with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso mixed with zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso Seven days later, zzso zzso zzso were removed and zzso cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a major zzso responsible for proliferation of the zzso zzso of zzso H into zzso significantly enhanced the zzso response compared with zzso H zzso Response to zzso zzso protein was only moderate, and zzso of this protein into zzso did not improve the zzso As an attempt to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso three synthetic peptides previously found to elicit a strong zzso response were used both as zzso and stimulating zzso None of the peptides was able to elicit a secondary response when zzso zzso cells were zzso in zzso However, each zzso primed T cells for a secondary challenge with zzso zzso zzso which was demonstrated by proliferation and a zzso hypersensitivity zzso and also by transfer experiments with zzso zzso
