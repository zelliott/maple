The zzso zzso zzso was isolated in its inactive zzso form from zzso guinea pig serum and the complete zzso acid sequence was zzso The zzso was isolated using a modification of previously described methods for zzso zzso and yielded 18 zzso of guinea zzso zzso judged homogeneous by cellulose zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso acid zzso and sequence zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation of intact zzso zzso following zzso acid zzso and of four peptides obtained from zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of reduced and zzso zzso zzso The sequence is as zzso zzso pig zzso zzso has approximately zzso overall sequence identity with human, zzso rat and mouse zzso As with zzso from other species, the guinea pig zzso has an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso at positions 23, 24, 37, 50, 57, and zzso
