The effects of human red cell zzso A zzso on the expression of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso has been examined in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with band 3 increased zzso zzso zzso transport into the zzso The effect of zzso was particularly noticeable at low band 3 zzso and less marked at high band 3 zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso transport was specific to zzso and was not observed when either zzso B or zzso C was zzso with band zzso zzso of whole zzso zzso showed the amount of band 3 zzso was not affected by zzso at zzso zzso zzso More band 3 was detected at the zzso surface by zzso when zzso was also zzso zzso treatment of intact zzso was also used to assess surface band 3 and greater zzso of band 3 by zzso was observed when zzso was zzso Band 3 synthesis and assembly into canine pancreatic zzso in the zzso zzso translation system was not altered by zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso zzso the zzso of band 3 to the plasma membrane at some point during band 3 zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso is not essential for the expression of band 3 in red cells, since zzso individuals have apparently normal levels of band zzso Other zzso mechanisms must also allow zzso of band 3 to the surface membrane in zzso cells and zzso zzso may affect the rate of zzso of band 3 at the cell surface, rather than the final level in the plasma zzso
