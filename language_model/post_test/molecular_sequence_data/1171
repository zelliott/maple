We isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso and zzso it by primer walking using zzso sequences as sequencing zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA consists of zzso zzso and its structural organization is zzso in comparison with other zzso Using zzso control region zzso we compared related species from the zzso zzso zzso zzso showing the similarity of zzso zzso isolated from Korean and Japanese zzso In this paper, we report the basic characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including structural organization, base composition of zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso and characteristics of zzso zzso These findings are zzso to aquaculture and to molecular zzso in the zzso zzso
