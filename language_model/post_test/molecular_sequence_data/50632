zzso of the coat protein of white zzso mosaic zzso zzso were investigated using zzso deletion zzso Whereas plants zzso with zzso transcripts of a full-length zzso clone of zzso produced typical infections, plants zzso with transcripts of each zzso did not produce symptoms, and viral zzso species were not detected by Northern zzso The zzso were able to replicate in zzso although, relative to the zzso zzso profile, the level of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was zzso These results indicate a role for the coat protein in efficient zzso transport in zzso zzso particles were detected in zzso extracts zzso with transcripts of a zzso in which the coat protein was truncated by 31 zzso zzso This result suggests that the lack of zzso transport in plants was not due solely to a failure of the zzso to form virus zzso zzso roles for the coat protein in transport and replication are zzso A zzso open reading frame, internal to the coat protein zzso was shown by zzso analysis not to be essential for replication or zzso
