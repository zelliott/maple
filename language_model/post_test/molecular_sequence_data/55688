zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso stimulates the zzso of many zzso genes by catalyzing the zzso of the zzso element binding protein zzso zzso the zzso or zzso of zzso gene zzso would require the zzso of zzso by a nuclear protein zzso In zzso cells treated with the protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid, zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter was enhanced over the level of zzso gene zzso observed in cells treated with zzso zzso This process was zzso at least in part, by a region of the zzso promoter that binds zzso Likewise, zzso acid prevents the zzso of zzso zzso in rat liver nuclear extracts and enhances the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The ability of zzso acid to enhance zzso zzso in zzso was entirely dependent on the presence of zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity present in nuclear extracts zzso with protein zzso zzso type 2A zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso columns and was zzso resolved from nuclear protein zzso type 1 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity in nuclear extracts was unaffected by the zzso protein zzso which is a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso more efficiently than did nuclear zzso Finally, when zzso zzso was treated with zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso whereas the zzso zzso retained the ability to stimulate zzso Nuclear zzso appears to be the primary zzso that zzso zzso zzso
