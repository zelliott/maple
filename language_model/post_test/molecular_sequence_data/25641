A zzso zzso was designed whose zzso activity can be regulated by varying the concentration of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with a His in rat zzso zzso zzso places a new zzso group on the surface of the zzso near the essential zzso zzso The unique spatial orientation of these His side chains results in the formation of a stable, zzso site that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Occupancy of this site by a metal zzso prevents the zzso group of zzso from participating as a general base in zzso As a consequence, the primary effect of the transition metal zzso is to inhibit the zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso The apparent Ki for this zzso is in the zzso range for copper, nickel, and zzso the tightest binding being to zzso at 21 zzso zzso zzso activity can be fully restored by removing the bound zzso zzso with zzso Multiple cycles of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso demonstrate that zzso regulatory control has been introduced into the zzso These results describe a novel mode of zzso of zzso zzso activity that may also prove zzso to other zzso
