zzso specific for the zzso acid hypothetical protein zzso by the zzso zzso of a human zzso gene were produced in rabbits by zzso with a zzso synthetic zzso When used to probe zzso cell extracts for the zzso product of this natural fusion zzso the zzso zzso detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 16,000 Da by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso An zzso protein of identical mobility was detected in organisms ranging from zzso to man, indicating that the extension zzso like zzso is highly zzso The zzso protein was isolated from calf zzso and direct sequencing revealed the first 16 zzso acids to be identical to those predicted from the extension portion of the human zzso Thus, zzso was no longer present at the zzso zzso The zzso bovine extension protein failed to react with a zzso zzso indicating the absence of zzso zzso as zzso Moreover, by zzso gel zzso zzso the extension has a molecular weight of 10,000 zzso a value that zzso more closely to the size of the extension alone zzso zzso than to the intact fusion protein zzso zzso The extension zzso which was found in both zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso cells, persisted at high levels when protein synthesis was blocked with zzso or zzso These results show that the zzso extension protein is the stable, processed product of the zzso fusion zzso
