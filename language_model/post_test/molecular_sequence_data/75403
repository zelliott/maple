A repeated sequence element which is located about 200 zzso upstream from the zzso portion of the muscle zzso gene (probably within a large zzso zzso in the zzso of the sea urchin, zzso zzso has been zzso and shown to contain the sequence features which indicate that it has been zzso by means of an zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is a member of a family which is dispersed and repeated about 800 times in the zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso In zzso zzso of this sequence by zzso zzso III defines a 300 zzso zzso unit which is bounded by a short direct repeated zzso The 3' end of this unit contains a simple 21 zzso zzso sequence characteristic of zzso and a consensus B box portion of an internal zzso zzso III zzso is located 60 to 80 zzso downstream from the two sites of zzso zzso This sequence also contains a 40 zzso region that is related to several zzso sequences zzso the B zzso and a 79 zzso sequence which is zzso to a repeated sequence previously shown to be present within the 3' untranslated portions of the zzso and zzso zzso of this species zzso Analysis of transcripts of this sequence family in zzso from several embryonic stages indicates that its expression is highest at 11 hours zzso (about 128 zzso and drops as development zzso Furthermore, most or all, zzso of this sequence family in zzso isolated from 11 hour zzso is by zzso zzso III, and is from the same strand which is transcribed in zzso
