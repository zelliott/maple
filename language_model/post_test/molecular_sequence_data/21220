zzso zzso is considered as a safe and effective zzso zzso Among various sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in zzso zzso which can be exploited for their zzso zzso zzso property of zzso zzso has been demonstrated against various enteric pathogens in both in zzso and in zzso zzso This study was aimed at characterizing zzso zzso isolated from zzso an ayurvedic fermented zzso and assessing its zzso property against a common zzso zzso zzso 

We report the isolation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and efficacy of its cell free zzso zzso in zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso On the part of zzso zzso zzso was tolerant to pH 2, zzso zzso zzso and simulated gastric zzso Additionally, zzso also exhibited adhesive property to human zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was zzso to enteric pathogens like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and clinical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso study regarding the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso showed a significant decrease in zzso formation and zzso cellular changes in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso caused disruption of tight junction proteins zzso and zzso in zzso cell line, which was prevented by zzso with zzso of zzso 

This is the first study to report isolation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso for its zzso zzso Our study demonstrates the zzso property of zzso to zzso zzso and effect of zzso zzso in reduction of cellular damage caused by zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso
