zzso is a common form of DNA damage to which zzso are particularly zzso We previously reported that oxidized zzso is potentially an important source of DNA zzso in zzso cells and that the incorporated zzso are removed by DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso zzso is associated with a zzso zzso and widespread zzso instability zzso Here, we identify oxidized zzso zzso zzso as an important zzso in this genetic zzso The high spontaneous zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso was attenuated by expression of the zzso zzso which degrades oxidized zzso zzso A high level of zzso abolished their zzso zzso and restored the zzso zzso rate to zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that the presence of zzso reduced the zzso of zzso in all classes, including zzso and also implicated incorporated zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso markedly attenuated the spontaneous zzso rate and reduced zzso It also reduced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso Our findings indicate that incorporation of oxidized zzso from the zzso pool may contribute significantly to the extreme genetic instability of zzso human zzso
