We have previously described zzso killing of human B zzso by two zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of 17 independently derived zzso zzso shows that B cell toxicity is not limited to the two described zzso but is a general property shared by a subset of zzso derived from the zzso zzso As observed by two independent zzso techniques, giant membrane pores were formed on target B cells within zzso zzso of exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso by individual zzso correlated directly to its B cell binding intensity measured by zzso zzso stronger the binding greater the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso region in zzso or in near zzso zzso was necessary but not sufficient for B cell zzso In addition, a particular sequence motif enriched in basic zzso acids in the zzso may be required to supplement the zzso zzso by the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the above sequence requirements have cold zzso activity towards the i zzso of zzso zzso In zzso such zzso cell zzso are rarely detected in healthy adults, but serum levels are dramatically elevated in selective pathological conditions, such as systemic lupus zzso and infectious zzso This strict regulation may be related to the novel and rapid mechanism of human B cell toxicity demonstrated by zzso zzso by a single human zzso zzso
