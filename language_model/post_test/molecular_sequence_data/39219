Recent studies have shown that certain zzso may trigger indirect zzso mechanisms by zzso the plant to create an increased state of resistance, similar to systemic acquired zzso In this study, the capacity of a zzso zzso to alter the expression pattern of certain zzso zzso genes in the root system of tomato plants zzso zzso provided the opportunity to study their cellular expression pattern and to investigate putative roles of these genes in the mechanisms of plant zzso 

zzso the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso zzso zzso techniques, the zzso and distribution of the transcripts of the zzso expressed zzso genes were examined in plants grown on zzso and compared with those of control plants grown on zzso 

zzso levels of expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the roots of tomato plants grown on the zzso A clearly distinguished spatial induction pattern was observed for these zzso zzso zzso transcripts were almost exclusively detected in the zzso cells surrounding the root stele of the main and lateral zzso zzso transcripts were present in the zzso of the root and stem zzso and the zzso and distribution of zzso transcripts was detected in discrete groups of cells that appeared sporadically in both the zzso and vascular system of the zzso suggesting that the gene is not expressed in a zzso zzso In addition, a novel zzso clone was isolated zzso which probably encodes a new tomato zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence that a zzso zzso is able to elicit consistent and increased expression of certain zzso genes in the roots of tomato plants, even in the absence of any zzso The in zzso zzso studies reveal expression patterns which are in accordance with the presence of protein or with the putative roles of the respective zzso zzso The expression of the zzso genes may be triggered by the zzso of the zzso or could be associated with zzso factors of the zzso
