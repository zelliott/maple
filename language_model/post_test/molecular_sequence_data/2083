zzso zzso zzso and derivatives contain the zzso element zzso present in an integrated state or as a free and integrated zzso This element, able to integrate zzso in the zzso of different zzso species, is zzso and zzso zzso zzso Besides these zzso functions, we have shown that the zzso zzso system of zzso presents strong similarities with that of several temperate zzso The integration event is promoted by a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso this zzso is closely linked to the zzso attachment site zzso A small open reading frame zzso zzso the zzso gene and the predicted protein exhibits similarities with zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso The integrated copy of zzso in strain zzso is flanked by zzso sequences zzso and zzso Another zzso sequence zzso is present in this strain and zzso and zzso are the boundaries of a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso from zzso zzso zzso partially similar to zzso zzso gene are found near the zzso integration zone in both zzso zzso The possible origin of zzso an element carrying zzso as well as zzso features, is zzso
