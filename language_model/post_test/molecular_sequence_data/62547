zzso virus nuclear zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso of primary human zzso in zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso acts as a zzso regulator of viral and cellular zzso however at present, few functional zzso of the 140 zzso zzso protein have been completely zzso There are five zzso nuclear zzso signals zzso four zzso and one zzso present in the zzso zzso acid zzso To identify which of these zzso are functional, fusion proteins between green fluorescent protein and deletion zzso of zzso were expressed in zzso zzso Each of the zzso containing at least one of the zzso was targeted to the nucleus of cells whereas a construct lacking all of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso of these zzso demonstrated that only three of the zzso were functional, one at the zzso end zzso zzso one in the middle zzso zzso and one at the zzso end zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
