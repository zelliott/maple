zzso address underlying causes of type 2 diabetes, although their mechanism of action is not clearly zzso The compounds are thought to function as direct zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although zzso the weaker zzso of the two zzso now in clinical use, seems to have more useful effects on circulating zzso We have used zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to identify a novel binding site in zzso A zzso binding site for zzso was zzso from the zzso with zzso and migrated as a large complex by size exclusion zzso The binding correlated with a zzso protein zzso marked by a zzso zzso in both zzso location and selectivity of competition by zzso The protein was isolated and identified by mass zzso analysis and zzso zzso Three synthetic peptides with potential zzso properties were zzso from the predicted zzso sequence to generate zzso in zzso Western blots show that this zzso which we have termed zzso is located in the zzso fraction of zzso brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, showing the identical zzso location and migration on zzso as the protein zzso specifically by the zzso zzso The protein exists in low levels in zzso and expression increases zzso in differentiated zzso The synthetic protein bound to solid phase associated with a complex of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso It is possible that zzso modification of the function of the zzso target may contribute to zzso lowering and/or zzso zzso
