zzso are mobile genetic elements found within the zzso of various organisms including bacteria, zzso plants and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were found included in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso from such fragments were zzso using specially designed zzso zzso and zzso In order to detect insertions of the zzso element, both zzso were used and one of them included a region of the zzso zzso and the other one had the right repeat and part of the bacterial zzso zzso The zzso products obtained from strain zzso were used as a pattern for zzso size comparisons when DNA samples from other zzso zzso strains were used as template for the zzso zzso zzso were observed concerning the zzso products of such zzso when some zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso and plum were zzso For the zzso strains only the strains zzso and zzso produced fragments with different sizes or weak band zzso Such variations in the zzso zzso zzso related to disrupted zzso copies are probably due to the possibility of such a zzso element being still able to duplicate even after deletion events might have taken place and also because the bacterial strains in which the main differences were detected are derived from different host plants cultivated under different climate conditions from the one used as zzso
