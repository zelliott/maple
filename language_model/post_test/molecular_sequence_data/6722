In zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso and activates those zzso its zzso To determine how this zzso also functions as an zzso we attempted to clone zzso genes by searching for insertions of the zzso zzso that express zzso zzso zzso zzso One such isolate was zzso The region upstream of zzso was zzso in zzso coli in such a way that it could be replaced in the zzso zzso zzso after appropriate zzso Analysis of zzso zzso deletions located an zzso zzso promoter to within a zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso the 3' end of an zzso zzso to zzso genes zzso zzso zzso with highest zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso the zzso end of an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso gene zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso and just upstream of the latter, a sequence with zzso to known zzso binding sites in the upstream part of the zzso zzso zzso The same region has also been zzso by others as part of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing project, revealing that the zzso gene is the first in a cluster termed zzso zzso fragments containing the putative zzso zzso but not those lacking it, showed retarded zzso mobility in the presence of zzso zzso A 277 zzso zzso zzso also showed anomalous mobility in the absence of zzso consistent with its being zzso zzso zzso I zzso localized zzso binding to zzso zzso to zzso (the zzso zzso Such a location for an zzso binding site, zzso overlapping the zzso start, is zzso
