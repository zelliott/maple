A zzso clone zzso was isolated from a soybean zzso zzso library using a zzso clone zzso for zzso zzso II as a zzso zzso was a zzso zzso with an open reading frame that zzso a protein of putative 309 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was identical to that of zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso was investigated by Northern zzso zzso by the reverse zzso chain reaction with subsequent zzso zzso with the zzso for zzso zzso II as a probe, and by zzso analysis with a zzso zzso that was specific to zzso zzso zzso The results suggested that the transcript of zzso was present in developing zzso and that zzso II accumulated during the zzso zzso This is the first report of the isolation of zzso for zzso II from zzso tissue and the results demonstrate that zzso II in soybean zzso is identical to that in soybean zzso
