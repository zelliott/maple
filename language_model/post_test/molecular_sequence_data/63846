Once a new zzso is zzso one of the important questions is to determine the presence and absence of biological zzso Analysis of biological pathways in a zzso is a complicated task since a number of biological entities are involved in pathways and biological pathways in different organisms are not zzso zzso zzso identification and analysis thus involves a number of zzso tools and databases and typically done in comparison with pathways in other zzso This zzso requirement is much beyond the capability of zzso so information systems for zzso zzso and analyzing biological pathways are much zzso We introduce a new comparative zzso analysis zzso zzso which zzso various resources and zzso tools using an interactive zzso web interface for reliable zzso zzso 

zzso allows users to compare biological pathways in multiple zzso using a spreadsheet style web interface where various zzso analysis can be performed either to compare zzso zzso sequence zzso and pathways zzso zzso hole zzso to search a zzso for de zzso prediction of zzso or to zzso a zzso in comparison with reference zzso of zzso To fill in zzso holes or make de zzso zzso predictions, multiple zzso methods such as zzso zzso zzso (a method of our own introduced in this zzso and zzso search are integrated in zzso Our experiments show that zzso and zzso search methods generally outperform zzso and zzso search methods in terms of sensitivity, but zzso search performs poorly in terms of zzso detecting more false positive as zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso search method performs best in terms of both sensitivity and zzso Gene neighborhood and zzso neighborhood zzso zzso zzso tools can be used to get context information that is complementary to conventional zzso map zzso 

zzso is an interactive zzso for zzso zzso zzso and analysis where experts can perform various zzso domain, context analysis, using an intuitive and interactive zzso zzso
