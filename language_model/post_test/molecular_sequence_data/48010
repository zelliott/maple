The identification and characterization of new zzso would widen the knowledge of the zzso mechanism of insulin dependent diabetes zzso zzso of zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cell zzso library with zzso zzso diabetic zzso mice zzso resulted in the isolation of a strong positive zzso named the clone zzso of zzso zzso without a zzso A zzso After zzso amplification of the zzso end zzso complete zzso sequence of the clone 3-5 gene consisting of zzso zzso showed that the 3-5 gene had the theoretical open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso However, the real zzso protein of the clone 3-5 was only 21 zzso acids long zzso by only 63 zzso The 21 zzso acids were expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso The zzso 3-5 zzso protein was examined for its zzso with zzso zzso mice zzso by zzso The only zzso form of the 3-5 protein showed a binding zzso with zzso mice zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso of 3-5 protein was important for zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso to the 3-5 protein was about zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and acute diabetic zzso mice zzso zzso However, the zzso from other mouse strains such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show a positive zzso to the 3-5 zzso which indicated that immune zzso against the 3-5 protein was zzso diabetic zzso
