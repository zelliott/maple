zzso from two immediate early zzso genes have been identified in cells infected with the gamma zzso zzso zzso One is a zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso of virus DNA zzso the other is a zzso zzso zzso from the gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for each of these zzso have been used in in zzso zzso experiments to compare their expression in individual cells in infected zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso accumulates zzso throughout the population of infected cells and prior to the zzso zzso of zzso from the gene for the zzso zzso protein in the same population of zzso This zzso in the timing of expression of zzso from the zzso zzso gene is paralleled by the zzso zzso of the protein zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso is independent of expression of the zzso zzso gene and that expression of the zzso gene requires (or is prevented zzso factors which do not affect zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso
