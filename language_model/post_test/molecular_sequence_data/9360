zzso and clinical studies demonstrate the feasibility of treating zzso and zzso Cell Disease zzso by zzso transfer of the human zzso zzso However, previous studies have not addressed whether the ability of zzso zzso to increase zzso synthesis might vary in different zzso generated zzso zzso carrying the human zzso gene with and without an zzso zzso and compared their ability to induce zzso synthesis in zzso and in zzso zzso We found that zzso of an zzso zzso leads to higher, potentially therapeutic levels of human zzso through a novel mechanism that links the rate of zzso of the transgenic zzso zzso during zzso differentiation with zzso binding and efficient translation, as reported here for the first zzso We also established a zzso zzso to test the ability of this novel zzso to zzso adult zzso in zzso precursors and in zzso cells isolated from patients affected by zzso and zzso Among the zzso patients, we identified a subset of specimens in which zzso production can be achieved using fewer copies of the zzso integrated than in zzso In zzso specimens the treatment with zzso ameliorates zzso by increasing adult zzso zzso zzso and zzso reducing the zzso zzso zzso zzso results suggest two major zzso First, we discovered that for the purpose of expressing the zzso gene the zzso element is particularly zzso Second, our analysis of a large group of specimens from zzso and zzso patients indicates that clinical trials could benefit from a simple test to predict the relationship between the number of zzso copies integrated and the total amount of zzso produced in the zzso cells of prospective zzso This approach would provide vital information to select the best candidates for these clinical trials, before patients undergo zzso and bone zzso zzso
