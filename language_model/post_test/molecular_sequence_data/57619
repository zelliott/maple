zzso zzso have previously been shown to play a crucial role in zzso degradation via the modified zzso zzso zzso Recently, the zzso induced in zzso bacteria have been classified into three groups on the basis of their specificity towards zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso have now been zzso to apparent zzso and characterized with respect to molecular mass and zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso has a distinct preference for zzso and did not convert the trans zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso to a significant zzso In properties like zzso acid zzso pH optimum of activity, and lack of zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso differed substantially from zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
