zzso zzso activity is required for triggering entry into zzso in all known zzso zzso mechanisms have evolved for regulating zzso activity so that zzso occurs in a timely manner, when preparations for its execution are zzso In zzso zzso zzso and a related zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are required for preventing premature zzso of the zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso in zzso we screened for zzso clones that rescue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from lethal zzso zzso One of the genes identified in this screen, zzso zzso zzso encodes a new zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to human and zzso zzso zzso and can inhibit zzso activity by zzso a critical zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso provided to zzso and is zzso expressed during the zzso divisions of zzso zzso remains high in the zzso cells of the central nervous system well after cells in the rest of the zzso have ceased zzso The loss of zzso expressed zzso does not lead to zzso catastrophe during zzso cycles 14 to zzso This result may indicate that zzso provided zzso is sufficient for regulating zzso during zzso or it may reflect the presence of a redundant zzso zzso zzso as in zzso zzso
