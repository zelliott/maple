We zzso the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso and showed by zzso protection experiments that zzso bound specifically to sites close to each end of zzso These specific binding sites are close to, and in the same relative orientation to, binding sites for the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the formation of zzso structures at the ends of zzso that help to correctly align the ends so that zzso can zzso
