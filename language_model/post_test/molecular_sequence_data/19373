zzso zzso a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a sole carbon and energy source with nitrate as an electron zzso Previously, we showed that zzso degradation by this zzso is initiated by two zzso steps, both zzso by zzso zzso that lead to the formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study presents evidence for the further degradation of zzso in cell extracts to form zzso and zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso genes required for zzso zzso zzso a zzso library with zzso DNA was constructed and transformed into the zzso related species zzso zzso which cannot grow with zzso By zzso zzso a zzso was identified that gained the ability to metabolize zzso Its zzso designated zzso carries a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing 22 putative zzso In cell extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso carried all of the genes necessary for zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso insertions in different genes of zzso zzso eight open reading frames were found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were assigned on the basis of sequence analysis and zzso zzso with two zzso zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso involved in ring zzso have also been zzso This work provides the first example of the identification of genes involved in the zzso degradation of aromatic compounds by zzso expression of a zzso library in a zzso related zzso
