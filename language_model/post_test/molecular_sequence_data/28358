The three large zzso segments of influenza C virus zzso were cloned and zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences were compared with those of the zzso zzso proteins of influenza A and B zzso The coding strategy of the C virus zzso segments is the same as that for the large A and B virus segments as one long open reading frame is present in each zzso zzso segment 1 of influenza C virus encodes the equivalent of the zzso zzso it has an approximate zzso sequence identity with the corresponding zzso zzso influenza A and B virus zzso zzso The zzso protein of influenza C virus, coded for by segment 2, has an approximate zzso sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of influenza A and B viruses including the zzso sequence motif found in many zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is thus the most highly zzso protein among the influenza A, B, and C zzso Although the protein coded for by zzso 3 of influenza C virus shows an approximate zzso sequence identity with the acid zzso zzso proteins of the A and B zzso its sequence does not display any acid charge features at neutral zzso This protein is thus referred to as the zzso (rather than the zzso protein of influenza C zzso
