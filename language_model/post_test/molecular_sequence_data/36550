Virtually all zzso sequences carry a zzso zzso pattern, presumably involved in the translation frame monitoring mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The hidden pattern, zzso zzso representing zzso N any zzso is further refined by extensive zzso analysis of zzso zzso According to zzso preferences in the three positions of coding zzso it appears now as zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso 2) generate the motif zzso The same motif is found by regarding the expected avoidance of zzso base zzso in hypothetical transient complementary complexes between zzso and zzso This hidden pattern, in its refined consensus form, zzso is an almost perfect complementary match to a unique site in small zzso zzso the universally zzso zzso zzso loop at position 525 (of zzso small zzso zzso zzso see zzso This strongly suggests that the 525 site is a major structural component of the previously proposed zzso mechanism which is based on the zzso contacts between zzso and three segments of zzso zzso with the original proposition, this site is one of three believed to interact with zzso
