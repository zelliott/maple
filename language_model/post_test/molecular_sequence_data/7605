A study of zzso zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso infection in a captive colony of 23 zzso zzso zzso indicated that 17 animals had high human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso Genealogical analysis suggested mainly a zzso transmission of this zzso Three long-term zzso lines, established from peripheral blood zzso cell cultures from three zzso zzso produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first complete zzso sequence of an zzso zzso zzso obtained for one of these zzso indicated an overall genetic organization similar to that of zzso but with a zzso zzso for the structural genes ranging from zzso to zzso compared with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Asian zzso The Tax and Rex regulatory proteins were well zzso while the zzso region, known to zzso new proteins in zzso zzso reading frames I and zzso was more divergent than that in the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso of 522 zzso of the zzso zzso gene from zzso peripheral blood zzso cell zzso from five of the zzso monkeys was zzso zzso trees constructed with the long terminal repeat and zzso zzso and zzso regions demonstrated that this new zzso occupies a unique position within the Asian zzso and zzso zzso being, by most zzso related more to the zzso zzso zzso than to any other Asian zzso These data raise new hypotheses on the possible zzso viral transmission between monkeys carrying zzso and early zzso zzso ancestors of the present day zzso zzso during their zzso from the Southeast Asian land mass to the greater Australian zzso
