zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the central component of the zzso complex, zzso the complex to the zzso and harboring the binding site for von zzso factor zzso Previous studies suggest that the zzso function in pigs differs from that in humans, especially with respect to the interaction between zzso and zzso However, we have little knowledge about the function of zzso zzso which is important with regard to studies of cardiovascular disease, zzso and surgery that use pigs as animal zzso To extend this information, we cloned and analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and includes an open reading frame that encodes zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed zzso identity with human zzso whereas the deduced zzso acid sequences were 59% zzso The zzso binding domain shares the highest identity among different species, whereas the zzso domain shows zzso zzso of zzso function by using zzso zzso zzso revealed remarkably lower levels of zzso in zzso than human zzso According to the sequence analysis and zzso zzso tests, we propose that the function of zzso especially regarding the zzso interaction, differs between pigs and zzso This characterization of zzso zzso will enhance our knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso
