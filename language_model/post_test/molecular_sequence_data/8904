Alternative zzso of zzso transcripts is a critical and extensively zzso mechanism of gene zzso In this chapter, we describe a series of fluorescent and zzso zzso reporters our lab has used to facilitate the study of alternative zzso regulation in cultured zzso Through the use of different versions of these zzso the inclusion level of a cassette zzso can be directly zzso by zzso or zzso activity, thereby making it possible to establish zzso zzso for induced zzso zzso or zzso A successful application of these zzso in a zzso zzso screen led to the identification of a cell zzso regulator of zzso zzso illustrating the power of these reporters to yield novel insights into alternative zzso The methods and zzso described are adaptable for genetic screens to uncover novel regulators of a broader set of alternative zzso events in other gene zzso These reporters also have a dynamic range that is suitable for small zzso screening for compounds that can regulate zzso
