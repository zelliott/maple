A new member of the human zzso zzso called zzso zzso has been found by expressed sequence tag zzso sequencing in zzso cell and fetal skin zzso cell zzso zzso The sequence of a full-length zzso cell zzso clone contained an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso signal zzso and a mature protein of 121 zzso zzso including four zzso zzso and motifs of importance for the zzso activity of Family 2 zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso E was produced in a zzso expression system and zzso An zzso against the zzso protein could be used for affinity zzso of zzso E from human zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso The mature zzso protein processed by insect cells started at zzso acid 4 zzso C zzso and displayed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso B zzso values of zzso and 32 zzso respectively), in competition with zzso zzso E is thus a functional zzso zzso inhibitor despite relatively low zzso acid sequence similarities with human zzso zzso identity with sequences for the Family 2 zzso C, D, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the Family 1 zzso A and B, and zzso 2 and 3 of the Family 3 zzso zzso Unlike other human low Mr zzso zzso E is a zzso carrying an zzso zzso chain at position zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso E gene is expressed in most human zzso with the highest zzso amounts found in zzso and zzso A zzso high zzso of zzso E clones in zzso libraries from fetal skin zzso and zzso membrane cells zzso of clones zzso indicates a protective role of zzso E during fetal zzso
