zzso communities were studied in several periodically zzso zzso zzso When zzso each soil had an zzso upper layer and consumed methane from the atmosphere (at zzso zzso In most zzso zzso the zzso values for methane were between 70 and 800 zzso These are higher than most values observed in dry zzso soils, but lower than those measured in zzso Based on zzso retrieval of the zzso and zzso of partial zzso gene zzso type II zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were abundant zzso zzso zzso target molecules per gram of dry zzso Type I zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso and zzso were detected in some zzso Six zzso sequence types not closely related to sequences from cultivated zzso were detected as well, indicating that diverse zzso zzso were zzso Three zzso were incubated under different mixing ratios of zzso methane to examine zzso incorporation into zzso fatty acids zzso zzso fatty acids typical of type II zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso in all zzso after incubation under an atmosphere containing 30 zzso of zzso zzso under 500 zzso of methane resulted in zzso of additional zzso besides zzso and zzso suggesting that the composition of the active zzso community changed in response to increased methane zzso In two soils, zzso zzso typical of type I zzso were strongly zzso after incubation under the high methane mixing ratio zzso Type II zzso are most likely responsible for atmospheric methane zzso in these soils, while type I zzso become active when methane is produced in the zzso
