zzso display of zzso clones prepared from zzso cells was used to identify host cell proteins that bound to zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso but not to empty zzso One gene found in several clones zzso a zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein zzso that was very similar in sequence to the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso representing a sequence near the zzso end of the zzso which is exposed on the outside of the full zzso but did not bind most other terminal zzso Adding zzso zzso to an in zzso zzso reaction using viral DNA as a template inhibited the production of the second strand after zzso zzso zzso but prior to zzso zzso zzso bound to various regions of the viral zzso including a region between zzso 295 and 330 of the viral zzso which has been associated with zzso zzso of the zzso minute virus of mice, which is zzso by a zzso structure of the DNA and cellular zzso zzso of the protein in zzso cells from a zzso zzso made them largely resistant to zzso zzso zzso of the protein binding site within the zzso end viral zzso did not affect replication of the zzso
