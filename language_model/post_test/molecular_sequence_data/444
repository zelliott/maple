zzso zzso type 1 zzso is one of nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by a zzso protein with an expanded zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso is implicated in zzso zzso Previous studies, utilizing zzso cell lines and a zzso zzso model of zzso suggest that zzso zzso at zzso renders it less susceptible to zzso This work also indicated that zzso from zzso mouse zzso zzso promotes the zzso of zzso at zzso and severity of zzso Here, we examined the zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso zzso cells, a prominent site of pathology in zzso We found that while zzso of zzso is associated with a stabilization of zzso in zzso cells, zzso of zzso either in zzso or in a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not decrease the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso decreased zzso of zzso These results argue against zzso as the in zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso and suggest that zzso zzso protein zzso is the active zzso zzso in the zzso
