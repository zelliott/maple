A gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was zzso in zzso coli, and the produced zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso is an extremely zzso zzso its activity was not lost after incubation at 100 degrees C for 10 zzso The zzso has a molecular mass of approximately 93 zzso and consists of four zzso with an identical molecular mass of 24 zzso This is the first report of the presence of zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso folds into an zzso The zzso unit consists of two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso axis generates the functional zzso The main chain coordinate of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is quite similar to that of the zzso coli zzso There was no significant difference in zzso interactions and the number of zzso pairs between the zzso structures of the two zzso However, a significant difference in the zzso structure was zzso The area of the zzso interface in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is much larger compared with the zzso coli zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso is 10 zzso acids longer than the zzso coli zzso in the zzso region and has an additional zzso zzso The zzso zzso produces a unique zzso zzso This promotes the formation of a functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and strengthens the zzso zzso zzso These structural features are considered to be responsible for the extremely high stability of the zzso zzso zzso This is the first description of the structure of zzso zzso and of zzso from the zzso zzso
