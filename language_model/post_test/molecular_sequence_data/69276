To zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso injury in zzso B virus zzso infection, the zzso of zzso zzso as a target for zzso T zzso zzso response was examined using zzso zzso virus zzso expressing surface protein zzso zzso protein zzso and core protein zzso of zzso zzso mice zzso were zzso with each zzso Their zzso cells were then harvested and zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso which zzso expressed zzso B surface zzso zzso zzso B e zzso zzso and zzso B core zzso zzso and used as zzso As the targets, L cells zzso infected with individual zzso were zzso zzso test was performed with various combinations and ratios of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso against zzso targets was greatest with zzso specific zzso on average at an zzso ratio of zzso among all the zzso zzso zzso against zzso target also revealed rather high zzso zzso zzso zzso at an zzso ratio of zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso to the targets expressing other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed less zzso activity against zzso targets zzso zzso zzso at an zzso ratio of zzso The zzso responses were blocked by zzso and zzso zzso complex zzso class I zzso but not by zzso or zzso class zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso especially PC, is a dominant target for the zzso class zzso zzso in zzso mice and that this system may work as an efficient model to study zzso of zzso zzso
