Most clock genes zzso zzso factors that interact to elicit cooperative control of clock zzso Using a zzso system approach, we have isolated two different partners of zzso zzso zzso which are similar to the zzso zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso but diverge in the zzso zzso thus bearing different zzso zzso zzso As for zzso the expression of both zzso zzso in most zzso in the zzso However, in many zzso the peak, levels, and zzso of expression are different between the two genes and for the same gene from tissue to zzso These results support the existence of independent peripheral zzso and suggest that zzso and zzso may exert distinct zzso functions, interacting zzso with zzso at various times in different zzso Our findings also indicate that multiple controls may be exerted by the central clock and/or that peripheral zzso can zzso interpret central clock zzso
