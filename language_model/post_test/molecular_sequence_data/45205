In the zzso of zzso zzso type 2 zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso cells of the cortical thick ascending limb where it generates zzso that regulate hormone zzso inhibit zzso zzso and support cell survival during salt loading and zzso In zzso the zzso are in direct contact with an aquatic environment and are the dominant site of zzso During transfers between zzso specialized cells in the zzso zzso zzso rapidly regulate zzso zzso for systemic zzso while they simultaneously are exposed to acute zzso zzso This study was conducted to determine if zzso is expressed in the zzso and if so, to evaluate its function in cellular and systemic zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends were used to deduce the complete zzso sequence of a putative zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso base pair zzso includes a coding region for a 610 zzso acid protein that is over zzso identical to zzso zzso A zzso zzso generated against a zzso region of mouse zzso labeled zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso may control zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso was then used to demonstrate that zzso expression of the zzso zzso was zzso greater in zzso from chronic seawater zzso than in zzso from chronic freshwater zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator were also greater in seawater, suggesting that chronic zzso expression in the zzso is regulated in parallel to the key zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso was also used to demonstrate that acute transfer from seawater to freshwater and from freshwater to seawater led to zzso transient zzso of zzso zzso Together with previous zzso evidence, the present molecular and zzso data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression is enhanced in seawater, where zzso can regulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data also suggest that zzso zzso expression may play a role in cell survival during acute zzso zzso
