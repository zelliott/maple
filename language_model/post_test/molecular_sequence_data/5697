zzso heavy chains are involved in zzso transport zzso While zzso zzso are involved in zzso or zzso movement, zzso zzso are essential for zzso of zzso and zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso heavy chain zzso sequences in man and zzso Using zzso chain reaction and zzso human and mouse zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso the zzso zzso binding region of zzso heavy chains were zzso We identified 11 different mouse and eight human zzso sequences in zzso which show high similarity to known zzso of different species such as zzso sea zzso or green zzso zzso similarities suggest that two of the mouse clones and one human clone zzso putative zzso zzso heavy zzso whereas the other sequences show higher similarity to zzso zzso Two of nine zzso zzso zzso identified in the mouse zzso are more closely related to known outer arm zzso while seven clones seem to belong to the inner arm zzso zzso Of the isolated human zzso three clones were classified as outer arm and four clones as inner arm zzso heavy zzso Each of the zzso zzso zzso to an individual gene as determined by Southern zzso zzso The alignment of the deduced protein sequences between human zzso and mouse zzso zzso fragments reveals higher similarity between single human and mouse sequences than between two sequences of the same zzso Human and mouse zzso fragments were used to isolate zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso are zzso genes zzso zzso inner arm zzso While the human clone is assigned to zzso the mouse gene maps to zzso zzso
