The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso cells and is likely to play an important role in controlling the levels of zzso a known zzso in this zzso To further investigate the regulation of zzso a portion of the zzso gene was isolated and used as a probe to examine the changes in zzso zzso throughout development and the level of zzso zzso in the two precursor cell zzso The zzso acid sequence of the cloned DNA zzso isolated is highly zzso to other zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso gene exists as a single copy in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso indicated that there is a single zzso zzso zzso transcript that increased during development to peak at the initial stages of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was highly localized in zzso cells, which is consistent with a proposed zzso model for zzso zzso in this zzso
