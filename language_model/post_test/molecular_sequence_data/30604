We present molecular mechanics simulations on zzso complexes between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on one hand and potent zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso A on the other, using the all atom force field in the framework of the program zzso The zzso models of both the sets of complexes show minimal zzso for the zzso consistent with the results of zzso zzso studies on these zzso The drugs have zzso in the minor groove, consistent with the previously reported investigations employing the united atom force field and with the experimental zzso Both zzso and zzso are calculated to bind zzso to the zzso sequences over zzso This is in qualitative agreement with experimental studies for zzso while for zzso A, this result is in apparent disagreement with experimental observations which have reported preferential binding of zzso A to zzso over zzso While the present study brings out the usefulness of the simple molecular mechanics approach zzso an all atom force zzso in zzso substantial experimental zzso it also emphasizes the need for further investigations on zzso and dynamics effects in understanding the sequence specificity of zzso zzso
