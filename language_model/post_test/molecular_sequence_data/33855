The Southern Ocean contains some of the most isolated islands on zzso and fundamental questions remain regarding their colonization and the connectivity of their coastal zzso Here, we conduct a genetic investigation into the zzso zzso zzso complex that was originally classified based on zzso characters into six subspecies, five of which are endemic to the New Zealand zzso zzso and Chatham islands zzso Previous genetic analyses of zzso from six of the seven island groups revealed two lineages with little or no zzso zzso We zzso zzso samples from all seven island groups using two zzso zzso and zzso one nuclear zzso zzso and 58 zzso from four randomly amplified zzso DNA markers zzso and confirmed the existence of two distinct zzso The pronounced genetic structuring within each lineage and the presence of private zzso in individual islands are the result of little genetic connectivity and therefore very high zzso This study supports the significance of the zzso islands as zzso during the last glacial maximum and adds to the knowledge of contemporary population connectivity among coastal populations of remote islands in large oceans and the distance barrier to gene flow that exists in the sea zzso its continuous zzso for most zzso
