zzso of the template region in the zzso component of zzso can cause incorporation of zzso DNA sequences at zzso We made all 63 zzso sequence combinations at template positions zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained faithfully incorporated template zzso as well as zzso sequences in zzso a zzso not previously reported for zzso zzso zzso template zzso Although growth rates and zzso profiles varied widely among the zzso zzso zzso separation and segregation were always zzso The zzso showed defects in sister zzso separation at zzso as well as zzso suggesting zzso of a cell cycle zzso zzso of the DNA damage response genes zzso zzso or zzso failed to restore zzso separation in the zzso template zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso sequences elicit a checkpoint that is genetically distinct from those activated by deletion of zzso or DNA zzso
