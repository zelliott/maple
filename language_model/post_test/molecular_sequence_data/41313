The complete zzso of zzso bases was amplified using rolling circle amplification, and zzso and zzso for two distinct strains of the zzso zzso Tomato leaf zzso Sudan virus zzso The two strains shared zzso identity with the previously described zzso from the Nile Basin, and zzso identity with one zzso One strain was cloned from symptomatic tomato plants from zzso zzso while the other was cloned from symptomatic tobacco plants collected from zzso zzso zzso A distinct full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the respective zzso tomato and tobacco zzso zzso of tomato and zzso zzso plants with cloned partial tandem repeats of zzso and the associated zzso Tomato leaf zzso Yemen zzso zzso resulted in the reproduction of leaf zzso disease symptoms in test plants like those observed in the zzso zzso The zzso contributed to symptom severity in zzso zzso test plants when it was zzso with zzso compared to the milder symptoms that were observed in tobacco plants infected with the helper virus zzso
