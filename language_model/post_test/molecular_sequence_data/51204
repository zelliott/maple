In order to prevent zzso degradation of zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso bonds were incorporated at the 2-3 and zzso bonds, zzso The zzso were zzso by a combination of solid phase methodology and reductive zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso During reversed phase high pressure liquid zzso zzso peak shape zzso could be zzso zzso was zzso based on gas zzso zzso analysis, which indicated acceptable levels of zzso (less than zzso in the crude zzso Instead, the phenomena could be attributed to slow zzso zzso originating from the zzso bonds in the zzso The presence of different zzso zzso was also established by zzso zzso in zzso All zzso showed high stability in blood zzso enhanced binding affinity for the zzso zzso and very low binding to the delta zzso While the zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed zzso activity, the Pro 2 zzso modified analogue zzso showed zzso activity comparable to zzso
