To study whether zzso zzso can degrade zzso and to understand the symbiotic relationship between zzso mushroom and zzso zzso 

zzso library of zzso zzso was zzso by the Roche zzso zzso zzso zzso platform, and the diverse zzso relevant to degradation of cellulose and zzso of symbiotic fungus zzso zzso were zzso 

Eighth sequencing run resulted in a total of zzso reads zzso sequence zzso zzso After removing the zzso and primer zzso the remained zzso reads were assembled into zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparing sequence similarity with known zzso these zzso representing approximately zzso unique zzso were successfully zzso using zzso searches zzso zzso or zzso zzso against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcripts included 33 zzso zzso involved in cellulose and zzso zzso 5 zzso could zzso cellulose and others had zzso activities for degradation of zzso starch and zzso and zzso Moreover, four genes zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso which could degrade zzso were also zzso These results revealed zzso fungus zzso zzso had many zzso and possibly zzso zzso compounds from plant zzso 

Data presented in this study indicated that zzso zzso had the ability to degrade zzso which made cellulose more easily zzso by the zzso produced by zzso zzso
