zzso bacteria are important players in the global zzso and carbon cycles, with considerable economical and ecological zzso However, the process of zzso zzso is still incompletely zzso Several mechanisms of energy conservation have been proposed, but it is unclear how the different strategies contribute to the overall zzso In order to obtain a deeper insight into the energy metabolism of zzso zzso zzso were used to compare the zzso response of zzso zzso zzso grown with zzso zzso zzso with limiting zzso and zzso relative to growth in zzso Growth with zzso showed the largest number of zzso expressed genes and the largest changes in transcript zzso In this condition the most zzso energy metabolism genes were those coding for the zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso The results also provide evidence for the involvement of zzso cycling and the recently proposed ethanol zzso during growth in zzso The zzso involving CO cycling is relevant during growth on zzso and zzso but not during growth in hydrogen as the most zzso genes were those coding for the zzso zzso Growth on zzso reveals a zzso of several energy metabolism genes similar to what was observed in the presence of zzso This study identifies the role of several proteins involved in the energy metabolism of zzso zzso and highlights several novel genes related to this process, revealing a more complex zzso metabolism than previously zzso
