The zzso A zzso gene codes for several zzso zzso including zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso These peptides are thought to play an important role in a variety of neural zzso To study the role of the zzso gene in zzso related zzso an zzso sequence of zzso gene was zzso into zzso zzso 40 late promoter expression zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells, which contain zzso zzso The sense orientation of the same zzso was also cloned and zzso serving as a zzso The presence and expression of zzso zzso plasmids in zzso 108 cells were confirmed by DNA and zzso zzso and by subsequent zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso message level was found to be 3 times higher in zzso cells than in sense or zzso 108 zzso This high zzso zzso level seemed to be due to the increased stability of zzso zzso rather than to an elevated zzso zzso Nevertheless, the level of total zzso was found to be reduced in zzso cells, though free zzso content did not differ from zzso or zzso zzso We suggest that both the increased zzso message and the unchanged levels of free zzso may be the result of zzso mechanisms induced by zzso zzso by zzso although the underlying processes remain to be zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso in the zzso cell lines, but not in the sense zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
