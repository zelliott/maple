The techniques involved in the transfer of foreign DNA to domestic animals have advanced to the stage where transgenic animals that express foreign genes can be reliably produced, albeit still at low zzso This paper reviews the current status of some of the more important areas in agriculture where this technology is being zzso Numerous attempts have been made to modify the growth performance characteristics of domestic animals by the introduction of zzso hormone fusion zzso A summary of our work with transgenic sheep is zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso production of growth hormone in transgenic sheep reduces carcass fat, zzso zzso rate and heat production, causes skeletal abnormalities and zzso zzso The introduction of new zzso pathways to domestic animals offers an attractive approach to improved animal zzso This paper zzso recent results of research directed towards the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cycle to transgenic zzso So far, the genes zzso the zzso have been isolated and expressed both in cells in culture and in transgenic zzso The results of work currently in progress demonstrate that some modification of the fusion genes is required to enhance their expression in transgenic zzso
