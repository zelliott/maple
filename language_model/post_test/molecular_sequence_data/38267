The sodium zzso zzso zzso is a plasma membrane protein that is responsible for zzso transport into zzso zzso To understand the regulation and expression of human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the expression levels of zzso zzso in primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation of zzso levels between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso zzso cases of zzso zzso and 7 pairs of primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in this zzso We measured the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso protection zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso By zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso but the degrees of expression were variable and were lower than those of normal zzso zzso The decreased expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso compared to normal zzso tissue was also noticed by zzso All 23 zzso zzso in this study showed the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso were again lower in zzso zzso zzso than in normal zzso The level of zzso zzso was correlated with the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso In addition, significant correlation of zzso level was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Two of six zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show zzso zzso even with significant zzso expressions in zzso zzso zzso in zzso The levels of zzso expression of the remaining four zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower than those of corresponding primary zzso Interestingly, one case showed no zzso expression in primary zzso but significant zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso No correlation was found in zzso zzso expression between primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso level in primary zzso may not predict the therapeutic response to radioactive zzso
