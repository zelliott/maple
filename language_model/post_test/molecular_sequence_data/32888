zzso plays important roles in the regulation of central nervous system zzso development and zzso In zzso two families of zzso zzso collectively known as zzso D1 and zzso zzso have been zzso Recently, zzso receptors have been targeted by pharmacological and therapeutic studies of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's zzso Here, we report a study on the molecular characterization of zzso D1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso We cloned the full-length zzso of a zzso zzso D1 zzso designated as zzso The sequence of zzso shares high zzso to the sequences of zzso D1 receptors in zzso zzso and other fish zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso The first zzso expression was observed at approximately 30 hours zzso at which time the expression was seen in the developing zzso and zzso In developing zzso the expression of zzso was detected in the inner nuclear layer with the exception of the marginal zzso In adult zzso zzso expression was detected in most cell types in the inner and outer nuclear layers as well as zzso cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in developing and adult zzso may play various roles in regulating visual system zzso
