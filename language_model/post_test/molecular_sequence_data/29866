We have recently established that the human growth zzso zzso gene is functional in zzso by documenting its expression in the zzso We have subsequently generated transformed zzso cell lines zzso expressing the genes for normal zzso growth hormone zzso zzso and each of two zzso genes generated by zzso 3 exchanges, zzso and zzso In the present study, we zzso these cell lines as sources of hormone to characterize and compare the zzso binding profiles of zzso with zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso bound to rat liver zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso bound to rabbit liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would be predicted to display both zzso and zzso zzso a dual specificity previously thought to be unique to zzso The zzso of hormone necessary to zzso 50% zzso of the zzso from zzso receptors and zzso zzso from zzso receptors was expressed as a ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso for each hormone zzso A zzso difference in this ratio was observed for zzso compared to zzso suggesting significantly greater selectivity by zzso in binding to the zzso zzso The intermediate binding ratios of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins confirmed the distinct zzso binding profiles of the two parent hormones and served to identify three zzso acids of potential importance in defining their respective zzso binding zzso
