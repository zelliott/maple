The zzso and the zzso locus of the zzso gene of zzso zzso were cloned and is the first representative of a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso at the first branch point of aromatic zzso acid zzso The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene consists of three zzso interrupted by two short zzso zzso The expressed zzso is zzso zzso in length and zzso expression is not regulated on the zzso level under zzso acid zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso of 268 zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso allowed determination of its kinetic parameters zzso zzso 82 zzso zzso zzso zzso 56, zzso zzso zzso zzso varying pH dependence of zzso activity in different regulatory states, and an zzso zzso value of zzso zzso acts as zzso zzso and zzso as negative acting, zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso data, zzso zzso as well as electron zzso studies, indicate that this zzso zzso has a zzso structure like the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a crucial zzso in zzso zzso revealed differences concerning the zzso signal zzso for zzso regulation of zzso zzso
