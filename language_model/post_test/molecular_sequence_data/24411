zzso zzso zzso and Goose zzso zzso isolated from infected zzso with zzso disease in the year 1999 were identified by zzso chain reaction and zzso The zzso sequences of their viral zzso proteins zzso show that they share zzso similarity at the DNA, and zzso at the protein zzso The most variable region between zzso and zzso resides in the zzso of zzso before the initiation zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso protein sequences diverge zzso to zzso among zzso isolated zzso zzso zzso acids cluster in the common regions of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso which zzso with the regions proposed to expose on the outer surfaces of zzso zzso zzso that selective pressure from host immune system might play a zzso These data provide useful information for zzso zzso zzso This study also reveal the presence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and these zzso seldom vary among different viral zzso suggesting that they might be functionally important and worth further zzso
