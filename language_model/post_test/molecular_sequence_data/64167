The zzso form of zzso zzso appears to be localized at the zzso junction in association with the zzso zzso complex through binding of its zzso tail zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso are thought to be involved in zzso zzso to the synaptic zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso of zzso is also likely involved, but there has been no direct zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso zzso in zzso Nine previously reported and three novel zzso are in zzso of zzso and most zzso zzso do not abrogate formation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Patient zzso however, are devoid of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso affect zzso of zzso to the synaptic zzso zzso Based on our observations that zzso zzso can be transplanted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso we tested zzso competence of nine naturally occurring zzso zzso and two artificial zzso zzso zzso human zzso inserted into the zzso zzso zzso whereas six zzso zzso and two zzso zzso did zzso Our studies establish that the zzso zzso indeed compromise zzso of zzso and that both zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso to the synaptic zzso zzso
