zzso 54 is a minor bacterial zzso factor that is not a member of the zzso 70 family of proteins but binds the same core zzso zzso Previously, we identified a region of zzso 54 that is important for binding core zzso In this work, zzso zzso was used to identify specific zzso acids important for this zzso The results show that important zzso are clustered most closely in a short sequence that was previously speculated to be potentially zzso to a sequence in zzso zzso The zzso also identifies important zzso in the zzso zzso region of zzso 54, which is absent in zzso zzso Overall, the data indicate that zzso 54 binds core zzso through a sequence zzso to that of zzso 70 but in addition uses unique motifs to modify this zzso
