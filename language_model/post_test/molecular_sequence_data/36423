A simple zzso procedure is described for specifically amplifying and zzso zzso element zzso which is associated with the zzso zzso zzso The product has been used to probe DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso The resulting restriction zzso length zzso were found to be able to distinguish zzso which were indistinguishable by other typing zzso The probe also zzso with zzso zzso zzso which were isolated before the emergence of zzso resistance, demonstrating its usefulness in typing species other than those that are zzso
