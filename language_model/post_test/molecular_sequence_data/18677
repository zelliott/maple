zzso zzso zzso is the structural zzso of a family of zzso zzso that catalyze electron transfer between low potential proteins and zzso and that display a zzso arrangement with an open cavity at their zzso The inner part of this cavity zzso the reacting atoms during zzso zzso at its edge are highly zzso among zzso zzso suggesting that they might contribute to both zzso stabilization and competent disposition of zzso Here we pay attention to two of these zzso in zzso zzso The first is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso It was thought to determine the extended zzso zzso and, zzso to zzso zzso electronic properties, partners zzso zzso efficiency and even zzso zzso The second, zzso contains key zzso for the allocation of partners and zzso including two zzso zzso and zzso proposed as candidates to facilitate the key displacement of the zzso zzso zzso from its stacking against the zzso ring during the zzso zzso Our data indicate that the main function of zzso is to provide the zzso cavity with flexibility to accommodate protein partners and to guide the zzso to the zzso site, while the extended zzso of zzso must be induced by other protein zzso zzso and zzso appear to assist the zzso changes that occur in the zzso during productive zzso zzso but their contribution to zzso displacement is minor than zzso Additionally, zzso appears a zzso to ensure zzso in zzso zzso
