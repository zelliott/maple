zzso in the zinc finger zzso factor zzso cause zzso zzso and have also been identified in patients with isolated zzso heart disease zzso To determine the relative contribution of zzso zzso to both zzso and isolated zzso we screened the coding region of zzso in zzso unrelated patients, including 61 patients with classic zzso 93 patients with heart defects characteristic of zzso and 11 patients with zzso zzso zzso Five novel zzso zzso in three classic zzso zzso and two sporadic zzso cases were zzso None of these zzso was found in 97 ethnically matched control zzso On the basis of these zzso we conclude that the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso should be expanded to include affected females and zzso not typical for zzso This screening of a cohort of patients with sporadic zzso indicates that zzso zzso account for approximately zzso of affected zzso zzso and nonsense zzso were found in the highly zzso zinc zzso domain and in the zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of all currently known zzso point zzso indicates that zzso in the putative zinc finger DNA binding domain and in the zzso domain result in loss of reporter gene zzso It is surprising that zzso studies demonstrate zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso between zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso of a subset of zzso zzso results at least in part from failure of appropriate nuclear zzso These results further expand the zzso and zzso spectrum of zzso zzso and provide initial zzso insight into their functional zzso
