In addition to DNA zzso complexes, DNA replication requires the coordinate action of a series of zzso including regulators zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso an essential zzso repeat zzso has remained particularly zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated in the DNA replication checkpoint as has the zzso gene with which zzso genetically zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso isolated as a dosage zzso of zzso zzso is an essential cell zzso gene required for DNA zzso We show that both zzso and zzso are required for the zzso checkpoint, including the proper zzso of the zzso zzso in response to DNA damage and replication zzso zzso is the second zzso protein shown to control zzso function, possibly indicating a general function for this class of zzso zzso and zzso show synthetic zzso and zzso dosage zzso The zzso and zzso proteins physically associate and function together to coordinate DNA replication and the cell zzso
