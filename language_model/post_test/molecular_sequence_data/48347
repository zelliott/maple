zzso have evolved sophisticated strategies to exploit host cell function for their zzso Here we show that under zzso normal oxygen levels zzso zzso virus zzso infection leads to a rapid stabilization of zzso factor zzso its zzso into the nucleus and the zzso of zzso zzso such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization is zzso by zzso protein zzso that binds the human oxygen sensing zzso zzso domain containing protein zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso of zzso The binding between zzso and zzso is direct and specific, and zzso expression of zzso alone zzso zzso of zzso responsive zzso zzso a zzso strain lacking the gene for zzso zzso is unable to induce zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso region of zzso is predicted to have a zzso structural fold but lacks the zzso active site zzso of zzso The induction of a hypoxic response by zzso is reminiscent of the zzso consequences of solid tumor formation, and illustrates a zzso strategy for manipulation of cellular gene expression and zzso
