The diverse biological actions of zzso acid zzso are zzso by zzso receptors zzso and zzso X receptors zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is achieved through two zzso functions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso located in the zzso and E zzso zzso While the zzso proteins that interact with the E domain are well zzso the zzso zzso partners and their zzso on the function of zzso are poorly zzso zzso is an ubiquitous nuclear protein that has been implicated in inducing zzso zzso zzso and regulating zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso can specifically repress zzso and zzso expression of a zzso zzso response zzso reporter gene and several zzso zzso genes in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso associates with zzso within the promoters of zzso genes independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso end of zzso and the B domain of zzso interact independently of zzso and the zzso end of zzso is sufficient for the repression of zzso gene zzso Finally, zzso zzso activity only partially accounts for the repressive effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso These findings identify zzso as a novel zzso protein that regulates the expression of a subset of zzso genes through direct binding to the zzso B zzso of zzso
