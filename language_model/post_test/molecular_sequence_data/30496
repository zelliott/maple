There is a mosaic pattern of variation between the two zzso arranged human alpha zzso zzso zzso Both the synonymous and the zzso sites of zzso 3 and 4 are more divergent than the rest of the zzso suggesting that they have had a different evolutionary zzso Comparisons of the two gene sequences with rat zzso indicate that zzso 3 and 4 of zzso have been evolving without functional constraint since their divergence from zzso It is proposed that the zzso region of the gene has been zzso recently by gene conversion with the zzso regions of zzso The zzso sequences surrounding the genes appear to have been involved in both the gene zzso and the gene conversion zzso
