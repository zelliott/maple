The zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene is zzso amongst all known zzso zzso has been reported to function in a variety of aspects of the virus zzso including protection of cells from zzso zzso zzso of enveloped virus particles from the zzso space and zzso spread of virus zzso In this report, we examined the zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes two proteins termed zzso and zzso zzso differs from zzso in that it contains 54 additional zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso localized predominantly to the plasma membrane whereas the zzso protein localized predominantly to the zzso To explore the differences in the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso we fused the zzso 54 zzso acids of zzso to the zzso of the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso Surprisingly, this fusion protein localized exclusively to zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso cells revealed that the zzso 101 zzso acids of zzso and zzso comprises a zzso zzso domain, and that the zzso 102 zzso acids of zzso comprises a nuclear zzso zzso We provide a model to zzso the complex zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso that the zzso nuclear and membrane zzso motifs function in the reported zzso zzso and zzso spread functions of zzso
