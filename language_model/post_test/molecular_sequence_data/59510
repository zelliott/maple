Two zzso zzso zzso that carry zzso zzso and zzso in a coupled fashion have been zzso One type, the zzso zzso carries these zzso across the zzso plasma membrane of the thick ascending limb of zzso zzso Another zzso the zzso zzso has been identified in a number of zzso zzso by zzso means, but its sites of expression in the kidney have not been fully zzso zzso DNA believed to code for the zzso zzso (called zzso or zzso have recently been zzso This study used a specific zzso zzso zzso to this protein for zzso in the rat zzso zzso studies using this zzso show abundant zzso against bands of zzso and 120 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and stomach, sites where the zzso form of the zzso has been identified by zzso zzso This distribution supports the hypothesis that this zzso represents the zzso form of the zzso Studies in the kidney revealed that the same bands are associated with membrane zzso chiefly in the outer zzso zzso show that zzso is selectively and intensely localized to the zzso plasma membrane of a zzso of outer zzso collecting duct zzso An independently produced zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso displays the same zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with respect to zzso specific for principal cells zzso and zzso cells zzso 3 and zzso show that zzso zzso is localized to zzso cells of the outer zzso collecting duct in the zzso This distinctive zzso suggests that the zzso form of the zzso may play a role in zzso zzso and/or acid zzso by this cell zzso
