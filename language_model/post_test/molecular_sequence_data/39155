zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso their association with zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest in zzso The zzso action of zzso in particular, is believed to be zzso essentially via zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein of human zzso 5 associates with zzso proteins via zzso in its zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, in particular through the motif zzso in zzso These interactions are required for zzso to prevent zzso arrest upon zzso of zzso We show here that mutating either of two zzso motifs adjacent to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso also zzso the ability of zzso to overcome zzso arrest by zzso or zzso zzso however, these zzso affect neither the association of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso nor its ability to zzso zzso zzso activity in transient zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso however, is defective in zzso several zzso zzso target genes in the presence of zzso or zzso Thus, zzso possesses an essential function besides zzso We speculate that this function might be required for the full zzso of zzso genes in their natural zzso zzso
