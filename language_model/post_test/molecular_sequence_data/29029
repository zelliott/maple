In the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso signaling and then zzso signaling initiate changes in gene expression that result in the maturation of zzso and zzso lineage T cells from common zzso Using gene chip technology, we isolated a zzso zzso designated zzso that encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso box family of zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso of immature zzso but not by zzso zzso of mature zzso T zzso zzso mice that express zzso show expanded zzso and reduced zzso single positive zzso zzso We present evidence here that this zzso results from a zzso in lineage commitment due to reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso This molecular marker of zzso selection events may therefore play a role in establishing the zzso threshold of developing T cells and patterning changes in gene zzso
