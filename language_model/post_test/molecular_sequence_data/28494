zzso group O strains have a level of genetic diversity similar to that of strains in group zzso however, group O has not been readily classified into genetic zzso zzso zzso of group O has been hindered by the limited sequence information zzso To facilitate zzso analysis, we zzso the gag zzso zzso zzso pol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes from 39 group zzso zzso These specimens include 32 plasma samples collected in Cameroon between 1996 and 1999, 2 specimens collected in the United States, and 5 infections previously isolated in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso group O sequences resulted in the identification of five clusters that are maintained across zzso zzso and zzso generally supported by high zzso values, and approximately zzso from each zzso In addition to the group O zzso several zzso branch independently and are zzso from the other group O zzso zzso I comprises greater than 50% of the group O zzso and is a diverse set of zzso that is subdivided into zzso The average zzso zzso and zzso distances for group O are similar to the corresponding distances for group M zzso The five group O clusters have characteristics similar to those of group M zzso Thus the data presented may form the basis for zzso of group O into zzso However, full-length zzso representing each group O cluster will be required to formalize a group O zzso zzso
