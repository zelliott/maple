A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was isolated by zzso zzso was detected at the zzso and, more zzso along zzso throughout the entire cell zzso zzso zzso does not require zzso suggesting that zzso is a genuine zzso zzso zzso exhibits sequence identity to a zzso zzso class of zzso proteins including human zzso and zzso zzso zzso has a size of only approximately 100 zzso and zzso to the zzso half of zzso The functions of the zzso and zzso halves of zzso were investigated in the corresponding zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso construct showed only zzso zzso whereas the zzso construct localized exclusively to the zzso This is unexpected because zzso is localized at the zzso pole zzso zzso zzso was present both at zzso and along zzso Furthermore, it bound to zzso in zzso unlike the two truncated zzso Thus zzso binding is determined by the zzso half and zzso binding may require the interaction of the zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, cells expressing full-length zzso exhibit zzso zzso and show a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso These features are unique among the known zzso zzso
