In this study, we have shown that zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso at zzso pH with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All other zzso zzso tested had low or no zzso zzso The zzso gene is juxtaposed with a gene cluster that contains genes believed to function in zzso zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso shares the backbone fold and the use of an active site zzso zzso to mediate zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso fold zzso zzso A comparative study of these two zzso showed that they differ greatly in the rate contribution made by the zzso zzso in the pH dependence of zzso and in zzso zzso
