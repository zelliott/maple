zzso therapy is the only specific treatment for scorpion zzso However, there are still major drawbacks associated with its use; mainly because zzso are still prepared from immune zzso serum raised against crude zzso whereas only a limited number of zzso are responsible for the zzso of the zzso Using a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso directed to zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso fragment, which was produced and zzso from transformed zzso It recognized toxin zzso with a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso of whole zzso Although the zzso capacity of protein zzso zzso was low compared to other zzso zzso formats zzso and zzso investigated in zzso the zzso engineering approach presented here provides an innovative way to zzso novel zzso zzso It may serve as a strategy for designing a new generation of zzso
