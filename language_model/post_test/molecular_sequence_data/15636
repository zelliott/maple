In order to find a promoter that could be influenced by temperature shift, we explored and isolated an zzso zzso gene expressed at high temperatures zzso degrees zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Of the 96 zzso clones isolated from the zzso library, one zzso clone showed zzso identity with zzso zzso heat shock protein 30 zzso Based on this, we designated the isolated gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed at 30 degrees C, but strongly at 40 degrees zzso We showed that the promoter of this zzso induced zzso gene expression at high temperatures using zzso zzso gene as a zzso Regarding zzso of the region essential for heat shock response, we showed that the minimum length of the promoter region that was essential for heat shock response was located between zzso and zzso zzso indicated the first position of the translation initiation zzso of the zzso zzso This promoter region harbors several putative zzso factor binding sites, including heat shock elements zzso a zzso box, and a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of this promoter revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso of the zzso promoter, were its zzso elements for heat shock zzso
