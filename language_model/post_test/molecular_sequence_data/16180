We have analyzed the contributions to zzso stability in an zzso species with a very short zzso zzso zzso and an zzso species with a very long zzso zzso zzso When the human zzso promoter was used to drive the expression of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso cells, a pulse of zzso synthesis was obtained following induction of zzso by zzso zzso cells with medium containing zzso calf zzso The zzso zzso was determined by using Northern zzso zzso analysis of zzso prepared at various times following the pulse of zzso Under these conditions human zzso zzso exhibited a zzso of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso exhibited a zzso of zzso zzso Replacement of the 3' end of the zzso zzso with the 3' end of the zzso zzso increased the zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso to 34 zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that sequences which make a major contribution to zzso stability reside in the 3' end of either or both zzso A zzso in which the zzso untranslated region of zzso was replaced by part of the zzso untranslated region of zzso led to zzso of the zzso zzso This construct produced an zzso with a zzso of zzso h instead of the zzso zzso of zzso This result suggests that additional zzso of stability reside in the zzso end of these zzso zzso zzso of part of the zzso untranslated region of zzso by the zzso untranslated region of zzso yielded an zzso with stability similar to zzso zzso These results suggest that interactions among sequences within each zzso contribute to the stability of the respective zzso
