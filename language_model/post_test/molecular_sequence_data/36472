zzso of an zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 114 was isolated using the zzso chain reaction zzso The primary structure of the zzso was deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso and compared with the structures of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mature zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso acid zzso and was zzso and zzso identical with the zzso A and the zzso zzso zzso Two active zzso acid sites and the zzso acids near those sites were zzso in the zzso zzso We also showed that there is another gene of zzso zzso than that of strain zzso reported by zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso both in that strain and in zzso zzso
