The biological pathways and functional properties by which zzso zzso zzso contribute to liver zzso have been zzso zzso However, little is known about the upstream mechanisms that zzso zzso expressions in this zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso B virus zzso X protein zzso a zzso zzso is frequently expressed in truncated form without zzso but its role in zzso expression and zzso development is zzso 

Human zzso zzso were infected with zzso full-length and zzso truncated zzso zzso for cell growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to identify the zzso promoters directly associated with zzso zzso zzso control was verified by zzso reporter zzso The differential zzso expressions were further validated in a cohort of zzso zzso zzso using real-time zzso 

zzso expressing zzso grew significantly faster than the full-length zzso zzso zzso decreased while full-length zzso increased the expression of a set of zzso with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso bound to and inhibited the zzso activity of some of these zzso zzso zzso some of the examined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also significantly zzso in a subset of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso compared to their matching zzso zzso highlighting the clinical relevance of our zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso directly regulates zzso zzso and in turn promotes zzso zzso thus revealing a viral contribution of zzso deregulation during zzso
