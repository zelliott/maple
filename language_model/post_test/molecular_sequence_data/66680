zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a multifunctional, nuclear protein involved in zzso regulation of a subset of viral genes during zzso zzso Three nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified in the N zzso of the zzso zzso and each of the three represents a short stretch of basic zzso acid zzso zzso of all three zzso prevented zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of individual zzso into a zzso zzso protein converted it into a nuclear zzso confirming that each zzso functions independently and is sufficient to promote protein nuclear zzso Although it exhibits a function similar to that of zzso virus zzso in promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and its function could be disrupted by point zzso of single or two zzso in random zzso despite the proper zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso The dysfunctional zzso containing zzso zzso also had low affinity with zzso zzso and the zzso export factor zzso However, the zzso binding of zzso in zzso appeared to have no effect on zzso enhancement of zzso zzso Thus, the three zzso identified in zzso provide at least two functions, nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
