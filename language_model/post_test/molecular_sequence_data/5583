The sequence zzso of viral structure zzso has been associated with immune escape zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso virus zzso is a highly variable region of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso region as a linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were first demonstrated in a rabbit infected with a zzso zzso virus carrying the zzso gene of human zzso virus type 2 strain zzso zzso Since we detected in this animal zzso zzso zzso that were able to neutralize not only human zzso virus type 2 but also zzso we investigated whether a similar immune response is evoked in zzso zzso zzso either infected with zzso or zzso with the external zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso lower zzso zzso were found in the zzso animals than in the zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso in both groups were high enough for competition experiments, we used five overlapping peptides encompassing the whole zzso region for a detailed identification of the zzso In each of the 12 zzso investigated, we detected a high level of zzso reacting with at least one zzso located in the central part of the zzso zzso The relatively high degree of zzso especially within the central part of the zzso region, which characterized the evolution of the zzso sequences from the original zzso in the infected zzso suggests the development of escape zzso Furthermore, 3 of 12 animals developed zzso directed against the zzso end of the zzso region zzso zzso analysis, however, revealed relatively low levels of genetic drift and genetic zzso within this part of the zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in zzso animals in combination with the increased genetic zzso of this region in zzso indicates a marked biological significance of this zzso for the zzso
