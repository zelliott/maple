On the basis of zzso zzso data, the structures of the zzso combining sites of zzso zzso zzso were compared for zzso which is one of the primary response zzso with low affinity for zzso and zzso which is one of the secondary response zzso with high affinity for zzso It has been concluded, on the basis of the results of zzso engineering, that in most secondary response zzso a zzso exchange at position 33 of the heavy chain is primarily responsible for the increased affinity for zzso zzso zzso Simon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso 7, zzso Although zzso exhibits one of the highest affinities for zzso it lacks the zzso exchange at position 33 of the heavy zzso A variety of stable zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso resonance assignments were made by zzso of the heavy chains and light chains of the zzso zzso zzso experiments of a zzso zzso and zzso experiments have demonstrated that, compared with the environment of the zzso combining site of zzso the combination of zzso (including one zzso zzso and the particular zzso zzso in the heavy chain of zzso zzso a more zzso environment, which is formed by one zzso zzso originating from the light chain and two zzso zzso originating from the heavy zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
