Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso soil collected from the zzso valley, zzso northern zzso A third isolate zzso zzso was recovered from the same soil sample after the sample had been exposed to simulated zzso environmental zzso The three strains were characterized zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the three zzso were most closely related to members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence data indicated that the three zzso could be divided into two zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso strains zzso and zzso This grouping was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited 92 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids present in all three zzso were summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso % of the zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso and zzso zzso the new strains are assigned to two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
