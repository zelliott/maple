The zzso zzso zzso of zzso virus contains 8 to 10 zzso zzso We have mapped the gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the seventh open reading frame of the zzso D zzso zzso zzso of this gene was achieved by using zzso to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso of the in zzso translation products of in zzso early zzso selected by zzso to cloned DNA zzso The identification was confirmed by translation of zzso transcripts made in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of two previously isolated zzso lethal zzso zzso that map to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) are consistent with an essential role of this zzso in late zzso This zzso zzso designated zzso predicts a zzso of 161 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso The zzso gene is transcribed early in infection, even though the zzso zzso which is zzso among many genes of the late class, is present near the zzso start zzso zzso of the zzso end of the early transcript by several different methods, including zzso zzso revealed a zzso leader with up to 14 zzso zzso whereas only 3 are present in the corresponding location of the DNA zzso Similar but somewhat longer zzso leaders have previously been observed in zzso of late zzso We noted a zzso motif near the initiation site of several other early zzso including the viral DNA zzso and carried out additional experiments to demonstrate that their early transcripts also have zzso zzso zzso Thus, formation of the zzso leader is not exclusively a late function but apparently depends on sequences around the zzso initiation zzso
