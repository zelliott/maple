zzso is a cell surface protein that plays an essential role in tactile responses during zzso zzso zzso body formation by producing the zzso zzso The primary zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibits zzso with members of the zzso alcohol zzso zzso family and several lines of evidence suggest that zzso binding is essential for biological zzso First, the predicted zzso secondary structure based on the 3 zzso zzso zzso crystal structure suggests that the zzso portion of the protein contains an zzso binding zzso Second, strains with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso binding pocket failed to zzso Third, zzso zzso zzso zzso development, whereas zzso with the zzso acid substitution zzso zzso does zzso Finally, zzso spore yield increased approximately zzso when containing 100 zzso of zzso was supplemented with 10 zzso of zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso of zzso or zzso delayed development for approximately 24 zzso and depressed spore levels approximately zzso Together, these results argue that zzso binding is critical for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso acids in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso failed to zzso Furthermore, a zzso protein containing zzso zzso was not able to restore development to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso acids zzso in the zzso binding pocket and zzso site are essential for zzso
