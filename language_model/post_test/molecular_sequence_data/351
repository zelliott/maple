A recently established rice breeding program in low latitudes aims to develop varieties with extremely long basic zzso growth zzso periods and weak zzso zzso The Taiwanese zzso variety Taichung 65 zzso harbors a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso (Early flowering 1) zzso thereby exhibiting an extremely long zzso zzso The previous reported functional zzso zzso (Early heading date 1), located on zzso 10, encodes a zzso response regulator, thereby zzso the zzso period, whereas its zzso zzso zzso greatly zzso the zzso zzso A conventional analysis using zzso and zzso populations and a subsequent zzso analysis based on the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso were at the same zzso The zzso analysis also indicated that the Taiwanese zzso varieties with extremely long zzso periods all harbor zzso but that zzso does not exist among zzso and zzso varieties in the low zzso Since zzso has not been found in any zzso varieties outside Taiwan, this zzso might have originated in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso period even more than zzso does, harbors an zzso zzso in zzso 2, which causes the complete loss of gene zzso Our results indicate that both zzso or zzso zzso can be used as new gene sources in developing rice varieties with extremely long zzso periods for low zzso
