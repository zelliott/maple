The zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso encodes an essential zzso zzso of 198 zzso which is critical to the development of the devastating plant disease fire zzso A zzso zzso zzso and in zzso protein pull-down zzso demonstrated that zzso interacts physically and specifically with four similar putative zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from apple, an important host of zzso zzso The genes zzso these four zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso to 4) are zzso in all zzso of hosts of zzso zzso zzso They also are zzso in all zzso of apple tested that range in zzso to fire blight from highly susceptible to highly zzso The four zzso have been zzso and they are expressed zzso in host zzso In zzso analysis indicated that the zzso have similar sequence structure and resemble zzso zzso from other zzso Evidence is presented for direct physical interaction between zzso and the apple proteins zzso by the four identified zzso which may act as zzso factors and be essential to disease zzso zzso of zzso and the interaction with zzso thus may facilitate understanding of fire blight development and lead to new approaches to control of zzso
