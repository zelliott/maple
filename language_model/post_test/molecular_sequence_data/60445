Factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that plays a key role in the blood zzso zzso On injury, factor zzso forms a complex with its zzso regulator, tissue factor, and zzso blood zzso Although the structure of the zzso complex has already been determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Winkler, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso binding to factor zzso are not known in detail because of a lack of structural information on free factor zzso Here we report the structure of zzso zzso human zzso factor zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso adopts an extended zzso within the crystal similar to that previously observed for the full-length protein in complex with tissue zzso zzso comparison of free and tissue zzso factor zzso reveals several structural zzso The binding mode of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso differs in the two structures, suggesting a role for the zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, a zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso which is located at the zzso recognition site, is distorted in the free form of factor zzso This subtle structural difference sheds light on the mechanism of the dramatic tissue zzso enhancement of factor zzso zzso
