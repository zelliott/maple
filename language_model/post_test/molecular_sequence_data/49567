zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and this zzso modification of a single zzso zzso is exceptionally zzso The exact details of the zzso interactions involved are unclear as a zzso complex has not yet been zzso Moreover, detailed information is lacking on the zzso zzso and role of fatty acids in zzso zzso We have zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso Delta zzso from the extreme zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of zzso 117 on zzso Delta 67 at temperatures of up to 70 degrees zzso Limited zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso revealed a single zzso site located 44 zzso from the zzso This site is adjacent to the predicted zzso site and zzso of zzso is significantly reduced in the presence of zzso and zzso Chemical zzso with zzso zzso allowed the isolation of a zzso Delta 67 zzso Furthermore, this complex was also formed between zzso and a zzso Delta 67 zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso Delta 67 zzso however, complex formation was considerably reduced using zzso Delta zzso These observations provide evidence that addition of the zzso prosthetic group reduces the ability of zzso Delta 67 to zzso with zzso and emphasizes that a network of interactions between zzso on both proteins mediates protein zzso
