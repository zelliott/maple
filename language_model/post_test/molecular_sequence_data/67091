During early zzso evolution, a zzso event in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a widely distributed zzso of zzso zzso gave rise to zzso zzso a zzso hormone zzso We report here on the crystal structure of zebra fish zzso in two different crystal zzso Despite the zzso distance, this structure compares well with those of newly characterized bacterial zzso especially with regard to zzso regions, which are highly zzso zzso with zzso structure reveals a highly zzso scaffold, zzso distinct functional sites located in the same regions of the two zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso in zzso compared to zzso map in putative zzso regions occupying significant portions of the two halves of a central channel that zzso the whole zzso zzso The evolution of zzso has been accompanied by remarkable changes of the zzso active sites that gave rise to a channel open at both ends, thus allowing free access to hormone zzso
