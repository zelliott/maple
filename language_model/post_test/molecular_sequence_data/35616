Signaling via protein zzso A zzso and protein zzso G zzso is critical for maintaining zzso in the resting zzso Both zzso zzso the activity of the small zzso zzso a critical signaling switch for zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso and zzso is largely zzso 

To identify the zzso zzso sites in calcium and zzso zzso zzso exchange factor I zzso the main zzso for zzso in zzso and the effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso sites in zzso were identified by zzso zzso incorporation zzso and mass zzso zzso was developed to detect zzso zzso in Western zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso pull-down zzso 

zzso was identified as the major zzso zzso site in zzso while zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated with the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso In zzso cells, expression of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso partially reversed the zzso effect of zzso signaling on zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso completely abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso 

Our study strongly suggests that zzso of zzso is a critical mechanism by which zzso controls zzso zzso zzso
