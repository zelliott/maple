The related zzso factors zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are involved in copper metabolism by zzso the zzso of copper zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso factors which possess a zzso zzso copper binding domain required for DNA zzso Here we report the identification of a nuclear protein from zzso zzso zzso whose zzso region is highly similar to the copper and DNA binding zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso have a zzso in the plasma membrane zzso and zzso zzso activity, are slow growing, respiratory zzso and hypersensitive to heat and exposure to cadmium, zzso lead and zzso zzso a dominant zzso zzso of zzso shows an elevated zzso activity and is hypersensitive to zzso We have identified two target genes of zzso whose altered expression in zzso of zzso can account for some of the observed zzso zzso First, zzso is involved in zzso level zzso of zzso zzso a plasma membrane component associated with both zzso and zzso zzso Second, zzso is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may zzso a novel zzso zzso factor required for both zzso and regulated zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso and the stress zzso
