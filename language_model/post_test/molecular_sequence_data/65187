zzso zzso by zzso zzso II is blocked at DNA sequences called arrest zzso An exceptionally weak zzso hybrid is often thought to be necessary at the point of zzso We have identified an arrest site from the zzso zzso zzso gene which does not fit this zzso zzso of many sequence zzso of this site shows that the zzso hybrid over the three bases immediately preceding the major arrest point may be strong zzso zzso without interfering with zzso However, arrest at the zzso site requires the presence of a zzso at the 3' end and arrest increases when the zzso segment is zzso zzso We also demonstrated that arrest at the zzso site is completely dependent on the presence of a zzso element immediately upstream of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso II arrest element from the zzso gene has several unanticipated zzso arrest is independent of a weak zzso hybrid at the 3' end of the transcript, but it requires both a zzso at the 3' end and a zzso element upstream of the zzso zzso
