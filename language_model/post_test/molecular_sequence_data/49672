zzso is one of the central routes of carbon zzso in zzso zzso Several zzso zzso including the key zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso is induced by a variety of zzso and zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, expression is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso gene of the zzso Here, it is shown that the amount of zzso zzso zzso by the second gene of the zzso exceeds that of the zzso zzso by about zzso This differential synthesis was attributed to an zzso processing event that takes place at the 3' end of the zzso open reading frame and to differential zzso zzso of the resulting zzso zzso The zzso specifying the truncated zzso gene is quickly zzso whereas the downstream processing products encompassing zzso are quite zzso This increased stability is zzso by the presence of a zzso structure at the zzso end of the processed zzso zzso were introduced in the region of the zzso zzso A zzso affecting the stability of the zzso structure immediately downstream of the processing site had two zzso First, the zzso transcript pattern was drastically shifted towards the primary zzso second, the stability of the processed zzso containing the zzso zzso structure was strongly zzso This results in a reduction of the amount of zzso zzso in the zzso It is concluded that zzso processing is involved in differential zzso of the proteins zzso by the zzso zzso
