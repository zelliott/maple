Products of the degradation of human growth zzso factor zzso in zzso solutions zzso zzso have been isolated and fully zzso The zzso product, zzso and the zzso product, zzso from the degradation of zzso in zzso solution and the corresponding products, zzso and zzso from the degradation of zzso have been isolated and zzso The products, zzso and zzso from the zzso of zzso at pH zzso and the corresponding products, zzso and zzso from the zzso of zzso have been isolated and zzso All the degradation products of zzso and zzso were evaluated for biological activity and found to have much lower in zzso zzso than the parent zzso zzso occurs at zzso and zzso and the zzso of these various transformations versus pH and temperature have been zzso zzso is most stable at pH zzso At pH below the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso at zzso is the major route of zzso For pH greater than 4, zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The rates of zzso and zzso are simple first order and vary with zzso independent of buffer zzso such that the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso form zzso The more rapid zzso of zzso to generate zzso and zzso in about a zzso ratio, presumably via a zzso zzso zzso occurs at pH greater than or equal to 5 and is general zzso Evidence was also obtained for direct zzso of zzso zzso in zzso at pH less than or equal to 2 to give exclusively zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso at pH zzso zzso degrees C, is relatively insensitive to temperature for T less than 37 degrees C, possibly due to zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso or otherwise hindered with respect to these changes as no degradation at these sites was observed under the conditions zzso
