Treatment with zzso of patients infected with zzso B virus zzso results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the zzso substitution in the zzso reverse zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against zzso The analysis of zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that zzso is independently acquired by more than one zzso zzso zzso indicating the zzso nature of zzso zzso The differential capacity of zzso zzso to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of zzso zzso depend on the genetic structure of the zzso zzso An analysis of zzso networks that connect zzso to many sites of zzso proteins confirms that zzso resistance is a complex trait zzso by the entire zzso zzso rather than by a single zzso These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug zzso
