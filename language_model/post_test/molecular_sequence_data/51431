We have previously reported zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992) the isolation of a human zzso protein zzso which selectively zzso and blocks the differentiation of zzso zzso unit zzso cells in bone zzso colony zzso and the zzso zzso zzso differentiation of cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso cell differentiation directly, without affecting the ability of the cells to zzso In the present study, zzso (at zzso 1 zzso inhibited zzso cell differentiation only when added to the culture medium within 1 h after zzso zzso indicating that it blocked an early, critical step in zzso cell zzso The protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso also zzso inhibited the differentiation of zzso cells during this same period following zzso suggesting that zzso may have blocked an early zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was found to abolish a transient increase in membrane zzso activity which was triggered in zzso cells within zzso zzso after zzso zzso This increase in membrane zzso activity resulted from the zzso of an inactive pool of zzso residing on zzso and not from the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso also zzso membrane zzso activity and differentiation in human zzso cells and zzso zzso leukemia zzso As was the case with zzso cells, zzso prevented the early zzso of zzso and the differentiation of human zzso zzso However, it did not inhibit the early increase in zzso activity in zzso cells or the subsequent differentiation of these zzso These results suggest that zzso blocks zzso cell differentiation by zzso an early and critical zzso of inactive membrane zzso
