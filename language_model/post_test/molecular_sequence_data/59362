zzso of some of the zzso zzso were zzso and the molecular sizes of their zzso zzso compared by zzso analysis to zzso of cells of other zzso Several species of zzso have a major zzso protein of zzso sizes of zzso zzso and a lesser amount of a second zzso possibly a minor zzso zzso of 60 zzso The zzso protein sizes of other zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formed against the zzso protein of zzso zzso showed zzso in Western blots against zzso proteins of spores of other zzso species, two species of zzso and an zzso zzso zzso was also observed with zzso cells of two other zzso zzso zzso and a zzso species, and with zzso zzso No zzso was observed with zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid composition and partial zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso was compared to literature data for other bacterial zzso and found to be most similar to zzso zzso zzso
