A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso of the zzso influenza virus zzso zzso was selected by zzso virus in zzso cells in a medium containing zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against the influenza zzso Growth of the resulting zzso virus is dependent on the addition of zzso to the zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein was absent from the zzso virus zzso and Northern zzso showed that zzso segment 6, which contains the coding information for the zzso had undergone massive zzso zzso protein synthesis in cells infected with the zzso virus was not dependent on the addition of zzso In the absence of a functional zzso the zzso zzso virus can zzso zzso cells with normal zzso zzso This zzso influenza virus serves as an excellent source of parent virus for reverse zzso experiments involving genes that zzso a functional zzso
