Every living zzso needs to have multiple defense mechanisms against environmental challenge for survival during zzso Rapid changes in gene expression have been demonstrated during bacterial adaptation to environmental zzso Since DNA zzso varies in response to environment, and since zzso is known to influence strand separation in DNA, and therefore many vital cellular zzso including transcription, zzso could potentially serve as a molecular mechanism through which expression of many genes could be influenced by the zzso The relationship between changes in DNA zzso and a number of environmental stress conditions including high temperature, zzso stress and extreme zzso is reviewed zzso The activities of DNA zzso and zzso I are key components in determining the degree of bacterial DNA zzso The specific involvement of zzso function in bacterial adaptation to these environmental stress conditions, as demonstrated by the effect of zzso or zzso on adaptation and survival for these potentially lethal conditions, is also zzso
