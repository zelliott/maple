zzso zzso is a problematic pathogen that may spread among patients with zzso zzso zzso One highly infectious zzso strain that causes zzso in both the United Kingdom and eastern Canada has been shown to possess both the cable zzso zzso gene zzso and a unique combination of zzso zzso However, no genetic markers linking this strain type with other types epidemic at various centers have been zzso Using a randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso typing zzso we identified an apparently zzso zzso zzso in the DNA fingerprint of epidemic zzso zzso zzso Conservation of the DNA marker among epidemic strains was demonstrated by Southern zzso and its prevalence was assessed in a collection of zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso representative of 132 zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The marker was specifically associated with seven epidemic zzso zzso was absent among zzso strains infecting individual patients with zzso and rare among strains recovered from the natural zzso Only one of the seven epidemic zzso strain types possessed DNA zzso to zzso The zzso marker was designated the zzso zzso epidemic strain zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA corresponding to the zzso zzso marker revealed the presence of a putative open reading frame zzso with significant zzso to several negative zzso zzso the zzso was designated the zzso strain marker zzso or zzso The zzso DNA is the first genetic marker that has been identified to be specifically associated with and zzso among several epidemic zzso zzso strains which zzso multiple patients with zzso
