zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant zzso disorder caused by defects in the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report a novel zzso of the zzso gene in a 38-year-old man with zzso FH from the province of zzso in Northern zzso The patient presented with zzso zzso over the zzso zzso as well as zzso at sites of surgical zzso He was diagnosed with severe coronary artery disease requiring zzso at age zzso After an unsuccessful course of treatment with zzso the patient has been treated with plasma zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene revealed zzso for the rare zzso zzso and a loss of the zzso restriction zzso site in zzso zzso Single stranded zzso zzso of zzso 3, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 8 reveals an abnormal migration pattern in zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the promoter region, zzso 1, 4, 8 and 13 revealed two zzso and a novel zzso in zzso zzso This zzso consists of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site of zzso 8 at the last zzso of zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso from zzso obtained from the patient reveals a decrease in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and skipping of zzso 8 zzso zzso as assessed by zzso scanning of the amplified zzso to form a new zzso transcript that includes zzso 7 and 9 without zzso Alternative zzso editing leads to a new cryptic zzso zzso site 17 zzso downstream in zzso 8 producing a zzso zzso and a predicted premature stop zzso zzso zzso from the zzso start site zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso zzso directed at the zzso zzso of the zzso protein reveals a marked reduction in zzso protein expressed in zzso obtained from the zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel zzso of the zzso gene that results in marked decrease in zzso zzso levels and protein expression by two alternate zzso editing mechanisms, that cause skipping of zzso 8 or the use of a novel cryptic zzso zzso site in zzso 8 with a zzso and premature stop zzso The patient continues to do well on selective plasma zzso but developed bilateral severe carotid artery disease requiring surgical zzso
