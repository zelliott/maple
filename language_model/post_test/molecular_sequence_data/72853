zzso regulation by the zzso zzso zzso requires its binding to hormone response element zzso sequences in zzso A consensus zzso response element zzso can mediate zzso by zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified putative zzso response element zzso sequences by binding of a human zzso zzso domain fusion protein to DNA in a random sequence selection zzso A zzso pair consensus zzso zzso termed zzso containing three potential zzso core binding sites organized as both zzso and direct repeats, was determined from a pool of zzso zzso zzso was active in zzso zzso induction of reporter gene expression in transient zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence revealed an zzso pair sequence zzso consisting of two potential core binding sites oriented as an overlapping direct zzso as the most potent zzso zzso demonstrated a strong preference for zzso binding and zzso when compared with zzso To our knowledge, this is the first observation that a direct repeat of zzso core motifs functions as a preferred hormone response element within the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso
