A three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed based on the X-ray crystal structure of the related zzso coli fatty acid zzso condensing zzso zzso zzso II, revealing a similar zzso active site organization in these two zzso The model was assessed by zzso zzso of five zzso zzso acid zzso in Act zzso that are in close proximity to the zzso active zzso Three zzso completely zzso zzso zzso while two replacements resulted in significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso labeling of the various Act zzso zzso proteins demonstrated that none of the zzso acid replacements affected the formation of the active site zzso
