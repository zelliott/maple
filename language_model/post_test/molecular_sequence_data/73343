We have zzso a zzso zzso transport protein from zzso zzso zzso and cloned and zzso the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso roots, cauliflower zzso tobacco leaves, and zzso zzso All of these zzso exhibit high zzso to each other but only approximately zzso identity to the known zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding genes are expressed in both zzso active zzso and in zzso zzso although transcripts were more abundant in zzso zzso zzso of the coding region in transformed zzso cells and subsequent transport zzso of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the protein mediates transport of zzso zzso in exchange with zzso compounds zzso at zzso 2, particularly zzso which is required inside the zzso for the synthesis of, for example, aromatic zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is thus different in structure and function from the known zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso contain various zzso zzso with overlapping zzso zzso to ensure an efficient supply of zzso with a single zzso even in the presence of other zzso zzso
