The process of zzso zzso in zzso coli was studied in a two zzso system where expression of the downstream reporter gene was dependent on translation of an upstream reading zzso The dependence was almost zzso zzso translation increased expression of the downstream gene by two to three orders of zzso This large difference allowed us to zzso zzso in a meaningful zzso In the absence of a Shine and zzso zzso region zzso occurred but its efficiency was about zzso of that found in the zzso carrying zzso We discuss three ways by which zzso zzso between neighboring zzso can be zzso
