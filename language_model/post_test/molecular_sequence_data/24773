We use heat capacity data of Taylor et zzso to calculate the zzso distribution of a model zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso was designed with small zzso zzso at both ends of the zzso to zzso zzso thus giving a system that would be expected to show a zzso transition that is very close to being two zzso If we subtract a background contribution from the heat capacity data, then the zzso distribution we obtain shows two distinct zzso representing zzso and zzso The difference in the peak zzso values agrees closely with the zzso obtained from the two-state zzso On the other hand, if we use the complete heat capacity without zzso background we then obtain an zzso distribution that has only a single peak at all zzso We show that this result can be consistent with the existence of two states, zzso and zzso but only if the range of variation of the zzso of each species is so large as to make the notion of a species fairly zzso
