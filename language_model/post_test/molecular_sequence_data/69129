zzso recognition and pairing of the zzso and 3' zzso sites are critical steps in zzso zzso We report that the zzso factors zzso and zzso specifically interact with both the integral zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso and with the 35 zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso Previous studies indicated that the zzso zzso binds specifically to the zzso zzso site, while zzso zzso binds to the 3' zzso zzso Together, these observations suggest that zzso and other members of the zzso family of zzso factors may function in zzso site selection by acting as a bridge between components bound to the zzso and 3' zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso also interact with the zzso zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interactions zzso by zzso proteins may also play an important role in regulating alternative zzso
