The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso particle has been determined at zzso A resolution and the structure of the native zzso zzso at zzso zzso The structures of the coat protein shell appear to be zzso while differences are found in the organization of the density corresponding to the zzso The zzso is built of coat protein zzso and in shape zzso to a truncated zzso with T zzso 3 zzso The zzso is stabilized by four calcium zzso per zzso zzso zzso One is located at the symmetry axis relating the zzso related zzso and is part of an elaborate network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the zzso The remaining calcium zzso stabilize the contacts within the coat protein zzso The stability of the zzso particles decreases when calcium zzso are zzso with zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso particles are zzso in solution with elevated salt zzso The model of the zzso zzso provides an explanation of the zzso zzso of zzso since hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and calcium zzso have important roles in the zzso zzso zzso density of three putative zzso zzso per zzso zzso unit has been observed in the zzso zzso The zzso mediate contacts between the two zzso forming a zzso and a third zzso in another zzso We suggest a model for zzso zzso assembly in which addition of coat protein zzso to the forming zzso is facilitated by interaction with the zzso zzso The zzso structure is the first example in the zzso family that provides insight into the mechanism by which the zzso protein interaction may accelerate the zzso assembly and increase zzso zzso
