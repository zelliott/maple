An in zzso cell model of mouse lung zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso cells, spontaneously transformed cells, and zzso zzso cells was analyzed for zzso and zzso changes associated with the transition to zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify the zzso derived from the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso This approach allowed analysis of the gene zzso product rather than potentially zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso product identified a common single point zzso alone or together with zzso zzso for zzso in all of the zzso zzso An zzso transition in the second base position of zzso 61 was common to spontaneously zzso and chemical zzso cell lines and to lines selected for lung zzso zzso The absence of the zzso in the zzso cells suggests that the zzso zzso may be a factor in onset or maintenance of the zzso zzso and, at least in zzso may be a late event in the transformation zzso
