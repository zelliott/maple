In zzso zzso zzso zzso the genes involved in the zzso of zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are functionally and genetically zzso to the zzso genes of the zzso zzso but are zzso zzso We have zzso by zzso Southern zzso and sequencing of selected regions the zzso of the zzso zzso This analysis shows that the structural and regulatory genes of the zzso and zzso systems exhibit a high degree of zzso and are similarly zzso in zzso However the zzso are differently arranged on the zzso zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso of the two systems suggests that the zzso arrangement found in zzso may have originated from that found in zzso zzso via zzso zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso between two copies of the zzso element zzso
