The zzso consequences of a type II zzso zzso that contained a zzso zzso acid substitution were analyzed in a transgenic mouse zzso The zzso correlated with one previously characterized in a patient with the lethal human zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and resulted in a similar zzso zzso There were fewer collagen zzso present in the transgenic cartilage and reduced zzso of cartilage zzso using a type II collagen zzso zzso collagen from transgenic mouse zzso cartilage was analyzed zzso and indicated less type II as well as type zzso collagen compared to their zzso zzso A zzso experiment was performed to evaluate the zzso and fate of type II zzso zzso isolated from transgenic tissue zzso fewer stable zzso resulting in decreased zzso of the zzso zzso By zzso acid sequence analysis of the type II collagen peptides from cartilage of transgenic mouse zzso zzso was not detected at zzso zzso the site zzso in the zzso Based on sequence data, we believe that the molecules incorporated into collagen zzso of the zzso zzso while fewer in number, were composed of normal alpha zzso zzso
