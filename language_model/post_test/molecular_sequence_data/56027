zzso M zzso is an integral membrane protein found in zzso zzso It zzso an zzso step in methane formation from CO2 and from zzso The zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso to apparent zzso The zzso zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 670 zzso and was composed of seven different zzso of 34 zzso 28 zzso 24 zzso 23 zzso 21 zzso 13 zzso and 12 zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of these zzso were zzso The native zzso zzso was found to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso zzso zzso and 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses after sodium zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that the zzso was bound to the zzso zzso The apparent molecular masses of the zzso given above were determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso without boiling the samples prior to zzso When the samples were zzso as is usually done, the zzso zzso changed its apparent molecular mass to 33 zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed zzso The specific activity zzso zzso of the zzso zzso preparation was zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso for zzso was 260 zzso and that for zzso M was 60 zzso The preparation was absolutely dependent on the presence of zzso for zzso zzso enhanced the activity zzso
