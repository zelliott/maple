zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso as well as a scavenger zzso for oxidized low density zzso is expressed zzso on zzso and zzso By this dual role it might be involved in early steps of zzso like the recruitment of zzso and formation of foam zzso We therefore studied the effects of zzso fatty acids on zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso into cellular zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso expression at the zzso and protein level, whereas zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso tended to increase zzso expression compared to the zzso This specific zzso of zzso by zzso fatty acids in cells involved in the initiation and progression of zzso and zzso represents a further mechanism that may contribute to the beneficial effects of zzso zzso fatty acids zzso in these zzso
