A family of zzso zzso have been identified in adult rat brain that include alternatively spliced products of the same zzso A composite sequence of zzso zzso zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with chicken zzso a zzso neural cell zzso zzso in the zzso zzso expressed in embryonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate as pure proteins in a zzso zzso zzso at a site located in the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed late in zzso development to approximately the same levels as zzso and comprise a significant fraction of brain membrane zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso zzso are zzso with zzso Major differences in zzso expression have been reported for zzso in zzso compared with the late zzso expression of zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso represent products of gene zzso events that have subsequently evolved in parallel with distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso and chicken zzso are nearly identical to each other and closely related to a group of nervous system cell zzso molecules with variable zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso A hypothesis to be evaluated is that zzso activity is shared by all of these zzso
