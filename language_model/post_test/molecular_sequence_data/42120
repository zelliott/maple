zzso acts via specific zzso receptors through signal zzso pathways that include increases in zzso free calcium and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso receptors have been zzso The ETA zzso is zzso selective, and the zzso zzso is zzso zzso Both zzso zzso are widely distributed throughout the body, although ETA receptors predominate in vascular smooth muscle, whereas zzso receptors predominate in the zzso The presence of mixed zzso zzso makes functional screening of zzso zzso zzso A zzso expression zzso was constructed by inserting the cloned coding region of the human zzso zzso downstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with this zzso and cell lines were isolated with zzso integrated copies of the relevant zzso One line, zzso was shown to specifically bind zzso zzso analysis indicated a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, as did zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso a selective ETA zzso zzso did not inhibit the action of zzso The zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso of the membrane from zzso cells with zzso acid zzso a zzso charged, zzso agent capable of zzso zzso groups, and zzso zzso a penetrating agent that causes irreversible zzso of zzso groups, significantly reduces zzso but has no effect on zzso In whole cells, zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso
