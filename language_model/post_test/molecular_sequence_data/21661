zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso is a widely distributed nuclear zzso involved in several zzso functions including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To better understand the role of this nuclear zzso in liver, we aimed at displaying genes controlled by zzso in liver cells by generating zzso human zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Genes whose expression was altered in these cells versus control cells were displayed using zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso of these genes was also altered in cells in which zzso was zzso zzso after zzso zzso A number of the genes found were involved in known pathways controlled by zzso for instance zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This study also revealed that genes such as zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso involved in the control of body weight, are also controlled by zzso Lastly, zzso involved in cell growth and zzso and associated with liver zzso was zzso by zzso zzso was found to be a new putative zzso target gene since it zzso in its promoter, a functional zzso as evidenced by zzso and zzso zzso Most of the other genes that we found regulated by zzso also contained putative zzso in their regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were occupied by zzso in zzso zzso Therefore these genes must now be considered as direct zzso zzso Our results open new routes on the roles of zzso in zzso metabolism and zzso within cells of zzso zzso
