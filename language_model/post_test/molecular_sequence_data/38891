The zzso core of zzso coli DNA zzso III contains three tightly associated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is the zzso but the least understood of the zzso As a first step in a program aimed at understanding its function, the structure of the zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso Although only a small zzso zzso was difficult to assign fully because approximately one-third of the protein is zzso and some sections of the remaining structured parts undergo intermediate zzso zzso The secondary structure was deduced from the characteristic nuclear zzso effect patterns, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the consensus chemical shift zzso The zzso third of the zzso which has many charged and zzso zzso acid zzso has no zzso secondary structure and exists in a highly dynamic zzso The zzso two-thirds has three zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso one short extended segment zzso and a long loop zzso of which part may undergo intermediate zzso zzso zzso of the three-dimensional structure by zzso techniques revealed that the zzso fold in such a way that the surface of zzso is zzso with one face of the protein containing most of the zzso zzso and the other face containing most of the long chain basic zzso zzso chemical shift mapping experiments with a domain of the zzso zzso have identified a loop region zzso in zzso as the site of association with zzso
