The effectiveness of tissue zzso zzso zzso in zzso therapy is dependent upon the rate at which zzso administered zzso reaches the zzso site and the proportion of that zzso which is zzso zzso zzso between zzso and its main plasma inhibitor zzso and between zzso and the zzso cells lining blood vessels are two factors which may limit zzso In an attempt to identify the regions of the zzso zzso involved in these zzso we have examined a series of synthetic peptides with zzso acid sequences corresponding to different regions of the zzso zzso for their ability to protect zzso from zzso by zzso and for their ability to reduce the binding of zzso to zzso zzso Three peptides were identified which were especially effective at maintaining zzso activity in the presence of zzso and three others were found which had a lesser zzso These same peptides were also found to inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso zzso This suggests that the same regions of the zzso zzso are involved in both zzso None of the peptides inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso These peptides may serve as models for the development of agents for enhancing the activity of both zzso zzso and of zzso administered in zzso zzso
