The aim of this study was to test for expression of a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso located at the zzso end of the zzso acid zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso and to determine the nature of the zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso fusion protein with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso prepared against this fusion zzso zzso with a zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso crude zzso Since this protein was larger than that predicted from the zzso sequence (32 zzso zzso was zzso revealing an zzso of zzso zzso that encodes a zzso protein containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso product has a high degree of similarity to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein zzso zzso A zzso zzso synthesis of zzso to zzso fatty acids but not zzso zzso zzso zzso severely inhibited zzso zzso activities of the zzso protein and extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They also showed zzso zzso with proteins in these zzso Both the zzso protein and the zzso zzso activity were located in the cell zzso or were loosely associated with the cell zzso These results indicate that zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso
