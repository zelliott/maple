zzso zzso I zzso is a type II zzso zzso which zzso the protein zzso at the zzso zzso zzso is composed of a zzso active zzso with zzso zzso activity and a zzso with zzso binding zzso Using comparative zzso binding zzso along with zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso was shown to zzso bind to terminally zzso zzso series zzso from human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso series zzso were not zzso Only marginal binding of zzso to terminal zzso zzso of neutral zzso with a zzso or zzso sequence was determined, whereas a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not bind at zzso Among the zzso investigated in Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso only those carrying zzso zzso exclusively, zzso or even as less abundant constituents in an assembly with zzso zzso displayed high zzso binding zzso From our data we conclude that zzso zzso has to be considered as a zzso zzso and not a zzso zzso and zzso zzso series zzso and zzso with type II zzso which share the zzso zzso are true zzso zzso This strict preference might help to explain the zzso potential of zzso toward certain zzso zzso and its therapeutic success as a zzso zzso zzso
