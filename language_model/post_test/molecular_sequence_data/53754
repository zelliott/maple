A polar zzso zzso zzso rod, zzso zzso originally identified as zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso rate of zzso under stringent conditions, with the type strain of zzso zzso despite the zzso zzso zzso value between two type strains being as high as zzso The strain was clearly differentiated from the type strain of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and nutritional zzso without significant difference in cellular fatty acid and zzso zzso Based on the results of zzso zzso sequence analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso isolated on 8 December 1989 from surface soil along the roadside in zzso zzso zzso Major respiratory zzso is zzso zzso content of DNA is zzso
