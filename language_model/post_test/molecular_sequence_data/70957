zzso coli zzso IV is a zzso DNA repair zzso zzso possessing both zzso (AP) zzso and zzso zzso The former activity zzso zzso sites, whereas the latter one removes a variety of zzso groups present at zzso breaks in damaged zzso However, the precise reaction mechanism by which zzso IV zzso DNA zzso is zzso To probe this zzso we have identified eight zzso acid zzso that alter zzso IV function in zzso Seven of these zzso proteins are zzso expressed in zzso coli and, when zzso show a zzso reduction in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most severe zzso was observed with the one remaining zzso zzso that showed normal protein zzso This zzso has lost the ability to bind zzso DNA and showed a dramatic zzso reduction in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso and the zzso activities of zzso IV are associated with a single active site, that is perhaps remote from the DNA binding zzso
