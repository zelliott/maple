Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso was used to determine the three zzso structure of rice zzso zzso transfer protein zzso a 91 zzso acid zzso protein belonging to the broad family of plant zzso zzso specific assignment was obtained for all but three zzso backbone zzso zzso and for more than zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments at zzso zzso The structure was calculated on the basis of four zzso bridge zzso zzso distance constraints derived from zzso zzso effects, 72 zzso angle restraints and 32 zzso zzso The final solution structure involves four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by a long zzso tail zzso with no zzso regular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso oxygen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonds with i + 3 zzso zzso additionally stabilize the N zzso of the first three zzso The fourth zzso involving Pro zzso display a mixture of alpha and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of 14 final structures with respect to the average structure is zzso zzso zzso A for all heavy atoms zzso zzso O and zzso and zzso zzso zzso A for the backbone zzso The global fold of rice zzso is close to the previously published structures of zzso barley and zzso zzso exhibiting nearly identical pattern of the numerous sequence specific zzso As reported previously for different zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrogen bonding and zzso mechanisms of fold stabilization were found for the rice zzso The sequential alignment of 36 zzso primary structures strongly suggests that there is a uniform pattern of specific long-range interactions (in terms of zzso which stabilize the fold of all plant zzso
