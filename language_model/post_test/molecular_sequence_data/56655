The zzso action of zzso zzso administered zzso zzso and zzso on zzso net flux of water under zzso zzso E1 zzso and zzso toxin zzso zzso conditions was determined in zzso on isolated zzso loop in zzso zzso Both zzso and CT induced zzso zzso in the zzso This zzso effect was not affected by SC administration of zzso zzso zzso 10, and 100 zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso while 200 zzso had no zzso Similarly, zzso (1 and 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso reduced the increase of net water flux induced by zzso However, higher doses of zzso zzso and 200 zzso and zzso (10 and 100 zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 and 10 zzso abolished the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso However, 100 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso zzso and zzso reduce the zzso induced by zzso and abolish that induced by zzso These effects were obtained with doses of less than 100 zzso of the products, higher doses being zzso The higher efficacy against zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso suggests a direct zzso effect at the zzso level and indicates the usefulness of these products as zzso agents in zzso zzso zzso
