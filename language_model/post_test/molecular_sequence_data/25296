zzso of zzso zzso with zzso relevant zzso of zzso resulted in the formation of spontaneously stable zzso zzso The reaction of zzso and zzso zzso from rat liver either by a DNA recognition site affinity zzso or by zzso acid extraction occurred primarily at the zzso zzso in the zzso tail of zzso which is crucial for its function as a zzso zzso It was further shown using an zzso fusion protein produced in zzso coli and the protein isolated from rat liver that the formation of zzso zzso with zzso impair its DNA binding zzso We propose that such a reaction may occur in zzso and lead to an inability to repress genes in the liver upon excessive alcohol zzso This mechanism may play a role in zzso collagen synthesis in zzso
