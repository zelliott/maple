zzso of the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso II controls the zzso assembly of zzso processing and zzso zzso zzso relies on zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognize different zzso zzso during the zzso cycle, but the molecular basis for their specificity remains zzso We show that the zzso of two zzso termination factors, zzso and zzso achieve high affinity and specificity both by specifically recognizing the zzso zzso and by zzso binding to neighboring zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso interface abolish zzso and affect recruitment at the 3' end processing site in zzso We suggest that this zzso provides a zzso mechanism to ensure that its action is confined only to proper zzso sites where zzso zzso density is zzso
