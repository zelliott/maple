zzso zzso protein zzso is produced as a zzso of 130 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we performed the in zzso processing of zzso and showed that the zzso zzso of zzso was processed into the two zzso fragments of 20 and 45 zzso through the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso The processing into these two fragments was also observed in zzso To investigate functional properties of the two fragments, zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins of the zzso intermediate and the zzso and zzso fragments were zzso Neither the zzso fusion protein zzso nor the zzso fusion protein zzso was actively toxic against zzso larvae of zzso zzso whereas the zzso intermediate fusion protein zzso exhibited significant zzso However, when the two fusion proteins zzso and zzso zzso significant toxicity was zzso The zzso experiment demonstrated that the two fragments associated with each zzso zzso it is strongly suggested that the two fragments formed an active complex of apparently 60 zzso A zzso of the zzso protein which was apparently resistant to the zzso zzso with the zzso extract of zzso zzso larvae had toxicity slightly lower than that of zzso
