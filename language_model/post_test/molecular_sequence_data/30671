To determine whether zzso elements in addition to the highly zzso zzso zzso motif are important for zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional zzso zzso factor, designated zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso site plays a critical role in the zzso zzso because zzso of the zzso DNA motif decreased zzso activity of the zzso zzso in cells of the zzso lineage but not in zzso zzso This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, combined zzso of both zzso and zzso sites further reduced zzso activity in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of either the zzso or zzso site in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that lacks the binding site for zzso abolished zzso activity in zzso cells zzso Nevertheless, a zzso of the zzso motif alone showed no zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso the functional data showing that a zzso protein binds to the zzso DNA zzso Our results suggest that the zzso element is a new crucial element important for zzso expression of the zzso gene but that interaction with another zzso element is essential for its zzso
