Two zzso and zzso distinct storage zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2) have been identified in zzso zzso zzso The molecular weights of the native molecules were estimated to be zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso 2) by pore limiting zzso zzso zzso 1 partially zzso with moderate alkaline zzso Both proteins are composed of a single type of zzso of zzso 73 zzso 1) and 80 zzso zzso zzso While most of zzso 2 is zzso by the fat body before zzso zzso 1 remains largely in the zzso during the last zzso and zzso zzso Both proteins were detected only in low zzso in the zzso of newly emerged adults, and they gradually disappear from adult workers maintained in the zzso In zzso workers, however, zzso 1 and zzso 2 accumulate in the zzso and fat body, zzso the most abundant proteins together with zzso zzso zzso storage zzso bear some zzso in their zzso sequence with the zzso of zzso and zzso as well as with a crab zzso However, with respect to their zzso acid zzso they can not be classified as zzso
