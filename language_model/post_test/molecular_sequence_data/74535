The transport of zzso zzso zzso is essential for the growth of all zzso The metabolism of zzso zzso species, and their ability to produce antibiotics and other secondary zzso are strongly influenced by the availability of zzso The zzso regulation of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso was zzso These genes zzso the two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these genes and that of the zzso transport system zzso follows a sequential pattern in response to zzso zzso as shown by zzso their promoters to a zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso but not that of zzso (a zzso zzso is dependent upon the response regulator zzso zzso binds to specific sequences consisting of direct repeats of 11 zzso in the promoter of zzso but does not bind to the zzso promoter, which lacks these direct repeats for zzso zzso The zzso start point of the zzso promoter was identified by primer extension zzso and the structure of the regulatory sequences in the zzso DNA region was zzso It consists of four central direct repeats flanked by two other less zzso zzso A model for zzso regulation of this promoter is proposed based on the four promoter zzso complexes detected by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso
