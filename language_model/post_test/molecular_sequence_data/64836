zzso zzso zzso a DNA analogue in which positively charged zzso replaces the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso by varying lengths has been zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso on solid phase in the 3' zzso zzso direction that allowed zzso incorporation of straight chain zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso using zzso zzso The stability of zzso zzso and zzso duplexes formed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso DNA, zzso and zzso zzso DNA, zzso respectively, has been evaluated by zzso melting and zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso enhances the zzso triplex stability by a zzso of 13 degrees zzso The zzso zzso studies of zzso triplex complexes show that the zzso zzso of the zzso bind in the major groove while the zzso zzso resides in the zzso rich minor groove of zzso A single zzso base pair mismatch in the target site decreases the zzso triplex stability by 11 degrees C, whereas zzso triplex stability was decreased by 23 degrees zzso zzso of zzso base pair into zzso base pair in the center of the binding site, which provides a mismatch selectively for zzso zzso decreases the triplex stability by only 5-6 degrees zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso the zzso duplex exhibited significant increase in the zzso zzso due to the binding of the zzso zzso zzso in the generated zzso minor groove, and the duplex stability was enhanced by zzso of 7 degrees zzso The stability of zzso zzso and zzso duplexes is independent of zzso whereas the stability of zzso zzso decreases with increase in zzso
