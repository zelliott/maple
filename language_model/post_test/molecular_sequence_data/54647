The population dynamics and prevalence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso were investigated on the zzso hill sheep farm in Country Mayo, Ireland from August 2006 until March zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected at zzso intervals in 4 snail zzso on the farm, their relative density and mean monthly zzso and temperature were zzso Snail abundance was associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso abundance was generally low during winter zzso zzso zzso 2007), mid spring and summer 2007 zzso and late autumn and winter zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, two zzso in zzso zzso abundance were evident during the study period, an early spring zzso and late zzso zzso zzso zzso Seasonal differences were observed in the prevalence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the greatest prevalence was evident in 2007 during the summer zzso and autumn zzso Two seasonal transmission peaks, as evident by the presence of mature infections in zzso one in zzso and the other in late zzso zzso Not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the zzso zzso stages observed in mature and zzso snails zzso Worthy of note in this study, zzso were also evident in zzso zzso The present study highlights the influence of milder temperatures and zzso conditions on both snail and fluke zzso If the trend in mild and wet weather conditions continues, there is the potential for an increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso and ultimately the prevalence of zzso in grazing livestock in zzso
