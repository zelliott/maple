The presence of a very high density zzso zzso an zzso zzso was explored in different zzso of zzso zzso throughout the last zzso and adult zzso and in egg extracts by Western zzso zzso The zzso was always detected in both, zzso and fat body, during the above mentioned stages and it was also observed in the buffer soluble fraction of zzso and egg zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso reaches a maximum value before the last zzso then it abruptly declines in males and females just after zzso but during adult life it increases zzso Fat body zzso decreases slowly and continuously during the zzso growth reaching a minimum value prior to zzso and in the first week of adult life the values were even zzso zzso then, it shows a different cycle of zzso and depletion in males and zzso In adult zzso the zzso zzso a cycle similar to the one observed in male fat zzso This protein increases progressively during embryonic development and, at the time of zzso zzso it reaches its maximum zzso The zzso protein presents zzso in its zzso sequence with storage zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
