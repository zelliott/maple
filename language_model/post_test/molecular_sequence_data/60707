The zzso and its molecular zzso zzso alpha gene fusion, is strongly associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso Since treatment response to zzso zzso acid zzso directly with zzso zzso zzso documentation is critical to patient zzso We have designed an extremely zzso practical, zzso chain reaction zzso method using a rapid air zzso zzso to detect type A, B, and zzso fusion patterns of zzso zzso We examined 15 cases of zzso and 13 cases of zzso other than zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso samples were type A, 11 were type B, and 1 was a B zzso based on gel band zzso zzso products exhibited positive probe zzso signals and had sequences containing type A, B, or zzso fusion zzso zzso amplification of zzso alpha was complete in 22 minutes, and the entire test required 4 1/2 zzso This method permits exceptional turnaround time and is an alternative to zzso and slower zzso zzso
