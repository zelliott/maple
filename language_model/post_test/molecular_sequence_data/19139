serpent zzso encodes a zzso that controls various aspects of zzso in zzso such as zzso development, gut differentiation and zzso During zzso zzso expression is required in the embryonic head zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the two known zzso zzso of zzso to obtain mature zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso is known to depend on snail and zzso but the regulatory complexity that defines the zzso has not been addressed zzso Here, we find that zzso is sufficient to transform trunk zzso into zzso We identify two zzso zzso zzso that direct the early expression in the zzso zzso and the late expression in mature zzso and zzso zzso zzso During embryonic zzso a combination of zzso zzso empty zzso and zzso confines the zzso zzso expression to the head zzso This restriction to the head zzso is crucial as zzso zzso in zzso precursors interferes with the development of zzso zzso and promotes zzso and zzso zzso Thus, several genes work in a combined fashion to restrain early zzso expression to the head zzso in order to prevent expansion of the zzso zzso
