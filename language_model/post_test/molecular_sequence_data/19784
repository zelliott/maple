A zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso improved protein zzso and promoted the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso High-yield zzso of zzso zzso was achieved through zzso affinity zzso with a final specific activity and yield of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso was determined to be approximately 43 zzso by gel zzso zzso zzso zzso had an optimum temperature and pH of 70 degrees C and pH 9, zzso It was stable up to 65 degrees C with a zzso of 5 h 15 zzso at pH zzso It was stable in the presence of 1 zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ), but inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 80 significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was active towards medium to long chain zzso zzso and various natural oils with a marked preference for zzso zzso zzso and sunflower oil zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were involved in zzso as its activity was strongly inhibited by 5 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was around zzso degrees C, as revealed by zzso protein analysis of CD zzso
