zzso zzso of zzso isolated from rat brain revealed the presence of two zzso zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso zzso at all stages of development ranging from 1 day before birth to zzso The level of both zzso messages appeared to be zzso regulated and a gradual increase was observed from prenatal day 1 to zzso The two transcripts were highly zzso as zzso through zzso studies using zzso derived from the zzso end, middle, and 3' end of a cloned rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was essentially identical in size to the zzso zzso zzso The message was efficiently translated in the brain, and is believed to zzso the zzso zzso It seems unlikely that the zzso species represents a precursor of the zzso zzso as it was also translated in zzso although less efficiently than the smaller zzso zzso Neither of the two zzso zzso species were induced by bacterial zzso Unlike zzso only one zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso could be zzso This transcript was of very low abundance and was not zzso zzso but could be increased by bacterial zzso The product of this induced message, however, was not zzso by Western zzso analysis using zzso raised against liver zzso An zzso could be detected in brain zzso by zzso using the same zzso This zzso however, exhibited zzso properties different from that of the zzso liver zzso or that of zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso activity correlated well with the amount of zzso zzso protein and both reflect the abundance of the zzso zzso message over the course of zzso
