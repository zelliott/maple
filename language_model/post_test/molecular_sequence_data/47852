zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is 150 zzso which includes a 43 zzso characterized region containing a number of defined genes and an open reading frame zzso The 43 zzso region is organized with the zzso immediately upstream from the zzso zzso coding for an zzso zzso then an unknown 20 zzso region downstream followed by the zzso gene zzso for a zzso protection zzso then the zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso is zzso zzso is a putative sensor and zzso a zzso zzso zzso of 60 zzso representing one zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso species, zzso the zzso zzso genes to an unrelated zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso chain reaction to show the linkage between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that the zzso gene product may participate in the transfer of the zzso gene with or without the zzso region and has zzso to bacterial zzso zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso genes carried and transferred the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso gene product may be important in transfer of the 43 zzso zzso region to zzso zzso The zzso gene product is not required when zzso is transferred independently of zzso
