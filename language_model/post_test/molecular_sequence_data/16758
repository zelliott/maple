In zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate zzso zzso and, more recently, stress and zzso The characterization of the molecular zzso responsible for its pharmacological selectivity was made possible by the recent discovery of the first zzso zzso zzso Based upon the structure of the zzso bovine zzso we established a three-dimensional molecular model of interaction between the human zzso zzso and zzso Four zzso acids located in distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found potentially responsible for the zzso zzso To validate these zzso we selectively replaced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 338 zzso of zzso by their corresponding zzso acids present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four zzso which all exhibited zzso affinities for zzso and good zzso to zzso C pathway, were zzso zzso receptors zzso at position 220 and 334 exhibited striking increase in affinity for zzso both in binding and zzso C zzso at zzso with the zzso modified at position 181 or zzso In conclusion, this study provides the first structural features concerning the zzso and highlights the role of few specific zzso in its pharmacological zzso
