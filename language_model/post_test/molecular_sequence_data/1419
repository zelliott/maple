zzso hybrid zzso and zzso are a consequence of divergent evolution between species and serve to maintain the discrete identities of zzso The evolution of hybrid zzso has been described in widely accepted models by zzso and zzso where zzso functional divergence is the essential characteristic of hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso models are required to identify and test candidate hybrid zzso zzso Several zzso zzso genes involved in hybrid zzso have been identified but none has yet been shown to have functionally zzso in accordance with the zzso zzso By introducing transgenic copies of the zzso zzso male rescue zzso gene into zzso zzso from its sibling species zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso has functionally zzso to cause F1 hybrid zzso between these zzso zzso with the zzso model, we find that zzso has zzso extensively in the zzso zzso zzso but we also find extensive divergence in the zzso zzso Together, these findings zzso over zzso of the zzso acids zzso by zzso as candidates for causing hybrid zzso The exceptional level of divergence at zzso cannot be explained by neutral processes because we use zzso methods and population genetic analyses to show that the elevated zzso divergence in both lineages is due to positive selection in the distant zzso least one million generations zzso Our findings suggest that multiple zzso driven by natural selection may be a general phenomenon required to generate hybrid zzso zzso
