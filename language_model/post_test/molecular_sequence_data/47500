The zzso basic protein zzso zzso present during maturation and early zzso of the sea star zzso zzso were zzso The major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso cloned based on zzso sequence information obtained with the zzso zzso and shown to be highly related to human zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso remained highly active until 12 h zzso zzso after which it zzso By 4 days zzso zzso protein was no longer zzso At 3 h zzso about half of the zzso zzso zzso activity could be attributed to a 75 zzso protein zzso that was distinct from zzso Like zzso this protein zzso zzso mostly on zzso zzso but it failed to zzso a zzso zzso based upon the zzso zzso zzso zzso site in zzso Rather, it zzso a zzso zzso patterned after the zzso of zzso Our studies also showed a dramatic increase in zzso zzso activity occurred by 4 days zzso that arose from a third zzso that zzso zzso solely on zzso zzso This zzso exhibited the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was not appreciably affected by addition of zzso or the zzso analogue Roche zzso 3, but it was partly inhibited by a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an apparent molecular mass of 41 zzso for the zzso zzso at least two novel zzso zzso distinct from zzso are zzso activated following zzso and early zzso of the sea zzso
