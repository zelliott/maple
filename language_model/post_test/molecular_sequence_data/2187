The functions and molecular interactions of type V collagen in the zzso zzso are zzso Our studies show that type V collagen zzso on a surface binds zzso zzso with apparent higher affinity than do collagen types I, II, III, IV, or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso molecules may mediate interactions between cells and type V zzso zzso type V collagen may act as an anchor for zzso in the zzso zzso and function as a zzso for zzso cell zzso This model is supported by studies showing that Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso which are deficient in zzso synthesis attach poorly to type V collagen zzso compared to zzso cells, whereas attachment of zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso is not zzso Also, zzso zzso reduces attachment of zzso zzso and smooth muscle cells to type V collagen but does not affect cell attachment to zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso depends on the size and zzso content of the zzso zzso At tested zzso zzso zzso does not affect the attachment of zzso cells or the binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso coated with type V zzso These data suggest that a certain degree of structural specificity is involved in zzso binding to type V zzso
