zzso compounds show zzso effects in zzso and in zzso Several clinical studies have shown the efficacy of zzso compounds in type 2 diabetic zzso However, a major concern is safety, which calls for the development of more potent zzso zzso For that reason different laboratories develop strategies to decrease the therapeutic dose of zzso One of these strategies use zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with zzso zzso activity and adhesive properties implicated in zzso zzso at inflammation zzso zzso of zzso combined with low zzso of zzso strongly stimulate zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the plasma membrane in zzso zzso and in rat zzso This combination also shows zzso effects in various animal models of type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso administration generates zzso locally in pancreatic zzso which stimulates insulin zzso and also produces zzso in zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso metabolism in zzso and in neighboring zzso This opens up the possibility of using the zzso activity as a local generator of protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso More recently a novel class of zzso zzso have shown potent zzso effects downstream of the insulin zzso Administration of these compounds lowers zzso and zzso the plasma zzso profile in type 1 and type 2 models of zzso The combination of different approaches to decrease zzso doses, among them zzso agents and zzso zzso should permit to develop safe and efficient zzso based agents safe for diabetes zzso
