zzso circular zzso zzso has been shown to be a useful technique for characterization of the qualitative secondary structure type for linear zzso and zzso A brief review of characteristic spectral responses and applications is zzso Since zzso is dependent on relatively short range zzso it detects residual structure in such zzso even if long range order is zzso zzso studies presented here for zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso as a function of zzso salt added and temperature, confirm residual local order in these zzso zzso zzso to results with Pro zzso supports an interpretation that these extended structures have a left handed twist zzso The zzso zzso is shown to be significantly reduced in intensity by temperature increase and by decrease in zzso zzso By contrast, for partially zzso zzso zzso the spectrum changes to the high temperature zzso shape on heating, first losing then gaining intensity, indicating an equilibrium shift between structured states, from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to be a useful technique for monitoring local order in otherwise random zzso zzso
