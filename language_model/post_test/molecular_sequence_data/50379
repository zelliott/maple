We have isolated a zzso zzso a zzso factor that binds to the zzso of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso protein 2 zzso is a zzso zzso containing two sets of widely separated zinc fingers and a stretch of highly zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso The two zinc finger regions, when expressed individually as bacterial fusion zzso bind with highest affinity to the zzso class I gene zzso Several proteins found in zzso nuclear extracts bind the zzso class I zzso in an zzso mobility shift zzso Only one of these, a zzso expressed factor, forming a zzso retarded complex, can be zzso by a zzso zzso The same zzso also zzso a protein of greater than 250 zzso from zzso cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a zzso factor involved in the regulation of zzso class I gene zzso
