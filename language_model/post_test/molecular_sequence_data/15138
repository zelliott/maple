To explore the association of microbial community structure with the development of zzso in a large shallow freshwater lake, Lake zzso 

The bacterial and zzso zzso in sediments of different lake areas were zzso using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of amplified zzso zzso zzso The bacterial zzso profiles showed that zzso sites, zzso areas and relatively clean sites with a zzso (albeit zzso site are three respective zzso Fifty-one dominant bacterial zzso bands were detected and 92 corresponding clones were zzso most of which were affiliated with bacterial zzso commonly found in freshwater zzso zzso were detected in the zzso of the lake and not at zzso sites whereas the opposite was found with respect to zzso Twenty-five dominant zzso zzso bands were detected and 31 corresponding clones were zzso most of which were affiliated with freshwater zzso zzso 

The bacterial community structures in the sediments of different areas with similar water quality and situation tend to be similar in zzso zzso 

This study may expand our knowledge on the relationship between the overall microbial zzso and the development of zzso in the shallow freshwater zzso
