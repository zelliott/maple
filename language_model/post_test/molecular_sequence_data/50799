A zzso clone containing the complete coding sequence of the human zzso gene has been zzso The gene is located at one end of the approximately 40 zzso zzso insert and approximately zzso zzso of the sequence data have been obtained from this zzso Two discrepancies with the published zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso & Reid (1991) zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso have been zzso zzso has previously been described as a modular zzso with the majority of its sequence composed of six tandem repeats of a sequence motif of approximately 60 zzso acids which is related to the zzso repeat sequence zzso initially described in zzso zzso & Hynes zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso & Reid zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence data indicates that the human zzso gene is organized into ten zzso which span approximately 6 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are coded for by zzso symmetrical zzso zzso zzso which supports the hypothesis that modular proteins evolved by a process involving zzso zzso zzso is also coded for by a discrete zzso but the boundaries are zzso zzso zzso The sequence coding for the sixth zzso is split across the final two zzso of the gene with the first 38 zzso acids of the repeat coded for by an zzso zzso zzso zzso This split at the zzso level has been zzso by alignment analysis, to be reflected at the protein level with the division of repeat 6 into zzso and zzso zzso
