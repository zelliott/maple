A full-length zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso a wild relative of the cultivated zzso Analysis of the predicted primary sequence suggested that the protein product, zzso may be targeted to the zzso zzso and inserted in the plant plasma zzso facing the zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso conditions for this construct were zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso raised against a truncated version of zzso The full-length zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso using immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso followed by zzso exchange zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a specific activity of zzso zzso zzso Its apparent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were in good agreement with values found in the literature for other plant zzso zzso zzso was highly sensitive to pH variations between zzso and zzso It was inhibited by zzso and insensitive to zzso These findings constitute the first kinetic characterization of a homogeneous plant zzso zzso The relevance of zzso kinetic properties is discussed in relation to the regulation of zzso metabolism in zzso
