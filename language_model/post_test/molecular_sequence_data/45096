The extreme diversity in zzso zzso and in the regulation mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in nature, makes a comparative structural study of these zzso of great zzso We report here on the zzso and structural characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This work zzso the way for the understanding of the structural zzso leading to diversity in zzso zzso and of the regulation mechanisms of zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso in complex with zzso was refined to zzso zzso The zzso unit contains two zzso zzso with each zzso consisting of a zzso binding zzso domain and a particularly unique zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was modeled into the active zzso The model of the zzso complex zzso nicely reveals at the atomic level the concerted mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso
