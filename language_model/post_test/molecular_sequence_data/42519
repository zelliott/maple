The principal zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso is located within the variable zzso region of the external envelope protein zzso Although it is recognized that zzso sequences induce zzso response with restricted zzso activity in zzso we observed that the zzso consensus sequences representing North zzso and African zzso were highly zzso binding 94 and zzso respectively, of zzso collected from zzso individuals originating from various parts of the zzso Even zzso zzso from some East African residents, infected by strains whose zzso loop sequences are undoubtedly distinct from the North zzso consensus zzso loop zzso reacted better to the zzso North zzso consensus zzso than to zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso consensus sequences represent the best candidates for optimal zzso with a wide variety of zzso Furthermore, using zzso for zzso to zzso zzso zzso it is shown that zzso strains related to the MN group are prevalent in West Africa, indicating either a West African origin of the zzso viruses or more probably an introduction of this group of viruses through zzso American zzso
