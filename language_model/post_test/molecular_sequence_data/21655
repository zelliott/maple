zzso vertically infected children in the USA are living into adolescence and beyond with the widespread use of zzso zzso These patients exhibit striking differences in the rate of zzso disease progression which could provide insights into mechanisms of zzso We hypothesized that differences in the pattern of zzso including zzso magnitude and zzso of zzso specific zzso T cell response could partially explain differences in progression zzso 

In this study, we zzso zzso and assessed the functionality of these responses against individual zzso zzso peptides in 58 zzso vertically infected zzso zzso were divided into two groups depending upon the rate of disease zzso adolescents with a sustained zzso were zzso as having no immune suppression zzso and those with zzso zzso as having severe immune suppression zzso We observed differences in the area of zzso to which the two groups made zzso In addition, subjects who expressed the zzso zzso or zzso zzso were highly likely to restrict their zzso response through these zzso There was a significantly higher frequency of zzso zzso T cells in the zzso subjects zzso compared to the SS zzso In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in any other zzso T cell zzso The differentiation profiles and zzso of zzso zzso T cells, regardless of zzso also failed to demonstrate meaningful differences between the two zzso 

Together, these data suggest that, at least in vertically infected zzso the region of zzso targeted by zzso T cells and the magnitude of that response relative to other responses may have more importance on the rate of disease progression than their qualitative zzso zzso
