To characterize the promoter structures of zzso zzso zzso primer extension analysis was carried out with 4 genes previously isolated in this zzso An analysis of the zzso start sites for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that each transcript was initiated at a zzso zzso Based on these sites, the zzso and zzso sequences for each transcript were deduced and zzso For all 4 zzso the zzso but not the zzso sequences were zzso to the zzso coli promoter consensus zzso
