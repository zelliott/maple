We have developed an zzso zzso method, which yields the internal zzso acid sequence of partially zzso zzso The overall yield for the method was greater than zzso The method yielded zzso zzso that could be zzso on zzso for all tested proteins with masses from 45 to zzso and yielded internal zzso acid sequence information when as little as 10 zzso of partially zzso protein was used as the starting zzso The zzso method was extremely reliable and gave sequence information for each of 25 proteins tested, including zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso that were difficult to sequence by other zzso
