zzso protein zzso is a new addition to the expanding zzso zzso gene family whose members contain at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other members of this family, zzso and zzso also share a common zzso domain structure, substantial primary sequence zzso and an ability to zzso bind zzso In this study, we further explored the hypothesis that zzso is a functional as well as structural zzso of zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso revealed that signal zzso zzso occurs within zzso 1, a significant structural difference from zzso in which zzso occurs at the zzso zzso zzso zzso competition zzso revealed both zzso and zzso to zzso bind zzso with the next closest zzso zzso member, zzso zzso being at least zzso less zzso zzso with their similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso both prevented zzso zzso or zzso zzso from zzso its zzso and inducing gene zzso in zzso However, zzso was at least zzso more potent than zzso in zzso gene zzso and zzso release zzso by zzso produced zzso zzso or zzso in multiple cell zzso Finally, zzso lacks the zzso sequence found in zzso and we found that it was also unable to bind cell surface zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that structural differences between zzso and zzso may zzso their different zzso capabilities with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together with our previous studies showing that zzso binding is essential for zzso biological activity, the differential activities of zzso and zzso further indicate that zzso binding is necessary but not sufficient to account for all of zzso zzso
