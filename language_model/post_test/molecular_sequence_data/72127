An zzso zzso that includes elements found in secondary structures at the zzso and zzso ends of zzso virus 2 zzso DNA was zzso by zzso of three overlapping zzso The most stable secondary structure was calculated to be zzso with a 61 zzso duplex zzso terminating in a three-way junction with 9 zzso zzso The zzso mobility of the zzso is slower than expected for normal duplex DNA of the same size, suggesting a bent or zzso zzso CD zzso indicate that the zzso structure is largely B form DNA, although there is a slight blue shift compared to the zzso of the isolated stem and loop zzso zzso melting experiments indicate that the hairpin is significantly more stable than the isolated stem and loop zzso zzso value decomposition of zzso zzso obtained as a function of temperature indicates that four species contribute to changes in the zzso upon zzso indicating that the melting is not a simple two-state zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by differential scanning zzso permits zzso of the zzso of melting by a zzso analysis, yielding zzso zzso zzso zzso This value agrees with the zzso zzso for the most stable secondary zzso
