The zzso gene cluster containing nine genes zzso was identified by sequencing of an zzso DNA region from zzso zzso To investigate the function of the zzso gene product, we isolated a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by introducing an zzso deletion into the zzso The zzso zzso could not grow zzso but retained half the level of zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso of the oxygen consumption test and Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene product is a zzso zzso but not involved in the zzso maturation zzso
