We investigated the interaction between zzso and the zzso membrane using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso accessibility of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protruding loop between zzso 6 and zzso 7 is protected from zzso zzso in the zzso This zzso loop contains an zzso zzso at position zzso To investigate the role of zzso this zzso was replaced by an zzso acid, and zzso was fused to green fluorescent protein zzso zzso could zzso in an zzso and in an zzso background at both the zzso and the zzso temperature, and it had a reduced affinity for the zzso membrane compared with zzso zzso zzso could also zzso in an zzso depletion zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso was not able to complement the zzso zzso or the depletion strain and induced zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso is able to zzso but that these zzso cannot form zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso This is the first description of an zzso zzso that has reduced affinity for the zzso membrane and does not support cell division, but is still able to zzso The zzso is able to form zzso in zzso but fails to zzso It suggests that neither membrane interaction nor bundling is a requirement for initiation of cell zzso
