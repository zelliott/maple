In zzso the genes responsible for specifying segment identity (the zzso zzso are transcribed in complex patterns during zzso zzso that mimic loss of zzso gene activity identify zzso DNA sequences and zzso proteins required for zzso zzso Some of the zzso proteins may facilitate interactions between zzso elements and the promoter by bringing together distant zzso zzso
