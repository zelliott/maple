The zzso zzso zzso has a functional zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso that zzso in the salvage of zzso which are essential for zzso zzso zzso displays zzso activity with zzso and zzso provides a zzso bypass for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and therefore compromises the use of zzso for treatment of zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso have been characterized and the crystal structure of the zzso complex with zzso zzso and the inhibitor determined at zzso A zzso This zzso shares 50% zzso acid sequence identity with zzso major zzso zzso and comparisons show that the architecture of the zzso binding site, and the zzso zzso are highly zzso as are most interactions with the zzso However, specific zzso acid differences, in particular the placement of zzso at the side of the active site, and adjustment of the zzso loop and zzso zzso at one side of the zzso zzso significantly reduce the size of the zzso binding site of zzso and alter the chemical properties compared with zzso A zzso zzso within the active site zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso group and zzso of a partner zzso forms a zzso similar to the zzso component of zzso zzso zzso therefore offers novel structural features to exploit in the search for zzso of therapeutic value against African zzso
