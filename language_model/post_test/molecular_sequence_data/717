During zzso zzso limb zzso local injury produces zzso changes that lead to cellular zzso and formation of a zzso but few details of these changes have been zzso Here we report the first global zzso analysis of zzso zzso comparing the profiles of abundant proteins in zzso limbs of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso and 3 days zzso when the zzso zzso is developing zzso We identified and zzso zzso zzso of which zzso were identified with high zzso ID zzso Of these zzso zzso 489 showed significant changes in quantity between the two zzso Taking into account identical peptides whose fold changes were within zzso and not including peptides whose fold changes were below the observed fold changes of peptides for the internal standard zzso zzso we were able to identify 145 peptides elevated in zzso relative to zzso and 220 peptides in zzso relative to zzso In this report, we focus on those proteins that were elevated in the zzso tissue relative to zzso In this class were members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso partner zzso which have important zzso roles in other systems and were also shown to be zzso expressed in stage 53 and 57 zzso and zzso zzso in our previous zzso zzso Besides zzso the possible zzso of inflammation during zzso limb zzso our zzso study also provides insight into zzso by revealing zzso of proteins known to characterize many stem zzso
