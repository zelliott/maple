A zzso zzso of the Arc zzso zzso was constructed by zzso the sequence positions of a zzso core zzso zzso 12, and an adjacent surface polar zzso zzso 11, in each strand of an zzso beta zzso The zzso protein adopts a fold in which each beta strand is replaced by a right-handed zzso and side chains in this region undergo significant zzso The observed structural changes allow the protein to maintain zzso exposure of polar side chains and optimal burial of zzso side zzso These results suggest that new protein folds can evolve from existing folds without drastic or large-scale zzso
