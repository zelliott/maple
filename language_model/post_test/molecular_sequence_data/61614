zzso deletions and point zzso in the zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso led us to identify zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as the motifs responsible for the role of this region in zzso by zzso These zzso acids are the only zzso of the zzso that are zzso in all zzso zzso and were found to have a similar function in the zzso zzso Both zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso were also observed to be critical for zzso by zzso which is synergistic with that by zzso zzso studies utilizing zzso of intrinsic protein zzso indicated that the zzso part of the zzso zzso in the signal zzso route from the zzso zzso site to the zzso site, but does not contribute to the binding of this zzso whereas it is essential for the binding of zzso zzso of the identified structural motifs did not alter either the action of other zzso zzso that also interact with zzso such as the inhibitor zzso and the strong zzso zzso zzso or the zzso effect of zzso zzso The latter data provide evidence that zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not linked to the same zzso transition as that zzso zzso by zzso
