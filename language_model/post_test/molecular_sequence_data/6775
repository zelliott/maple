zzso DNA clones zzso plasma zzso (also called zzso or zzso zzso were isolated from Syrian zzso liver zzso library and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of putative zzso site zzso was zzso characteristic of zzso of zzso type zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A molecular zzso tree of all known zzso proteins was constructed based on the synonymous substitution zzso The result shows that the zzso has zzso off first before the divergence among mice, rats, and zzso and that the rabbit is the closest relative of the guinea pig which is separated from the zzso Although this tree differs largely from the classical zzso based on the zzso zzso and zzso belong to the same family, zzso and the guinea pig belongs to the order zzso it lends support to recent concepts that the zzso and guinea pig zzso in a number of zzso features, not only from each other but also from mice and rats, and that the guinea pig may belong to an order distinct from zzso
