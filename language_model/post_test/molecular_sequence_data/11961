Male germ cells contain a number of zzso zzso most of which are zzso during either the zzso or the zzso stages of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified in mouse round zzso that has an additional 12 zzso acids at its zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso Until now, the presence of this protein in other zzso has not been zzso Northern zzso analysis using an zzso probe complementary to a unique coding region of the zzso of mouse zzso showed that zzso zzso this protein was present in isolated rat round zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of basic nuclear proteins from round zzso zzso with an zzso zzso that recognizes the novel zzso sequence indicated that the protein was present in round zzso but not in zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso PAGE and migrated slightly more slowly than zzso by zzso zzso When zzso zzso were zzso zzso and basic nuclear proteins were zzso zzso was detected in zzso sections of stages zzso It reached a maximum level in stages zzso and then decreased to minimal levels in stages zzso Since zzso was not detected in zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso corresponded to the respective steps of zzso present in the zzso While zzso constituted a relatively small amount zzso zzso of total zzso protein in round zzso its presence in both the mouse and the rat suggests that its function may be zzso in zzso zzso zzso
