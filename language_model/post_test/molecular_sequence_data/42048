zzso amplification is an increasingly popular approach to the identification of transcribed sequences and will complement other strategies to isolate zzso We have used this system to amplify candidate zzso from 32 zzso including 8 zzso which span a well characterized zzso region of the human major zzso class II region on zzso zzso zzso We have examined the efficiency, zzso and zzso of the system in zzso zzso from genes known to be present on particular zzso and have determined the nature and frequency of zzso zzso in routine zzso zzso We were able to clone at least one zzso from zzso zzso of all known genes tested (including zzso which are zzso zzso and obtained zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Such zzso generally arise from the amplification of zzso sequences flanked by regions with high zzso to zzso and donor zzso zzso We show that the zzso amplification procedure can be used successfully with a wide variety of zzso which have different numbers of genes and gene structures and describe several approaches to the characterization of novel zzso cloned in this zzso
