zzso injury is frequently complicated by bacterial zzso Following burn injury, exposure to zzso produces a measurable decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an acute phase protein that zzso the recognition of zzso zzso by binding to the zzso A zzso of zzso In this study, we sought to determine the effect of zzso rat zzso zzso on zzso zzso function after burn or sham injury in the presence or absence of bacterial zzso 

zzso underwent a zzso zzso total body surface area zzso or sham zzso At 24 h zzso zzso were isolated, zzso at 50,000 zzso and incubated with 50 zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso an irrelevant control protein produced using the same expression system as zzso at zzso by volume of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were incubated with zzso rat serum or zzso zzso and blocking experiments were conducted using an zzso synthetic zzso zzso In zzso zzso function was measured using a variable rate video camera system with length detection zzso 

zzso of burn and sham injury derived zzso with high-dose zzso in the presence of zzso resulted in a significant reduction to the functional impairment observed in peak zzso zzso following exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 20 zzso in the presence of zzso abolished the ability of zzso zzso and zzso rat serum to restore peak zzso zzso of zzso isolated following burn injury to levels of function exhibited in the absence of zzso zzso 

In the setting of zzso challenge following burn injury, zzso at high zzso restores zzso zzso zzso function in zzso Rather than zzso the recognition of zzso by the cellular zzso zzso complex, zzso at high zzso likely results in an zzso binding effect that zzso the impact of zzso exposure on zzso function following zzso zzso
