zzso virus zzso is a member of the zzso zzso in the family zzso isolated in Japan from mosquitoes in zzso We determined the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso from the original stock virus which formed a mixture of plaques with different sizes, and that from a full-length zzso zzso zzso infectious zzso transcripts from which formed uniform large plaques on zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso in length exclusive of the 3' zzso zzso Between the complete zzso sequences of the full-length zzso zzso zzso and the consensus sequence from the original stock virus, there were nine zzso acid zzso two each in zzso zzso and zzso and three in zzso some of which may be responsible for plaque zzso zzso in the original virus zzso zzso was most closely related to Ross River virus among other zzso fully zzso with zzso acid sequence identities of zzso in the zzso proteins and of zzso in the structural zzso The 3' terminal 280 zzso region of zzso was zzso identical to that of zzso Forest virus, which was otherwise not closely related to zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso with partial zzso sequences of zzso virus zzso which was originally isolated in Malaysia in 1955 and is closely related to zzso in zzso and in biology, showed near identity between the two zzso suggesting that zzso is a strain of zzso
