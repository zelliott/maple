zzso switches of the zzso family, in concert with their associated regulators and zzso are well known as important control elements of vital signaling pathways in zzso zzso Yet, this knowledge has so far been established mainly from animal and zzso zzso However, during the recent years, the zzso switch has gone increasingly green as well, and it turned out that the zzso system in plants holds some distinctive features regarding structures, functions and molecular mechanisms for signal zzso In this review, we give an overview about the structural characteristics of the zzso proteins of plants, termed zzso highlighting some exciting differences to their animal and zzso zzso We further address the unique regulators and zzso of the zzso and discuss the structural basis for the function and interaction of those proteins in zzso controlled reaction zzso We finally intend to stimulate the demand for future three-dimensional structures that advance our understanding of the zzso switch in zzso
