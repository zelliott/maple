The class II major zzso complex zzso zzso is strongly linked to the development of spontaneous zzso diabetes zzso zzso in non obese diabetic mice and to the induction of experimental allergic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso it resembles the zzso molecules associated with human zzso in having a zzso zzso at position 57 in its beta zzso To identify the requirements for zzso binding to zzso and thereby potentially zzso T cell zzso we analyzed a known zzso T cell zzso zzso egg white zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that the minimal zzso for zzso of the T cell zzso zzso was zzso and the minimum sequence for direct binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning revealed two primary anchors for binding at relative positions zzso 6 zzso and 9 zzso in the zzso zzso The critical role of both anchors was demonstrated by incorporating L and Y in zzso zzso at the same relative positions as in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified by analyzing the binding of peptides containing multiple zzso at individual zzso zzso zzso was a large, zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso whereas zzso was aromatic and zzso zzso or zzso or positively charged zzso zzso zzso zzso were not tolerated at these and some other zzso A motif for binding to zzso deduced from analysis of the model zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso of peptides reported to be zzso T cell zzso or zzso from zzso zzso a set of overlapping peptides encompassing human zzso revealed the motif in zzso good zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso weak or zzso zzso zzso zzso This motif should facilitate identification of zzso zzso relevant to the zzso and zzso of zzso
