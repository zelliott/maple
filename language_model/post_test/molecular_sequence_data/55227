zzso proteins zzso are found in various species and have multiple zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso from zzso seminal zzso cloned the zzso zzso and functionally characterized this zzso The molecular mass of the zzso protein was calculated to be 25 zzso by zzso gel zzso under reducing zzso The full-length zzso of zzso contains zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a protein 222 zzso in zzso zzso contains a putative zzso domain between zzso 79 and zzso however, this domain did not show zzso binding zzso The overall zzso acid sequence identity of zzso from zzso human, zzso bovine and canine ranges between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis showed that zzso is zzso from zzso cells in the zzso to the seminal zzso To explore the role of zzso in the seminal zzso we tested the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso suspended in zzso saline began to swim after the addition of zzso zzso but not when zzso serum zzso was added, indicating that zzso promotes zzso zzso
