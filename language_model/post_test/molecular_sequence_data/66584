zzso cause two diseases with prominent vascular zzso zzso zzso fever with zzso syndrome and zzso pulmonary zzso All zzso zzso human zzso cells, although it is unclear what zzso zzso from zzso zzso We observed dramatic differences in zzso zzso responses between zzso and zzso zzso at 1 day zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may in part be determined by viral regulation of cellular zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso Prospect Hill virus zzso elicits early zzso responses following infection of human zzso zzso We determined that zzso replication is blocked in human zzso cells and that zzso and protein synthesis by zzso but not zzso or zzso is inhibited at 2 to 4 days zzso The addition of zzso to beta zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso induction by zzso and demonstrated that zzso infection zzso the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the induction of zzso zzso transcripts by zzso and further suggested the potential for zzso to regulate early zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tail inhibited by zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso from zzso response elements or zzso promoters in a zzso zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso tail had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso Further, neither the zzso nor zzso zzso tails inhibited zzso responses directed by a zzso active form of zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso zzso and zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso protein regulates cellular zzso responses upstream of zzso zzso at the level of the zzso zzso These findings further suggest that the zzso zzso tail contains a zzso element which determines the ability of zzso to bypass innate cellular immune responses and zzso a mechanism for zzso zzso to successfully replicate within human zzso zzso
