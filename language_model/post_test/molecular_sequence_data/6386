Culture conditions that lead to swelling and zzso dramatically influence cell surface characteristics and properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso adherence to polystyrene and zzso markedly increased during zzso in a zzso zzso zzso appeared to be sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso of cell wall zzso by zzso or sodium zzso suppressed zzso of zzso zzso K zzso decreased it whereas zzso strongly dispersed the zzso These observations suggest that both cell surface carbohydrates and proteins are involved in the zzso zzso zzso microscopic observations demonstrated that the cell wall of zzso was subject to some zzso during zzso involving degradation and loss of the external convoluted layer, and subsequent exposure of underlying zzso This was confirmed using zzso zzso with gold or zzso zzso which showed that some zzso particularly those acting as zzso for peanut zzso are largely exposed during the zzso Finally, zzso revealed major protein changes between resting and swollen zzso We conclude that the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso with an increase in adherence and zzso reorganization of the cell zzso
