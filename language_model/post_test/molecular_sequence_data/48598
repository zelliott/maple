Over the past three decades, zzso has become recognized as an important zzso for zzso It is involved in a number of key zzso including energy zzso resistance to zzso and nutritional stress and zzso In addition, this zzso acid supports critical zzso life cycle processes by acting as an energy source, thus enabling zzso invasion by the zzso and subsequent zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso is oxidized to zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso zzso zzso When expressed in its active form in zzso coli, zzso exhibits a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso state zzso zzso zzso and protein expression are strongly zzso in the zzso zzso a stage which requires an external supply of zzso In addition, when zzso zzso zzso zzso for this gene zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso diminished free zzso zzso levels and an enhanced sensitivity to zzso stress in comparison to the zzso zzso were observed, supporting the hypothesis that free zzso zzso constitutes a defense against zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso increases zzso c zzso activity in zzso zzso Overall, these results demonstrate that zzso is involved in zzso zzso during periods of zzso imbalance and also shed light on the participation of zzso in energy zzso which drives critical processes of the zzso zzso life zzso
