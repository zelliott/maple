Numerous zzso genes zzso factors with a zzso zzso occur in zzso Genes of this class in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be zzso expressed in developing floral zzso and in zzso they are required for floral zzso zzso symmetrical zzso These genes are therefore particularly interesting in zzso a family that is thought to have evolved zzso independently from other zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we show that zzso of zzso occur in zzso and may be divided into two main classes zzso group I and zzso apparently the result of an early duplication, and each class is characterized by a typical zzso acid signature in the zzso zzso Furthermore, group I genes in zzso may be divided into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso apparently the result of a zzso near the base of the zzso zzso or zzso Most zzso zzso investigated have all three genes present zzso zzso zzso and zzso inviting further work to investigate possible functional difference between the three zzso However, within these three major gene groups, the precise relationships of the zzso between species are difficult to determine probably because of a complex history of zzso and loss with lineage sorting or zzso zzso rate zzso due to functional zzso The results illustrate both the potential and the difficulties of zzso determination in variable gene families, on which the zzso approach to zzso hypotheses of function zzso
