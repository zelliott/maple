zzso derived from the previously published rat zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso sequence (Van Patten, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso and Walsh, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 88, zzso were used to isolate a DNA zzso coding for a mouse zzso of the rat zzso zzso This DNA zzso was then used to screen a mouse brain zzso library, and two zzso clones related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and comparison showed that the two zzso differ only in the presence of a zzso pair zzso which results in an zzso extension of the predicted zzso beta 2 protein by 20 zzso relative to the zzso beta 1 zzso By using the appropriate zzso zzso was used to amplify specific regions of both of these clones from mouse brain zzso When both clones were expressed in zzso the zzso for zzso beta 2 produced a protein product that was larger and much more effectively zzso suggesting a functional role for the inserted zzso Both zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells to evaluate their ability to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso from cells expressing the zzso beta 2 zzso showed greater zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity than extracts expressing the zzso beta 1 zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from various mouse zzso showed the presence of transcripts of zzso zzso related to these zzso Analysis of brain zzso from several species indicated that expression of these zzso zzso is zzso zzso Together with previous studies, these results indicate the presence of at least three zzso proteins in zzso The skeletal muscle zzso has been designated zzso zzso while the zzso zzso is zzso zzso We propose to designate the two zzso zzso described here zzso beta 1 and zzso beta zzso
