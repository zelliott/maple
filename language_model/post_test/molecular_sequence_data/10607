We have cloned zzso for the shaker zzso channel gene from the zzso lobster zzso zzso As previously found in zzso there is alternative zzso at the zzso and 3' ends of the coding zzso However, in zzso zzso alternative zzso also occurs within the zzso region of the zzso Three different zzso zzso were found within the P region, two of which bestow unique zzso characteristics to channel zzso zzso I and pore II zzso differ in zzso dependence for zzso zzso of zzso current zzso and drug zzso The pore 0 zzso lacks a P region zzso and does not produce a functional zzso This is the first example of alternative zzso within the zzso region of a zzso zzso zzso We used a recently identified zzso channel blocker, zzso zzso to study the zzso role of the two pore zzso The toxin selectively blocked one pore form, whereas the other form, zzso between the two pore forms, and zzso zzso were not zzso When it was tested in the zzso zzso zzso the toxin produced no effects on transient zzso currents or synaptic transmission between zzso
