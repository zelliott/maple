zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso electron transport chain by zzso zzso to zzso and transferring the electrons to zzso In zzso it is composed of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and a membrane domain, zzso two smaller zzso zzso zzso and zzso which anchor the zzso to the zzso inner zzso To investigate the role of the zzso anchor zzso in zzso assembly and zzso we isolated and characterized seven zzso in the zzso zzso Two zzso are premature zzso of zzso with losses of one or three zzso zzso The remaining five are zzso zzso that are clustered between zzso acids 103 and zzso which are proposed to be located in zzso segment II or the zzso loop connecting segments II and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly but specifically impair zzso zzso activities but have only minor effects on zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso strongly suggests that a zzso site is associated with this region of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by a zzso inhibitor supports the hypothesis that two distinct zzso sites are present in the zzso zzso
