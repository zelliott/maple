The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli is very similar to the human zzso transport zzso zzso and both contain a highly zzso zzso zzso in predicted zzso 11 that is different in a zzso zzso member of this sugar transport family zzso The role of the zzso zzso (which is predicted to be in putative zzso zzso zzso in the zzso relationship of the zzso zzso zzso was therefore assessed by measuring the interaction of sugar zzso and the zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso protein binds zzso B with a zzso zzso higher than the wild zzso This low affinity binding was not detected with equilibrium binding or zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso protein binds zzso with a zzso similar to that of the wild type and is zzso by zzso The zzso protein displays an increased amount of zzso zzso zzso with the binding of zzso suggesting that the substitution of the zzso zzso has altered the environment of a zzso probably zzso in a zzso active region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso protein provided association and zzso rate zzso zzso and zzso describing the initial interaction of zzso B to the zzso binding site zzso that are decreased zzso and increased zzso compared with the wild zzso This yielded a zzso constant zzso for zzso B to the zzso binding site zzso higher than that of the wild zzso The binding of zzso gave values for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso lower, respectively, yielding a zzso value for zzso similar to that of the wild zzso The low overall affinity zzso zzso of the zzso protein for zzso B is due mainly to a disruption in binding to the zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso forms either a direct binding interaction with zzso B or is part of the immediate environment of the binding site and that zzso is in the immediate environment, but not part, of the zzso binding zzso The ability of the zzso protein to catalyze energized transport is only mildly impaired with zzso and zzso reduction in zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso In stark contrast, the overall zzso describing binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso and their subsequent zzso across the membrane is substantially increased zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso These data indicate that zzso is associated with both the zzso B and internal sugar binding zzso This conclusion is also supported by data showing that the sugar specificity of the zzso protein has been altered for zzso This work powerfully illustrates how comparisons of the aligned zzso acid sequences of zzso membrane proteins of unknown structure and characterization of their zzso can be used to map zzso and zzso binding zzso
