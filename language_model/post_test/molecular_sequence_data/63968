The characterization of the zzso gene and its zzso should have an important impact on the efforts to develop genetic markers to select for low zzso in zzso Raising intact male pigs would have a significant economic impact on the pork zzso however, the presence of zzso (a major cause of zzso zzso in meat from male pigs would be highly objectionable to zzso It has been shown that the phase II metabolism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is related to the clearance of zzso in the zzso The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the zzso gene from pig liver, examine its zzso identify genetic zzso and study how a genetic variation in this zzso translates into zzso variation in zzso zzso We show here that a substitution of zzso at base 546 of zzso causes a significant decrease in its zzso activity and thus may be at least partially responsible for a higher level of zzso in zzso Our findings provide an important basis toward the goal of making it possible to predict the zzso status in pigs and the development of genetic markers for low zzso
