zzso and assembly of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and its single zzso and double zzso zzso analog onto zzso zzso and zzso cells and bacteria, zzso coli and zzso zzso were studied as a model system to understand the plausible role of assembly on their contrasting zzso but similar zzso zzso zzso ability to zzso and damage the membrane organization of zzso and zzso cells decreased from zzso to zzso and to zzso which may be related to their decrease in assembly onto these zzso live cells and zzso states in the presence of these cell zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and its zzso showed appreciable similarities in damaging or zzso the zzso coli or zzso zzso cells, which further matched with their comparable assembly and zzso either onto these live cells or the cell zzso or in the presence of zzso charged zzso zzso zzso
