The genetic diversity of zzso strains was studied by using 30 zzso obtained from zzso on zzso growing in zzso fields over a wide geographic zzso The following zzso approaches were zzso zzso zzso analysis, restriction zzso length zzso analysis of the amplified zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso sequence zzso The division of zzso strains into two major zzso groups zzso A and zzso that has been described previously was confirmed by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We identified a total of five zzso species, including the previously described species zzso zzso All of the group B strains except one were homogeneous and belonged to a single zzso species corresponding to zzso zzso Group A was heterogeneous, containing three zzso species and five strains that remained zzso and its members had very different zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequences of strains representing the two major groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso species 2 strain zzso exhibited 19 zzso Both of these strains belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso and strain zzso was clearly separated from zzso zzso and closely related to zzso zzso Thus, zzso species 2 could be distinguished from zzso zzso by its zzso zzso zzso by DNA zzso data, by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and by previously described zzso zzso zzso results and zzso zzso zzso we propose that strains belonging to zzso species 2 should be classified in a new species, zzso zzso and that strain zzso should be the type zzso
