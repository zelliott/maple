This paper describes a facile synthesis of zzso zzso clusters and their application as a new type of templates for zzso zzso zzso zzso introduction of multiple zzso zzso onto a zzso core was achieved through the reaction of zzso zzso with zzso or with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The clustered zzso placed on the zzso core allow rapid and highly zzso zzso with multiple copies of zzso peptides under virtually neutral conditions at room zzso This mild and highly efficient zzso method is extremely valuable for zzso large and complex zzso peptides that may not be easily obtained by conventional zzso zzso The usefulness of the zzso clusters as a new type of templates for zzso zzso synthesis was exemplified by the synthesis of two zzso zzso peptides incorporating the sequence of the potent zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso peptides are useful as novel zzso to raise specific zzso for zzso zzso They are also useful zzso for studying zzso membrane fusion zzso
