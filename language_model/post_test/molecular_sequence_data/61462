A modified zzso and a zzso zzso version of the zzso zzso primer zzso allowed strains that were previously zzso because of point zzso accumulating at the primer binding site, to be G typed by reverse zzso chain zzso The strains were collected during zzso in Italy in hospitals of the zzso region, from children affected by severe zzso zzso Using a wide selection of zzso zzso detected worldwide, sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison, and zzso analysis showed that the Italian strains have strong genetic similarity zzso or zzso to zzso zzso identified recently in many parts of the world and different from the old zzso strains identified during the 1980s (less than zzso zzso variation of zzso zzso explains the constraints encountered in the typing zzso and presumably accounts, together with genetic zzso events, for the emergence on a global scale of the zzso zzso
