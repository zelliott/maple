zzso one-third of the world's population carries zzso zzso The recent emergence of extreme drug resistant strains that are resistant to the zzso of last zzso zzso has caused a further increase in the pressing need to discover new drugs against this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a validated target for drug zzso To drive the development of potent and selective zzso zzso we have studied the mechanism of the zzso and analyzed the interaction of zzso with zzso and two related zzso zzso zzso zzso from kinetic zzso reveal that zzso is zzso and prefers zzso carrier protein zzso carrying fatty acids with long zzso zzso On the basis of product zzso studies, we propose that the reaction proceeds via an ordered sequential zzso complex, with the zzso zzso binding first, followed by zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso has been further explored by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be involved in determining the specificity of the zzso for zzso compared to zzso Finally, in preliminary zzso studies, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are all zzso zzso zzso of zzso These compounds inhibit the growth of zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso Upon selection for resistance, three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso containing these zzso had zzso values approximately zzso larger than that of the zzso strain, whereas the zzso zzso zzso had K i values zzso larger than that of zzso zzso The increase in both zzso and K i values caused by the zzso supports the proposal that zzso is the zzso target for the zzso zzso zzso
