zzso zzso zzso employs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for transport of many cellular zzso Previous work showed that zzso zzso contain zzso that prematurely zzso resulting in defective transport of FB components into developing zzso zzso zzso zzso are smaller than wild type and contain defective zzso zzso In this article, we show that zzso encodes a zzso integral membrane protein that has a zzso zzso zzso The zzso motif is found in a large, diverse family of proteins that have been implicated in zzso transfer during protein zzso Seven zzso zzso were zzso including zzso nonsense, and deletion zzso An zzso to zzso showed significant zzso with a known marker for the zzso during zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso deletion zzso lacked zzso zzso zzso this zzso lacks a zzso promoter and most coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso which changes a zzso zzso within the zzso domain in all zzso behaves as a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is required for the zzso to properly deliver the FB to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain is essential for this zzso
