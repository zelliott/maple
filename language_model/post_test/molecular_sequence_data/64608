Over 1,500 human disease genes have been identified, of which only a small fraction have experimental structural information on the protein zzso To better understand the mechanisms of these zzso diseases, we undertook a systematic study to predict the structures of disease proteins and characterize their interactions with other zzso This study was facilitated by two tools developed zzso zzso a zzso method that exploits the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso a method that predicts the zzso involved in zzso zzso In this initial study of human disease zzso we were able to build structural models for 60 proteins involved in human zzso For a number of zzso new structural zzso were zzso In the case of zzso a protein responsible for zzso the disease zzso zzso was positioned at the zzso zzso This positioning is consistent with experimental observation that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggests that that the disease mechanism of this zzso lies in the impaired zzso zzso This initial study illustrates the value of the predicted structure models and may serve as an example for expanded studies of other disease zzso
