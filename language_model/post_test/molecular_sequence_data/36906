zzso of adult rat brain regions by specific zzso revealed a widespread distribution of transforming growth zzso zzso but not zzso growth factor zzso the zzso that had previously been reported to be present in zzso zzso zzso zzso samples from the different regions of rat brain were analyzed by Northern zzso to identify zzso species zzso precursor proteins for zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is the most abundant zzso for the zzso zzso in most parts of the brain zzso zzso for zzso was only zzso after prolonged zzso exposure; levels of zzso zzso were between two and three orders of magnitude lower in brain than those expressed in control tissue zzso and one to two orders of magnitude lower than zzso zzso levels in all brain zzso These results were confirmed by analysis of zzso by zzso and support the hypothesis that expression of zzso zzso in the brain is limited to smaller discrete areas, whereas zzso gene expression is almost zzso
