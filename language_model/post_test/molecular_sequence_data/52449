zzso component zzso is a zzso protein known to interact specifically with more than 10 different plasma proteins or cell surface zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso factor, a structural analogue of zzso that shares some properties with zzso zzso formation of a zzso zzso but differs in others zzso zzso to regulation by factors H and zzso The zzso of structural differences between zzso and zzso zzso factor can be expected to help identify functionally important regions of zzso zzso To that end we have undertaken the molecular cloning of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor to take advantage of the unique zzso system where both proteins are produced by the same zzso We report the primary structure of zzso zzso zzso and the derived protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso It contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a single zzso zzso consisting of a zzso acid signal zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which is separated from the zzso by four zzso zzso There are no zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits approximately zzso zzso sequence identity with zzso from zzso zzso At the protein level, sequence identity is approximately zzso and sequence similarity approximately zzso All 27 zzso zzso are highly zzso as are the zzso zzso zzso site, the zzso site, and the factor B binding zzso zzso zzso also seems to have zzso binding sites for factor H and zzso as well as a zzso sequence in the functionally important region of the zzso zzso The sequence zzso at the zzso and zzso binding sites does not exceed the overall sequence zzso zzso the existence of zzso and zzso binding sites can neither be deduced nor zzso
