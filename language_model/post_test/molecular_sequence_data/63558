zzso virus zzso has been historically performed by adaptation to cell zzso The current dogma is that attenuated virus strains induce more type I zzso and are more resistant to zzso protection than wild type zzso 

The adaptation of a zzso virus isolate zzso by 13 passages in zzso cells induced a strong zzso of this strain in zzso The adapted virus zzso differs from its parental strain by only 5 zzso acids (4 in zzso and 1 in the M zzso While a vaccine strain, zzso Zagreb, could replicate equally well in various zzso cells, both zzso strains exhibited restriction to the specific cell type used initially for their zzso Surprisingly, we observed that both zzso strains induced type I zzso the zzso strain inducing even more than the attenuated ones, particularly in human zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso protection from the infection of both zzso strains depended on the cell type zzso being less efficient in the cells used to grow the viral zzso 

Thus, zzso in M and zzso proteins can critically affect zzso zzso cellular zzso and lead to virus zzso without interfering with the zzso zzso zzso
