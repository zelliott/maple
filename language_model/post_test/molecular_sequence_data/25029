The gene zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified, zzso and functionally expressed in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed similarity zzso to members of zzso sugar zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of 115 zzso composed of zzso zzso Rate dependence (at 85 degrees zzso on both zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed zzso zzso with apparent zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso apparent zzso values were about 5 zzso The zzso was specific for zzso as zzso zzso but showed a broader spectrum of zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso activity required zzso zzso zzso which was most effective, could partially be replaced by zzso zzso or zzso The zzso had a temperature optimum of 90 degrees C and showed a significant zzso up to 100 degrees zzso zzso activity was not zzso regulated by classical zzso of zzso of zzso and bacteria, such as zzso and zzso In zzso this zzso zzso did not contain the typical zzso binding sites for these zzso This is the first report of a sequence of an zzso zzso related to the zzso sugar zzso zzso
