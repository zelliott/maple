zzso are a gene family of membrane proteins with distinct expression zzso zzso I is an abundant protein of the synaptic zzso membrane and was implicated as the zzso sensor in fast responding zzso Yet, its precise role along the synaptic zzso life cycle is not fully zzso In this report we show that zzso I is not exclusively confined to zzso and neuroendocrine systems, rather, it is also expressed in the zzso system of the zzso zzso The gene for zzso I was isolated and zzso from rat zzso zzso The identity of zzso I protein was further confirmed by several independent zzso The protein is exclusively found in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso similarly to zzso another major integral membrane protein of synaptic zzso zzso I represents zzso of the total membrane protein mass of the zzso Using zzso zzso the two proteins were also localized primarily to the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso I which regulates zzso neurotransmitter release also plays a role which is common to all zzso zzso zzso and zzso A role for zzso I in zzso signals with protein zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso
