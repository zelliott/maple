zzso components of the membrane zzso are implicated in various cellular zzso zzso the diversity of these functions requires better characterization of the interacting zzso of zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of a kidney zzso library revealed that the zzso domain of alpha zzso binds specifically zzso A of zzso zzso zzso zzso The alpha zzso zzso domain does not interact with zzso B or C nor does zzso A interact with the alpha zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso A led us to look for a zzso zzso in alpha zzso Western zzso showed that alpha zzso is zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso on zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso site of alpha zzso near the zzso domain, as an in zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is also an in zzso target for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso decreases zzso sensitivity to zzso in zzso Similarly, the presence of zzso zzso in cell culture is associated with the absence of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso state could zzso zzso zzso by zzso and may play an important role during membrane skeleton zzso
