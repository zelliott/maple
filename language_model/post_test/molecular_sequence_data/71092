The zzso and activity of zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso status of one or more of its 16 potential zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether the zzso status of one or more of these sites contributes to the determination of the various zzso and activity of zzso Moreover, whether and how the zzso of zzso may regulate the zzso of the zzso sites is also zzso In the process of analyzing the function and regulation of zzso we uncovered the existence of an unusual structural zzso zzso zzso acids zzso the zzso of which zzso upon zzso a zzso zzso zzso of this structural domain zzso rather than zzso the growth zzso function of zzso In order to understand the effect of the zzso of zzso on the zzso of zzso sites, we identified all the zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of which drastically modify the zzso of zzso zzso of each of these four sites alone or in combinations results in the different zzso of zzso the migration pattern of which, on zzso gel zzso resembles various in zzso zzso zzso Each of these zzso forms of zzso has enhanced growth suppressing activity relative to the wild zzso Our data revealed that the zzso structural motif controls the exposure of the zzso sites zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso has enhanced growth suppressing activity, similar to a zzso with zzso zzso at zzso Our recent finding, that the zzso region is part of a structural domain, zzso zzso zzso and functionally between zzso and zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso domain may play a role in the coordinated regulation of the activity of these two tumor zzso under certain growth zzso
