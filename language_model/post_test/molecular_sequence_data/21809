The 2009 pandemic zzso zzso of apparent zzso origin, may have evolved in pigs unnoticed because of insufficient zzso zzso the need for surveillance of influenza viruses circulating in pigs has received added zzso In this study we characterized zzso viruses isolated from Canadian pigs in zzso zzso from May 2009 were comprised of zzso and zzso zzso genes of classical zzso origin in combination with the North American zzso internal gene zzso zzso here termed contemporary zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso viruses were zzso with the North American zzso zzso which was distinct from the zzso zzso that were zzso more related to the zzso zzso After the initial isolation of zzso from an zzso pig farm in early May 2009, zzso was found several times in Canadian zzso These zzso zzso were genetically and zzso zzso In addition, zzso viruses bearing seasonal human zzso and zzso genes together with the zzso cassette and an zzso zzso an zzso marker were isolated from zzso The zzso gene of one of these seasonal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso implicating zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso was observed between zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso In zzso although there was zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in Canadian pigs after May 2009, there was no evidence supporting the presence of zzso in pigs prior to May zzso The possibility for further zzso being generated exists and should be closely zzso
