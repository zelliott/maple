To investigate the conservation of mechanisms for zzso patterning between zzso and zzso we isolated two zzso clones zzso bone zzso protein zzso proteins from a zzso zzso zzso Based on their predicted zzso acid zzso these two clones were designated as zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that in zzso zzso both genes were localized in the zzso part of the zzso consistent with the proposed function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was also seen in the embryonic zzso the most zzso zzso zzso To examine the ability of zzso to zzso zzso we injected synthetic zzso into zzso zzso and found that zzso of this gene eliminated zzso structures including zzso at both zzso and molecular zzso In contrast, expression of zzso marker gene zzso was expanded to the zzso zzso These effects are analogous to the zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso Taken together, one may conclude that the zzso mechanisms for zzso patterning regulated by zzso are zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
