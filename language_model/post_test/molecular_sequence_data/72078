We have used sodium zzso zzso cells as an in zzso model system to study the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso alkaline zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso using human zzso reporter genes along with zzso I zzso were used to zzso a critical zzso element zzso corresponding to the sequence zzso zzso of the zzso element resulted in a dramatic reduction in reporter gene activity, and zzso was shown to function in the context of a zzso zzso promoter in a cell zzso manner, further supporting its functional role in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso binds zzso and zzso but these factors comprise only a portion of the total nuclear binding and appear to mediate only a small portion of its zzso zzso zzso does not zzso to any previously characterized regulatory region from other zzso zzso We have thus identified a novel, zzso zzso element in the human zzso gene that appears to play a role in its zzso zzso during differentiation in zzso
