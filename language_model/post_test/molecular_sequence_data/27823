The T cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex which has a dual function of zzso recognition and signal zzso One of its zzso zzso the zzso chain, has been shown to have a significant role in the expression and function of the zzso on the cell zzso The mouse and human zzso zzso share significant zzso to each other but are distinct from all of the previously characterized zzso zzso We now report the isolation and structural analysis of the complete zzso zzso zzso This gene spans at least 31 zzso and divides into eight zzso The first zzso which is located at least 20 zzso upstream from the second zzso codes for the zzso region and most of the signal zzso The second zzso codes for the remainder of the signal zzso the zzso domain, the zzso domain, and the first three zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the majority of the zzso zzso The eight zzso encodes the zzso 21 zzso acids and the zzso zzso Four groups of zzso initiation sites have been identified at approximately 140 base pairs upstream to the zzso zzso No zzso box has been zzso The gene is localized to the zzso part of zzso 1 in a linkage group highly zzso between man and zzso
