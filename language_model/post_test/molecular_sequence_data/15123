Database searches can fail to detect all truly zzso zzso particularly when dealing with short, highly sequence diverse protein zzso Here, using zzso interacting and transport zzso zzso as an example, we have applied an approach of zzso matching followed by zzso zzso structure zzso to the detection of true zzso in the borderline significant zone of database zzso Novel zzso zzso were confidently identified in zzso containing an apparently inactive zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso protein containing a zzso zzso As a proof of principle, we have confirmed the novel zzso zzso for zzso by in zzso profiling of binding to zzso zzso
