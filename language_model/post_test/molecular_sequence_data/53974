A single zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated in zzso The zzso region was cloned and zzso Although the proteins have more than zzso identity to a previously described zzso region in zzso the zzso gene contains a zzso zzso that leads to a predicted truncated zzso Furthermore, sequence analysis of the zzso gene revealed the presence of an zzso element zzso which interrupted the zzso zzso This suggested the zzso expression of the zzso zzso which was zzso zzso gel zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was not related to zzso zzso band zzso Both strains contained multiple copies of the zzso zzso
