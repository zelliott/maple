We have previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso is represented among the zzso targets of human T cell responses induced by zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso serves as an zzso zzso recognized by zzso T cell zzso By using peripheral blood zzso cells and T cell lines from the same donor group, we have in this study shown that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recognized by memory T cells 8 years after zzso with zzso zzso The finding that zzso zzso zzso T cell lines responded to zzso zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso suggested the existence of additional T cell zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with this, testing of the T cell lines for zzso responses to the complete zzso zzso truncated zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and overlapping synthetic zzso made it possible to identify two zzso zzso regions defined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso T cell clones showed limited zzso by responding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the T cell lines specific to the zzso zzso and zzso were broadly zzso as demonstrated by their response to zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis complex, zzso zzso and other zzso zzso restriction analysis of the zzso T cell lines showed that the zzso zzso and zzso were presented by one of the two zzso molecules expressed from self zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso was recognized in the presence of zzso as well as zzso and zzso mismatched zzso zzso zzso The results obtained in this study made it possible to identify zzso T cell zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and provide an explanation for T cell recognition of this zzso in individuals infected with species of the zzso tuberculosis complex or environmental zzso
