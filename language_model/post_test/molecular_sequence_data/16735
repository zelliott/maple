By using a zzso zzso approach, a structural model of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was zzso A unique chemical library of approximately zzso compounds was zzso zzso to identify potential active site zzso The resulting biased subset of compounds was zzso for both toxicity and the ability to inhibit the growth of zzso in tissue culture zzso A family of zzso related compounds was found which exhibits selective activity against zzso zzso zzso with 50% zzso zzso of 3 to 12 zzso These compounds exhibited no significant zzso in the four cell lines tested and did not inhibit the growth of other organisms such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso cells were conducted in the presence of active compounds to verify that the correct zzso step zzso core protein zzso was being zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells indicated a block in zzso zzso viruses were generated and resistance was mapped to the zzso open reading zzso zzso expression with the zzso zzso gene rescued the ability of zzso virus to replicate in the presence of compound, indicating that this is the only gene necessary for zzso This novel class of zzso has potential for development as an efficient zzso drug against zzso zzso including zzso
