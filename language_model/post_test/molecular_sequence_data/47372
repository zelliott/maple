zzso is a zzso genetic element that normally is integrated site specifically into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso within zzso zzso replication of both zzso integrated and zzso zzso During mating with zzso zzso zzso can zzso delete part of zzso and form a family of autonomously replicating zzso zzso Earlier work has shown that zzso and zzso gene products act in concert to control zzso maintenance and regulate their own zzso Here we report that these zzso genes act also on a second promoter, zzso zzso opposite zzso located adjacent to, and initiating zzso divergent from, zzso to regulate zzso involved in the zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso and zzso two overlapping genes immediately 3' to zzso and directly regulated by zzso are shown by zzso zzso to control zzso growth zzso zzso zzso Additional genes resembling transfer genes of other zzso zzso plasmids and required for zzso transfer and/or zzso zzso spread are located more zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in an otherwise competent recipient strain prevented zzso gene transfer of zzso and zzso genes but not zzso zzso activity, suggesting that information zzso to recipients after the formation of mating pairs affects zzso zzso Taken together with earlier evidence that the zzso zzso regulates zzso DNA zzso the results reported here zzso zzso in the overall regulation of functions related to the zzso state of zzso
