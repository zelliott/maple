Although a novel zzso fatty zzso protein zzso was recently zzso the identity of a second fatty zzso protein detected with zzso to the heart zzso has not been clearly zzso The present investigation, using zzso laser zzso mass zzso showed that this protein was a form of zzso whose zzso zzso acid was neither zzso nor was it zzso Furthermore, zzso focusing revealed two major zzso a major band zzso zzso and a minor band zzso zzso in a distribution pattern opposite to that observed for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso mass maps of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso protein bands showed that the two zzso differed only in a single zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the heart zzso zzso This zzso had an zzso + zzso zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso consistent with a single zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso Whereas it is well established that both zzso and zzso interact with zzso fatty zzso we showed that they also significantly alter plasma membrane cholesterol dynamics in a manner opposite to that of another brain zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso In zzso the data demonstrated for the first time that the zzso from brain, while nearly identical to zzso from heart, differed significantly in zzso distribution and in zzso terminal structure from heart zzso This suggests that the brain and heart zzso may not necessarily function zzso in these zzso
