Three novel toxins belonging to the scorpion zzso zzso family were zzso to zzso from the zzso of the Chinese scorpion zzso zzso They have been identified according to their molecular mass zzso zzso and their zzso in mice and characterized as zzso acid zzso One of them shows zzso sequence identity with members of the zzso group (named zzso whereas the other two, named zzso and zzso show zzso identity with toxins of the zzso zzso Their chemical synthesis by the zzso methodology allowed us to show that zzso unlike zzso and zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso established that they are lethal zzso agents in mice zzso of zzso zzso per zzso Those toxins proved to be potent zzso of the zzso zzso channels, as they were able to compete with zzso for its binding to rat brain zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to block the cloned zzso zzso channel zzso from rat brain, expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also shown to compete with zzso for its binding to the zzso zzso zzso channels present on bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso These new sequences show zzso zzso when compared to the other related scorpion zzso channel toxins and should prove to be useful zzso for studying the diverse family of zzso zzso
