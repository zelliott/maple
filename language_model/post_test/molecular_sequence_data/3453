Ion mobility zzso and molecular dynamics simulations were performed for zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso + zzso adopts a zzso zzso (a zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso over the entire temperature range examined zzso zzso zzso + zzso on the other hand is designed to have a flat energy landscape with a marginally stable zzso zzso This zzso shows at least four different zzso at low temperatures zzso zzso The two zzso with the largest cross sections are attributed to - and partial zzso while the one with the smallest cross section is zzso The other main zzso may be partially zzso zzso + zzso becomes predominantly zzso at intermediate temperatures and then becomes more zzso as the temperature is raised zzso This unexpected behavior may be due to the zzso having a higher zzso zzso than the zzso state, as predicted by some recent calculations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000, 79, zzso
