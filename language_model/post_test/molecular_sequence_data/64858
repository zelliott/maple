zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso III, which is an immediate zzso precursor of zzso A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso by using zzso and screening a zzso zzso A study of its zzso zzso in zzso coli was carried zzso To get high-level expression of zzso zzso three kinds of zzso zzso fusion expression systems (with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used, and results of expression were zzso Fusion zzso with different tags was expressed with diverse expression levels and zzso in the three zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature, and inducing time for producing zzso zzso were zzso Under higher zzso concentration (up to 1 zzso the highest level of expression for fusion protein was obtained in the zzso His fusion system with zzso zzso promoter, but expressed products were only partially zzso With lower zzso concentration (less than zzso zzso the highest expression was detected in the zzso fusion system with zzso promoter, and the lowest level of expression appeared in the zzso fusion zzso The expression level in the latter system did not differ dramatically with a range of different zzso zzso zzso and zzso His fusion proteins were mainly soluble in zzso solutions and zzso zzso improved the zzso of zzso fusion proteins zzso this protein is zzso Fusion proteins could only be partially zzso by a single affinity zzso step for all three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have higher specificity than zzso zzso and zzso conditions were shown to affect zzso zzso Three kinds of zzso zzso with different tags showed zzso activity, but total zzso activity was lost as a result of the affinity zzso zzso zzso and Factor zzso could be used for zzso zzso of fusion zzso but the incubation temperature affected zzso activity of zzso zzso
