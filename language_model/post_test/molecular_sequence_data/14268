zzso migration during zzso repair depends on interactions between cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso This study investigates the molecular basis of the binding specificity of the zzso and zzso receptors expressed by human zzso We used zzso zzso to alter a zzso zzso protein by substituting the most critical basic zzso with zzso All proteins were expressed in zzso cells, zzso and characterized zzso We used in zzso binding zzso including surface zzso zzso to examine interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso We identify a major zzso binding domain on the outer edge of a zzso of zzso surrounded by a track of zzso low affinity zzso This domain harbors distinctive zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is the first study to demonstrate a binding specificity of two zzso produced by a single cell zzso In addition, we found that although zzso interacts exclusively through its zzso zzso zzso binding relies on both its core protein and its zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may trigger different signals toward zzso depending on its interaction with zzso or zzso
