The open reading frame zzso of the gene for the precursor of the zzso Red zzso zzso zzso zzso from the blue crab zzso zzso was cloned by zzso with zzso targeted to the initiation and the end of the translation coding zzso A 272 zzso zzso was characterized between zzso zzso and 344 of the reported zzso present in the region coding for the last zzso acids of the precursor related zzso of zzso The zzso zzso structure here described is similar to that reported for the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
