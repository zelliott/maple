The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade is inhibited by zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso Cloning studies of the zzso have shown that several potential zzso zzso sites are located in the third zzso loop of zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we identified zzso acid zzso that are involved in the zzso of the zzso Two zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were determined to be zzso zzso sites by in zzso zzso studies using a series of synthetic zzso Treatment with zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso with a rightward shift in the zzso value, which implies the zzso of the zzso from the G zzso zzso zzso studies showed that substitution of zzso for zzso but not for zzso markedly attenuated the effect of zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso was primarily involved in zzso zzso
