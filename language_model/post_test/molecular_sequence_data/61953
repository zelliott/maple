zzso zzso zzso catalyze the essential zzso zzso of carrier proteins zzso from fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso typically harbor one zzso specific for zzso of primary metabolism zzso zzso and at least one capable of zzso carrier proteins involved in secondary metabolism zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso we have used the zzso sequence of this zzso to zzso zzso and express (in zzso zzso three candidate zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso (a discrete zzso zzso and another that is integrated into a modular zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis of these zzso zzso with an zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso as zzso revealed that only zzso is active in zzso transfer with this zzso zzso was also shown to provide complete modification of zzso and of an entire zzso zzso from the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The efficiency of the zzso in zzso transfer in zzso coli makes it an attractive alternative to other zzso zzso for zzso experiments with zzso zzso
