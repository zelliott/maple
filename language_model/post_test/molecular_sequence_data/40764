In comparison to bottom-up zzso approaches, zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso are zzso zzso approaches, involving direct analysis of intact zzso provide higher specificity for protein identification and are zzso for the characterization of sequence zzso However, zzso protein characterization usually requires more sophisticated zzso and zzso to deal with the more complex tandem mass zzso derived from zzso of high mass multiply charged intact zzso zzso zzso reactions are universally zzso and have proved to be useful in mixture analysis and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso transfer reaction in the context of zzso has been demonstrated to expand zzso power in zzso protein zzso particularly with platforms that employ zzso zzso trap and zzso mass zzso In addition, probing protein primary structure using zzso electron transfer zzso usually provides extensive structurally zzso fragmentation and also allows for the zzso of zzso zzso Here, the performance of the widely used zzso platform, equipped with zzso reaction zzso for zzso protein characterization is zzso and various zzso employing zzso reactions are zzso
