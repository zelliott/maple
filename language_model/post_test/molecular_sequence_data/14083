zzso zzso zzso by zzso receptors that recognize corresponding zzso on microbial surfaces has attracted increasing interest as a potential host defense mechanism against zzso pathogens and as a means of survival in the host for zzso zzso Three types of zzso zzso involving zzso interactions (also termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions are zzso A prominent zzso on zzso cells involved in recognizing pathogens belongs to the zzso zzso It mediates both zzso and zzso zzso and exhibits multiple specificity for different microbial zzso In other cases, similar specificity toward a microbial zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is shared by dual zzso one of which zzso the zzso protein in zzso mediates zzso and the other zzso the zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of the zzso In addition, we discuss how zzso zzso can trigger the zzso to release inflammatory agents and cause tissue zzso Further studies of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in particular those underlying the zzso of the zzso receptors by various agents, should lead to the development of new approaches for the prevention of infectious zzso
