zzso of zzso cell cycle progression requires sequential zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex is a pivotal step in zzso initiation and the zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of cell cycle sequence during zzso transition and zzso zzso entry by zzso the zzso zzso 15 on the zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation is essential for the exit from the zzso zzso In zzso little is known about the genes that regulate zzso zzso complexes at the zzso transition of their cell zzso Although zzso zzso zzso are absent in the zzso of zzso zzso on protein zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso Here, we characterized a zzso protein zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso strain zzso for zzso inhibited cell division and caused cell zzso This demonstrates the lengthening of zzso which provided cells with extra time to grow before zzso The zzso protein zzso was expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso slender forms of zzso zzso and the role of zzso in cell cycle progression was analyzed by generating zzso interference cell zzso In the zzso form of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso expression by zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showing an increase in the percentage of cells with zzso zzso and zzso were observed in these zzso cell zzso Using zzso with a synchronized cell cycle, we demonstrated that zzso is linked to the zzso zzso We also showed that zzso is an essential gene necessary for proper cell cycle progression and zzso growth in zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for the existence of a functional zzso in zzso zzso with a potential role in cell division at zzso
