zzso is essential for zzso and for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso can promote zzso because only zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso signals emanating from immune receptors linked to zzso zzso These previous data suggest that zzso harbors a unique domain that functions in concert with the zzso site in zzso Here we identify such a domain, highly zzso domain in zzso zzso which is zzso for the early phase of zzso and zzso signaling but is essential for their zzso zzso including sustained zzso of zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso recruits an zzso zzso zzso which further associates with zzso in the late zzso zzso of the zzso signaling complex could account for the sustained zzso of zzso and zzso The present study identifies zzso as a unique domain that plays a critical role in the long-term linkage between zzso and zzso signals, providing a molecular basis for therapeutic zzso
