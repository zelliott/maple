zzso DNA technology makes it possible to genetically fuse V genes or zzso to toxin zzso resulting in zzso for selective destruction of tumor zzso Since zzso zzso can be easily manipulated in terms of affinity or zzso potency and produced in large zzso we have developed a new zzso zzso fusion toxin zzso Human zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso expression zzso and thereby fused to a modified zzso zzso zzso A zzso lacking its zzso domain zzso After zzso expression in zzso coli strain zzso the 60 zzso zzso fusion protein zzso was isolated from inclusion zzso zzso protein was zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso and concentrated by zzso zzso on a zzso Q zzso The binding properties of zzso were evaluated by competitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis on zzso zzso The in zzso toxicity of the fusion protein was then tested on the zzso zzso cell line zzso and the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso exhibited specific zzso against zzso cells zzso zzso 24 zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso This is the first report on the specificity and zzso potency of a zzso zzso fusion toxin against Hodgkin's zzso zzso
