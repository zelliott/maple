zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a constituent of the zzso cycle responsible for zzso zzso We report the isolation and characterization of zzso clones that zzso the gene for rat zzso zzso zzso The gene spans at least 24 zzso and contains ten zzso and nine zzso The zzso zzso region of the gene has also been cloned and zzso zzso 1 contains the untranslated sequence of the transcript, extending downstream to zzso the coding region for the putative zzso signal (35 zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the zzso start point permits zzso of a reporter gene in zzso zzso cells but not in an zzso cell line, confirming the function of the zzso A truncated construct of 142 zzso is still able to promote zzso in zzso cells, suggesting the presence of zzso zzso elements in the zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso region contains typical promoter zzso including a zzso box and several putative recognition sequences for zzso factors involved in controlling both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the presence in the zzso zzso promoter of zzso responsible for the zzso regulation of transcription, is supported by transient zzso zzso
