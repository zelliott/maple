Four novel zzso peptides were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso system monitoring the zzso contraction of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso As these peptides are structurally related to zzso zzso zzso zzso we termed these peptides zzso zzso peptides 1, 2, 3, and 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso The primary sequences of these peptides were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso regions of these zzso possessed zzso at the zzso level to various zzso while the zzso zzso differed from zzso zzso All of the zzso consist of 28 zzso zzso with zzso forms at the zzso whereas zzso possess 30 zzso zzso and have free forms at the zzso zzso exert zzso activities on isolated quail zzso in a zzso manner, with threshold zzso between 1 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited potent zzso activities acting on the zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso As yet, this is the first isolation of biologically active zzso peptides from zzso
