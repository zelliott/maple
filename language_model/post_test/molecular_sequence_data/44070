The extensively zzso zzso membrane proteins zzso zzso and c are derived from a single gene by alternative zzso that produces proteins with differences in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso targeting signals reside in the zzso domain of these zzso zzso are not restricted to zzso but can also be found in zzso and at the cell zzso We investigated the zzso distribution of zzso comprised of the zzso domain of avian zzso and the alternatively spliced zzso of avian zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain showed predominantly zzso distribution, while higher levels of zzso with the zzso or b zzso domain were present at the cell zzso The increase in cell surface expression was due to differences in the recognition of the targeting signals and not zzso of zzso trafficking zzso zzso zzso defined the zzso zzso of the zzso tail as critical in governing the zzso of zzso zzso and c between zzso compartments and the cell zzso
