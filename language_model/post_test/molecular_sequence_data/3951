We previously identified a zzso A + zzso element zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso We have also recently demonstrated that the zzso ARE interacts with a number of zzso proteins zzso whose pattern changes during zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso binds in zzso to zzso zzso The results obtained in a zzso zzso zzso system have demonstrated that the zzso acid portion of zzso zzso zzso in all zzso containing the two zzso recognition zzso also binds to the zzso ARE in zzso zzso zzso zzso results in an increase of zzso zzso of zzso by a general zzso inhibitor reduces this increase by zzso These results indicate involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso
