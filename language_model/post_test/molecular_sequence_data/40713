zzso zzso zzso in particular their spores and other resistant zzso play an important role in secondary succession processes that facilitate zzso after zzso zzso In this study, the effects of high and low wildfire zzso zzso short and long fire return zzso on the resistant zzso communities zzso of a Mediterranean open pine forest were zzso zzso samples were collected in four mountain sites with different fire return intervals and used to test zzso development in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were characterized by direct sequencing of zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso regions from individual zzso root zzso zzso zzso species were detected in the zzso The most frequently found zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both hosts and zzso zzso and zzso zzso on maritime zzso A short fire return zzso reduced the species richness of the zzso community found on zzso zzso promoted species like zzso zzso and reduced the abundance of other species zzso zzso zzso The abundance of zzso zzso was positively affected by long fire return zzso but decreased significantly with zzso zzso These results indicate that changes in fire frequency can alter the structure, composition and diversity of zzso communities, which could compromise the resilience of the zzso in highly disturbed zzso
