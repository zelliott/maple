We detected a novel nuclear zzso zzso that bound to the zzso binding motif zzso in which zzso in the zzso sequence was zzso zzso was partially zzso by zzso on zzso and zzso followed by affinity zzso to a zzso coupled to the zzso binding zzso Its binding to the zzso zzso binding motif was specific, although it also recognized the zzso motif zzso zzso was further found to recognize only one of two differently zzso forms of the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and down regulated when the growth of these cells was zzso We propose that zzso plays a role in regulating the zzso function by recognizing the zzso state of the zzso binding motif in a zzso zzso
