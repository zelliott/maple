A novel biological factor that stimulates the zzso activities of zzso zzso complex zzso has been identified and partially zzso from human zzso The zzso factor enhances zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso in a dose related zzso At zzso concentration of the zzso factor, zzso increases the activity to a different extent (10 to 56 zzso depending on the zzso used to zzso the zzso The zzso factor does not zzso neither zzso peptides which are used to zzso zzso nor typical zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso factor is characterized by a high molecular mass zzso zzso and an extreme instability since it loses the activity at 46 degrees C in 10 zzso and at 4 degrees C within a zzso The zzso activity is zzso by incubation in zzso or alkaline media, and by treatment with zzso zzso but it is relatively resistant to the action of zzso It has been suggested that the novel zzso factor zzso described is a protein or a protein complex which may zzso the function and the activity of zzso by zzso zzso
