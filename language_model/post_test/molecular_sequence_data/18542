The zzso zzso protein complex zzso is an integral zzso of the zzso and required for zzso removal during zzso zzso The complex associates with the zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso changes of core zzso zzso stabilizing zzso as well as zzso zzso In addition, the zzso is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control, response to DNA damage, as well as formation and export of zzso We have identified the zzso protein as the zzso of zzso one of zzso core zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso is required for polarized growth of the zzso zzso and, in line with the described zzso functions, the zzso zzso affects the cell cycle and cell zzso The zzso deletion influences zzso in zzso zzso on a global scale, as zzso analysis revealed increased zzso retention zzso Surprisingly, we identified in a screen for zzso interacting proteins not only zzso core components as zzso and zzso but several proteins with putative functions during zzso transport zzso Among others, zzso interacts with the motor protein zzso in the zzso Similar zzso with respect to zzso and polar growth, zzso zzso as well as the zzso of early zzso corroborate the genetic interaction between zzso and zzso Our data zzso a previously unidentified connection between a component of the zzso machinery and zzso transport zzso As the zzso deletion also affects zzso zzso zzso the protein may constitute a novel functional zzso between the two disparate processes of zzso and zzso
