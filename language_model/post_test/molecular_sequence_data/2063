We began characterization of the zzso interactions necessary for zzso light induced zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a key plant defense zzso Three light dependent in zzso zzso appear on a 90 zzso stretch of the zzso promoter with a time course correlated with the onset of zzso zzso We define a minimal light responsive promoter by functional analysis of truncated zzso promoter zzso with a reporter gene in transient expression experiments in parsley zzso Two of the three zzso sequence zzso reside within the minimal zzso Replacement of 10 zzso within either of these zzso leads to complete loss of light zzso We conclude that these sequences define the necessary zzso elements of the minimal zzso zzso light responsive zzso One of the functionally defined zzso is zzso to an element implicated in regulation of genes involved in zzso These data represent the first example in a plant defense gene of an induced change in zzso contacts necessary for zzso zzso Also, our data argue strongly that divergent light induced zzso pathways share common regulatory zzso
