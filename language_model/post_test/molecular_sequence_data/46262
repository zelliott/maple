zzso a zzso zzso zzso with extremely high zzso content, exhibits zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso To gain insight into the mechanism of zzso action on membrane zzso zzso leakage induced by this zzso was studied by using various zzso with zzso of different zzso zzso In zzso containing zzso charged zzso zzso induced rather zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso appeared to be selective in provoking leakage of neutral, egg zzso zzso zzso it effectively induced the release of zzso charged fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B, but was unable to induce the leakage of a neutral compound, zzso and that of positively charged zzso Moreover, organic zzso such as fatty zzso were found to suppress the zzso zzso leakage of egg PC zzso Based on these results, we concluded that zzso zzso the dye release from zzso zzso zzso not by formation of membrane pores as it is generally accepted for the majority of zzso peptides but rather via zzso of dye molecules across the membrane in the form of zzso complexes, zzso zzso operates as an organic zzso zzso This conclusion was supported by observing the formation of complexes between zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso analog having only one zzso was ineffective in zzso binding and zzso zzso The mode of action proposed here for zzso can be related to that previously zzso for zzso derivatives which are able to carry organic zzso across zzso and bulk phase zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003, zzso The newly identified mechanism of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso action of zzso via induction of plasma membrane zzso for important zzso zzso which zzso regulation of zzso balance ultimately leading to zzso membrane zzso
