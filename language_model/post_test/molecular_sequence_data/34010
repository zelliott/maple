zzso is a small, highly active zzso zzso inhibitor whose high-resolution zzso structure was recently solved in zzso Here, we present its zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso methods such as zzso zzso and CD were zzso to extract zzso changes upon modification of zzso temperature and chemical zzso zzso revealed native like behavior over a wide range of zzso agents as reflected in terms of activity and zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso properties of zzso were compared to the zzso zzso Despite the overall structural zzso the zzso stability of the two proteins is zzso Our analysis led to the conclusion that zzso is even more stable than zzso Furthermore, investigations on three zzso truncated zzso derivatives indicate that the higher stability is caused by the long flexible zzso
