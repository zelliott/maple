zzso studies have shown that the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso responds zzso to the zzso zzso We wished to predict which zzso in zzso bind zzso and how the zzso properties of these zzso determine the zzso odor zzso Building on our previous work on zzso interactions in zzso zzso we constructed a molecular model of zzso based on the zzso A resolution three-dimensional map of zzso zzso was automatically zzso in the zzso The results predicted an zzso pocket approximately 10 A from the zzso surface, in a location similar to the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso and the zzso pocket of a previous zzso zzso zzso A zzso on zzso and an zzso on zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso formed Van der zzso contacts with the hydrocarbon portion of zzso We zzso related odor compounds and found that the predicted affinities compared favorably with experimental zzso We also tested a number of zzso acid zzso in order to predict their effects on zzso affinity and provide leads for future experimental zzso
