When zzso Acid zzso cultures were frozen at zzso degrees C for 24 zzso the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to zzso viability improved significantly for the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains tested or for one strain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 zzso the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock zzso Use of zzso zzso zzso based on the major cold shock protein zzso of both zzso coli and zzso zzso resulted in zzso products from all strains zzso The zzso product from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other zzso Use of zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence resulted in zzso products being produced only from the zzso strains studied and not from the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso strains zzso
