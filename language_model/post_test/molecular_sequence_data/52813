zzso are blue light zzso found in both plants and zzso They probably evolved from zzso which are zzso zzso involved in DNA zzso In seed plants, two different zzso zzso genes have been found in zzso and one in zzso while three genes have been found in the zzso zzso We report the zzso of tomato zzso genes zzso and zzso They map to zzso 4 and 9, respectively, show relatively zzso expression and zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins show higher similarity to their zzso counterparts than to each other, suggesting that zzso between zzso and zzso is an ancient event in the evolution of seed zzso The seed plant zzso form a group distinct from the zzso zzso zzso that only one gene was present in the common zzso between these two groups of zzso Most zzso positions in zzso genes from plants and zzso are highly zzso Tomato zzso and zzso proteins carry zzso zzso 210 and 160 zzso acids long, zzso Several zzso motifs are found in these zzso some of which are common to both types of zzso while others are zzso
