We have previously demonstrated the clinical zzso of the rapid detection of zzso by use of a DNA zzso This zzso involves the zzso of capture and detector probe pairs with bacterial zzso zzso target molecules to form a zzso sandwich on the sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the detector probe to zzso amplify the zzso zzso These previous studies involved the zzso of bacterial zzso zzso target sequences with zzso zzso probe pairs at 65 degrees zzso zzso of zzso technology will be greatly facilitated by zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of probe length and target location on signal intensity using zzso temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees zzso Signal intensity was found to vary dramatically with zzso location in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs of as short as 10 zzso in length were able to produce a significant zzso zzso and signal intensity was correlated with probe length for zzso of 10 to 20 zzso in zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso probe pairs was approximately 330 zzso These shorter zzso allowed differentiation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso target sequences differing by a single zzso A panel of zzso probe pairs ranging from 11 to 23 zzso in length was able to distinguish among seven groups of urinary tract zzso In conclusion, we have developed short zzso probe pairs for the zzso identification of zzso at ambient temperature by use of an zzso zzso
