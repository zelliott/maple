The human insulin resistance zzso 2 diabetes, zzso combined zzso and essential zzso genetically complex disorders whose molecular basis is largely zzso The spontaneously zzso rate zzso is a model of these human zzso In the zzso strain, a zzso deletion event that occurred at the zzso locus during the evolution of this zzso strain has been proposed as a cause of defective insulin action and fatty acid zzso In this study, three copies of the zzso zzso one transcribed copy and two zzso were identified in normal rat zzso but only a single gene in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequence localized the zzso deletion event between zzso 4 of the normally transcribed copy of the gene and zzso 4 of the second zzso The deletion led to the creation of a single zzso zzso gene in zzso The boundaries of the zzso junction identified within zzso 4 were surrounded by long zzso nuclear elements zzso and DNA zzso I recognition zzso An zzso deletion at the zzso zzso 15 boundary of the second zzso zzso the putative zzso zzso site and is the cause of an zzso 3' zzso previously observed in zzso We conclude that in zzso the complex trait of insulin resistance and defective fatty acid metabolism is caused by zzso zzso resulting from a zzso deletion caused by unequal zzso This demonstrates that zzso deletions caused by unequal zzso can be a cause of quantitative or complex zzso zzso
