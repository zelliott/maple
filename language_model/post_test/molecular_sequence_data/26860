zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and 3 zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso and metabolize zzso and zzso compounds using zzso as a zzso zzso exhibits a higher zzso value toward zzso and more limited zzso zzso activities than zzso although they are highly zzso to each other in zzso acid sequence zzso In the present study, we investigated the origin of the different properties of the zzso by analyses using several zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso acid sequences was conducted and as a result, two zzso regions between human zzso and zzso were zzso these were designated as the zzso zzso region zzso and the zzso zzso region zzso the zzso zzso We genetically constructed zzso zzso while focusing on these zzso 

zzso zzso possessing zzso of zzso zzso exhibited zzso activities but a low zzso affinity probably due to a structural zzso in a zzso domain, whereas zzso zzso including zzso of zzso zzso was zzso similar to zzso Furthermore, zzso was similar to zzso in both zzso activities and zzso zzso 

These results suggested that zzso zzso the zzso loop region, is the origin of the difference between human zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso
