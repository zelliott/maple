Many plant species including temperate grasses require zzso in order to zzso zzso is the process of promotion of flowering after exposure to prolonged periods of zzso To investigate the zzso response in zzso the expression patterns of about 1,500 unique genes of zzso zzso were analyzed by a zzso zzso approach, at different time points after transfer of plants to low zzso zzso of zzso zzso takes around 80 d and, therefore, the plants were incubated at low temperatures for at least 12 zzso A total of 70 zzso genes were identified that are either zzso or zzso with a minimal zzso difference compared with the common zzso The majority of these genes show a very rapid response to the cold treatment, indicating that their expression is affected by the cold stress and, therefore, these genes are not likely to be involved in the flowering zzso Based on zzso zzso one gene could be identified that is zzso towards the end of the cold period and, in addition, a few genes have been found that are zzso in the last weeks of the cold treatment and, zzso are putative candidates for genes involved in the zzso zzso Three of the zzso genes are zzso to members of the zzso box, zzso and zzso families of zzso factors, zzso The latter two are novel genes not connected previously to zzso zzso Furthermore, members of the zzso family of zzso factors have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso suggesting that this molecular zzso as in zzso plays a role in the regulation of the zzso response in zzso
