zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were determined for 11 strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess by molecular genetic means, zzso recent zzso interpretation which split the species into three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one other species, as yet unnamed zzso species zzso Four sequence patterns were identified among the 11 zzso Two sequences that varied at one site were found among strains of zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso comparisons revealed zzso sequence differences of zzso zzso in the zzso 240 zzso zzso segment zzso Although zzso differences are not large in terms of percent zzso zzso they are much larger than the observed zzso variation and support the zzso interpretation distinguishing three zzso When the data were zzso using zzso and zzso the three zzso tree was well zzso The zzso arrangement of these strains is zzso with secondary zzso profile zzso
