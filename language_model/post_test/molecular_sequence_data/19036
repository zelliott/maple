The related zzso zzso zzso zzso increases gene zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso and enhances zzso in zzso Both zzso and inflammatory factor zzso regulate gene expression of zzso but how zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso gene zzso is zzso Here, we found that zzso interacts with zzso zzso of zzso a primary zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity, whereas expression of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso markedly enhanced zzso stimulation on the zzso promoter activity zzso A physical interaction between zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso experiments in cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso crystal structures revealed that a zzso surface of zzso potentially interacts with zzso via four zzso acid zzso located at zzso zzso zzso and zzso We performed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso in zzso is a key site for the formation of zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso at zzso of zzso disrupted the interaction of zzso with zzso Moreover, expression of zzso decreased zzso zzso promoter activity, zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso however, the effect of zzso was largely lost when zzso was zzso to zzso These results indicate that zzso interacts with zzso through zzso and that they antagonize each other for zzso zzso zzso suggesting a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates gene zzso linking zzso to zzso
