zzso is a standard drug for treating severe malaria in Africa, and it is also increasingly used to treat uncomplicated zzso However, failures of zzso therapy are common, and it is unknown if failures in Africa are due to drug zzso Recent studies have identified associations between in zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso in genes zzso putative zzso including zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and varied numbers of zzso or zzso repeats in zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso To better characterize zzso of zzso response, we assessed associations between genetic zzso in zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso treatment responses in zzso zzso Among zzso fresh clinical zzso tested in zzso decreasing sensitivity to zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 86, zzso and zzso Nearly all zzso had zzso zzso preventing analysis of associations with this zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso with 2 copies of either zzso repeat showed modest decreases in zzso sensitivity compared to those with 1 or zzso repeats, but the differences were not statistically zzso None of the above zzso predicted treatment failure among 66 subjects treated with zzso for uncomplicated zzso Our data suggest that zzso sensitivity is a complex trait and that known zzso in zzso zzso and zzso while associated with zzso sensitivity, are not robust markers for zzso zzso
