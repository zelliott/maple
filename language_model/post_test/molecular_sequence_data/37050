zzso zzso are a group of closely related zzso zzso produced by a variety of common zzso These are potent and highly specific zzso the toxicity of which is based upon their zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Apart from protein zzso it is not known whether these zzso peptides could bind any other cellular zzso We wanted to determine whether any possible unknown zzso could explain the zzso effects observed at high zzso of zzso The question of other possible cellular proteins binding to zzso is also relevant when these compounds are employed for affinity zzso of protein zzso In zzso cell zzso zzso to zzso recognized three protein zzso of zzso and 55 zzso By zzso and zzso approaches, these proteins were identified as the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso The latter target could be associated with the suggested zzso potential of zzso
