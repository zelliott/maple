zzso The zzso blast zzso is of great interest, not only because of the damaging potential of rice blast to the rice crop, but also because both the pathogen and its host are zzso zzso The rice blast resistance gene zzso which is one of the five classical zzso located at the zzso locus on the long arm of zzso 11, zzso high and stable resistance to many Chinese rice blast zzso zzso The isolation and functional characterization of zzso were performed in the present study through genetic and zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso is required for the expression of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso repeat zzso zzso and each shares a very high level of protein identity with corresponding proteins zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from other zzso zzso including zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The coupled genes probably did not evolve as a result of a zzso event, and are far from any zzso R gene zzso zzso is a younger zzso at the locus that probably emerged after rice zzso
