A novel zzso protein zzso has been zzso from the zzso zzso of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a basic protein zzso zzso which appears to be a zzso composed of zzso with an apparent zzso zzso of zzso and with an zzso sequence (20 zzso zzso zzso exerted an zzso effect on the zzso zzso cascade zzso with zzso preparations of factor G and the zzso zzso from the zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was evaluated by measuring the residual zzso activity of the zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso using zzso as the zzso zzso The binding specificity of a wide range of zzso and other zzso towards zzso was expressed by the relative zzso zzso of the zzso of factor G, the first zzso zzso in the pathway, which is activated by binding to zzso zzso was found to have a high affinity for linear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was able to bind to zzso with zzso branches and mixed linkage such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso and barley zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was demonstrated by an zzso zzso zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso
