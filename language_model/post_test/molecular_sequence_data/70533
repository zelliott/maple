The zzso zzso zzso gene is required for entry into zzso and for zzso segregation during zzso To further understand zzso function, we undertook a synthetic lethal screen with the zzso zzso zzso and isolated lid (for lethal in zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso zzso At the restrictive temperature of 36 degrees C, zzso zzso cells arrest with a zzso zzso similar to that of zzso and zzso zzso An zzso version of zzso is a component of a zzso approximately zzso complex; the presence of zzso in this complex depends upon functional zzso zzso zzso with several other zzso including zzso and zzso and the presence of zzso in a zzso complex depends upon the activity of zzso Further, zzso function is required for the zzso of zzso an zzso complex or zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso complex decline significantly, and the zzso of an zzso target is zzso These data suggest that at least one role of zzso is to maintain or establish the zzso level of the zzso
