We have described an zzso zzso envelope zzso from human zzso virus type 1 that is stabilized by an zzso zzso bond between zzso and the zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sanders, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Olson, and zzso zzso Moore, zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso site between zzso and zzso is fully zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso zzso that have deletions in the first, second, and/or third variable loop zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso bond formed efficiently in zzso containing a single loop deletion or a combination deletion of the zzso and V2 zzso However, deletion of all three variable zzso prevented formation of the zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso were not fully processed to their zzso and zzso constituents even when the zzso zzso was zzso The exposure of the zzso zzso site is probably affected in these zzso even though the disabling change is in a region of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso proteins revealed that deletion of the variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso near the zzso site on zzso These zzso zzso zzso might be useful as zzso
