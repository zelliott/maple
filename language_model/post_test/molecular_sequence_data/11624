Using computer methods for detecting zzso zzso acid sequence zzso we show that the zzso organization modifier zzso domain that has been previously identified in several proteins involved in zzso zzso is present in a much larger group of zzso zzso zzso some of which are positive rather than negative regulators of zzso The most interesting new members of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso lethal zzso protein involved in the X zzso gene dosage compensation in the males and human zzso protein zzso We show that the zzso domain is duplicated in several zzso proteins and use this observation to interpret recent results on zzso binding obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso domain may be a vehicle that delivers both positive and negative zzso regulators to the sites of their action on zzso
