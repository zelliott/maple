zzso zzso is a gastric pathogen that zzso half the human population and causes zzso ulcers, and zzso The zzso gene product is a major zzso factor associated with gastric zzso It is injected into zzso cells, zzso zzso by host cell zzso and zzso host signaling zzso zzso is known for its zzso zzso and functional diversity in the zzso half, where an zzso zzso motif is zzso The Western version of zzso carries the zzso segment types A, B, and C, while the East Asian zzso carries types A, B, and D and shows higher zzso Many structural zzso such as zzso and deletions are zzso In this study, we gained insight into the relationships of zzso zzso through various modes of zzso by analyzing all known zzso zzso at the DNA sequence level with the single zzso zzso zzso that occurred were: zzso zzso zzso between DNA sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between DNA sequences for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso between short similar DNA zzso The left half of the zzso segment characteristic of East Asian zzso was derived from Western type zzso with zzso type zzso as the zzso through zzso of specific sequences within the zzso zzso zzso acid changes were detected in the variable region as well as in the zzso region at sites to which no specific function has yet been zzso Each showed a unique evolutionary zzso These results clarify zzso routes of zzso evolution and provide a solid basis for a deeper understanding of its function in zzso
