We have expressed the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso in bacteria as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein displays zzso activity, zzso the zzso zzso precursor zzso to the expected zzso The zzso zzso is only active as a zzso and we hypothesized that zzso zzso might be used as an indicator of zzso zzso We constructed 25 zzso zzso zzso throughout gag and assessed the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso by the appearance of zzso zzso products in bacterial zzso All zzso zzso produced stable protein in zzso zzso activity of the majority of the zzso zzso was indistinguishable from that of the wild zzso Six zzso one with an zzso in the zzso zzso four with insertions in the zzso zzso and one with insertions in the zzso zzso globally disrupted zzso zzso When zzso was provided in trans on a separate zzso the zzso proteins were zzso with zzso zzso These results suggest that the gag zzso identified as disruptive of zzso processing did not conceal the zzso bonds of the zzso Rather, the zzso prevented zzso zzso in the context of a zzso zzso perhaps by preventing zzso zzso
