An association has been observed in several independent data sets between late onset Alzheimer's Disease zzso and the zzso locus on zzso zzso We have examined the zzso in family history positive zzso and family history negative zzso cases and find a distortion of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso with previous zzso However, when we examined the zzso distribution of the zzso siblings of the zzso group we found an excess of the zzso 4 zzso which also differs significantly from historic controls but not from the affected zzso The age distribution of the affected and unaffected siblings was similar, suggesting that the zzso frequency distortion in the unaffected siblings was not due to their being below the mean age of zzso zzso score linkage analysis, with age dependent onset and zzso zzso of the genetic zzso did not suggest linkage to the zzso zzso Furthermore, an analysis of zzso of the age of disease free survival suggested that zzso zzso contributes a small fraction of the total zzso indicating that the zzso locus is a poor predictor of disease free survival age within late onset zzso One explanation for the age dependent association reported by other groups, and our results, is that the zzso locus enhances the rate of progression of the disease process in otherwise predisposed individuals and that variation at this locus is not able in and of itself to cause the zzso We suggest this hypothesis is compatible with the current literature regarding zzso and zzso
