This prospective study examined the persistence and transition of zzso virus zzso in human zzso virus zzso subjects with and without oral zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecular epidemiology of zzso infection was characterized in subjects treated with zzso to suppress zzso zzso Tongue zzso zzso of zzso subjects were found to support not only zzso replication but also persistent, zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to enter the tongue from the blood zzso of infection and, zzso from zzso sources as zzso zzso transition from the blood to the tongue appeared to occur even during zzso suppression of zzso zzso suggesting zzso entry into tongue zzso tissue as a zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these results describe the persistence and transition of zzso as a dynamic interaction between the blood and zzso reservoirs of zzso infection and suggest a role for entry, zzso and zzso of oral zzso zzso in the zzso of oral zzso zzso
