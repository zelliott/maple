A zzso of mainland eastern Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was constructed using presence or absence of zzso zzso restriction sites in 15 zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso between species were generally large zzso between 10 and zzso emphasizing the zzso of this zzso zzso analysis of the zzso resulted in a strongly supported zzso zzso with relationships suggested by a previous study of zzso variation, but conflicting with concepts based on zzso zzso The zzso grouped the species into two zzso one containing zzso and zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso with a northern zzso of zzso being more similar to zzso than other zzso The zzso from zzso was most closely related to that of zzso and then zzso The strongly zzso molecular zzso confirms and extends the previous zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reinterpretation of zzso and ecological shifts in the zzso This suggests considerable plasticity and zzso in the zzso characters previously used to associate zzso The low divergence and close relationship between the zzso zzso specialist zzso and the widely distributed zzso zzso demonstrate the capacity for zzso rapid and dramatic shifts in habitat zzso This contrasts with the assumption of fixed habitat preference that zzso zzso models of diversification of zzso zzso
