Over zzso of the world's nearly 170 million zzso C virus zzso subjects exist in regions of Africa, Southeast Asia and Middle Eastern countries where zzso 4-6 are very zzso In particular, zzso zzso 4 is highly prevalent in Egypt with more than zzso of the population infected and chronic zzso representing one of the top five leading causes of death, due in part to ineffective zzso alpha treatment against this zzso Despite this, very little work has been carried out to characterize the sequence diversity of zzso 4, which will be critical to the development of effective vaccines and zzso therapies against this zzso As a result of the paucity of sequence data available for zzso zzso 4, for which only one full zzso sequence is currently available, we were interested in characterizing additional zzso 4 sequences and to provide zzso for amplification of this zzso Here we describe seven unique zzso zzso zzso full zzso in addition to a single zzso zzso zzso and characterize their sequence diversity in relation to other more closely characterized zzso zzso
