zzso zzso acids without a side chain functional group can transfer themselves into peptides after prolonged standing in zzso at warm zzso Seven zzso and free peptides were isolated and their structures zzso The zzso group participation is the key to the zzso zzso An zzso mixed zzso zzso intermediate was proposed for this type of reaction which might provide a clue to the function of the zzso group in the zzso zzso and in the zzso synthesis of zzso
