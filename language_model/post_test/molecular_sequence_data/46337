The zzso common zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso in zzso bacteria whose role remains largely zzso In a previous work, we have demonstrated that zzso the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso imposed severe deficiencies to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we show that zzso in the zzso structure activate the zzso zzso which results in the repression of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso In addition, a detailed analysis of zzso cluster zzso zzso which provoke the disruption of the zzso zzso at different levels of the pathway, suggests that the absence of the zzso zzso zzso structure could constitute a potential signal detected by the zzso zzso We also identify zzso as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that high zzso zzso zzso activity in this zzso These results provide a new perspective from which to understand the zzso conservation of zzso among zzso and the basis for the zzso zzso detected in zzso zzso strains in other zzso zzso
