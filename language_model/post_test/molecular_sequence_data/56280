The ability of the nuclear zzso zzso to activate zzso is controlled both by level of DNA binding and by the activity of its zzso zzso Control of DNA binding is achieved by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the DNA zzso resulting in enhanced zzso and zzso activity of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso which is the target for repression of zzso activity under zzso conditions, results in a strong decrease of zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso by zzso is fully restored upon zzso of zzso Both zzso are also found in the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso and are the only differences between these proteins in the zzso domain, suggesting that zzso escapes zzso of DNA binding by both zzso However, zzso of zzso of zzso is absolutely required for the ability of zzso to activate zzso of zzso genes in a zzso zzso
