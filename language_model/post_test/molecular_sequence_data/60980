Japanese encephalitis virus zzso a zzso zzso is an important human zzso The envelope zzso zzso a major structural zzso is responsible for viral zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso of zzso was predicted using the zzso zzso modeling approach and X-ray structure data of the zzso of zzso encephalitis virus as a template zzso et zzso zzso In the initial stages of zzso a zzso zzso constant of zzso was used to simulate the zzso zzso The predicted structure was refined by zzso the protein in a zzso layer of water by explicitly considering zzso water zzso Four independent structure evaluation methods report this structure to be acceptable zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso has an extended structure with seven zzso two zzso and three zzso The zzso structure was used to delineate zzso and sequential zzso These results document the importance of zzso structure in understanding the zzso properties of zzso in general and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso prediction method could be used to identify zzso zzso on any protein zzso with known three-dimensional zzso This is one of the largest proteins whose three-dimensional structure has been predicted using an zzso modeling approach and water as a zzso
