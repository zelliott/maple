The sequences of different plant viral leaders with known translation zzso ability show partial zzso to the central region of zzso zzso Such zzso might serve as a means to attract zzso zzso zzso and explain in part the zzso property of these zzso To verify this notion, we designed zzso zzso zzso differing only in the nature of 10 zzso zzso in the center of their 41 base zzso These were complementary to consecutive zzso of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that leaders with zzso complementary to regions zzso and zzso zzso of plant zzso zzso bound most efficiently to the zzso zzso zzso after zzso from zzso zzso under conditions of high zzso strength, a treatment known to remove translation initiation zzso Using wheat germ zzso zzso we could demonstrate that zzso with these leaders were translated more than three times more efficiently than a control lacking such a zzso Three linked copies of the insert enhanced translation of reporter zzso to levels comparable with those directed by the natural translation enhancing leaders of tobacco mosaic virus and potato virus Y zzso Moreover, inserting the same leaders as zzso sequences in zzso zzso substantially increased translation of the second zzso thereby revealing internal zzso entry site zzso Thus, for plant systems, the complementary interaction between zzso leader and the central region of zzso zzso allows zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso complex without assistance of translation initiation zzso
