Although emerging evidence suggests that schizophrenia zzso is associated with peripheral and central zzso fatty acid zzso deficits, there is currently nothing known about the expression of genes that mediate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and relevant fatty acid zzso ratios as estimates of zzso activities, in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso After correction for multiple zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly greater in zzso patients relative to controls zzso zzso and there was a positive trend found for zzso zzso zzso No differences were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Both male zzso zzso and female zzso zzso zzso patients exhibited greater zzso zzso expression relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso patients treated with typical zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited greater zzso zzso expression relative to zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso activity, zzso patients exhibited a greater zzso ratio zzso zzso and a positive trend was found for zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate zzso potentially zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso of zzso patients that are independent of gender and antipsychotic zzso Greater zzso zzso expression and activity could have implications for central zzso synthesis and zzso zzso
