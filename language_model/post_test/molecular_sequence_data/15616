zzso zzso is the most common form of zzso retinal zzso with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in zzso At least 28 genes and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report two extended and highly zzso families segregating early onset zzso zzso Despite the zzso in both families, we found zzso zzso in one of them, in which affected individuals were compound zzso for two different zzso of the zzso zzso In the second family we found evidence for locus zzso A novel zzso zzso of zzso was found in only 14 of 17 affected individuals in this zzso Our data indicate that in the other affected individuals the disease is caused by a different zzso These findings demonstrate that while zzso mapping is an efficient tool for identification of the underlying zzso genes in zzso families, both locus and zzso zzso may occur even within the same zzso zzso These observations should be taken into account, especially when studying common and zzso zzso genetic zzso
