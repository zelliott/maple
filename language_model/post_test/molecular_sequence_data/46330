zzso zzso zzso affects multiple zzso shows zzso progression and is caused by zzso expansions at the zzso zzso We determined the zzso zzso zzso profile and zzso length in zzso from zzso zzso zzso adults, zzso individuals and transgenic zzso zzso Analysis included zzso binding sites upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso as zzso zzso binding affects zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso In humans, in a given zzso expansions were largest in heart and smallest in liver, differing by zzso zzso in adults, the largest expansions were in heart and cerebral zzso smallest in zzso differing by up to zzso repeats in the same zzso zzso zzso was specific to the zzso zzso In zzso adults, heart, liver and zzso showed zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso kidney and skeletal muscle were devoid of zzso zzso decreased between zzso and zzso zzso to previous findings, zzso was not restricted to individuals with zzso zzso The expanded repeat zzso an abrupt boundary of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso site, were zzso whereas the repeat itself and downstream sequences were zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns were similar but not identical to those in zzso zzso notably in mice, zzso was present zzso and downstream of the zzso but greater zzso Thus, in humans, the zzso expanded zzso repeat appears to maintain a highly polarized pattern of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which varies markedly with age and zzso
