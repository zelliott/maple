zzso as a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, is expressed on the surface of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso is a characteristic of zzso diseases such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso zzso The zzso gene has been mapped to a region of the zzso zzso that is involved in zzso to systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the deletion of zzso T zzso We were interested in determining the molecular nature of zzso zzso zzso comparison has revealed significant identity between the zzso human and zzso zzso zzso they share a number of common consensus binding zzso zzso zzso identified three regions of zzso zzso the region between position zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso site at positions zzso to zzso and a downstream promoter element zzso at positions zzso to zzso zzso and zzso I zzso showed specific zzso interactions of the zzso promoter with the zzso site and the zzso repeat zzso The zzso element was shown to be essential for start site zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso site at zzso to zzso is associated with maximum reporter gene activity, the zzso element is required for start site selection, and the zzso zzso repeats act to repress zzso We also have shown that the zzso is zzso when we screened a random healthy zzso Further studies are required to determine whether zzso instability in the zzso zzso susceptible individuals to zzso zzso
