zzso remains a major zzso health threat which demands the discovery and zzso of new drug targets in order to develop future zzso The zzso of zzso consumed during zzso zzso is an important zzso present in many zzso The final step of this pathway, the conversion of zzso to zzso can be performed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso depending on the particular species zzso 

The gene zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso tuberculosis zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was found to be a member of the zzso zzso zzso and closely related to the corresponding zzso in zzso zzso but not to that found in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso donor preference for the formation of zzso from zzso was for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso - zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso - zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso with a zzso of zzso - zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds were examined as potential zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielding zzso zzso with Ki values of zzso - zzso zzso These same compounds were examined as zzso agents against zzso tuberculosis and a lower biohazard zzso zzso model system, and were found to completely prevent cell zzso zzso was the most effective growth inhibitor with an zzso of 78 zzso against zzso zzso and one of 156 zzso against zzso zzso 

zzso formation from zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso This zzso can be inhibited by selected zzso compounds, which also have effectiveness in preventing cell growth in zzso These compounds represent a starting point for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso with higher activity and lower zzso
