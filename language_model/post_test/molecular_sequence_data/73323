zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso zzso that comprises zzso group 11 of the zzso zzso disorders zzso zzso a candidate gene for zzso identified in zzso encodes the zzso for zzso zzso proteins with the zzso zzso targeting signal zzso By zzso probing we identified human and zzso zzso genes and found that expression of either zzso the zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso In a collection of 36 zzso zzso we found two zzso zzso zzso one, zzso was present in 26 of the zzso all with a severe zzso the second, zzso was present in three zzso including two with a milder zzso A third zzso zzso whose functional significance is yet to be determined, was present in five zzso all compound zzso with zzso We conclude that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso and suggest a founder effect may explain the high frequency of zzso
