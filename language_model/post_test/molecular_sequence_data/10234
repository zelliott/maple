zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene product zzso the proliferation of cells in zzso A major target of the RB protein is the zzso zzso factor zzso RB binds directly to the zzso domain of zzso and zzso it, thereby preventing cells from entering S zzso To induce complete zzso arrest, RB requires the presence of the zzso zzso which are components of the zzso zzso zzso This cooperation is zzso through a physical interaction between RB and zzso We show here that in zzso cells RB can contact both zzso and zzso at the same time, thereby targeting zzso to zzso zzso and zzso are indeed found within the same complex in zzso Furthermore, RB and zzso cooperate to repress zzso activity in transient zzso zzso The ability of zzso to cooperate with RB to repress zzso is dependent upon several distinct zzso of zzso including the RB binding domain and the zzso binding zzso However, the zzso seems zzso for this zzso Taken together, our results point out an unexpected role of zzso for the zzso zzso The ability of zzso and RB to cooperate in zzso zzso activity could be an underlying mechanism for the observed cooperation between zzso and RB to induce zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the domain of zzso that binds RB has zzso zzso potential which RB can zzso This suggest that RB not only targets zzso but also regulates its zzso
