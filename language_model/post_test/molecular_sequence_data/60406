The zzso system controls the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso is calcium independent apparently because zzso is a tightly bound zzso of zzso The zzso zzso site is located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso rather then zzso zzso The proteins with the so-called zzso motif bind zzso in a zzso zzso This group of proteins does not include zzso which has the zzso zzso zzso In the experiments with synthetic peptides was demonstrated that the interaction between the zzso and zzso site of zzso does not depend on the zzso zzso On the other hand, in the experiments with fusion, zzso and truncated zzso was shown that these features of zzso region of zzso is not enough for the zzso to bind zzso zzso this interaction requires the additional binding sites both in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso In the experiments with fusion zzso the mechanism of zzso regulation of electron transfer in zzso was zzso The concept of zzso control element in the zzso site of zzso zzso is zzso
