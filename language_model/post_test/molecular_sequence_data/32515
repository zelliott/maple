The zzso zzso at zzso that involve the zzso leukemia gene zzso zzso zzso zzso are one of the most common zzso abnormalities in acute leukemia and have been associated with a poor zzso Given that not all zzso zzso are seen under conventional zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso it is very important to use molecular techniques to determine the cause of zzso In this study, we describe two cases of zzso in which FISH analysis showed a high-level zzso amplification, to confirm if this zzso may be accompanied by partial tandem zzso of the zzso gene zzso Both patients showed complex zzso and an zzso clinical zzso The zzso region characterization included conventional zzso zzso and comparative zzso zzso analysis to study the expression patterns of several zzso located within the amplified region and detection of partial tandem zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the two zzso Moreover, patient 1 showed amplification of the zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that molecular methods such as zzso or sequencing should be used to detect zzso zzso and that amplification of zzso locus may be extended to its zzso zzso
