The numerous zzso in the zzso blood group system result from zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso to zzso in this system can be clinically zzso We describe six zzso whose plasma contained zzso to zzso zzso zzso and discuss their zzso 

zzso chain reaction amplification, direct sequencing, restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and protein modeling were performed by standard zzso 

zzso 1 zzso and her zzso compatible sister were zzso for a zzso change in zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Red blood cells zzso from zzso 1 and her sister were not zzso by plasma from zzso 2; however, zzso from zzso 2 were zzso by plasma from zzso zzso zzso 3, 4, 5, and 6 had the zzso change associated with the previously reported zzso zzso zzso 5 was also zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed an association between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso modeling indicated that whereas zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso are zzso 

zzso in the zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is detected by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the results of protein modeling are zzso
