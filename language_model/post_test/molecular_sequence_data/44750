Recent advances in the fields of molecular cloning and zzso zzso zzso a zzso of our views concerning the evolution of the genes zzso zzso zzso The currently widely held view that the zzso of zzso contain only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a second zzso gene being expressed only in zzso fish is no longer zzso Identification of genes zzso both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso identification of the zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso and the isolation of gene products from at least two zzso zzso genes in zzso suggests the alternative hypothesis that zzso of the zzso gene occurred early in evolution, predating or zzso with the appearance of the zzso We speculate that at least two zzso genes are expressed in all classes of zzso but these genes have evolved at very different zzso It is probable that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a related zzso arose from a second independent zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso fish at a time after the divergence of the zzso stock from the line of evolution leading to zzso The recent isolation of zzso II, a zzso which contains a region of structural similarity but is not zzso related to zzso from the central nervous systems of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that we modify the accepted view that zzso II is exclusively a product of the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso
