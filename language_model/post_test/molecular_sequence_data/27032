A novel zzso primer pair for amplification of full-length zzso B gene from zzso zzso generated an zzso of approximately zzso zzso base pairs zzso with all 18 zzso zzso zzso 7 for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso The putative open reading frame zzso of the zzso B from zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso similarly, but differing from those of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso The putative promoter structures consisting of a zzso T zzso sequence and a consensus sequence at the zzso region were identified upstream of the putative zzso in all the zzso zzso zzso A start zzso zzso and a probable zzso binding site were also identified in all the zzso In addition, two distinctly different and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dependent hypothetically intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso B were identified to occur within the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified the zzso of zzso B gene in the zzso zzso zzso The neighbor joining tree suggested that the zzso sequence information of the zzso B had molecular discrimination efficacy among UN zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso
