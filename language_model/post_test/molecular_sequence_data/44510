zzso is the modular zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso of zzso the first component of the complement classical zzso Its zzso region is a zzso zzso of two zzso zzso each zzso two zzso complement control protein zzso zzso IV and V zzso known as short consensus repeats zzso a zzso zzso segment, and the zzso zzso B zzso With a view to gain insight into zzso interactions within this region, zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso of the active zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were isolated and then fragmented by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence and mass zzso analyses of the resulting zzso peptides allowed us to identify one zzso zzso between zzso of module V and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso B domain and one zzso zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso gamma and zzso of the B zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso IV and V and of the B domain was also zzso The complementary information provided by chemical zzso and zzso modeling studies was used to construct a three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso in which module V interacts with the zzso zzso on the side opposite to both the active site and the zzso zzso zzso Also, a tentative three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso was built, indicating a loose zzso to zzso association of the zzso with the active sites facing opposite directions toward the outside of the zzso The latter model is compared with available zzso structural data, and its functional implications are discussed in terms of the zzso changes occurring during zzso zzso
