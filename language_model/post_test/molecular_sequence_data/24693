Chemical zzso was used to study the spatial structure of zzso zzso promoter D upon formation of the zzso active complex with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso binding was shown to induce zzso changes in sites located at positions 43 and 57, several zzso turns away from the zzso zzso This was the first finding of a structural deformation induced by assembly of the zzso zzso The deformation was associated with specific features of the promoter zzso zzso and suggested high zzso in the organization of the zzso complex and substantial energy zzso caused by the zzso
