A transient zzso zzso zzso expression system was developed for zzso zzso An zzso coli zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso cat gene was zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were placed upstream of this cat zzso and zzso zzso were performed in zzso coli from these zzso maintained zzso The plasmids with putative promoters zzso and zzso were found to be approximately zzso more active than were the plasmids with zzso or no zzso The level of activity correlated well with the resistance to zzso that each zzso zzso Next, the zzso zzso zzso were transformed by zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed by both zzso zzso and the zzso diffusion zzso zzso of zzso activity demonstrated that the zzso promoter was again about zzso more active than the zzso cat zzso The zzso and zzso promoters increased the activity zzso and zzso respectively, over that with the zzso zzso This simple zzso zzso was shown to be an effective method to study promoter function in zzso zzso in the absence of a well-developed genetic zzso
