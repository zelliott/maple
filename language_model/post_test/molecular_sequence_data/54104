Six strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the human oral cavity and an infected arm zzso were subjected to a comprehensive range of zzso and zzso tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the zzso were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso were zzso and produced zzso and zzso acids as end products of zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Polar zzso analysis revealed a variety of zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso No respiratory zzso were zzso The zzso was of the type zzso zzso with zzso partially replaced by zzso The DNA zzso content of one of the zzso zzso was 55 zzso A novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate the six zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
