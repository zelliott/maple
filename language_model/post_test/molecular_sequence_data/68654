The zzso is a recurring zzso found in zzso cells of some patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso The zzso gene was identified on zzso 19 adjacent to the zzso of the zzso and has been proposed to be a candidate zzso which may play a role in zzso The current study of a Japanese patient with zzso revealed that the zzso is zzso at the molecular zzso the zzso gene was juxtaposed to the zzso side of the S alpha 1 switch region of the zzso heavy chain gene zzso on the zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso to the S alpha 1 region was joined to zzso 19 sequences on the zzso zzso partner zzso The zzso on zzso 19 was 16 zzso upstream of the first zzso of the zzso gene and 7 zzso of zzso 19 sequences were deleted at the point of the zzso The zzso zzso so far zzso analyzed consistently occurred within one of the two S alpha switch zzso however, sequence analysis of the zzso 19 regions involved in the zzso failed to demonstrate an obvious sequence similarity with the switch zzso The zzso breaks on zzso 19 from two zzso patients having the zzso were within zzso repeated zzso
