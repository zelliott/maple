In the present study, we identified an additional member of the human zzso requirement factor A zzso protein family, called zzso zzso zzso or zzso which was most highly expressed in the heart and zzso We cloned the full-length sequences of two forms zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso located the gene on zzso zzso determined its zzso structure and revealed how the two zzso zzso are produced through alternative zzso The alternative zzso was also verified by Northern zzso Four distinct zzso were found for the long form zzso zzso zzso an zzso growth factor binding domain, zzso a zzso S zzso domain, zzso a zzso zzso domain and zzso a zzso zzso The short form is identical to the long form except it lacks the zzso zzso zzso of all members of human zzso zzso including their zzso suggests that both zzso of zzso represent active zzso zzso that they may have different zzso zzso and that zzso may have similar functions to zzso All three zzso family members showed very different zzso patterns in 76 human zzso indicating a specific function for zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso are highly expressed in the zzso Identification of the zzso function of each zzso family member is clearly of zzso
