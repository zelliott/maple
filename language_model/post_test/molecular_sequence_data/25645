zzso zzso an zzso zzso of diphtheria toxin identified by zzso labeling with zzso was replaced with zzso acid, zzso or zzso by directed zzso of the zzso zzso of the toxin zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso in zzso coli, and the corresponding zzso zzso A zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused reductions in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while causing only minimal changes in zzso zzso The effects of the zzso on zzso activity were considerably zzso only a zzso reduction in activity was observed for zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso actually exhibited a small but zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was diminished zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and was zzso in the other zzso The results confirm that zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso and imply an important function for the zzso zzso group in zzso The zzso group is also important for zzso labeling by zzso but not for zzso zzso The pH dependence of the zzso parameters for the zzso reaction revealed a group in zzso that zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso and is in the zzso state in the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
