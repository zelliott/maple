A zzso gene from zzso zzso was isolated by a zzso strategy, cloned and subsequently zzso The amplified sequence contained the entire coding region of the zzso II, which is interrupted by a 165 zzso zzso at 73 zzso downstream the starting zzso This zzso contains all the elements required for the processing mechanism in zzso a high A + U content, the appropriate zzso sites in the zzso and 3' ends and four typical zzso consensus zzso zzso transformation of wheat zzso with the complete zzso gene under the control of zzso zzso promoter revealed that the zzso sequence was spliced zzso The gene was also expressed at high levels, probably due to an zzso sequence found near the 3' end of the zzso
