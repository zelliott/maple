The zzso of zzso requires the interaction of several zzso zzso by zzso genes and is well zzso between zzso and zzso We have cloned the human zzso of zzso based on its zzso to different zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso We created zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso its zzso at the zzso membrane by zzso zzso Our results and the one predicted zzso spanning region are in line with the assumption that H zzso is an integral zzso membrane protein with the zzso inside the zzso and the zzso facing the zzso The zzso zzso membrane protein zzso interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso The physical interaction could be confirmed by zzso of the two in zzso transcribed and translated zzso To address the targeting of zzso to the zzso zzso the expression of different zzso and zzso zzso zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso was investigated in human zzso The zzso 33 zzso acids of zzso were necessary and sufficient to direct the reporter protein zzso to zzso and seemed to be integrated into the zzso zzso The expression of a zzso zzso fusion protein did not result in a zzso zzso but interestingly, this and several other truncated zzso fusion proteins were also localized to zzso and/or zzso structures representing zzso
