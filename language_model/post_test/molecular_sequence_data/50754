An isolate of zzso zzso from the blood culture of a child with leukemia was found to produce two zzso at least one of which zzso resistance to zzso Genes zzso both zzso were located on a single zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was introduced into zzso coli zzso zzso and the gene zzso one zzso was zzso onto zzso zzso by exploiting a gene dosage zzso The zzso gene was found to zzso a zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso This gene was subsequently zzso onto zzso zzso The zzso element zzso the zzso zzso has been designated zzso Both plasmids zzso and zzso were shown to zzso a zzso with the same zzso point and zzso profile as the zzso zzso zzso zzso at approximately 7 zzso is larger than zzso zzso zzso and zzso at a lower zzso Although it produced a zzso which can complement the zzso of zzso its zzso function was not able to complement the zzso of a zzso element which lacked zzso The occurrence of a gene zzso an zzso zzso on a zzso element in a clinically significant zzso is potentially a cause for concern for the spread of resistance to the zzso zzso
