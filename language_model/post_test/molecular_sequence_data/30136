zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso solution were assigned by using zzso two-dimensional nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation time zzso and zzso zzso shift correlation zzso Due to the large line zzso it was not possible to directly extract zzso zzso zzso constant values from any spectrum including zzso or zzso However, comparison of quantitative zzso spectral simulations with experimental zzso enabled zzso of zzso zzso The scope and limitations of this approach were explored by zzso and by use of experimental zzso It was found that zzso line zzso exhibit some zzso from one zzso to the next as well as from one zzso to the next within a zzso and the exact line zzso is critical to accurate evaluation of zzso zzso Experimental zzso zzso were not consistent with a rigid zzso zzso for any of the zzso zzso A classical two-state model, with rapid jumps between zzso zzso angle P zzso 162 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso was able to account for the spectral characteristics of terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso from the zzso core could be simulated only if the classical two-state model was altered such that the dominant zzso had a zzso angle at 144 degrees instead of 162 zzso In this case, the major zzso amounted to zzso zzso the spectral data were consistent with a zzso model in which zzso and zzso zzso had the largest and smallest zzso respectively, but a third zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso 126 zzso was present, consistent with recent molecular dynamics zzso This alternative yielded populations of 50% zzso zzso 162 zzso zzso zzso zzso 126 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso for the zzso zzso The spectral results indicate little variation of sugar zzso between T and zzso Small differences in zzso component zzso and characteristic spectral zzso however, do suggest some zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical shift correlation zzso zzso alternating chemical shifts and zzso zzso suggestive of zzso backbone zzso differences between zzso and AT zzso
