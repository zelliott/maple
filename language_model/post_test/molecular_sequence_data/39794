On zzso of a zzso the G protein zzso complex zzso away from the zzso on the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso The rate of zzso is influenced by the type of gamma zzso associated with the G zzso zzso zzso living cells expressing fluorescent protein zzso G proteins and zzso zzso receptors and G proteins in zzso used to identify mechanisms at the basis of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso gamma zzso with altered zzso zzso showed that the differences in the zzso zzso were not sufficient to explain the differential effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso were altered dramatically by mutating the C terminal tail region of the gamma zzso The zzso characteristics of these zzso suggest that after zzso zzso zzso retains contact with a zzso through the gamma zzso C terminal domain and that differential interaction of the activated zzso with this domain controls zzso zzso from the plasma zzso
