A zzso expression library constructed from zzso derived from adult stage zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened with pooled zzso from zzso zzso cases of human zzso zzso from the Indonesian island of zzso where zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso raised to zzso zzso fusion proteins from two of the most highly zzso clones identified a protein of Mr 70,000 in all stages examined zzso zzso and zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence from these two overlapping zzso identified the zzso protein as a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, and showed the closest similarity to the zzso expressed zzso shock zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and DNA from zzso zzso under stringent conditions identified a major transcript of zzso zzso and revealed the existence of a family of related zzso In zzso culture of zzso stages of zzso zzso at elevated temperatures zzso degrees zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso and a classic heat shock response in which five proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were exclusively zzso in zzso Analysis of zzso by Western zzso implied that zzso generated by infection with zzso zzso was directed at zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso with zzso fusion proteins for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that some individuals with zzso or zzso zzso did produce zzso which zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso responses were not generated in all individuals, indicating that this zzso would not be suitable for diagnostic zzso zzso with a zzso zzso fusion protein from zzso zzso showed zzso responses to zzso across the clinical spectrum of zzso zzso of the derived zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso and comparison of the zzso zzso of the products of the two zzso clones by Western zzso and zzso suggested that these zzso were located primarily at the C zzso of the zzso
