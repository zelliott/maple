We have isolated zzso to two zzso zzso M and alternative zzso M zzso from the mouse zzso Analysis of zzso DNA revealed these transcripts were derived from alternative zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso chain reactions revealed that both transcripts were expressed in the eye, though the alternative form was the major zzso In zzso zzso studies demonstrated that alternative zzso M zzso localized exclusively in the zzso cells in the zzso and expressed only after the opening of the eye, suggesting that these transcripts are related to the maintenance of the retinal structure or functions of matured zzso cells rather than the development or differentiation of retinal zzso
