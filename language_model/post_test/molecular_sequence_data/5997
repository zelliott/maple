Certain zzso zzso light chains zzso are responsible for marked disturbances of zzso zzso cell functions zzso syndrome, zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso inclusions containing zzso zzso are commonly found in plasma cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso In an attempt at understanding the zzso of zzso zzso we recently determined the first complete primary sequence of a zzso zzso responsible for the zzso We now report on the primary structure of three other zzso of the V zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso After zzso amplification, zzso zzso these zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were found to be highly zzso to the same zzso gene zzso These patients had numerous zzso zzso whereas the fourth patient, zzso had no zzso zzso The zzso from the latter patient was zzso to another zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences to previously reported zzso of the V zzso zzso zzso allowed identification of a number of unusual zzso acid zzso in the V region that had rarely or never been previously described at the corresponding zzso Some of these unusual zzso affect highly zzso zzso acids located either in an external loop zzso 30) or in inner zzso 48 and zzso and outer zzso 63 and zzso zzso that may be important for the structure and binding properties of the zzso These and several other zzso some of them shared with zzso zzso could induce zzso zzso and represent a zzso zzso zzso
