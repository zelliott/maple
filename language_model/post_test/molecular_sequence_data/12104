Recent studies on the induction of zzso gene expression by zzso have indicated that zzso forms part of a widely operative system of gene regulation by zzso Similar responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso have indicated that the action of these agents is closely connected with the mechanism of oxygen zzso To consider further the mechanisms underlying these responses, the effect of zzso compounds was tested on five genes which show zzso zzso erythropoietin, vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso In each case, the response to zzso was specifically inhibited by low doses of zzso zzso zzso This occurred irrespective of whether the hypoxic response was induction of gene expression zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of gene expression zzso In contrast, the induction of gene expression by zzso zzso or zzso was not inhibited by zzso The differential action of zzso on the response to zzso versus the response to zzso zzso or zzso must reflect a difference in the mechanism of action of these zzso which will require accommodation in any model of the zzso zzso Based on the known properties of zzso the implication of these findings is that the mechanism of oxygen sensing most probably involves the operation of a zzso zzso
