A 40 zzso acid sequence of the zzso structure of zzso coli zzso zzso is essential for zzso binding and encodes an zzso zzso that zzso with zzso raised against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The secondary structure of this sequence is predicted to be an zzso zzso that includes one zzso and eight zzso side chain zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso of a synthetic zzso model of this region zzso to zzso were zzso In addition, double zzso and zzso zzso were separately placed in the zzso on the zzso and zzso face, respectively, of the predicted zzso These zzso conserve the zzso character of each face and retain the potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso model demonstrate the potential for zzso zzso formation for the segment from zzso to zzso The behavior of the zzso in the zzso together with earlier data and zzso zzso presented here, suggests that one face of the putative zzso is an zzso region of the surface of the zzso where it contributes to the interaction with zzso zzso and that the specific sequence of the zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso
