zzso of human zzso with zzso zzso increases zzso at zzso of zzso as determined with zzso zzso zzso This specific modification is completely inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso promoted by the zzso inhibitor zzso A, making it possible to purify the two forms of zzso to zzso zzso overlay zzso with zzso zzso labeled with either zzso or zzso show that only zzso zzso interacts with zzso in total zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and when zzso In the absence of detergents, both forms of the isolated protein are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso filaments in zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The interaction affinity is high zzso approximately zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This interaction is also observed in zzso extracted with zzso but not with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso only in the presence of zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso can activate zzso zzso zzso binding site in zzso zzso regulation by both mechanisms may be important for proper cellular control of zzso linkages between the zzso zzso and the plasma zzso
