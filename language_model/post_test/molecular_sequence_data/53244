The outer and inner hair cells of the zzso zzso perform different zzso In response to changes in membrane potential, the zzso outer hair cell rapidly alters its length and zzso These mechanical changes, driven by putative molecular motors, are assumed to produce amplification of zzso in the zzso that are zzso by inner hair zzso Here we have identified an abundant complementary DNA from a zzso designated zzso which is specifically expressed in outer hair zzso zzso of the zzso protein show moderate sequence similarity to zzso and related zzso transport zzso zzso shape changes can be zzso in cultured human kidney cells that express zzso The mechanical response of outer hair cells to zzso change is accompanied by a zzso zzso which is zzso as zzso zzso We also demonstrate this zzso zzso in zzso kidney zzso We conclude that zzso is the motor protein of the cochlear outer hair zzso
