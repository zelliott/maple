In many zzso a specific DNA zzso zzso is required for zzso end joining zzso repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a zzso active zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso consisting of a zzso bound to a DNA end with a 3' zzso two metal zzso and an incoming zzso but, significantly, lacking a primer zzso This structure represents a zzso complex in a zzso intermediate zzso This zzso complex occurs in solution, stabilizing the zzso on DNA ends and promoting zzso extension of short incoming zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso contained in a zzso loop zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso by regulating binding of a second metal zzso in the active zzso We propose that this zzso intermediate zzso extension reactions involving critically short or zzso DNA ends, thus promoting break repair and minimizing sequence loss during zzso zzso
