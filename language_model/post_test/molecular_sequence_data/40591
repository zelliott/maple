zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides detailed data concerning the predicted zzso of this zzso and allows for a zzso approach to gene zzso Comparative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed a highly zzso zzso block of genes zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso a zzso zzso vaccine candidate against East Coast fever zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso designated zzso encodes a protein of limited zzso acid sequence identity zzso to zzso zzso zzso were produced against zzso zzso and were used to demonstrate expression of zzso in zzso and zzso stages of the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso in zzso were increased zzso in comparison to zzso a previously identified gene zzso an zzso stage surface zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons between the zzso strain and two attenuated and virulent strains from Argentina and Australia revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in zzso among these geographically and zzso divergent zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso Additional zzso comparisons show that the zzso gene locus is also zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso While not identifiable through zzso acid or zzso sequence zzso the zzso gene order within this locus in multiple zzso may suggest a critical function adapted for each zzso unique host and zzso
