Although the zzso role of zzso zzso in males remains largely unknown, there is limited evidence that the zzso might be a candidate source and target of zzso in zzso as zzso transcripts are detected in the zzso zzso and it contains zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso acts as a source and target tissue of zzso we zzso the expression pattern and cellular zzso of both zzso and its own zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso during zzso development by molecular and zzso zzso zzso were collected from zzso zzso and partial zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of human zzso were zzso zzso expression increased through zzso zzso while zzso expression changed little during zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were restricted to the zzso cells, whereas both zzso cells and zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso was expressed in the zzso as an zzso form (the expected size of zzso but not as the zzso mature form, during development because of a lack of the zzso required for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was detected at all stages as specific bands of 75 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, we provide evidence for expression of zzso zzso system in the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso act as a source and possible target tissue of zzso
