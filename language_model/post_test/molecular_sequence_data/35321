The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a highly zzso zzso region zzso whose structure and function remain zzso Using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso sequence zzso mass zzso and zzso we show that the zzso domain is not a zzso plant zzso zzso finger, as previously proposed, but binds an additional zinc atom through the region zzso to the putative zzso zzso The zzso domain and the preceding zzso interact and mutually stabilize each other, zzso a cooperative zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso and the zzso domain can interact with zzso but found that the zzso does not participate in zzso
