zzso of the zzso stabilized complex of alpha zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the archetype of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso complexes, is associated with structural zzso of the alpha zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso An approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso alpha zzso complexes are biologically active, possessing zzso activity and zzso increases in expression of the alpha zzso gene in human zzso and zzso This suggested that structural zzso of the alpha zzso zzso during formation of a complex with zzso exposes a domain that is recognized by a specific cell surface zzso or zzso To test this hypothesis, the known three-dimensional structure of alpha zzso and comparisons of the primary structures of the zzso were used to select a potentially zzso exposed and highly zzso region in the zzso form of alpha zzso as a candidate zzso zzso fragment, zzso acids zzso We show here that synthetic peptides based on the sequence of this region bind specifically and zzso to human zzso cells and human zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso M, zzso X zzso plasma membrane receptors per zzso and mediate increases in synthesis of alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is blocked by alpha zzso complexes, zzso III zzso zzso complexes, alpha zzso zzso zzso G complexes, and, to a lesser extent, complement component C1 zzso complexes, but not by the corresponding native zzso zzso of zzso zzso is also blocked by peptides with sequence corresponding to zzso fragments of the zzso AT III and alpha zzso but not by peptides having the sequence of the extreme zzso zzso of alpha zzso The results also show that zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso alpha zzso zzso Thus, these studies demonstrate an abundant, relatively zzso cell surface zzso which recognizes zzso complexes zzso zzso This zzso is capable of modulating the production of at least one of the zzso alpha zzso Since the zzso specificity is similar to that previously described for in zzso clearance of zzso complexes, the SEC zzso may also be involved in the clearance of certain zzso zzso
