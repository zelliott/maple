The structures of two crystal forms zzso I, zzso a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso form II, zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A and beta zzso zzso 6 degrees ) of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso F have been solved by the zzso zzso Form I has been refined at a resolution of zzso A to an R value of zzso and includes 32 water zzso Form II includes 86 water molecules and has been refined at zzso A resolution to an R value of zzso In form II, there are three molecules in the zzso unit with the molecules related by a zzso 32 symmetry zzso In both crystal forms, it was found that only a few zzso effectively participate in the formation of zzso contacts along both the zzso zzso I) and the zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso The crystal structure of the form II crystal is compared with those of other zzso molecules from zzso zzso From this comparison, a similarity in the core region, which is composed of aromatic zzso and includes the active zzso has been zzso
