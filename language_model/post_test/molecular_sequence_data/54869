The lethal group of zzso zzso zzso includes type I zzso zzso zzso type II zzso zzso zzso type III zzso zzso zzso and type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also used to be classified in the zzso zzso Recently, zzso in a gene zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso patients with zzso zzso but no zzso zzso 

Because of clinical and zzso similarities between zzso zzso and the other lethal types of zzso the authors decided to investigate zzso in a cohort of fetuses with the lethal forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso diagnosed cases of zzso zzso Fifteen fetuses were zzso A zzso approach was zzso For zzso families and for those with zzso zzso a zzso analysis around the gene locus was first performed, and, for the others, all the coding zzso of zzso were directly zzso 

Using the zzso approach for two families, the authors excluded the zzso region as a candidate for zzso zzso sequencing of zzso in the other 13 cases showed a zzso zzso in zzso 8 zzso in only one zzso case closely related to the type III zzso 

The findings show that zzso in zzso can also be responsible for a lethal form of zzso and provide the molecular basis for the zzso zzso zzso
