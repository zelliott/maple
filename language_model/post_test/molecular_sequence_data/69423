zzso products amplified with the zzso zzso and zzso and template DNA from various zzso species showed differences in molecular zzso By sequencing the zzso products, we found that the DNA zzso from zzso tuberculosis and that of zzso zzso have different DNA zzso The former was zzso zzso composed of 27 A, 54 C, 57 G, and 26 zzso while the latter was 109 zzso composed of 22 A, 37 C, 34 G, and 16 zzso We compared these sequences and selected a zzso sequence unique to zzso zzso and used as primer zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed from the complementary sequence of zzso which is located about zzso b downstream of zzso zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso and template DNA of various zzso showed that positive results were only with the template DNA from zzso zzso zzso DNA from those other than zzso but appear in zzso were tested in zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso None of them showed positive zzso zzso of the zzso products was determined with a specific probe zzso which was constructed using a sequence between zzso and zzso to confirm the specificity of zzso by Southern zzso Only the products from zzso zzso zzso with the probe zzso indicating the specificity of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
