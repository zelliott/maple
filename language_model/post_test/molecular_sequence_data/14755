In this study, we report the analysis of zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso of three breeds: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified three new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the three goat breeds and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso goat zzso At zzso zzso zzso AB and zzso zzso were found in the three goat zzso At zzso zzso zzso and CT zzso were found in zzso and zzso goat zzso After comparing zzso distribution within the three goat breeds, zzso had conspicuous differences from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso locus was in zzso zzso at zzso locus in the three goat breeds zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso the zzso locus was in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso goat breeds zzso zzso zzso Association of zzso with litter size was done at zzso locus in the three goat zzso The result showed that AA zzso had remarkable litter size at zzso locus in the three goat breeds zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso gene is a strong candidate gene that affects litter size in zzso
