The zzso zzso of expressed genes provide useful information for a candidate gene approach to the genes responsible for genetic zzso A large set of randomly isolated zzso zzso by partial sequencing can serve as a resource for zzso and zzso these disease zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we examined the zzso zzso of 217 human zzso zzso with independent novel sequence tags at the 3' end zzso Among them, we determined the zzso of 50 zzso zzso sequencing of these from the zzso ends indicated that 39 zzso still can be produced for new zzso These zzso with identified zzso zzso are powerful tools that can be used to help zzso the genes responsible for zzso skin zzso
