The ABC zzso zzso is recognized as an zzso exporter of zzso substances as well as an increasing variety of zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified with a single zzso acid substitution in the zzso loop zzso Because this zzso zzso acid is highly zzso among zzso zzso and is located in zzso loop 3 zzso we investigated the impact of this zzso on human and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso or human zzso zzso exhibit substantially reduced zzso coupled with impaired plasma membrane zzso To understand the molecular basis for the zzso zzso we developed a zzso model of zzso zzso The zzso model suggested that the bulky zzso substitution disrupted zzso zzso zzso dynamic simulations of a zzso of human or zzso zzso containing a zzso substitution indicated altered zzso coupled with reduced zzso zzso zzso challenge coupled with circular zzso revealed that the zzso substitution disrupted the ability of this zzso of zzso to readily form an zzso Furthermore, expression and plasma membrane zzso of these zzso zzso proteins are mostly rescued by growing cells at zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso is closely related to zzso we extended this by engineering certain zzso zzso zzso and we showed they zzso human and zzso zzso Altogether, our studies provide the first evidence for a zzso domain in zzso of zzso that is crucial in ensuring its proper plasma membrane zzso
