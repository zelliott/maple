The role of zzso protein zzso in the process of zzso assembly during zzso of zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso led to a reduction in binding to zzso a newly identified zzso of zzso zzso a reduction of zzso zzso at the leading edge, and a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso to sites of new zzso zzso and zzso with zzso at the leading zzso zzso increases zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the cortical membrane upon uniform zzso stimulation in a time course that parallels zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit multiple zzso formation and defects in zzso efficiency due to frequent changes of zzso zzso expression of zzso by expressing a hairpin zzso zzso zzso construct resulted in more polarized cells that exhibit a delayed response to a new zzso source due to delayed extension of zzso toward the new zzso These results suggest that zzso is required for new zzso zzso and prompt zzso of cells toward a new zzso by initiating localized bursts of zzso zzso and/or zzso
