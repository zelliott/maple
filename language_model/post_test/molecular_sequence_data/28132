The zzso zzso zzso gene was identified and shown to be essential for symbiotic and zzso zzso nitrogen zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein which may be involved in a zzso process zzso zzso essential for zzso zzso This gene was localized downstream of zzso and its expression was dependent on the zzso promoter, providing evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis of the unusually long, zzso leader region between the zzso promoter and the zzso structural gene did not reveal the presence of a zzso or fix gene that was absolutely essential for nitrogen zzso However, a short open reading frame zzso within this region zzso a zzso of 35 zzso acids zzso was shown to be efficiently zzso zzso deletion of a zzso DNA zzso covering zzso resulted in a zzso reduction of the zzso zzso level, which in turn also reduced the nitrogen fixation activity of this zzso This suggests a possible zzso control mechanism for the expression of the zzso zzso involving the stabilization of zzso zzso by zzso actively translating zzso
