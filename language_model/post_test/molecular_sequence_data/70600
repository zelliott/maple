The geographical distribution of the zzso family zzso is essentially zzso with 18 species in southern Africa, 10 in the northeastern Atlantic, and only 11 species elsewhere (although 4 of these do occur in the zzso One possible explanation for this distribution is the suggestion of a recent, perhaps Early zzso migration from southern Africa zzso We tested this hypothesis by constructing a molecular zzso derived from partial sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained from 34 of the 38 zzso zzso Five species of zzso and 3 of zzso were included as potential zzso Analysis revealed that two zzso zzso are represented in the northeastern zzso The typical European zzso zzso zzso zzso form a single zzso within which there is little molecular zzso but are distant from all other zzso thus zzso the idea of recent southern zzso From the limited fossil record and estimated rates of molecular zzso we suggest that zzso zzso may have originated at least as early as the Upper zzso and that its northern distribution may have been achieved at the same zzso The second zzso zzso present in the northeastern Atlantic is the zzso zzso of which the single species zzso zzso extends from West Africa to the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso is indeed a member of an otherwise southern African zzso and may have attained its present distribution more recently, during the zzso The geographical origin of the family remains zzso but a zzso radiation in southern zzso is zzso By zzso zzso characters on our molecular tree, we consider the evolution of shell zzso and zzso zzso We also discuss the zzso zzso of the zzso and present some evidence that the family may not be zzso
