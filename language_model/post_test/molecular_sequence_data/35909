zzso zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso II were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and the zzso acid sequence of the zzso half of the protein was zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso II, the largest zzso of zzso zzso zzso II contains a unique repetitive tail domain at its zzso zzso It consists of 24 highly zzso zzso repeats, with a consensus sequence of zzso In addition to the tail domain, five segments of the deduced primary structure show zzso 50% sequence identity with either zzso or mouse zzso zzso blots show that zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso species of approximately 6 zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso raised against the tail domain lighted up a single protein band of 200 zzso Interestingly, expression of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II appears to be under zzso zzso The zzso of its zzso showed a zzso increase during the first 3 h of development, followed by a steady decrease during the next 6 zzso zzso began to accumulate a higher level of the zzso zzso II zzso after 9 h of zzso When cells were treated with low zzso of zzso zzso to stimulate the zzso process, the pattern of zzso zzso moved 3 h ahead, but otherwise remained similar to that of control zzso
