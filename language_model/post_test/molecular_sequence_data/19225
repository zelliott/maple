zzso is a zzso protein predominantly expressed in excitable zzso that associates with and regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 68 zzso however, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso activity are not fully zzso The objectives of this study were to characterize zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso and knockout zzso adult mouse zzso zzso and investigate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso currents using the zzso zzso zzso A zzso representing the 19 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was introduced into the interior of zzso zzso and zzso zzso through the patch zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 4 zzso reduced the currents in zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso at zzso increased currents in zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso to a level above that seen in the absence of zzso
