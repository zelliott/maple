zzso at a single zzso zzso are responsible for causing human zzso zzso zzso kidney disease zzso Recent studies suggest that the zzso disease might result from defects in zzso cell zzso but how the zzso zzso acid zzso protein zzso by the longest open reading frame of this zzso complex gene may regulate this process is zzso Using novel in zzso expression systems, we show that the zzso gene product zzso zzso a complicated pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso at a probable zzso zzso site produces a large zzso domain that is zzso to the zzso stalk by zzso zzso This zzso is then shed from the primary zzso by zzso of a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, resulting in zzso release of an zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is similarly shed from the primary zzso upon zzso of zzso This is the first known example of this process involving a protein of the primary zzso and suggests a novel mechanism zzso proteins that zzso to this structure may function as zzso signaling zzso zzso release from the primary zzso into the zzso may be a mechanism to distribute signal to zzso targets using zzso
