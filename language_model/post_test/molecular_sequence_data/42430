zzso relationships among the 16 extant zzso of zzso (the New World zzso were examined using aligned zzso gene sequences from 19 New World monkeys (representing all 16 extant zzso zzso and seven zzso (one Old World monkey and six zzso and zzso as the zzso The consensus maximum zzso tree found for these zzso sequences and the levels of support from zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso in this tree, provided strong evidence for a zzso zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute family zzso In turn, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute tribe zzso tribes zzso and zzso zzso constitute zzso zzso tribes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso constitute family zzso The two families zzso and zzso constitute the zzso the only extant zzso of zzso zzso The zzso relationships of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso is not as well supported by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso these relationships are not incorporated in the proposed zzso zzso On determining branch lengths for the zzso zzso tree from only the more freely evolving zzso sequences at the zzso locus and taking the reference age of 35 million years ago zzso for the New World zzso branch point, we estimated the age of the zzso branch point as about 20 zzso and the ages of the next branch points, those between the zzso in each family, as zzso zzso
