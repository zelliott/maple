A novel stationary zzso protein has been identified in the zzso protein extract of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing data were used to identify likely genes for zzso of the protein in the complete zzso sequences of various zzso zzso The corresponding genes were identified and zzso The genes zzso a protein ranging from 83 to 92 zzso acids in zzso with a calculated zzso ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso acid sequences of the genes were highly zzso even between members belonging to the different zzso zzso The zzso secondary structure of the protein indicates it consists of four large zzso regions separated by short coiled zzso We propose this protein as a candidate regulator of gene expression in stationary zzso
