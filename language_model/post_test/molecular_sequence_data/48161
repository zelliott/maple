The zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulates the growth of zzso zzso cultivated under zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso possesses a single zzso transport system that belongs to the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso of zzso Through zzso zzso a zzso deficient in zzso transport was zzso We identified two zzso zzso and zzso grouped in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is strongly regulated by the external zzso of the zzso The zzso gene codes for the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which presents two striking features: zzso a fusion between the regions zzso the zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain zzso and zzso a swapping of the zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso displays a high affinity towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is an zzso whose activity is tightly regulated by external zzso leading the zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso to be under dual control at the zzso and genetic zzso A protein presenting the characteristics predicted for zzso was detected in the membrane fraction of zzso zzso The fusion between the zzso and the zzso is the first example of a new organization within zzso ABC zzso
