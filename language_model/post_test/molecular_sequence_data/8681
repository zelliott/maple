The zzso sequences of the outer surface protein C gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso representing six different restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso groups were determined, and the deduced zzso acid sequences were aligned in comparison with the previously published zzso protein zzso The sequence similarity analysis revealed the high sequence zzso of zzso zzso and the degree of zzso acid similarity ranged from zzso to zzso among 25 zzso It has been reported that the representatives belonging to the three species of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso acid sequence motif at positions 23 to 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso sequences of zzso zzso group IV, zzso and VI zzso revealed that a sequence motif of all the zzso was quite similar to that of zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso protein sequences also showed that most of the Japanese zzso were closely related to the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group IV species is zzso among clinical zzso of zzso disease patients, zzso zzso and adult ticks in zzso Although the zzso differed from type strains of the three delineated zzso in genetic and zzso zzso it is likely that the zzso zzso within the species zzso zzso the representatives of zzso groups IV, zzso and VI appear to have evolved within zzso zzso and to have adapted to an zzso habitat, and there appeared to be a sufficient ecological pressure to allow bacterial species level zzso
