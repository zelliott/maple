A zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso of the human lung zzso cell zzso line zzso was established by zzso selection in increasing zzso of zzso Different levels of zzso were observed towards zzso zzso zzso zzso and, somewhat unexpectedly, zzso Resistance was stable for at least 3 months in culture in the absence of zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso and Western zzso and a direct zzso role for zzso zzso in the resistant zzso was established by zzso with an zzso specific zzso zzso A modified zzso procedure was necessary for the resistant zzso zzso The resistant population displays zzso zzso with respect to resistance zzso A higher frequency of double minute zzso was observed in zzso when compared with the parental cell zzso
