A clone containing the DNA repair gene zzso of zzso zzso was identified from a zzso zzso DNA library using the zzso zzso zzso were screened for resistance to zzso methane zzso zzso A DNA zzso that zzso the zzso zzso was zzso by monitoring its ability to transform the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cloned DNA indicated that the size of the zzso gene is approximately zzso zzso The identity of the zzso gene was verified by restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso to three different zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso DNA and zzso of the zzso gene indicated that it has an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with a 69 zzso zzso in the middle of the zzso Two zzso initiation sites located around 73 zzso and 290 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso were identified by primer extension zzso Northern analysis revealed that the nature transcript of the zzso gene was about zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso is deduced to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 54 zzso The proposed zzso has zzso identity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and contains two unique zinc finger motifs for zzso acid zzso zzso between the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso gene encodes a protein which is involved in zzso repair, rather than zzso zzso
