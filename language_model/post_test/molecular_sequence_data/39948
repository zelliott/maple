zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso which regulates the trafficking of zzso to the secondary zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although both zzso possess similar affinities for the zzso and similar abilities to promote G protein zzso and zzso they share only zzso sequence zzso Here, we show that substituting zzso six zzso acids of zzso zzso for the corresponding zzso domain of zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso that exhibits high affinity binding and G protein zzso of zzso These data demonstrate that despite dissimilar zzso the zzso terminal zzso of these two zzso is capable of performing similar roles resulting in zzso zzso
