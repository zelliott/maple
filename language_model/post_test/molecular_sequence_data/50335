zzso is a zzso zzso zzso diphtheria zzso fusion protein which has been shown to be selectively toxic to cells expressing the zzso zzso In this report, we have used zzso and zzso deletion zzso to study the role of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso component of zzso in the intoxication zzso We demonstrate that deletion of the zzso 15 zzso acids of the fusion toxin leads to loss of zzso The substitution of zzso with either zzso Ala or zzso results in a greater than zzso decrease in zzso activity of the respective zzso fusion zzso In addition, substitution of zzso with either Ala or zzso results in a similar loss of zzso zzso All of these zzso forms of the zzso fusion toxin demonstrate a significant decrease in binding affinity zzso to the zzso zzso in a competitive zzso binding zzso In marked contrast, however, the substitution of zzso with zzso results in a zzso increase in zzso potency and binding affinity to zzso zzso bearing cells in zzso
