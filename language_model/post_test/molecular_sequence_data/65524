We report evidence that zzso and zzso two previously identified components of the zzso zzso spore coat, are produced zzso in the mother cell chamber of the zzso cell under the control of zzso and zzso and immediately assembled around the forming zzso In the coat, the two proteins interact to form a coat component of 23 zzso The zzso interaction was not detected in two zzso zzso suggesting that it occurs only in zzso zzso zzso forms of both zzso and zzso failed to be assembled at the surface of the developing spore and accumulated in the mother cell compartment of cells zzso for zzso In contrast, neither zzso nor zzso accumulated in the mother cell compartment of cells zzso for zzso These results suggest that zzso is required to protect both zzso and zzso in the mother cell compartment of the zzso and that zzso is needed to allow their assembly and subsequent interaction at the spore zzso
