Growth hormone plays important roles in various zzso processes such as growth, zzso and zzso In this study, two zzso zzso growth hormone zzso zzso were isolated from the liver of zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso were zzso and zzso in length and named zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared zzso similarity in zzso sequences and zzso similarity in deduced zzso acid zzso zzso it was presumed that they were two different zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were different from those of other zzso For example, zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were, respectively, zzso and zzso while it was zzso for zzso in other zzso Similar to other fish species, zzso and zzso were expressed in brain, zzso liver, muscle, zzso zzso stomach, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The expression levels were the highest in zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression levels of zzso in most female fish zzso were higher than those in male zzso No significant difference in zzso expression was found in all the zzso in male and female of zzso zzso Under zzso condition, the expressions of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso in liver, while the expression of zzso remained zzso This observation would contribute to understanding the evolution of the zzso family in further investigation of growth regulation of zzso zzso
