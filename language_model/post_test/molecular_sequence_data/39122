B cells are important in the development of zzso disorders by mechanisms involving zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso family that is a potent zzso of B cells in zzso and in zzso Here we identify two receptors for zzso and demonstrate a relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso animals zzso zzso in zzso cells develop symptoms characteristic of systemic lupus zzso zzso and expand a rare population of zzso zzso zzso In addition, circulating zzso is more abundant in zzso and zzso mice during the onset and progression of zzso We have identified two zzso zzso family members, zzso and zzso that bind zzso Treatment of zzso mice with soluble zzso fusion protein zzso the development of zzso and zzso survival of the zzso These findings demonstrate the involvement of zzso and its receptors in the development of zzso and identify zzso as a promising treatment of zzso disease in zzso
