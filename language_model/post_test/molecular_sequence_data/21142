The genetic variation and evolutionary mechanisms of broad bean zzso virus 2 zzso were studied by zzso sequence analysis of four zzso regions of 30 zzso from different zzso zzso diversity was high zzso for a plant zzso zzso and genetic structure analyses showed low population zzso suggesting a significant gene flow between distant geographic zzso Analysis of synonymous and zzso zzso showed different negative selection pressures for different parts of the coding regions, but no positive selection was zzso Several zzso detection methods showed that some zzso zzso might have originated from zzso or zzso
