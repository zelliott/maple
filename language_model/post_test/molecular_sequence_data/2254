Although beta zzso zzso is zzso during zzso the beta zzso promoter zzso zzso expression when joined to zzso genes zzso into a variety of different cell backgrounds, including differentiated zzso zzso promoter activity is dependent upon the binding of a ubiquitous factor to the zzso zzso Loss or reduction in factor binding zzso with a major reduction in promoter activity both in zzso and in zzso The binding domain covers approximately 23 base pairs as determined by zzso zzso zzso of A and G zzso in and adjacent to the zzso box results in the loss of factor zzso zzso across the binding domain indicate that the sequence zzso within the domain is sufficient as a recognition sequence for factor zzso This binding is not zzso by the alpha cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate a zzso single band of similar mobility in nuclear extracts from various cells and zzso with the exception of zzso zzso The prevalence of the factor and its recognition sequence in a variety of promoters suggests that this factor has a common role in the zzso zzso of several zzso zzso
