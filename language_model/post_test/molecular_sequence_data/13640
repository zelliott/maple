zzso human zzso zzso were detected by zzso using zzso consensus zzso zzso and zzso To determine the underlying zzso zzso zzso products were subsequently analyzed employing a combination of restriction zzso length zzso zzso and zzso with a generic zzso probe that binds to a zzso region located close to the zzso site within the zzso zzso Using zzso sequence analysis, the lengths of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restriction fragments zzso with the generic probe were zzso revealing distinct patterns for each of the 45 zzso zzso zzso This method is superior to zzso analysis since it is not impaired by large amounts of restriction fragments resulting from zzso zzso zzso Moreover, considering clinical specimens containing two or three different zzso types, direct sequencing of zzso products will be inconclusive, and the increased number of restriction fragments will complicate interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the generic probe, however, results in the appearance of, at most, 2 or 3 bands per restriction zzso digest and thus zzso identification of the underlying zzso zzso
