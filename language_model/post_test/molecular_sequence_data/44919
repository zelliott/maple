zzso are characteristic zzso components of plasma cell zzso especially enriched in the zzso and zzso In some diseases involving the zzso in particular motor zzso associated with zzso block, zzso zzso against zzso zzso have been implicated as a zzso zzso In order to study the zzso distribution in peripheral nerves we have investigated its in zzso zzso using a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and production of the zzso zzso was made by common protocols and binding specificity was investigated by using structurally related zzso and modified zzso The result showed that an alpha 2-3 bound zzso acid together with a terminal zzso zzso were essential for zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in rat zzso and zzso spinal roots was investigated by conventional zzso zzso zzso was the same in both roots and appeared like a finely zzso in places zzso material confined to zzso zzso to zzso sheath zzso end segments and to some extent to the zzso zzso cell zzso all of these structures are likely to be the target for zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso gaps and zzso contours showed a weak zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the zzso of zzso and the zzso end segments of the zzso zzso might indicate a role of zzso as zzso zzso
