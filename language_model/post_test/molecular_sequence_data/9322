zzso resistance has become a global public health problem, thus there is a need to develop a new class of zzso Natural zzso peptides have got an increasing attention as potential therapeutic zzso zzso peptides are small zzso peptides with broad zzso zzso They can serve as critical defense molecules protecting the host from the invasion of zzso Even though they possess a different mode of action compared to traditional zzso zzso peptides couldn't go into the drug markets because of problems in application such as zzso zzso to zzso manufacturing cost, size, and molecular zzso Nevertheless, zzso peptides can be new hope in developing novel, effective and safe zzso without zzso zzso Thus, it is necessary to discover new zzso sources in nature and study their structures and zzso properties more in zzso
