Taking advantage of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have been able to zzso the zzso zzso sequence of zzso children in circulating zzso Using this approach, we have also identified 3 novel zzso in zzso from liver and zzso of two zzso One zzso detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment, is a C to T transition in the zzso zzso site of zzso 10, which resulted in the skipping of zzso 11 with the premature termination of zzso translation downstream from zzso 12 zzso zzso The other two zzso are zzso zzso in zzso 10 and 11 zzso zzso and zzso The present study supports the view that circulating zzso give easy access to zzso gene transcripts whose zzso sequence is identical to that reported in liver and therefore represent a useful tool for molecular genetic studies in zzso
