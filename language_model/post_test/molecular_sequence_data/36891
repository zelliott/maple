At least six DNA zzso have been identified during zzso of extracts from the zzso zzso zzso Three of those, DNA zzso B, C, and D, have been further zzso and zzso DNA zzso B and C zzso with DNA zzso delta through several zzso steps, but were separated from the zzso by zzso zzso DNA zzso D zzso with zzso Factor C over seven zzso steps, and was only separated from it by zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso All three zzso are DNA dependent zzso with zzso values for zzso of 190 zzso 325 zzso and 60 zzso for DNA zzso B, C, and D, zzso Their DNA zzso activities are zzso They are zzso zzso and have pH zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of 1-2 zzso However, they differ in the zzso requirement for zzso zzso Whereas all three zzso preferred zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso DNA zzso C also used zzso but not zzso On the other hand, DNA zzso D used zzso but not zzso and DNA zzso B used neither zzso as zzso These studies allowed us to conclude that DNA zzso B, C, and D are not only distinct zzso but also different from two previously identified zzso DNA zzso the zzso protein and zzso zzso
