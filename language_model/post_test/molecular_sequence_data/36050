The zzso zzso zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso and zzso produce psychosis in humans and abnormal zzso in zzso zzso and zzso rat cortical zzso We show that zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 20 zzso induce zzso zzso and zzso heat shock protein in these zzso injured zzso and zzso also zzso zzso in injured zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso drug induced injury occurs in 30 day and older rats, but not in zzso day old rats, and is prevented by prior administration of the antipsychotic drugs zzso and zzso Since zzso and zzso block zzso and zzso zzso and since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevent the injury produced by zzso zzso and zzso future studies will be needed to determine whether zzso zzso zzso or other receptors mediate the zzso
