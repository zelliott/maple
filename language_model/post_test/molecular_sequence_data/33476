Homer proteins have recently been identified as novel zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release channels in heart and skeletal muscle, through an zzso domain which binds to zzso regions in target zzso Many Homer proteins can also zzso through a zzso domain that allows their zzso In other zzso especially zzso Homer anchors proteins embedded in the surface membrane to the zzso release channel in the zzso zzso and can anchor membrane or zzso proteins to the zzso Although this zzso aspect of Homer function has not been extensively investigated in muscle, there are consensus sequences for Homer binding in the zzso and on many of the proteins that it interacts with in the massive zzso zzso channel zzso In this review we explore the potential of Homer to contribute to a variety of cell processes in muscle and zzso that also involve zzso zzso
