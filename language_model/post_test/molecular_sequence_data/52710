zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Although the zzso has been characterized and cloned from a number of sources, until now no three-dimensional structure has been determined for this zzso Although the utility of this zzso as a drug target against zzso zzso is yet to be established, the critical role played by zzso in the long slender zzso form of the related zzso zzso zzso makes it a viable drug target against sleeping zzso 

The zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined by zzso anomalous zzso zzso techniques, and used to solve the zzso A zzso structure in complex with zzso Each 39 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parts of both zzso share structural similarity with plant zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso like, density buried inside the zzso domain indicates a possible zzso modification with an associated biological zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso is the first structure of this zzso from any source and, in view of the sequence identity of zzso serves as a valid model for the zzso zzso zzso The differences between the human and zzso zzso are extensive, with only zzso sequence identity between the zzso and host zzso and support the feasibility of exploiting the zzso site to develop selective zzso against zzso zzso The structure also offers a plausible explanation for the observed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso oxide, the active form of the zzso drugs zzso and zzso
