The zzso gene of zzso zzso is large and genetically zzso Five partly independent zzso groups are uncovered by several viable and lethal zzso at the zzso At least 15 zzso signals have been detected by Northern zzso zzso One of them, zzso derived from a 75 zzso primary transcript, has been proposed as the carrier of zzso function, based on the large size of its precursor and its tissue zzso We here provide direct evidence that zzso is the zzso zzso A facile and generally zzso selection scheme for the isolation of zzso zzso zzso was applied to map two lethal zzso point zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA by the zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing of the amplified zzso revealed the presence of zzso that lead to zzso of the zzso open reading zzso The zzso rate observed in the zzso locus is within the range of rates that have been determined in a few other zzso zzso
