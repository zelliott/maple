The modification of zzso zzso in proteins by addition of single zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in cell zzso However, understanding the cellular mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso has been challenging due to the difficulty in detection and zzso of this zzso Mass zzso multiplex quantitative approaches have been successfully employed to measure relative zzso levels using zzso induced zzso zzso However, zzso modifications such as zzso are lost prior to fragmentation of the zzso backbone in conventional zzso often preventing correct zzso zzso zzso of the modified site, and as a result, relative zzso Compared to zzso zzso Transfer zzso zzso preserves zzso zzso modifications zzso and allows direct mapping of zzso zzso This is the first report to assess the utility of combining zzso zzso tandem mass tag zzso labeling and zzso for relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of both labeled and zzso peptides from bovine zzso zzso at least one zzso containing modification site in each of the protein zzso in addition to a multitude of other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso labeled peptides produced four unique reporter zzso that could be used for relative zzso zzso reporter zzso ratios measured by zzso had similar accuracy and precision as those obtained by conventional zzso zzso When applied to zzso or otherwise modified zzso zzso was the only zzso method which consistently provided confident sequence zzso zzso zzso and quantitative information, all in the same zzso This suggests that zzso zzso can be complementary to traditional zzso approaches when used for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of modified zzso
