We have expanded our description of the energy landscape for folding of the zzso domain of chicken zzso by a detailed structural characterization of its zzso state ensemble zzso This zzso is significantly populated under mildly zzso conditions in equilibrium with the folded zzso Evidence from zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso experiments on zzso zzso protein suggests the presence of zzso whose residual structure bears some zzso to the structure of the folding transition state of this zzso zzso analysis in a zzso with an zzso non-native zzso tendency shows a significant amount of local non-native structure in the zzso while the overall characteristics of the zzso are zzso zzso with recent theoretical predictions of zzso domain folding reactions reveals an interesting correlation with the predicted early zzso Based on these results and recent data from other systems, we propose that the zzso of a protein will resemble the intermediate or transition state of its nearest zzso step, as a consequence of simple energetic and kinetic zzso
