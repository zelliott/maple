The application of zzso molecular biology has lead to remarkable advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of cell function in general and of the polarized zzso zzso cell in zzso This article focuses on some of the advances made towards determining the contribution of zzso hormone gene regulation to the regulation of zzso events in the zzso zzso Application of these techniques to other zzso processes involved in zzso hormone physiology such as zzso zzso in the regulated zzso zzso and zzso processing have been equally zzso For example, many of the key zzso in the zzso hormone processing cascade have been cloned and are being studied at a molecular zzso We have focused this article on the SS and zzso peptides because of their known zzso importance and zzso and the depth of analysis accomplished to zzso Studies using SS and zzso as models have established principals that cover the spectrum of zzso regulation of gene activity to the identification of a single zzso acid zzso responsible for zzso induction of SS gene zzso Many genes in the zzso zzso system have been cloned and the article by zzso zzso zzso in this zzso discusses progress made in understanding the complex regulation of the zzso zzso We anticipate similar advances in studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso Y, whose genes have been cloned and initially zzso Finally, as outlined in this article, the mechanisms of regulation of a specific gene often differ between sites of zzso even within the zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso mechanisms regulating gene expression and other processes in zzso zzso cells await novel methods to maintain and zzso these zzso These studies will almost certainly involve new and creative uses of zzso molecular zzso
