In order to find, and zzso novel genes required for regulation of zzso in the cerebral cortex, we performed a genetic screen in zzso As the result of this screen, we created a new mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso is due to an zzso into a zzso family zzso zzso zzso Mice zzso for the zzso zzso have zzso zzso fail to thrive in the zzso period and have defects in central nervous system zzso The defects in central nervous system development are particularly prominent in the cerebral cortex, which is zzso smaller than in zzso zzso A large reduction in the size of the cortical plate was already apparent during zzso zzso mice show a lack of large zzso cells in layer V of the cortex, which is reflected in a reduction in the number of zzso zzso in this layer during zzso zzso zzso mice also show a reduction in the number of zzso zzso throughout the zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an essential component of a genetic cascade regulating cell differentiation in the cortex, probably acting in a zzso complex regulating zzso structure during zzso
