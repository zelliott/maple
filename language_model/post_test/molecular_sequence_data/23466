The solution structures of two 27 zzso zzso zzso and their complexes with zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso of the zzso region from zzso coli zzso P zzso a zzso zzso changing the identity of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso double zzso changing only the zzso zzso zzso calculated from zzso constraints show that the zzso zzso adopt different zzso In the zzso zzso double zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso stem is found to be shifted in the zzso by one zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso is used as a zzso probe for zzso binding sites because both complexes have zzso symmetry and have similar zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were used to locate the site of zzso binding to both zzso zzso The metal zzso binds in the major groove near a zzso loop in both zzso but is shifted 3' by about one base pair in the double zzso The change of the metal zzso binding site is compared with results obtained on corresponding zzso zzso P zzso molecules as reported by Harris and co-workers zzso 1, zzso
