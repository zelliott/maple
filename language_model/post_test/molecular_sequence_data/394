Iron zzso and zzso in plants are important processes for both plant and human nutrition, whereas relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of iron transport within the plant zzso Several reports have shown that yellow stripe 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Among the 18 zzso genes in rice zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids containing 13 putative zzso zzso An zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion was localized to the plasma membrane when zzso expressed in onion zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso acid, but not zzso zzso acid, or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed more zzso transcripts in flowers than in shoots or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in zzso zzso including the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso zzso the inner zzso of crown roots, and zzso zzso and companion cells at the zzso part of every leaf zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso involved in the zzso of iron in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
