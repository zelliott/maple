zzso zzso alter the composition of zzso and play crucial roles in transcription, zzso zzso DNA repair, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso lineages occurs on a background of zzso architecture that shows global similarities from sponges to zzso but the zzso zzso zzso a member of the sister group to zzso exhibits profound modification of this ancestral zzso 

We show that a zzso complement of 47 gene zzso encodes 31 zzso zzso grouped in distinct sets of zzso expression profiles throughout the life zzso A particularly diverse array of 15 zzso zzso zzso was uncovered, including a zzso zzso the first zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso Universal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present but zzso zzso lacks zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso encodes many zzso and zzso zzso and the repertoire of zzso zzso is expanded through alternative zzso zzso regulating the number of zzso zzso zzso in the functionally important zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso identified 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso modifications zzso and showed that hallmark zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were present in zzso zzso No obvious reduction in silent zzso marks was observed despite high gene density in this extraordinarily zzso zzso zzso 

These results show that zzso gene zzso and their organization differ considerably even over modest zzso zzso zzso innovation among all core and zzso zzso zzso has evolved in concert with adaptation of specific life history traits in this rapidly evolving zzso zzso
