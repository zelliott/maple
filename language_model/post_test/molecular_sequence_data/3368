Sonic zzso promotes proliferation of developing zzso zzso zzso As sonic zzso is expressed in the zzso throughout life it is not clear why proliferation occurs only in the early zzso period and only in the external zzso cell zzso We asked whether zzso zzso zzso might regulate sonic zzso proliferation and thereby contribute to the specialized zzso environment of the external zzso cell zzso We identified a zzso sequence within sonic zzso that is essential for binding to zzso zzso zzso but not for binding to the zzso zzso Sonic zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso promote zzso proliferation of zzso day 6 zzso zzso By contrast, proliferation of less mature zzso cells is not affected by sonic zzso zzso The importance of zzso for proliferation increases during development in parallel with increasing expression of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso may be critical zzso of zzso cell zzso
