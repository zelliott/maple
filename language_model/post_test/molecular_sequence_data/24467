The ability of genetically diverse strains of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso to coexist in a zzso farm was assessed through the case study describing a chronically infected farm, and also by an animal experiment involving the use of zzso zzso The case study employed a program of monitoring zzso from zzso zzso and finishing pigs for the presence of zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and virus isolation zzso The zzso zzso tested zzso consisting of zzso and pulmonary zzso collected from 60 breeding animals from the same zzso The open reading frame zzso 5 portion of selected positive zzso detected from zzso or zzso were zzso acid zzso and their zzso zzso The results indicated the presence of 3 genetically diverse groups, designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso between zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso within zzso zzso zzso verified the presence of zzso in 1 of 60 animals, and no evidence of strains B or C were zzso This paper indicates that based on the evaluation of zzso 5, genetically diverse strains of zzso appear to zzso although the frequency and significance of this observation is not zzso
