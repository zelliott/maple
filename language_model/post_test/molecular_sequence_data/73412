zzso zzso are zzso zzso motifs that often bind to the zzso of protein zzso zzso oxide zzso an zzso signaling zzso plays critical roles in nervous, zzso and cardiovascular zzso Although there are numerous zzso functions for zzso zzso produced primarily by the zzso NO zzso zzso excess zzso activity mediates brain injury in cerebral zzso and in animal models of Parkinson's zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity must therefore be tightly zzso To determine zzso for the zzso domain of zzso we screened 13 billion distinct peptides and found that the zzso domain binds tightly to peptides ending zzso This differs from the only known zzso consensus that interacts with zzso zzso from zzso zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso position is zzso by zzso of zzso A zzso to zzso substitution changes the binding specificity from zzso to zzso zzso by the zzso consensus, candidate zzso interacting proteins have been identified including zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso have distinct zzso binding zzso
