We show that leukemia zzso factor zzso plays a zzso role in the programmed withdrawal of zzso from zzso zzso First, zzso zzso is present in embryonic skeletal muscle and is zzso zzso We detect high levels of zzso zzso at embryonic day 17 zzso in mouse hind leg zzso The content of zzso zzso falls zzso between zzso and birth and then remains low in the zzso and zzso The decrease in zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso with the end of secondary zzso and the completion of the adult number of zzso Second, treatment of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso a superficial muscle of the hind leg, with zzso from birth zzso zzso zzso delays the withdrawal of excess zzso from zzso zzso zzso by approximately 3 zzso The zzso of the process is shifted from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days of zzso zzso treatment delays zzso withdrawal by altering its timing without an appreciable effect on its zzso Third, in mice zzso for a disruption of the zzso zzso the zzso in the reduction of multiply zzso zzso zzso occurs 1 day earlier, at zzso zzso zzso days of zzso Muscle fiber number is unchanged in zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso does not alter the rate of zzso growth, the number of muscle fibers in the zzso or the reappearance of zzso that have been zzso Instead, zzso appears to delay maturation of the motor unit by zzso delaying the onset of zzso zzso We zzso that this is a necessary component of a selective process that will operate simultaneously and equally on zzso competing motor zzso
