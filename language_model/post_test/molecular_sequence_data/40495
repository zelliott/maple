zzso zzso zzso into infectious zzso to survive outside of the zzso It is of interest to identify factors involved in zzso of zzso wall proteins zzso during this zzso zzso proteins are important regulators of development and cell differentiation in zzso and zzso No member of this gene family has been reported to date in zzso plants, or zzso zzso We have identified a zzso gene zzso zzso a putative paired domain in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso during both zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso specifically bound to the zzso zzso elements of the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso increased zzso to zzso and zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso paired domain or zzso of the basic zzso acids of the paired domain resulted in a decrease of the zzso function of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso family has been zzso during evolution, and zzso could zzso the key zzso genes to regulate differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
