Chemical and zzso studies were performed with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso a major component sugar of the zzso from zzso was in an zzso as is also the case in the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso of the zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso A structural analysis revealed that the O zzso chain of the zzso from zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was clearly revealed by zzso and zzso zzso tests with whole cells, as well as by passive zzso tests with sheep zzso cells that had been zzso with the zzso from zzso and zzso In contrast, in passive zzso tests, the zzso of zzso did not zzso zzso with the zzso from other strains such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1875 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso from these strains consist of O zzso chains composed of zzso zzso of zzso with various zzso groups, and they share the zzso zzso factor C of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the absolute zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso plays a very important role in the expression of the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso factor C of zzso zzso zzso
