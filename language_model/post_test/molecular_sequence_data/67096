zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fatal neurodegenerative prion disease affecting cattle that is zzso to humans, zzso as a zzso of zzso disease zzso likely following the consumption of meat contaminated with zzso zzso zzso zzso are a prerequisite for the development of simple, highly sensitive and zzso diagnostic tests that are able to detect even small amounts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe here the affinity maturation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a binding affinity of 1 zzso to a zzso derived from the zzso region of bovine zzso zzso zzso This is the tightest zzso zzso reported to date and may find useful application in zzso especially when zzso is zzso by zzso and/or zzso for zzso zzso Several rounds of directed evolution and zzso selection with zzso display were performed using an zzso library generated from a single zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso As the correct zzso of affinities in this range are not straightforward, competition zzso techniques and zzso methods were both applied and zzso zzso interpretation of the affinity improvement was performed based on the crystal structure of the original prion zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso by modeling the corresponding zzso
