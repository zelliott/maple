A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil and its zzso position determined using a zzso zzso The zzso formed abundant aerial zzso that differentiated into zzso spore zzso The cell wall contained zzso zzso the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso while the cellular fatty acids were rich in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on an almost complete zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso was closely related to a group that consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso data demonstrated that strain zzso was clearly distinguished from all closely related zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data demonstrate zzso that the isolate should be classified as a new species of zzso
