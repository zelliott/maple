zzso is a zzso zzso zzso isolated from sugar beet leaves infected with the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso the growth of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso but has little or no effect against zzso zzso is produced in very low amounts in sugar beet leaves, and to study the protein in greater detail with respect to biological function and protein structural analysis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for large-scale zzso The zzso acid zzso processing of the signal zzso zzso bridges, and biological activity of the zzso protein were determined and compared with that of the authentic zzso In zzso zzso the protein was expressed with an additional zzso zzso The zzso bonding was found to be identical to that of the authentic zzso However, when tested in in zzso zzso the biological activity of the zzso protein was slightly lower than that measured for the authentic zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein was significantly more sensitive to zzso than the authentic zzso This is most probably due to the extra zzso since no other differences between the two proteins have been zzso
