zzso a member of the orphan nuclear zzso is a zzso factor regulating the expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso Previously, we cloned a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated the zzso zzso zzso a protein of 469 zzso zzso Then, expressions of two types zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were examined during development of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso They were expressed in the zzso at stage zzso Expressions of both the alpha and beta zzso became stronger in the zzso of frogs at stage zzso and were most prominent in that of frogs zzso after zzso In the former zzso zzso were the only germ cells in the zzso zzso whilst zzso cells were observed in the latter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was more zzso In addition, we cloned the regions with either zzso I or II of the zzso zzso zzso structure analysis revealed that zzso is a partial zzso zzso zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso are expressed from the same gene by alternative zzso and that they may play an important zzso in differentiation of zzso germ cells in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
