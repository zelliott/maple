zzso are zzso cell zzso molecules that mediate cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso and functional analysis of the zzso part of zzso that mediates this binding has often been hampered by the availability of sufficient amount of zzso zzso we have expressed the zzso region of zzso zzso using the zzso expression zzso system zzso A zzso zzso was generated that encodes the signal zzso the precursor region and the zzso part of the mature zzso under the control of the zzso for zzso zzso of insect cells with zzso virus led to the expression of about 40 zzso of the zzso zzso per 2 zzso zzso infected zzso About half of the protein zzso was zzso either as mature protein or in its zzso zzso The precursor zzso was removed by zzso treatment in the presence of zzso and zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso characterization of the zzso protein revealed a high degree of similarity with the mouse zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited the known resistance to zzso in the presence of zzso and was recognized by two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso made against the zzso protein recognized zzso from different zzso In spite of the high degree of structural resemblance zzso zzso was not able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso
