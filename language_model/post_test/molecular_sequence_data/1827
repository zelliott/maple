While characterizing zzso 2 and 3 of the class I human zzso zzso zzso locus in human zzso two similar but unexpected zzso products were detected in six samples of Filipino zzso A zzso sequence analysis of the two zzso tentatively named zzso and zzso rendered them as two novel and seemingly related zzso both with zzso to the gorilla and human major zzso complex zzso A zzso zzso 2 is similar to the published human zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso differing by 2 zzso from zzso and zzso and by 4 zzso from zzso zzso 3 is most similar to zzso and zzso differing by 7 zzso from zzso and by 8 zzso from zzso zzso sequence comparison of zzso 1 to 8 indicates that their closest published match is to the zzso Complete typing at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the six samples yielded the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus far, zzso and zzso have been detected only in Filipino samples containing these zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso based on a stop zzso located in zzso zzso zzso is also a zzso gene because of the dual zzso zzso in zzso 4, with a reading frame shift generating a stop zzso zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso with 31 other zzso A locus coding regions resulted in a zzso tree that zzso the two zzso with the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso evolved from a common ancestral zzso
