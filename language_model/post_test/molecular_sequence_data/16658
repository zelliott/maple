Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging and cognitive zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso is a primary constituent of senile plaques - a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease - and has been implicated in the zzso of the zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso 35 of zzso may play a critical role in zzso zzso stress and zzso Several additional mechanisms of zzso have been proposed, including the role of zzso binding and reduction to produce hydrogen zzso and the role of zzso zzso It has been reported that zzso zzso is less likely to form larger zzso structures, and consequently, large zzso As a consequence of the lack of deposition of the zzso in zzso brain, zzso zzso has been proposed to be zzso Additionally, the sequence of the zzso variety of zzso contains three zzso acid zzso compared to the human zzso These zzso include the shift of zzso 5, zzso 10, and zzso 13 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso This shift in sequence within the zzso binding region of the zzso results in a decrease in the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso to zzso compared to the human zzso zzso As a result of the effect of the zzso acid variations on the ability of the zzso zzso to reduce zzso to zzso compared to the human zzso the zzso beta has been proposed to lack zzso stress zzso In this study, the zzso stress and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso were evaluated and compared to those of human zzso Both human zzso and zzso were found to have a significant effect on zzso DNA zzso loss of zzso networks, and cell zzso zzso zzso was found to cause a significant increase in both protein zzso and zzso zzso similar to zzso both of which were inhibited by the zzso chain breaking zzso vitamin zzso suggesting that zzso oxygen species play a role in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso reduction may not play a critical role zzso zzso stress, and that the zzso stress exhibited by this zzso may be a consequence of the presence of zzso 35, similar to the findings associated with the native human zzso zzso
