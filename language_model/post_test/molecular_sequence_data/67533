zzso regulatory factor 5 zzso has been identified as a key zzso zzso regulating expression of both type I zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso were isolated from Japanese flounder, zzso zzso The gene of Japanese zzso zzso is zzso zzso long, contains 9 zzso and 8 zzso and encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence shares zzso identity to fish zzso and possesses a zzso domain zzso a middle region zzso an zzso association domain zzso a virus activated domain zzso and two nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso in all known zzso zzso analysis clustered it into the zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in all zzso zzso with higher levels observed in the zzso and head zzso Gene expression of zzso was analyzed over a zzso time course in the zzso head zzso zzso and muscle of Japanese zzso challenged with zzso disease virus zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso The data showed that zzso expression was slightly zzso by zzso but its induction time was clearly moved up; in contrast, the induction upon zzso zzso challenge started not earlier than day 2 zzso and was stronger and more persistent with a later peak time in all four zzso The late and long-lasting zzso expression of zzso following zzso zzso challenge suggests that it might be an zzso zzso gene zzso the induction of which is driven by zzso zzso type I zzso
