zzso initiation zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in initiation of zzso The zzso complex contains at least eight different zzso but, as yet, little is known about the function of the individual zzso In this study we have characterized the role of zzso zzso a recently identified zzso zzso protein of 39 zzso in the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso we show that this protein is required for cell cycle progression and for mating and plays an essential role in initiation of protein zzso By zzso screening we have identified two partners that directly associate with zzso zzso a previously characterized zzso zzso and a novel protein of 33 zzso zzso which is part of the zzso complex and has an zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso interact with each other and zzso of zzso zzso the growth zzso of a zzso zzso Our results provide support for both physical and functional interactions between three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
