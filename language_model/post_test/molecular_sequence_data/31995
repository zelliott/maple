In this study, two zzso gene zzso designated as zzso and zzso were cloned and characterized from the freshwater prawn zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso showed high sequence zzso to the insect zzso and contained zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso showed that the zzso and zzso genes were expressed in all investigated zzso with the highest level of expression in the zzso and zzso zzso also revealed that zzso and zzso zzso expressions were both significantly increased at 5 and 20 days zzso after zzso Thus, the results of the present study imply that zzso and zzso play complex and important roles in the sex differentiation of zzso zzso
