One of the human zzso zzso Stones zzso has been shown to be the product of a hybrid gene of which the zzso derived from the zzso B zzso gene whereas the zzso derived from the zzso A zzso zzso The present study reveals the zzso point of this hybrid gene from the analysis of zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso sequences encompassing the region corresponding to zzso 3 to zzso 4 of zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso according to zzso and zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso After zzso the products, the zzso sequences derived from zzso zzso and putative zzso genes were zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso genes indicate that the zzso took place 200 base pairs upstream from the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence surrounding the putative zzso point is zzso to the zzso point proposed for zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso These results suggest strongly that zzso zzso through unequal zzso can be facilitated by specific zzso zzso such as those in common in these two zzso zzso The present study also revealed that this zzso individual has a zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso for zzso at the zzso for zzso 39 results in substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso acid 39, and loss of an zzso restriction zzso
