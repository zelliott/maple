Two strains of zzso purple zzso bacteria capable of growing at low temperatures (5 degrees zzso were isolated from the zzso The two strains showed positive zzso and grew over a relatively wide temperature range zzso degrees zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clustered with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso (99 zzso However, zzso zzso experiments between zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso revealed a level of zzso of only 67 zzso The DNA base composition of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso (by zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso and zzso zzso studies, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficiently different from other zzso species to merit its description as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
