Although the zzso zzso retains most of the zzso functions associated with the zzso zzso zzso it is completely defective for genetic zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso exhibits an zzso zzso DNA zzso activity, zzso producing a zzso zzso DNA zzso that is an ideal zzso for zzso zzso strand zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso processes zzso DNA in the same manner as the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we further show that the zzso zzso is unable to coordinate the loading of zzso protein onto the zzso DNA produced, and we conclude that this inability results in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our findings argue that the facilitated loading of zzso protein by the zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso in zzso
