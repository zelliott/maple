zzso dynamics zzso simulations and circular zzso zzso experiments were carried out on zzso zzso A and zzso two short peptides belonging to an interesting class of natural substances known to be active mainly against zzso bacteria and zzso Experimental results indicate the higher propensity of zzso zzso with respect to zzso A, in forming zzso zzso These results were revisited by zzso MD simulations, in which their zzso propensity was investigated in the absence of zzso zzso clearly show the higher stability of zzso zzso in zzso zzso moreover, an interestingly strong mechanical zzso emerges since both zzso show the same zzso zzso (from 7 to 10) as the most energetically accessible for zzso zzso Such studies provide some intriguing structural and mechanical evidence that may help in better understanding and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in water solution and, ultimately, the inner principles of their microbial targets selectivity and mechanism of action at the level of cell zzso
