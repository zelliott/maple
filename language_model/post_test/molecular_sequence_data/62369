Alpine zzso undergo dramatic zzso changes in their zzso properties, suggesting that the bacteria there encounter uncommon shifting selection zzso zzso constitute important members of the zzso soil zzso In order to characterize the zzso zzso community and to assess the impact of shifting selection on this community, we examined the ability of zzso zzso zzso to grow on a variety of carbon sources, and we determined their zzso relationships based on zzso zzso DNA zzso We found a high prevalence of zzso in our soil samples, and zzso from these zzso exhibited extensive zzso zzso In addition, our data revealed that many of our zzso form a unique zzso zzso representatives of which are also found in the Swedish zzso and zzso Our data also show a lack of zzso between the zzso properties and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso diversity of these organisms cannot be predicted by zzso
