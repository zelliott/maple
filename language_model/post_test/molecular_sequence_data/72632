We have identified an zzso box motif zzso that is strictly zzso at the beginning of alpha 6 zzso in all zzso zzso zzso and most of the related zzso zzso By using CD and zzso zzso we have demonstrated that the capping box zzso have an important role in determining the zzso zzso adopted by this zzso in the zzso environment of the zzso This is an example in which a local zzso contributing to nucleation of a structural element essential to the global folding of the zzso is strictly zzso in a zzso of zzso zzso
