zzso are large zzso zzso with many essential functions in basement membrane assembly and zzso Cell zzso to zzso is zzso by a tandem of five zzso zzso zzso zzso at the C zzso of the alpha zzso zzso binding requires an intact zzso region, as well as contributions from the coiled zzso formed by the zzso zzso and gamma zzso We have determined the crystal structure at zzso resolution of the zzso region of the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso The three LG zzso adopt typical zzso zzso with zzso calcium binding sites in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interact through a substantial zzso but zzso is completely zzso from the zzso zzso We suggest that the missing gamma chain tail may be required to stabilize the interaction between zzso and zzso in the biologically active zzso A global analysis of zzso zzso sites shows that the zzso faces of zzso are free of zzso modifications in all five zzso alpha zzso suggesting that these surfaces may harbor the zzso binding zzso The alpha zzso structure provides the first atomic view of the zzso binding region of zzso
