Despite detailed knowledge of the regulation of individual steps in the zzso pathway, the relative importance of each step to the overall control of zzso by insulin is not zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso of the rat zzso cell line zzso were produced, zzso a zzso zzso driven by a promoter not responsive to zzso In these cells zzso zzso from zzso was increased zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells after 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso was associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso levels zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, and zzso activity in control cells, but no zzso decrease was observed in zzso zzso These experiments provide direct evidence in intact cells that zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso from zzso and show that zzso action to inhibit zzso is predominantly on the zzso of zzso zzso
