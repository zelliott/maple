In the present study, we explored structural and functional variations and possible zzso of the major zzso complex zzso gene in water buffalo zzso zzso Two zzso zzso amplified from one individual water zzso were designated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The percentage of zzso and zzso acid similarity between zzso and zzso revealed that these sequences display more similarity to zzso of respective zzso and zzso genes from other zzso species than to each zzso The zzso analysis also revealed a considerably larger genetic distance between these two genes than between zzso genes from other zzso The larger genetic distance between zzso and zzso and the presence of different bovine zzso putative locus specific zzso acid zzso suggests these sequences are zzso This finding is consistent with zzso gene zzso in other zzso
