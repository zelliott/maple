zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and subsequent analysis of the translation products by zzso showed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 108 zzso zzso analysis revealed a single binding component with high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso molecules zzso specifically bound zzso No evidence for zzso zzso during in zzso synthesis was zzso When zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso on zzso zzso a complex of zzso 6 S was zzso The complex was shifted to a higher zzso zzso after incubation with a zzso zzso zzso directed against an zzso in the zzso zzso In the presence as well as the absence of hormone, zzso molecules were able to bind to zzso without an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso forms complexes with a DNA element containing zzso zzso element zzso zzso interactions were stabilized by different zzso zzso directed against either the zzso or zzso part of the zzso and were abolished by an zzso directed against the zzso domain of the zzso In conclusion, translation of zzso zzso in zzso yields an activated zzso protein which binds steroid with high zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso enhance zzso binding by stabilizing zzso zzso when bound to zzso
