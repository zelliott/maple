The zzso 3 zzso protein zzso by the zzso C virus possesses both an zzso zzso zzso activity and a zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examines the effects of the zzso on the zzso by comparing the zzso properties of the full-length zzso protein with truncated versions in which the zzso is either deleted or replaced by a zzso (His zzso or a zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso When the zzso protein lacks the zzso domain it zzso zzso more slowly and does not unwind zzso in the presence of excess zzso acid that acts as an zzso zzso Some but not all of the zzso zzso activity can be restored by adding a His tag or zzso tag to the N zzso of the truncated zzso suggesting that the effects of the zzso are both specific and zzso Similar but smaller effects are also seen in DNA zzso and zzso zzso While zzso on zzso (or zzso the full-length protein zzso zzso more slowly than the truncated zzso suggesting that the zzso allows for more efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the full-length protein assembles on zzso DNA as a higher order zzso than the truncated fragment, and the binding appears to be more zzso The data suggest that zzso C virus zzso zzso and therefore viral zzso could be influenced by the zzso of the zzso domain which likely occur during zzso zzso
