zzso zzso late zzso abundant zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso plant proteins that accumulate in the late stages of seed development and in zzso zzso subjected to water deficit, zzso low temperature, or zzso acid zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso to zzso zzso zzso this binding is accompanied by an increase in zzso of the zzso and adoption of zzso can be induced by sodium zzso zzso All zzso contain at least one zzso a zzso zzso acid consensus zzso The zzso is predicted to form a class zzso zzso zzso a structural element known to interact with zzso and zzso Here, three zzso deletion proteins of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso is required for binding to zzso zzso zzso and adoption of zzso of the zzso accounts for most of the zzso change of zzso upon binding to zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso The adoption of structure may help stabilize cellular zzso including zzso under stress zzso
