A zzso zzso was used for the transient expression of the alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein zzso gene in zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso strong protection against subsequent alfalfa mosaic virus infection, enabling the efficacy of zzso zzso to be determined without developing transgenic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alone without zzso zzso zzso weaker protection against zzso The activity of the zzso zzso zzso in protection did not correlate with their activities in zzso zzso The activity of a zzso zzso suggested that zzso did not have a role in zzso Our results indicate that interaction of the zzso with alfalfa mosaic virus zzso is not important in protection, thereby leaving open the possibility that interactions with host factors lead to zzso
