Two clones have been isolated from a zzso library of the moss zzso zzso and a zzso library of the zzso green zzso zzso zzso The zzso contain genes coding for the major zzso zzso protein zzso in the zzso II zzso zzso complex zzso The zzso insert of the moss zzso clone contains the complete zzso region and zzso and 3' zzso zzso The coding region contains an zzso of zzso zzso which is spanned by a pair of zzso perfect direct zzso There are two zzso boxes and five zzso elements related to zzso zzso et zzso 1983) residing in the zzso Comparisons of the moss cab gene with sequences of zzso genes of higher plants reveal zzso and repeated sequences similar to the zzso element in the zzso region upstream from the zzso and zzso boxes thought to be responsive to light zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains the complete zzso zzso a zzso zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso While the overall zzso in the zzso regions is low between the cab gene of the moss and that of the zzso the zzso regions of the two contain some sequences that are zzso among the cab genes in higher zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these two clones are highly zzso except for the zzso zzso Their zzso plots are very similar and both possess three zzso segments that are likely zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso transit zzso sequence of the zzso is divergent from that of the moss or higher plants, suggesting that they may have evolved from different zzso Southern zzso analysis shows that the cab genes in the moss and the zzso as in higher plants, are zzso by a number of zzso genes zzso a zzso zzso
