zzso migration zzso factor zzso is a ubiquitous protein playing various zzso zzso and hormonal zzso zzso was originally identified for its capacity to inhibit the random movement of zzso in zzso zzso is widely expressed in many zzso with particularly high levels in the nervous zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and database searching, we have identified in bovine brain several zzso zzso According to mass spectral analysis, the molecular masses for three of them were determined as zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we have identified another zzso protein zzso zzso by Western zzso using zzso zzso raised to zzso zzso an apparent molecular weight of 12 zzso isolated to zzso from bovine brain zzso The modified zzso procedure was mainly based on zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso acid as a zzso we have demonstrated zzso activity of the isolated zzso The zzso sequences for all zzso proteins were found to be zzso Several other higher molecular weight putative zzso proteins were also revealed in the bovine brain zzso zzso A zzso nature of zzso is suggested to be a result of its occurrence in different zzso states in a wide variety of zzso and zzso
