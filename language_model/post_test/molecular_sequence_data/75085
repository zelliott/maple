An X zzso gene located 40 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso at zzso was isolated and zzso This zzso which we named zzso spans about zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso is zzso in evolution, and has the features of a zzso zzso At its zzso end, a cluster of zzso zzso is zzso on the inactive X zzso and zzso on the active X zzso The zzso gene can code for a 157 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso show zzso identity to zzso a highly zzso 76 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is characterized in its central part zzso zzso by a sequence zzso to the zzso zzso site of zzso The structural organization of the zzso protein suggests the existence of a family of zzso in addition to the zzso zzso that could play specific roles in key cellular zzso possibly through zzso zzso
