The preparation of three building blocks required for the total synthesis of zzso I zzso is zzso a complex zzso zzso bearing a zzso ring which spans four of the five zzso of its zzso zzso Key steps involve the zzso zzso addition of zzso to zzso the zzso of the resulting alcohol 18 with the zzso zzso 7, and further zzso of the resulting product 19 into zzso 22 on treatment with the zzso protected zzso donor zzso The zzso method is also used for the formation of the second zzso represented by zzso zzso A model study shows that the assembly of the zzso perimeter of 1 depends critically on the phasing of the zzso events between fragments 22, 38 and the zzso donor 27 due to the severe zzso hindrance in the zzso A particularly noteworthy finding is the fact that zzso 22 can be zzso zzso at the zzso group in high yield without protection of the neighboring zzso zzso
