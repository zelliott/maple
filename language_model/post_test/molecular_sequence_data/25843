The zzso sequence of an unusual zzso virus gene which maps immediately upstream from the zzso virus zzso gene has been zzso The zzso Mr protein predicted to be zzso by the gene contains 11 copies of a 12 zzso acid zzso repeat zzso The seven zzso copies of the repeat sequence are perfectly zzso but variation exists in the four zzso zzso Three peptides were zzso which contained either one copy of the repeat zzso two copies of the repeat sequence or a zzso zzso region of the zzso All three peptides when injected with zzso into rabbits gave rise to zzso which reacted strongly on Western blots of zzso zzso virus proteins with a zzso Mr zzso When directly compared in Western blots the zzso zzso were shown to recognize a protein zzso with one of the two zzso proteins recognized by chicken zzso virus zzso taken 2 weeks zzso The zzso protein is removed by treatment with sodium zzso suggesting that it is located at or near the surface of the zzso
