zzso zzso a zzso which causes zzso fever in humans and other zzso eludes the immune response by zzso variation of the zzso zzso This occurs by replacement of an expressed zzso gene with a copy of a silent zzso zzso Silent and expressed zzso genes are located on separate linear zzso To further characterize zzso zzso copy numbers were determined for two linear plasmids and for the zzso zzso by comparing zzso of zzso to native DNA with zzso to zzso plasmids containing zzso zzso zzso copy numbers were also estimated by zzso zzso zzso Total cellular DNA content was determined by zzso For zzso grown in mice, copy numbers and zzso confidence intervals were 14 zzso for an expression zzso 8 zzso for a silent zzso and 16 zzso for the zzso zzso grown in broth medium had zzso to one-half this number of plasmids and zzso zzso of cells with zzso revealed DNA to be distributed throughout most of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso organize their total cellular DNA into several complete zzso and that cells undergoing zzso switches do one or more of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from switched and zzso expression plasmids for at least three to five generations, zzso suppress zzso from some expression zzso copies, or zzso partition expression plasmids zzso The lower copy number of the silent zzso indicates that zzso zzso gene zzso may result from loss of zzso silent plasmids by zzso
