The parameters controlling the generation of robust zzso T cell recall responses remain poorly zzso In this study, we compare recall responses by zzso and zzso memory T cells following zzso zzso zzso of mice immune to either zzso zzso virus or zzso zzso results in robust zzso T cell recall responses but poor boosting of zzso T cell recall responses in the same zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with a pathogen sharing only a zzso T cell zzso results in robust boosting of zzso T cell recall zzso The disparity in zzso and zzso T cell recall responses cannot be attributed to competition for growth factors or zzso as robust zzso and zzso T cell recall responses can be simultaneously induced following zzso with zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso T cell recall responses are dependent on the duration of the secondary zzso zzso the zzso dose results in more potent boosting of zzso T cell recall responses and artificially limiting the duration of secondary infection following zzso zzso adversely impacts the magnitude of zzso T cell, but not zzso T cell, recall zzso These findings suggest that rapid pathogen clearance by secondary zzso following zzso zzso prevents optimal boosting of zzso T cell responses and therefore have important practical implications in the design of vaccination and boosting strategies aimed at promoting zzso T zzso zzso
