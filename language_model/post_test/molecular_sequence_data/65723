The prevalence of zzso was investigated in 24 strains of four species of plant zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Upon induction by zzso C, the release of zzso particles was observed in 11 strains from three zzso zzso electron zzso revealed two distinct sizes of zzso depending on the identity of the zzso species, typical of the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso experiments carried out on zzso zzso revealed that all zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains had a size of about 10 zzso whereas all zzso isolated from zzso zzso strains displayed zzso sizes ranging from 62 to 65 zzso Strong DNA zzso signals were shown for most zzso hosted by the same species whereas no zzso was found between zzso zzso by different zzso Moreover, the complete sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined as a zzso DNA circular zzso of zzso zzso that encodes 95 predicted zzso Only 14 of the predicted proteins could be assigned functions, some of which were involved in DNA processing, zzso zzso and bacterial zzso In addition, the zzso complete zzso was mapped as a zzso on a zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso and a region of zzso zzso of zzso was found to be duplicated on the zzso zzso zzso previously zzso from zzso zzso zzso the parental strain of zzso zzso zzso
