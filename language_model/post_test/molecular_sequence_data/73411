zzso repeat sequences have become of great interest due to their association with specific genetic zzso Here we report the identification of a zzso containing zzso zzso repeats from mouse zzso termed zzso The zzso repeat is contained within the longest open reading frame within the zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that four distinct zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in mouse and rat zzso with low expression in the zzso brain, and adrenal zzso Further, zzso zzso were highly abundant in both zzso zzso and round zzso and decreased in zzso zzso profile analysis indicated that zzso zzso are translated in mouse zzso with efficiencies similar to other transcripts expressed in late zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings thus suggest a role for zzso zzso containing zzso repeats during mouse zzso
