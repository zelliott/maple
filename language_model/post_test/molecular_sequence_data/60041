zzso antibiotics can target zzso folds with zzso affinity and inhibit biological processes ranging from protein zzso to zzso action and viral zzso zzso features of zzso zzso recognition have been zzso using chemical, zzso zzso and zzso approaches on both natural zzso targets and zzso zzso identified through in zzso zzso Our previous studies on zzso zzso complexes are extended to zzso B bound to its selected zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso I and zzso of zzso B is sandwiched between the major groove floor of a zzso zzso mismatch aligned segment and a zzso zzso base that zzso over the bound zzso zzso zzso hydrogen bonds are observed between the charged zzso of zzso B and base mismatch edges and backbone zzso These interactions anchor zzso ring I and zzso ring II within the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso complexes with zzso and zzso B zzso common architectural principles to generate zzso pockets for the bound zzso zzso In each case, the zzso ring I and an attached zzso ring are zzso within the major groove binding pocket, which is lined with mismatch zzso The bound zzso within the pocket is capped over by a zzso base and anchored in place through zzso hydrogen bonds involving charged zzso groups of the zzso
