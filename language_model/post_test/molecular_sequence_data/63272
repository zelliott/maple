Several small zzso drugs that bind to the host zzso zzso and prevent viral entry have been developed for the treatment of zzso zzso The innate zzso found in zzso envelope and the complex zzso interactions during entry makes defining resistance to these zzso zzso Here we found that mapping zzso in the zzso gene from a primary isolate zzso selected in culture for resistance to the zzso entry inhibitor zzso was complicated by zzso of the cloned envelope gene in zzso zzso We therefore zzso the envelope from zzso into a highly active and susceptible zzso zzso zzso The zzso envelopes generated robust signals in the zzso zzso and a 200 zzso acid fragment, encompassing a zzso region of the zzso zzso was required to zzso resistance in both the zzso zzso and in replicating zzso In contrast, a zzso envelope that contained only the zzso region from this resistant virus was completely susceptible suggesting that the zzso changes acquired are context zzso
