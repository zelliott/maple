The zzso zzso immunity systems that are present in most zzso and many zzso function by incorporating fragments of alien zzso into specific zzso zzso zzso the zzso and using the transcripts as guide zzso to destroy the zzso of the zzso virus or zzso This zzso zzso immune response is zzso by numerous, diverse and rapidly evolving zzso zzso zzso several of which form the Cascade complex involved in the processing of zzso transcripts and zzso of the target zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso protein sequences and structures led to the zzso of the zzso systems into three zzso zzso II and zzso 

A detailed comparison of the available sequences and structures of zzso proteins revealed several unnoticed zzso zzso The zzso Mysterious zzso zzso containing a distinct form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, which are major components of the zzso systems, were classified into three large groups, zzso zzso and zzso Each of these groups includes many previously zzso proteins now shown to adopt the zzso zzso Evidence is presented that large zzso contained in most of the zzso systems could be zzso to zzso proteins which contain a zzso Palm domain and are predicted to be zzso active in Type III zzso systems but zzso in Type I zzso These findings, the fact that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso all contain core zzso zzso and distinct gene arrangements in the three types of zzso systems together provide for a simple scenario for origin and evolution of the zzso zzso Under this scenario, the zzso system originated in zzso zzso and subsequently spread zzso among zzso 

Because of the extreme diversity of zzso systems, in-depth sequence and structure comparison continue to reveal unexpected zzso relationship among zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein families previously considered unrelated provides for improvement in the zzso of zzso systems and a reconstruction of their zzso
