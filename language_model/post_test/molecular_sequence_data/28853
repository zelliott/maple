zzso zzso an essential zzso in the zzso synthesis pathway, was identified as one of the zzso genes in the rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulation of zzso zzso is important to the understanding of zzso regulation of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Young male adult zzso rats were used for zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso were used to characterize gene zzso 

The zzso acid sequence of rat zzso zzso shares zzso and zzso identity with that of mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is abundantly expressed and regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso and lateral zzso of the rat zzso and its expression is localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso also is regulated by zzso in the seminal zzso but not in the muscle, brain, zzso zzso heart, or liver, suggesting that this zzso is responsive to zzso in the male sex accessory zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and two other zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is most abundantly expressed and regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso cells, suggesting that regulation of zzso zzso is likely a key step in coordinated zzso regulation of zzso synthesis in the zzso
