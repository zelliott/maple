zzso zzso zzso zzso center zzso zzso is a member of the human zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso and is the zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso We have cloned a novel zzso zzso of zzso from a human tumor line and have further identified a complex family of zzso zzso zzso We showed zzso to be highly expressed in most tumor cell lines relative to normal zzso An active role for this zzso in transformation was suggested by an zzso of zzso focus formation by expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of an inactive zzso of zzso also inhibited the zzso growth of cells yet had no effect on proliferation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso expression and had a striking effect on zzso growth zzso zzso cell zzso Together, these results suggest an important role for zzso in cell transformation and zzso
