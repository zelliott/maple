The zzso of protein function has become a crucial problem with the advent of sequence and structural zzso zzso A large body of evidence suggests that protein structural information is frequently zzso in local zzso and that folds are mainly made up of a number of simple local units of zzso structural zzso consisting of a few secondary structures and their connecting zzso Moreover, protein zzso play an important role in protein zzso Here we present zzso a zzso database of structural zzso consisting of one loop plus its bracing secondary zzso zzso currently contains zzso zzso elements classified into zzso motif zzso The database provides an easy way to retrieve functional information from protein structures sharing a common zzso to search motifs found in a given zzso family, zzso or fold, or to search by zzso on proteins with classified zzso The zzso database of zzso is located at zzso
