We recently identified an zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso with selective activity for zzso cells of zzso zzso Here we describe the characterization of a highly related zzso zzso also known as zzso Human zzso shares zzso identity and zzso similarity with zzso The human and mouse zzso genes share a common zzso Like zzso zzso is able to induce zzso survival and migration of adrenal cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression is induced by hypoxic zzso zzso expression occurs predominantly in the zzso and is largely restricted to primary zzso zzso delivery of zzso or zzso to the mouse zzso resulted in a potent zzso zzso We have localized the expression of the zzso receptors within the zzso to vascular zzso zzso The zzso exhibits relatively high turnover of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with other factors such as zzso may maintain the integrity and also regulate proliferation of the blood vessels in the zzso
