Most patients with zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso harbor zzso in zzso the gene for zzso zzso a zzso protein with a zzso zzso that interacts with numerous signaling zzso including zzso The functions of zzso and the mechanisms of zzso development leading to zzso failure are zzso Recently, we reported that zzso expression levels zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2010 zzso zzso a zzso analysis of zzso and zzso was undertaken to identify regions required for their interaction and ability to zzso zzso A set of zzso zzso with systematic replacement of six zzso acids with zzso was tested for binding to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, a series of deletions within the zzso zzso was examined for binding to zzso We identified 3 zzso zzso in zzso that completely zzso zzso and identified a previously described 74 zzso acid zzso binding domain in the zzso zzso as necessary for zzso zzso The functional consequences of zzso zzso binding were studied in zzso zzso utilizing zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso binding were zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso Likewise, deletion of the zzso sequence from the zzso zzso domain zzso its zzso of zzso zzso Based on the crystal structure of zzso the zzso interaction sites are likely to reside on exposed regions within the G protein zzso zzso These structural details should facilitate the design of zzso to zzso zzso signaling in zzso
