Three strains of moderately zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from zzso hot vents of the Bay of Plenty (New zzso and zzso Harbour zzso New zzso zzso of all zzso were short, zzso zzso rods with one polar zzso All strains were zzso zzso and grew zzso at pH zzso zzso degrees C and zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso were molecular hydrogen, zzso and saturated fatty zzso one of the zzso isolated from zzso Harbour, was able to zzso zzso zzso sulfur was required for zzso zzso and CO2 were the only growth zzso No growth occurred in the absence of 100 zzso zzso extract zzso The zzso content of the DNA determined for the type strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequencing indicated that these strains represent a distinct lineage most closely related to the zzso zzso On the basis of the results of zzso zzso and zzso studies, a new zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with the type species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
