The zzso life stage of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso that serves as its alternate host were identified in laboratory transmission experiments and their roles were confirmed using molecular zzso zzso by the zzso occurred in susceptible fish that were either exposed to or force fed the freshwater zzso zzso zzso infected with the zzso These observations were confirmed using the zzso chain reaction with zzso designed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified from zzso harboring the zzso that caused infection in the fish but not from zzso zzso zzso DNA from an infected zzso was zzso and its zzso with the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso spores verified the proposed life zzso zzso examination of the zzso in the zzso showed zzso stages in the zzso rather than within the zzso zzso as described for other zzso The methods described will be useful in identifying alternate hosts and zzso diverse life stages in the complex life cycles of other zzso and in understanding the relationships between these zzso and their zzso
