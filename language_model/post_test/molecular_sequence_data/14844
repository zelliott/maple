A kinetic model of zzso zzso metabolism in zzso zzso was constructed based on zzso kinetic parameters determined under zzso conditions (including zzso zzso and the zzso activities, zzso zzso and zzso determined in the zzso under control and zzso zzso The zzso structure is characterized by a zzso synthetic module of low flux and low zzso capacity, and another more zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso The model allowed zzso of the contribution of each zzso to the control of zzso synthesis and concentration zzso control and concentration control zzso zzso The main control of flux was exerted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively), followed by zzso transport zzso negligible flux controls by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso machinery were zzso The concentration of reduced zzso was controlled by zzso zzso and zzso stress zzso however, zzso and zzso also exerted control on the cellular level of zzso when they were inhibited by more than zzso The model predicted that in order to diminish the zzso synthesis flux by zzso it is necessary to inhibit zzso or zzso by 58 or zzso respectively, or both by zzso whereas more than zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso simultaneous and moderate zzso of zzso and zzso appears to be a promising zzso therapeutic zzso In contrast, use of highly potent and specific zzso for zzso and the zzso machinery is necessary to affect the zzso capabilities of the zzso
