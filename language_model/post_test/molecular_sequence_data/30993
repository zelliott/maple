Among the various known zzso binding zzso the 67 zzso high affinity zzso zzso zzso is intimately involved during tumor invasion and zzso In this study, we report that zzso and zzso two attachment zzso significantly increased the total cellular level of 67 zzso zzso zzso in two human cancer cell lines, zzso breast zzso cells and zzso melanoma zzso Neither zzso nor zzso synthetic peptides induced such a zzso zzso Since the steady state level of zzso zzso has been shown to control the number of receptors expressed at the cell surface, these results suggest that contact of the cancer cells with zzso and zzso in the host zzso may be an important regulatory mechanism by which cancer cells maintain a high number of zzso at their cell surface as they progress through the several steps of zzso invasion and zzso
