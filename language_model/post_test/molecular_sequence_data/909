Two zzso based on modified zzso containing a metal binding site and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the two zzso were studied by circular zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was found to have a zzso zzso in which the zzso group is zzso in the zzso zzso while 3 showed a larger proportion of the zzso with the zzso group outside the zzso As a consequence, the two zzso were found to bind zzso with different zzso as revealed by zzso zzso in competitive binding zzso zzso of zzso or zzso acids induced increases in zzso intensity, which were dependent on the zzso acid used and in some cases on its absolute zzso The zzso 4 was found to be more zzso than 3, suggesting that the zzso in the zzso cavity strongly increases the zzso discrimination ability of the zzso zzso zzso a linear fluorescent zzso zzso which has the same binding site and absolute zzso as 4, showed very low zzso discrimination zzso The zzso in zzso response was found to be due to the formation of zzso zzso complexes, which were detected by zzso and by circular zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso of the zzso group was completely zzso in the zzso complexes formed, and that the residual zzso was due to zzso zzso
