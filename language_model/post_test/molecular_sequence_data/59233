With the systematic sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso biology has entered a new era where novel challenges have to be zzso One challenge is the identification of the function of the several hundred novel genes discovered by zzso zzso Another is to understand how all zzso genes act in concert to ensure and maintain cell zzso zzso zzso gel zzso is the technique of choice to take up these challenges because it provides the opportunity of obtaining an overall view of zzso zzso In prospect of these studies we have undertaken the construction of a zzso zzso gel protein database that contains information on zzso of the zzso protein zzso In this paper we report the information presently contained in this zzso The reported information includes the identification of 250 protein spots and the characterization of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock induced proteins and proteins zzso by zzso zzso In all, 600 spots are zzso These data can be zzso on the zzso zzso zzso server through the World Wide Web zzso
