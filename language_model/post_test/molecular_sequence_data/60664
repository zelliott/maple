zzso is responsible for the mechanical properties of zzso One of the earliest changes observed in arthritis is the depletion of cartilage zzso due to increased zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Two major sites of zzso have been identified in this region at zzso and zzso While several zzso zzso have been shown to cleave at zzso an as yet unidentified protein termed zzso is responsible for zzso at zzso and is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in cartilage zzso We have identified and cloned a novel zzso zzso with zzso motifs that possesses zzso activity, zzso zzso which has extensive zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso possesses a number of zzso zzso that have been shown to play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have expressed zzso human zzso in insect cells and shown that it zzso zzso at the zzso site, with the zzso pattern and inhibitor profile being indistinguishable from that observed with native zzso A comparison of the structure and expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso Our findings will facilitate the study of the mechanisms of cartilage degradation and provide targets to search for effective zzso of cartilage depletion in zzso zzso
