The synthesis of zzso the structural component of the zzso cell wall that gives shape to the cell, occurs at the plasma membrane and is the result of the activity of at least a zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso directly responsible for the synthesis of zzso whilst the second zzso zzso has a zzso regulatory role zzso et zzso zzso zzso has been characterized in zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and in several other zzso zzso In this work, we have used zzso zzso derived from the zzso regions of zzso to isolate the zzso gene of zzso zzso The gene isolated in this way, which we have named zzso encodes a 204 zzso acid protein that shows a high degree of zzso with other zzso However, unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso strain in zzso zzso is viable, although it exhibits an increased sensitivity to zzso white and zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at both 28 degrees C and 37 degrees zzso The complete sequence of zzso can be obtained from zzso under zzso zzso zzso
