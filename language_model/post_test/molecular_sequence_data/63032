An zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso was isolated from the gut of the mole zzso zzso zzso and identified as zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of this zzso bound tightly to both zzso and zzso Q zzso and its molecular mass zzso was about zzso zzso The highest zzso activity was observed at pH zzso and 60 degrees zzso The zzso was greatly suppressed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not by zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso was capable of zzso various types of zzso compounds, it could not decompose zzso cellulose or zzso The zzso zzso ) gene consisted of an 1,188 zzso open reading frame that zzso a zzso of 395 zzso acids with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso The domain structure of zzso zzso was most similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso family 10 zzso However its sequence identity with any of the zzso in this family was below zzso The results of this study suggest that the zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso with some properties that are distinct from those of zzso family zzso
