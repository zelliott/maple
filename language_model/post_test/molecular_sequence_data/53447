zzso disease virus zzso the zzso agent of severe zzso in a wide variety of animal species, has been considered to be genetically zzso and to form a single type within the zzso zzso of the family zzso zzso infections are of particular interest, because for the first time a virus infection appears to be linked to human psychiatric zzso We now describe a new zzso of zzso isolated from a horse which was zzso due to zzso incurable neurological zzso The zzso sequence of this new strain, named zzso differs from the reference strains by more than zzso and the zzso is difficult to detect by standard reverse zzso zzso zzso The zzso exchanges of the novel zzso isolate have surprisingly little effect on the primary structures of most viral zzso with the notable exception of the X protein zzso which is only zzso identical to its counterpart in reference zzso Our data indicate that the zzso of zzso is far more variable than previously assumed and that naturally occurring zzso may escape detection by currently used diagnostic zzso
