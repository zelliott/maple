The sequence of 10 zzso acids zzso at the site of zzso of the rabbit fast zzso muscle zzso is highly zzso in the family of zzso zzso We changed each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to an zzso acid differing in size or polarity and zzso the zzso for zzso transport activity and zzso with zzso or zzso We found that conservative changes zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso to zzso did not destroy zzso transport activity or zzso formation, whereas zzso changes zzso zzso did disrupt zzso These results indicate that very conservative changes in the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso A number of zzso were also introduced into zzso acids predicted to be involved in zzso zzso in particular those in the zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not essential for zzso zzso although changes to zzso diminished zzso transport activity but not zzso zzso Changes of zzso and zzso abolished zzso formation with both zzso and zzso indicating that these zzso may contribute to the zzso of the zzso zzso
