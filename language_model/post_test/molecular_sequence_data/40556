zzso in zzso strategies are among the most extreme and complex in zzso A prominent example is male body size and the correlated zzso strategies in some species of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso is controlled by a single zzso locus zzso that determines the onset of sexual maturity of zzso Because males cease growth after reaching zzso this results in a marked size zzso The different male size classes show pronounced behavioral differences zzso courtship versus sneak zzso and females prefer large over small zzso We show that sequence zzso of the zzso zzso 4 gene zzso comprise both functional and zzso versions and that variation in copy number of zzso genes on the Y zzso zzso the P locus zzso zzso zzso zzso copies in larger males act as zzso zzso and delay the onset of zzso Copy number variation, as a regulating zzso zzso this system with extreme genetic flexibility that generates extreme variation in zzso Because zzso is critically involved in regulation of body weight and zzso a novel link between the zzso system controlling energy balance and the regulation of reproduction becomes zzso
