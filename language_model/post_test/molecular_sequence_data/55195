zzso zzso proteins are extensively scrutinized at the zzso zzso zzso Various signatures of client zzso including exposure of zzso patches or zzso zzso are zzso zzso to reduce zzso proteins in the zzso We report here the cryptic zzso site as a recognition signal for unfolding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in familial zzso zzso and zzso degradation zzso zzso analyses revealed that prolonged zzso unfolding zzso zzso of cryptic zzso site and triggers zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso and decreases cell proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this modification provides an alternative zzso for degradation, which is zzso zzso zzso distinct from the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso Hence we zzso that zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso system recognizing cryptic zzso sites of zzso proteins to preserve protein zzso
