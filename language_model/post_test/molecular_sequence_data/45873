zzso such as zzso produce a variety of zzso natural products via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and hybrid zzso zzso The protein zzso which is a member of the zzso carrier protein family from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a region of the zzso zzso that is rich in zzso and zzso zzso To gain new insight into the zzso role of zzso carriers in zzso the solution structure of zzso has been solved by zzso zzso The protein adopts a twisted zzso zzso bundle fold, with a zzso zzso motif positioned at the start of the second zzso zzso comparisons with proteins from other organisms suggest a likely zzso function as a discrete zzso carrier zzso
