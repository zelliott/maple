zzso a toxin zzso from the scorpion zzso zzso is a 37 zzso acid zzso having zzso zzso with zzso zzso blocks large zzso zzso zzso channels at zzso zzso from the external side only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is only able to block the skeletal muscle membrane zzso zzso channel incorporated into zzso zzso when applied to the external zzso In the presence of zzso channel activity is interrupted by zzso periods that can last for several zzso From single-channel records it was possible to determine that zzso binds to zzso zzso channel in a zzso zzso When the solution bathing the membrane are 300 zzso zzso internal and 300 zzso zzso external the toxin second order association rate constant is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the first order zzso rate constant is zzso zzso zzso zzso yielding an apparent equilibrium zzso constant of zzso zzso This constant is zzso lower than that of zzso and the values for the rate zzso showed above indicate that this is mainly due to the very low zzso rate zzso mean blocked time approximately 5 zzso The fact that zzso competitively zzso the zzso binding to the channel is a strong suggestion that this toxin binds to the channel external zzso zzso the external zzso concentration makes the association rate constant to decrease with no effect on the zzso reaction indicating that the surface charges located in the external channel zzso play an important role in modulating toxin zzso
