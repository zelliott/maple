To zzso the function of zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso organisms, the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso diffusion zzso using zzso coli zzso zzso provided a test of resistance to long-term exposure under zzso zzso After affinity zzso the zzso zzso had minimal zzso activity toward classic zzso zzso but displayed significant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso green fluorescent protein construct and zzso by electron zzso localized the protein exclusively in the zzso of all zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso analysis identified an approximately zzso sequence upstream of the zzso start site necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso factor binding motif in the minimal promoter led to the loss of reporter zzso Similarly, zzso interference zzso of zzso indicated the involvement of this zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso under stress conditions of zzso was confirmed by analyzing zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso To investigate the function of zzso in zzso transgenic animals zzso zzso were generated exhibiting an increased resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso created worms with an increased sensitivity to several zzso zzso and heat zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso environmental zzso
