Three novel zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso zzso mouse liver zzso and compared to the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso The molecular masses were zzso 55, 51, and zzso zzso and the zzso of the reduced CO complexes were at 450, zzso zzso and 449 zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequences suggest that these zzso belong to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso activities and zzso zzso studies, zzso was the sole catalyst of zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso catalyzing the high zzso zzso zzso This reaction was also zzso at a slower rate by the low zzso zzso zzso zzso contributed significantly to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Western zzso and dot zzso zzso of zzso showed that the induction patterns of the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso induced all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso (about zzso zzso induced only zzso while all other zzso were decreased by 30 to zzso The changes in the zzso amounts of these zzso correlated generally well with the variation in the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the structural and zzso properties, zzso zzso and induction profiles, all three zzso were different from each other and from the previously characterized zzso This mouse zzso zzso model may be valuable in further studies on the induction mechanisms of zzso and zzso
