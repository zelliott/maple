We have recently shown that stimulation of zzso cells with vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso followed by zzso family zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso Royal, zzso zzso zzso zzso Patterson, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 14, zzso In this study, we provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso interaction of the protein with the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso This interaction requires the zzso of zzso on zzso 14 by members of the zzso family of protein zzso such as zzso and zzso because it is completely abolished by expression of a zzso inactive zzso zzso or by zzso zzso of zzso 14 of zzso Most interestingly, the association of zzso with zzso zzso induced the recruitment of zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso suggesting that this complex may be involved in the negative regulation of zzso zzso The association of zzso with zzso zzso occurs in zzso zzso and involves the zzso domain of zzso because it was markedly reduced by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso tail of the zzso Most interestingly, the reduction of the interaction between zzso and zzso by using these zzso also decreases zzso cell zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso associates with zzso zzso and that this complex may play an important role in zzso regulation and zzso
