zzso proteins constitute the largest zzso of the Ras zzso of zzso zzso and are regulators of zzso protein zzso Their slow intrinsic zzso activity zzso zzso at 30 degrees zzso has to be accelerated to switch the active to the inactive zzso We have identified the zzso domain within the zzso halves of two zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso with specificity for zzso zzso The zzso active fragments of zzso and zzso were more active than the full-length proteins and accelerated the intrinsic zzso zzso rates of their preferred zzso by factors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for the zzso and zzso active fragments zzso and 42 zzso zzso indicate that the affinities of those zzso for their zzso are very zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso contain five zzso zzso zzso zzso of only one of them zzso in zzso and zzso in the analogous position of zzso rendered the zzso almost completely zzso We suggest that zzso like zzso and zzso follow the same mode of action and provide a zzso zzso zzso zzso in trans to accelerate the zzso zzso rate of the transport zzso
