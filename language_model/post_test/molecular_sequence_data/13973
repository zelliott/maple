The unfolding and zzso processes of zzso coli zzso zzso at 25 degrees C, induced by concentration jumps of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso were investigated using zzso circular zzso zzso zzso fluorescence, and zzso zzso Only a single exponential process was detected for the fast time scale unfolding zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso depending on the final zzso zzso For zzso the zzso CD value largely recovered within 50 zzso of the zzso mixing dead time zzso zzso This phase was followed by either one or two zzso with rate zzso from zzso to zzso zzso as detected by CD and fluorescence, zzso Although this protein has a single zzso zzso a very slow phase due to zzso zzso was not observed, for either unfolding or zzso The difference in the zzso of the burst zzso for zzso in the zzso and zzso CD zzso revealed that an intermediate state exists, with the characteristics of a molten zzso Because the zzso fast exponential process detected by CD zzso to the slower of the two zzso detected by fluorescence, the intermediate detected by CD might be the most zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that this intermediate zzso zzso with a transition zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The Gibbs free energy difference zzso zzso between the intermediate and the unfolded states, under zzso conditions zzso degrees C, pH zzso and 0 M zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is reasonable to assume that the zzso zzso rather than the unfolded state, is the zzso zzso state under zzso zzso zzso linear relationships between the zzso concentration and the zzso of the microscopic rate zzso determined by CD and zzso were also zzso By zzso to a zzso concentration of 0 M, zzso Gibbs free energies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for unfolding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso under zzso conditions were zzso The zzso competition combined with two-dimensional zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso I are the most highly protected, suggesting that zzso I is the initial site of protein zzso The CD and zzso data showed that the intermediate state has a structure similar to that of the zzso molten zzso
