zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by one or more zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the past, zzso infection in cattle in Australia was largely zzso and recognized to be associated with zzso zzso However, outbreaks of zzso have occurred in beef and dairy cattle in zzso zzso regions (New South zzso of zzso There is also one published report of a recent zzso outbreak in a beef farm near Seymour in the zzso state of zzso In order to gain an improved insight into the genetic composition of zzso populations following this outbreak, we undertook zzso an integrated zzso zzso zzso analysis of sequence variation in part of the major zzso surface protein zzso gene within and among samples from cattle involved in the zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso of 94 cattle in the Seymour zzso the genetic analysis showed that the zzso and zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso complex were detected in 75 and zzso of 84 infected zzso respectively, and that mixed populations of these two zzso were found in zzso of infected zzso Given unpublished reports of a significant increase in the number of outbreaks in Victoria, future investigations should focus sharply on zzso the epidemiology of zzso to zzso the economic impact on the cattle industry in this zzso Although used here to explore genetic variation within the zzso zzso complex in Australia, a zzso zzso approach has broad zzso to other species of zzso in other zzso
