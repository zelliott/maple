zzso vaccination is a new approach to treat patients with chronic zzso B virus zzso We have used the zzso model to examine the efficacy and safety of this zzso 

Seven zzso chronically infected with zzso zzso virus were zzso with surface zzso from this virus, zzso from zzso in conjunction with a zzso named zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso from zzso whale zzso which is recognized by T helper zzso As controls, two zzso chronically infected with zzso zzso virus were zzso one with zzso only and the other with surface zzso zzso 

zzso with surface zzso and zzso but not with zzso or surface zzso alone, induced zzso zzso in 7/7 zzso zzso In the two zzso in which the highest zzso of zzso zzso was zzso severe liver damage was zzso one died of zzso zzso and the other became seriously ill with zzso injury and had to be zzso 

zzso of chronically infected zzso with surface zzso and a zzso recognized by T helper cells produces a good zzso zzso zzso However, this strategy needs to be zzso before its zzso in zzso Although our experiments are not strictly comparable to vaccination of chronically zzso B zzso patients with zzso or zzso vaccines, we believe that precautions should be taken to avoid the risk of severe liver injury when zzso zzso B virus zzso
