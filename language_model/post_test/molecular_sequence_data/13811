We attempted to reverse zzso resistance zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso the sequences of which are sense or zzso to the initiation zzso of mouse zzso zzso were tested against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso A weak zzso effect on the growth of zzso and zzso cells was observed at a sense and zzso zzso concentration of 30 zzso Using the zzso zzso to zzso and a flow zzso technique, we showed that the level of expression of zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso was lower than when treated with sense zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells, whereas sense zzso did zzso This was accompanied by an increase in zzso retention in the zzso The reversal of the resistance by zzso zzso was increased by the combination with 1 zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso and low dose zzso may be useful in zzso the resistance to zzso drugs of zzso zzso
