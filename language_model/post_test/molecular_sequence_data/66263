In an attempt to determine how the folding dynamics of zzso zzso vary with the strand number, we have studied the zzso relaxation zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso induced relaxation of zzso occurs on the zzso time zzso however, a comparison of the current results with those obtained on a zzso zzso zzso suggests that increasing the strand number from three to four increases the folding free energy barrier by a minimum of zzso zzso depending on the folding zzso zzso these results together suggest that the relaxation zzso of zzso can be analyzed according to a two-state model even though its folding may actually involve parallel (but zzso or nearly zzso kinetic zzso The apparent, two-state folding time of zzso is determined to be approximately zzso zzso at the zzso melting temperature, which makes it one of the fastest folders known to zzso
