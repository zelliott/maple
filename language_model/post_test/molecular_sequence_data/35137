In the Netherlands, a selective zzso B virus zzso vaccination zzso started in 2002 for men having sex with men, drug users, commercial sex workers and heterosexuals with frequent partner zzso We assessed the zzso effectiveness to guide policy on zzso zzso 

We zzso reports of acute zzso infection in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 requesting serum from patients for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso analyses to assess genetic diversity of zzso zzso cases over zzso 

zzso patients with acute zzso infection were reported between 2004 and zzso The zzso of reported acute zzso infection decreased from zzso to zzso per 100,000 zzso mostly due to a reduction in the number of cases in men who have sex with zzso Men were overrepresented among cases with an unknown route of transmission, especially among zzso zzso cases mainly associated with transmission through male homosexual zzso The genetic diversity of zzso zzso strains obtained from men who have sex with men decreased from 2006 zzso suggesting zzso zzso in this group zzso 

The selective zzso zzso for zzso high-risk groups very likely reduced the zzso of zzso infection in the Netherlands mainly by preventing zzso infections in men who have sex with zzso A considerable proportion of cases in men who did not report risk zzso was probably acquired through homosexual zzso Our findings support continuation of the zzso and adopting similar approaches in other countries where zzso transmission is focused in high-risk zzso
