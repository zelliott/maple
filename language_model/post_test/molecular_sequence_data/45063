zzso is a global regulator of zzso in zzso zzso It zzso during growth genes required for adaptation to zzso zzso including zzso genes in some human zzso zzso activity is regulated by zzso and zzso chain zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso drop as cells enter stationary zzso Although zzso has a highly zzso zzso it has no significant similarity to proteins of known zzso Here we report crystal structures of two fragments of zzso from zzso zzso that clearly constitute its zzso and DNA binding zzso and reveal that zzso is a zzso of previously observed folding zzso The zzso zzso zzso adopts a fold reminiscent of the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is a zzso stabilized by an zzso six zzso bundle that zzso an extensive zzso surface rich in zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso chain zzso acid zzso reside in zzso pockets of each zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso DNA binding domain belongs to the winged zzso zzso The implications of the structure for DNA binding by zzso and its control by zzso binding are zzso
