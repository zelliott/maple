zzso research for the discovery of new generation zzso is one of the most active areas of zzso In the search of zzso zzso objects, plant virus particles appear as zzso defined entities that can be formed by protein zzso In particular, in the field of plant zzso there is plenty of literature available describing the exploitation of plant viral cages to produce safe vaccine vehicles and zzso for drug zzso In this context, we have investigated on the use of the artichoke zzso zzso virus zzso zzso both as a carrier of zzso zzso and for the delivery of zzso zzso A dual approach that combines both in zzso tools and experimental zzso was applied for the rational design of zzso active zzso zzso particles zzso carrying zzso zzso The atomic structures of wild type zzso and zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso The effects of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the structural stability of zzso zzso were predicted and assessed by detailed inspection of the zzso zzso interactions at atomic zzso zzso and zzso zzso exposing on their surface the zzso zzso were successfully produced in zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso zzso could also function as drug delivery vehicles able to load the zzso drug zzso To our knowledge, this is the first systematic zzso and empirical research addressing the question of how this zzso virus can be used for the production of both zzso and viral zzso for biomedical zzso
