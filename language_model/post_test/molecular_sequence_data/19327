The zzso position of a group of fluorescent zzso strains isolated from the zzso of grasses was investigated through a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed highly similar patterns for the investigated strains which supported, together with the agreement of many zzso zzso their affiliation to the same zzso A comparison of zzso zzso gene sequences of strain P zzso a representative strain from the grass zzso revealed that it was affiliated to the cluster of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as the closest zzso zzso However, zzso zzso showed a clear zzso at the species level between strain P zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a comparison of zzso patterns with zzso species zzso next to the novel grass zzso on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences supported their separate species status at the zzso zzso Based on zzso features, the novel zzso could also be differentiated from the other fluorescent zzso species that share positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a consequence of these zzso and zzso zzso the zzso from the grass zzso represent a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is P zzso zzso zzso zzso
