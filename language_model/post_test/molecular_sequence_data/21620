The zzso complex mediates the assembly of zzso zzso protein rings on small nuclear zzso zzso which are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso core assembly depends on zzso proteins and zzso recognition by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which the zzso proteins are gathered while preventing illicit zzso assembly on zzso is zzso Here, we describe the zzso crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain, a key assembly zzso zzso through its extended zzso zzso wraps around the zzso zzso interacting with all five zzso zzso and gripping its bottom and top sides and outer zzso zzso reaches into the zzso pocket, preventing zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso interaction is zzso by a spinal muscular zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso These findings provide insight into zzso complex assembly and zzso linking zzso zzso and zzso zzso
