Human zzso 3A zzso degrades zzso the major inhibitor of zzso function, thus zzso zzso zzso Of the 11 human zzso only zzso and zzso have zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso Their function is not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso High pressure liquid zzso zzso analysis of a zzso digest yielded an zzso within the insert of zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso site exists within the zzso Because zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso A zzso model showed that zzso is zzso zzso from the zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso zzso away from zzso zzso has an altered zzso but no change in zzso zzso of wild type but not zzso is inhibited by an zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is modified by zzso and involved in zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso acid in zzso is zzso we prepared the zzso zzso and found that its zzso and zzso were similar to the wild zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso to wild type, suggesting that the zzso may, like the zzso serve as a H zzso zzso analyses of nine additional insert zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit an altered zzso but not zzso indicating that zzso is zzso We document a new functional role for the insert in which zzso binding may produce a zzso zzso This change would allow the zzso to bind to zzso and other zzso acids in the insert to interact with zzso important for zzso in the active site zzso
