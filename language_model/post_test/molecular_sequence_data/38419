zzso zzso activity has been shown to play a critical role in cell growth control, regulating the expression of a variety of genes that zzso proteins important for the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle zzso We have shown that the zzso locus encodes two protein zzso the zzso product, which is tightly regulated by cell growth, and the zzso product, which is zzso expressed throughout the cell zzso To further explore the mechanism controlling the expression of the two zzso gene products, we analyzed the zzso sequences zzso the zzso region of zzso and zzso We find that a series of zzso binding sites zzso negative control on the zzso promoter in zzso cells, similar to the control of the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a group of zzso zzso which are zzso binding sites, zzso responsiveness to zzso and are necessary for full zzso of the zzso promoter in response to growth zzso Based on these results and past experiments, it appears that the zzso zzso and zzso genes are similarly regulated by growth zzso involving a combination of zzso negative control and zzso positive zzso In contrast, the zzso expression of the zzso gene more closely reflects the control of expression of the zzso and zzso zzso
