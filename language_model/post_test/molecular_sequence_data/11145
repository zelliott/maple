zzso fatty acids are the primary source of energy production in the zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso the first reaction in the transport of zzso fatty acids from the zzso to the zzso a zzso step in zzso In this study, we report the functional expression of the human zzso muscle zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a human heart zzso library with zzso fragments zzso the rat heart zzso resulted in the isolation of a single full-length human heart zzso zzso zzso The clone has an open reading frame of zzso zzso with a zzso untranslated region of 38 zzso and a zzso 3' untranslated region with the zzso addition sequence zzso The predicted protein has zzso zzso acids and a molecular mass of 88 zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from different human zzso using the human zzso zzso as a probe revealed an abundant transcript of approximately zzso zzso that was only present in human heart and skeletal muscle zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso with no zzso zzso activity, produced an zzso protein that was located in the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso expression strain exhibited a zzso A zzso zzso activity that was zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was 69 zzso and the zzso for zzso and zzso were 666 and 42 zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso of the heart zzso is 30 times lower than that of the zzso liver zzso and the zzso for zzso is more than 20 times higher than that of the liver zzso This is the first report of the expression of a heart zzso in a system devoid of zzso zzso activity and the functional characterization of a human heart zzso in the absence of the liver zzso and zzso
