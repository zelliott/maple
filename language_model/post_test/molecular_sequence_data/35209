To analyze zzso gene zzso in a Chinese family with zzso zzso zzso and to provide zzso prenatal diagnosis for a zzso 

zzso scanning was carried out with zzso and bilateral direct sequencing in 2 affected and 6 unaffected individuals from the zzso After the zzso was confirmed, prenatal diagnosis was performed on zzso zzso samples obtained at 11th zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was discovered in all of the patients, which has led to substitution of zzso by zzso at zzso 11 zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso diagnosis indicated that the fetus had also carried the same zzso zzso Following termination of the pregnancy, analysis of the aborted zzso was consistent with prenatal zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene probably zzso the disease in this zzso zzso diagnosis with DNA sequencing can facilitate genetic counseling of this zzso
