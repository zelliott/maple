zzso zzso associated with zzso disease possess an zzso gene organization consisting of a single zzso zzso gene followed by a zzso of several zzso and a tandem repeat of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns for these genes have been widely used to zzso zzso disease zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso gene organization and sequences for two zzso zzso zzso from Japan zzso and zzso and two group zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso ticks or rabbits from North America zzso zzso and zzso This analysis revealed unique zzso not previously described in other zzso disease zzso zzso The molecular basis of these zzso was determined by Southern zzso and zzso zzso Only one continuous copy of the zzso gene cluster was identified in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The second zzso gene cluster is entirely absent from the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso an intervening sequence is present, resulting in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso site of this intervening sequence element differed in each zzso While zzso zzso and zzso were found to carry a fragmented zzso zzso they lacked zzso To determine if these zzso zzso were indicative of an underlying zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso genes was zzso The zzso zzso from zzso sequence analysis suggest that the zzso resulted from recent zzso zzso In addition, the zzso analyses also support the proposed species status of zzso zzso zzso zzso and indicate that zzso of zzso group zzso belong to a previously zzso species for which we propose the nomenclature zzso zzso zzso zzso
