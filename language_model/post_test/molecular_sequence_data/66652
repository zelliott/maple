In zzso coli, the global regulatory protein zzso zzso store regulator zzso binds to leader segments of target zzso affecting their translation and zzso zzso activity is regulated by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which act by zzso multiple zzso zzso Here, we describe a protein zzso that controls the degradation of zzso zzso The dramatic stabilization of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso altered the expression of zzso genes in a manner predicted from the previously described zzso regulatory zzso A zzso in zzso zzso the primary zzso involved in zzso zzso also stabilized zzso although the zzso of other zzso that are zzso for zzso E zzso zzso and zzso were unaffected by zzso Analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso suggested that zzso is not a zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein contains zzso and zzso zzso yet unlike typical proteins in this large zzso its activity in the regulation of zzso zzso does not involve zzso zzso zzso The two predicted zzso regions are zzso for zzso activity, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Thus, these studies demonstrate a novel process for the selective targeting of zzso molecules for degradation by zzso E and a novel function for a zzso zzso
