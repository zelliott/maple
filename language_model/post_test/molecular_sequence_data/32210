zzso out mice deficient for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso display residual zzso oxide zzso activity and zzso To attribute this signal to the two minor zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso against the zzso specific zzso motif involved in zzso domain scaffolding and the zzso specific zzso The zzso zzso zzso clearly recognized the zzso band of zzso zzso on Western zzso Using zzso this zzso displayed, in rats and zzso mice, a labeling pattern similar to but not identical with that obtained using a commercial zzso zzso This similarity indicates that the majority of zzso zzso zzso is not likely to be zzso with zzso proteins via the zzso zzso This conclusion was confirmed by the zzso of zzso interaction by the zzso zzso zzso in pull-down zzso By contrast, zzso zzso labeling was clearly reduced in zzso and cortical zzso areas enriched in zzso zzso complex containing spine zzso In zzso knock out mice, zzso was not zzso whereas the zzso zzso showed a distinct labeling of cell bodies throughout the brain, most likely reflecting zzso in these zzso The zzso zzso clearly detected bacterial expressed zzso fusion protein and zzso in zzso zzso cells by Western zzso zzso individual cell bodies in zzso cerebral cortex, and in some brain stem zzso were labeled in knock out but not in zzso mice, indicating an zzso of zzso in zzso deficient zzso
