The zzso shows vast zzso variations among different zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso zzso controls zzso in the mouse zzso and is also expressed in the zzso zzso of the evolutionary distant zzso The upstream regions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso several stretches of zzso zzso Here, we show that the upstream region of zzso zzso is capable of faithfully zzso zzso expression in the zzso and mouse zzso A single zzso regulatory region is essential for zzso zzso expression in the zzso and for expression in the zzso zzso of the zzso However, a second zzso region that is inactive in the fish zzso is necessary for expression in the lateral zzso of mouse zzso This regulatory region, which drives expression in the zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso activity and binds zzso zzso in zzso Thus, the regulatory elements of zzso appear to be zzso among zzso with certain differences being incorporated in the zzso of these zzso for the acquisition of more advanced features in zzso Our data provide evidence for the zzso of regulatory regions as a mechanism of evolutionary diversification of expression patterns, and suggest that an zzso in zzso expression was crucial in zzso zzso
