zzso hormone responsive protein zzso also known as Spot 14 and zzso is a zzso and zzso nuclear protein specific to liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso functions to activate genes zzso zzso synthesis zzso Recent studies have shown that in some zzso human zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and is zzso suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso during zzso zzso a member of the Spot 14 zzso is an zzso zzso protein with no sequence similarity to other zzso gene products and its zzso function is zzso To shed light on the zzso relationship of this zzso human zzso was zzso zzso human zzso zzso the zzso truncated human zzso zzso and their zzso zzso derivatives were expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were grown at zzso using zzso as a zzso Using zzso radiation, data for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were collected to zzso zzso and zzso resolution, respectively, at zzso The zzso of full-length zzso and its zzso zzso belonged to space group zzso with approximate zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of the truncated zzso and its zzso zzso belonged to space group zzso with approximate zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso solution calculated using a zzso Spot 14 structure as a search model indicated the presence of six molecules per zzso unit, zzso three zzso zzso
