Recently, mice with a disrupted zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso were produced by gene zzso To examine the role of zzso zzso type I in the regulation of zzso calcium concentration zzso of zzso cells, zzso was measured with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined in zzso medium before and after the addition of zzso M zzso zzso and zzso M zzso II zzso The expression of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and hormone receptors in the zzso from these animals also was measured by quantitative reverse zzso with specific zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and zzso zzso zzso type 1, and zzso receptors zzso A and zzso In zzso zzso the shorter zzso of zzso zzso type 1, which lacks the first zzso is zzso zzso zzso and the responses to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso 7 zzso to 73 zzso 7 zzso zzso 66 zzso 6 to 91 zzso 8 zzso were significantly lower than those in the zzso mice zzso 93 zzso 13 zzso to 162 zzso 13 zzso zzso 87 zzso 7 to 147 zzso 9 zzso P zzso zzso for both zzso without significant changes in zzso expression of hormone zzso The results with quantitative reverse zzso also revealed that zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene family was not significantly different between the two zzso The present study clearly shows that zzso zzso type 1 plays a major role in the regulation of zzso in the zzso and that lack of an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso does not induce expression of the other zzso of the zzso zzso
