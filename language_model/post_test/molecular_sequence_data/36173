One alpha zzso and three different zzso zzso clones were isolated from a chicken lens zzso library by using zzso zzso The sequence of alpha zzso zzso showed more than zzso zzso with zzso of alpha zzso genes of the human and zzso Two zzso zzso showed almost identical sequences with previously reported chicken beta zzso and beta zzso zzso The remainder showed zzso zzso of sequence with bovine beta zzso zzso Using these newly cloned zzso in addition to zzso of alpha A- and zzso we examined the expression pattern of these zzso in the process of zzso of cultured lens zzso cells of the zzso All zzso except zzso were expressed through the period of cell culture, but three zzso were expressed only after the zzso zzso These results suggest that: zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso can be used to detect differentiation of the lens zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are superior in the detection of chicken lens zzso differentiation in zzso to zzso zzso which is zzso expressed by various zzso zzso
