Previous experiments have established that in certain synthetic zzso DNA zzso including zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso base pairs form to the exclusion of neighboring zzso zzso zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso & Gray, zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso In the present work, circular zzso and other zzso were used to study DNA zzso that represented two additional classes with respect to the formation of zzso and/or zzso base zzso zzso One class included two sets of repeating zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso For both of these sets of zzso an increase in the magnitude of the zzso positive CD band centered at about 280 zzso occurred as the pH was lowered from 7 to 5 at zzso and zzso M zzso indicating that zzso base pairs zzso Even though it may have been possible for these zzso to form duplexes with two zzso zzso base pairs per zzso no zzso base pairing was detected by monitoring the CD changes at 250 zzso Thus, spectral data showed that as few as zzso zzso base pairs were stable in two sets of zzso in which zzso base pairs did not form adjacent to, or in place of, zzso base zzso zzso Another class of zzso was represented by zzso which was studied by CD, zzso and zzso zzso We confirmed previous work that this sequence was able to form both types of base pairs as the pH and temperature were lowered zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
