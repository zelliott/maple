The zzso zzso complex is a terminal zzso zzso in the zzso respiratory chain of zzso coli and is zzso by the zzso zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso O at the zzso zzso site is essential for zzso zzso pumping by the zzso and suggested that the zzso gene encodes a novel zzso for zzso O zzso zzso IX zzso zzso O zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study was focused to define the zzso zzso of the zzso protein via a zzso zzso zzso We have individually zzso 40 zzso acid zzso including 22 zzso zzso with zzso and found that 23 zzso zzso were zzso and exhibited a specific loss of the CO binding activity at the site of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which represent the zzso of different zzso zzso revealed that their defects are attributable to substitution of zzso IX for zzso O present in the zzso zzso zzso Based on the above zzso we suggest that the zzso zzso acid zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are part of the zzso center of zzso O zzso
