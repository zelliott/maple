zzso genes are considered to have a high degree of sequence conservation between species and also at higher zzso zzso In this paper we document a case where a single individual of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso plant, contains highly divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification a nearly complete zzso DNA zzso was performed using zzso DNA, the products zzso and the zzso zzso genes were zzso from 19 zzso Of these, five distinct types were zzso Fifteen of the sequences were nearly identical (11 or fewer zzso and these were designated Type zzso The remaining types zzso were each represented by a single clone and differed from Type I by 93 to 255 zzso Compared with green vascular plants, we found that there are more zzso differences in the zzso zzso sequences within a single individual of zzso than among all zzso zzso vascular zzso Several trends of molecular evolution observed in zzso zzso from other zzso zzso and zzso green algae have been also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso structures were constructed for representatives of the five clone types, and in all cases these possessed complete zzso of the major structural elements present in functional zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that such molecules may be subject to zzso selection, thus providing indirect evidence that they have retained some degree of zzso This zzso zzso is probably a case of zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso to the nucleus or zzso has not been tested and therefore cannot be ruled zzso
