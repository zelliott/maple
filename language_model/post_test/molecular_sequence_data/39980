zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that uses hydrogen gas as an electron donor for carbon dioxide fixation during zzso growth or for zzso synthesis during nitrogen zzso It also uses hydrogen as an electron supplement to enable the complete zzso of oxidized carbon compounds, such as zzso into cell material during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso predicts a zzso zzso zzso zzso and several regulatory proteins to control zzso zzso There is also a novel sensor zzso gene zzso directly adjacent to the zzso gene zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso regulatory sensor zzso zzso acts in conjunction with the sensor zzso regulator protein pair zzso to activate zzso expression in response to hydrogen zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso regulatory system also controls the expression of genes zzso a predicted zzso acid transport system, a putative zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso had a small effect in zzso zzso zzso We also determined that the zzso system zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso probably in response to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that about 30 genes were zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells that zzso hydrogen when growing zzso on zzso under zzso conditions compared to a zzso strain that lacked zzso zzso From this it appears that the recycling of zzso in the form of hydrogen does not have extensive zzso effects on gene expression in zzso zzso
