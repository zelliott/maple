Breast cancer is a common disease found among women and has been a serious issue for last two zzso Although various kinds of heat shock proteins zzso have strong implications in cancer, heat shock protein 90 alpha zzso has attracted highest attention for the cause and therapy of breast zzso It regulates approximately 200 numbers of proteins known as client proteins including large number of zzso found to be zzso in many cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a common therapeutic approach pursued in many zzso However, zzso zzso both natural and chemical, reported so far are plagued with problems related to zzso zzso and zzso including zzso the most common zzso zzso zzso search for a suitable zzso inhibitor is an urgent zzso 

Here we zzso that zzso organizing protein zzso helps in the interaction of zzso with zzso which is the key to appropriate zzso function of zzso and therefore, zzso such interaction might lead to the disruption of zzso protein complex, which in turn destabilize and degrade client zzso We further zzso that considering the zzso involved in the reaction we can design novel zzso based zzso zzso 

In our present in zzso investigation, we hypothesized that the zzso function of zzso requires the complex formation with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We performed the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso Based on the key zzso involved in the interaction between zzso and zzso we designed ten peptides having twelve zzso acids zzso We zzso the designed peptides with zzso using zzso software zzso zzso and the zzso with the highest binding energy value was zzso Using the online zzso program, we assessed their zzso zzso zzso properties were also considered and based on that five different peptides were again zzso Several modifications incorporated onto the zzso led to the design of five different zzso 

The zzso with the lowest zzso properties and highest binding energy for zzso was the criteria laid for selection as an zzso Its potential to bind zzso and disrupt zzso complex was subsequently investigated using both wild as well as zzso zzso as a client zzso 

The predicted binding energy values showed that our designed novel zzso demonstrated strong binding affinity for zzso zzso the binding affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was shown to be reduced substantially indicating a strong zzso potential of the designed zzso zzso zzso for zzso
