The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA segment from the left arm of zzso zzso zzso IV is zzso An analysis of this segment revealed 11 open reading frames zzso longer than 300 zzso and one split zzso These zzso include the genes zzso the large zzso of zzso zzso II, the zzso zzso zzso an zzso factor zzso zzso the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, and the sequence zzso the protein zzso zzso Further sequence analysis revealed a short zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso an zzso in a zzso untranslated region and an extended zzso with another zzso zzso located on the same zzso The potential biological relevance of these findings is zzso
