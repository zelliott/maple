In zzso the synthesis of zzso peptides in response to microbial infections is under the control of the Toll and immune zzso zzso signaling zzso The Toll signaling zzso responds mainly to zzso bacterial and zzso infection while the zzso zzso mediates the response to zzso zzso zzso recognition upstream of Toll zzso at least in part, zzso recognition proteins zzso The sensing of zzso bacteria is zzso by the pattern recognition receptors zzso and zzso binding protein 1 zzso that cooperate to detect the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso Recently it has been shown that a zzso zzso in zzso recognition protein zzso zzso severely zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we have solved the crystal structure of zzso at zzso zzso zzso with available structures of zzso in complex with their zzso zzso zzso strongly suggests a zzso acid zzso specificity for zzso This result is supported by pull-down zzso with zzso zzso In addition we show that Toll zzso zzso after infection by zzso zzso containing bacteria is clearly reduced in zzso zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that the role of zzso is the recognition of zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of the Toll zzso by zzso zzso
