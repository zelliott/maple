DNA zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of DNA zzso break repair in zzso cells, and defects in it cause zzso at the cellular and zzso zzso Central to zzso is the protein complex containing DNA zzso IV and zzso By searching for additional zzso factors, we identified a previously zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso factor zzso also named zzso that has weak sequence zzso with zzso and is predicted to display structural similarity to zzso We show that zzso directly interacts with the zzso IV complex in zzso and in zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso in human cell lines leads to zzso and impaired zzso Furthermore, we establish that zzso zzso cells derived from a zzso and zzso patient lack zzso due to an zzso zzso zzso in its zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso into such cells zzso their zzso and zzso zzso zzso thus constitutes a novel core component of the zzso zzso zzso
