The modification of a zzso zzso by a fatty acid such as zzso acid is now recognized as a mean to induce cellular zzso zzso of zzso obtained by combining individually zzso compounds, were shown to be promising synthetic vaccine zzso Usually, in zzso zzso the fatty zzso zzso is introduced on the crude zzso chain using zzso zzso The separation of the target compound from zzso by zzso is often complicated by the zzso properties of zzso and results in low overall zzso To overcome the difficulties associated with zzso synthesis and mixture preparation, we have developed a method where the fatty zzso zzso is zzso and collectively introduced in solution onto a mixture of individually zzso zzso The zzso is based on the zzso and high-yielding zzso of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso were prepared in a zzso medium and could be isolated by direct zzso of the reaction zzso This process is compatible with zzso zzso and no zzso nor degradation could be zzso
