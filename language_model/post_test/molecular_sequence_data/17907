Models for the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso These models have been developed by using the concept of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of receptors that have evolved from a common zzso An initial component of the binding site was identified as a highly zzso zzso stretch of primary structure in the zzso zzso region of all known zzso zzso based on aligned sequence data of zzso This zzso termed the zzso was zzso as an zzso zzso and we propose that it forms a major zzso of the binding zzso for zzso This initial, partial zzso model has been extended to include zzso zzso identified as zzso adjacent to the binding zzso A recently developed technique for rapidly scanning the known protein structural database for zzso zzso using just sequence information identified the known structure of the zzso zzso zzso as a candidate scaffold for the zzso domain of the zzso This similarity was investigated further using sequence zzso A framework model of the full zzso domain in which the position of the zzso and other zzso zzso as well as the main zzso region zzso have been mapped on to the zzso zzso
