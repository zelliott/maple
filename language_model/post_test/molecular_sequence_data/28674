We have cloned a basic zzso zzso factor zzso zzso from a mouse zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso and genetic mapping place zzso at the zzso end of mouse zzso 2 zzso zzso to human zzso zzso Based on zzso analysis, zzso belongs to a new zzso of zzso factors including at least four previously identified mouse zzso factors: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the developing nervous system, zzso was found to mark the zzso boundary, suggesting that zzso may have a role in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is expressed in a transient fashion that suggests a role in the pancreatic zzso cell zzso zzso experiments show that zzso can repress zzso zzso zzso through the pancreatic zzso specific insulin promoter zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso may zzso the expression of genes required for the differentiation and/or maintenance of pancreatic and zzso cell zzso
