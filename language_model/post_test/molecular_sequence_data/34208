Genome and zzso sequencing yield extensive zzso of human genetic zzso However, zzso the few zzso zzso zzso among the many zzso present in human zzso remains a major challenge, particularly for rare and complex traits wherein genetic information alone is often zzso Here, we review approaches to estimate the zzso of single zzso zzso zzso which can be used to prioritize zzso zzso We describe recent advances in comparative and functional zzso that enable systematic zzso of both coding and zzso zzso Application and zzso of these methods will be essential to find the genetic answers that sequencing promises to hide in plain zzso
