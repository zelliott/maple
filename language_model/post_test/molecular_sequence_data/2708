A number of zzso chemical zzso induce zzso DNA zzso For example, zzso zzso a zzso of vinyl zzso readily zzso with zzso DNA to predominantly form zzso zzso Here, we report on in zzso zzso caused by zzso treatment of DNA in zzso These experiments used partially duplex zzso zzso zzso form DNA in which a part of the zzso gene sequence was held in zzso form to direct reaction with zzso zzso partial duplex DNA was zzso into zzso coli, and the induced base changes were defined by DNA zzso These experiments suggested that zzso treatment induced zzso at zzso much less efficiently at zzso but not at zzso or zzso Among zzso targeted to zzso zzso were zzso transitions and zzso were zzso zzso Application of a zzso method detected zzso formation of zzso and zzso in zzso treated zzso These data indicate that zzso is a highly efficient zzso with properties suggestive of a zzso DNA zzso in zzso Paradoxically, zzso are efficiently zzso by a mechanism which appears to be largely zzso
