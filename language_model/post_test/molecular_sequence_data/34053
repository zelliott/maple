The zzso family, with about 20 members in humans, is composed of zzso zzso proteins and is linked to a range of serious human diseases, including cancer and zzso and neurological zzso The oldest zzso family members are found in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was suggested as a promising model system for in zzso studies on zzso family functions, and we chose to investigate zzso zzso as the closest zzso of the zzso human zzso Here, we report the first crystal structure of an zzso protein from this zzso the zzso state of zzso to zzso zzso Crystal packing suggests zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso interface very similar to, but even more extensive than, that reported for zzso The interactions are primarily through the zzso zzso zzso from adjacent zzso in an zzso zzso zzso comparisons between known zzso zzso zzso together with analysis of zzso changes to the zzso zzso suggest a mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
