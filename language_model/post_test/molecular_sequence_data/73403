Based on the similar effects of zzso zzso and human type I zzso on zzso of zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso class I and II zzso zzso we compared zzso acid sequences of human zzso with zzso zzso and found zzso existing between zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso of zzso individuals zzso zzso using zzso column could recognize human zzso in zzso but no zzso against zzso was detected if zzso were prepared in the same way from pooled zzso zzso Besides, a sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso soluble zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso may share an zzso zzso with zzso We examined 40 zzso from healthy and zzso zzso individuals and zzso for zzso zzso levels by zzso The levels of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso individuals zzso A, zzso zzso 6) was increased by about zzso in comparison with zzso but the zzso levels were obviously reduced in the case of symptomatic zzso individuals zzso B, zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso C, zzso zzso 7) in comparison with zzso zzso individuals zzso zzso We suppose that the increased zzso level in zzso individuals zzso zzso may be due to this common zzso zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso zzso with zzso
