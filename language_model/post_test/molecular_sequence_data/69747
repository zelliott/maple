Eight zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared successfully by zzso DNA synthesis using the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and released from the support by zzso zzso at room temperature for zzso h or by zzso zzso in zzso at 55 degrees C for 15 zzso zzso by zzso and fully zzso About 6 zzso of zzso zzso and 7 zzso of zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso were consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also zzso to afford the corresponding zzso zzso zzso formed stable zzso duplexes with both the fully complementary zzso and a zzso zzso the zzso zzso complement, and identical melting temperatures were observed for both zzso The zzso zzso study of these duplexes is presently under zzso
