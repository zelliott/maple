The nuclear zzso zzso is a zzso factor essential for the development of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Recent crystal structures of the zzso zzso binding domain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso revealed that, although these receptors share the classical zzso architecture, they lack a zzso binding zzso This volume is instead filled with bulky zzso side zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso binding groove is filled with polar side zzso thus, the regulation of zzso by this zzso of nuclear zzso zzso may be zzso by some other interaction surface on the zzso We report here the identification of a novel zzso interface on the zzso of zzso We used an zzso zzso strategy that zzso the identification of an interaction surface without the need of a full zzso We found that zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso and zzso bind to a zzso patch on the zzso of zzso This binding surface involves a groove between zzso 11 and zzso zzso in this site abolish zzso by the zzso zzso These findings give insight into the unique mechanism of action of this class of nuclear zzso
