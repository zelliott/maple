Research on zzso variation in zzso is scarce, and in zzso zzso of fish, virtually zzso In this study, seven zzso obtained from zzso affected by zzso in different parts of the zzso Peninsula zzso Spain and southwest zzso were zzso and genetically characterized to investigate the zzso divergence in these zzso zzso The zzso were stained with zzso silver zzso and examined in an optical zzso all were found to have the typical zzso characteristics described for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sixteen zzso characteristics of the seven zzso were used in a zzso discrimination analysis zzso to select a subset of those that best identified each zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso length of the zzso length of the zzso field, the body zzso zzso ratio, the body zzso the zzso zzso and the distance between zzso and zzso were the most important zzso variables for discriminating the zzso The first three zzso functions accounted for zzso of the total zzso The scatter plots of the first two zzso variables grouped and separated the zzso zzso zzso into five zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso also indicated zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso Nuclear markers (a zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso gene were then used to investigate the zzso genetic variation in zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso sequences of seven zzso revealed a high degree of zzso genetic variation among the zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso genes revealed six zzso (and zzso in both zzso however, analysis of the zzso zzso gene revealed only two zzso The results show clear zzso variation at zzso and genetic levels in the zzso zzso zzso and verify the suitability of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso genes for detecting zzso genetic variation within populations of zzso that zzso cultured zzso The existence of this zzso variation must be taken into account in the design of an effective vaccine to control zzso
