Most zzso zzso in zzso zzso require zzso zzso zzso editing, a process zzso by guide zzso zzso and zzso by zzso complexes called zzso The six zzso binding zzso proteins zzso are a part of the common core of zzso They form a network of interactions among themselves as well as with the zzso and deletion zzso and are essential for the stability of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins bind zzso in zzso and are known to interact directly in zzso zzso zzso In this study, using several approaches we show a minimal interaction surface of the zzso protein that is required for this zzso By screening a series of zzso and zzso truncated zzso fragments, we show that a predicted zzso of zzso zzso is required for its interaction with zzso An zzso against the zzso zzso or zzso of this region can eliminate association with zzso while a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso can independently interact with zzso thereby supporting the identification of zzso zzso We also show that the predicted zzso of zzso independent of its interaction with zzso is responsible for the stable integration of zzso in the zzso and editing complexes zzso with the zzso zzso can catalyze zzso zzso zzso we conclude that while zzso interacts with zzso through the zzso region of its zzso the entire zzso is required for its integration in the functional zzso through additional zzso zzso
