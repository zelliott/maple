We assessed the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso using an automated DNA zzso and analysis zzso We evaluated 48 point zzso in a zzso stretch of mouse zzso The zzso included 10 zzso and 38 zzso and both types of zzso were compared at six different locations in the zzso zzso zzso of the red zzso internal standard fragments were zzso to size but highly zzso and were used to zzso or correct minor differences in apparent zzso mobility between zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were distinguished from wild type when run in separate lanes using one set of zzso zzso of wild type and zzso in the same lane resolved zzso of 45 zzso from wild zzso Under conditions of this study, the magnitude of mobility shifts resulting from the zzso zzso were largely determined by position of the zzso rather than by the nature of the substitution zzso zzso zzso However, examination of paired zzso at the same position revealed that some zzso cause greater mobility shifts than zzso
