Gene 4 of zzso zzso encodes two zzso zzso the zzso and zzso gene 4 zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso to 3' on zzso DNA using zzso zzso for energy and is a zzso The zzso gene 4 protein zzso all of the activities of the zzso gene 4 protein and, in addition, zzso the synthesis of zzso on zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in a putative zzso binding site of the zzso gene 4 protein were zzso by substituting Val and Met for zzso zzso zzso and zzso at positions 317 and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene 4 protein lacks the ability to catalyze the zzso of a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso reaction and zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene 4 zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso gene 4 protein on zzso zzso DNA and zzso of the zzso zzso activity on an zzso with a single zzso recognition zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene 4 protein stimulates the zzso zzso activity over zzso on zzso zzso DNA and zzso on zzso This increase in zzso activity zzso with an increase in the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso complex for zzso DNA zzso
