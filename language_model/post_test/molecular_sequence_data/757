DNA zzso and repair pathways require zzso zzso to process DNA structures that include zzso zzso and Holliday zzso Previously, we determined that the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso protein to produce zzso zzso and that zzso has a zzso role in zzso zzso zzso zzso The importance of zzso to pathways crucial for maintaining zzso stability in zzso prompted us to search for zzso in other zzso Based on zzso expression pattern, zzso zzso zzso and zzso repair function, we determined that the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso between these proteins and zzso zzso zzso helped identify a zzso interaction with a second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence described here and in related papers suggest that zzso and zzso direct Holliday junction resolution by at least two distinct zzso in different zzso and repair zzso
