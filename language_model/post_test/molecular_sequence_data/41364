zzso zzso zzso strains have been zzso linked with enhanced infection severity and risk of zzso toxic shock syndrome zzso a syndrome triggered by zzso stimulation of T zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains causing zzso demonstrated that zzso strains were surprisingly less zzso than other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso indicating poor zzso zzso We identified a 13 zzso deletion in the zzso zzso gene of all zzso strains zzso The deletion led to a premature stop zzso in zzso and was not present in other major zzso zzso zzso of a functional zzso gene successfully enhanced zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and also restored zzso activity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains where the zzso gene had been zzso In contrast, the zzso gene with the 13 zzso deletion could not enhance or restore zzso in any of these zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso is zzso regardless of strain zzso The zzso in zzso reduced the potential for zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso in human zzso but not during invasive infection of zzso zzso Notwithstanding zzso associations with zzso and disease severity, zzso strains have inherently poor zzso that is explained by a zzso zzso in zzso
