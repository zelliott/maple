To better define the role of B cells in the control of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso six zzso monkeys were depleted of B cells by intravenous infusion of zzso zzso 28 days and 7 days before zzso zzso zzso and every 21 days thereafter until AIDS zzso Although the blood and zzso were similarly depleted of B cells, zzso zzso G zzso zzso responses were completely blocked in only three of the six zzso In all six animals, levels of viral zzso zzso in plasma peaked at 2 weeks and declined by 4 weeks zzso zzso However, the three animals prevented from making an zzso zzso response had significantly higher plasma zzso levels through 12 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso The remaining three zzso animals made moderate zzso zzso zzso responses, maintained moderate plasma zzso zzso and showed an expected rate of disease zzso surviving to 24 weeks zzso without developing zzso In contrast, all three of the zzso animals prevented from making zzso zzso responses developed AIDS by 16 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso responses are critical in maintaining effective control of zzso replication at early time points zzso
