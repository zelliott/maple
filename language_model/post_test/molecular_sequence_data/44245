In 1992 we started assembling an ordered library of zzso clones from zzso XIV of the zzso zzso zzso At that time, only 49 genes were known to be located on this zzso and we estimated that zzso to zzso of its genes were yet to be zzso In 1993, a team of 20 European laboratories began the systematic sequence analysis of zzso zzso The completed and zzso checked final sequence of zzso base pairs was released in April, zzso zzso parts had been published before or had previously been made available on zzso The sequence contained zzso known or zzso zzso zzso including two zzso and three zzso 14 zzso zzso and three small nuclear zzso zzso For 116 zzso zzso zzso one or more structural zzso were identified elsewhere in the zzso zzso Half of them belong to duplicated groups of zzso loosely linked zzso in most cases with zzso gene order and orientation zzso zzso zzso We have considered the possible evolutionary origins of this unexpected feature of zzso zzso zzso
