zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were raised against synthetic peptides (or fusion zzso corresponding to zzso acid sequences unique to human and mouse zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso region zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso the zzso region zzso zzso or the F region zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso zzso directed against the zzso and F regions specifically zzso and recognized by Western zzso all human and mouse zzso beta zzso zzso beta 1, zzso 2, zzso 3, and zzso zzso produced in zzso cells zzso with expression zzso containing the corresponding zzso beta zzso Furthermore, in gel zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso response element zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso region were specific for the zzso beta 2 zzso The above zzso allowed us to detect the presence of zzso beta 2 proteins in mouse zzso and to show that their presence in zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso cell zzso is dependent upon zzso zzso The zzso were also used to demonstrate that zzso beta proteins produced by zzso in zzso cells are zzso zzso beta 2 zzso was not affected by zzso treatment, whereas the zzso of zzso beta 1 and zzso beta 3 zzso was greatly enhanced by zzso We also show that, in contrast to zzso alpha 1 and zzso gamma 1, zzso beta 2 proteins contain zzso zzso and are only zzso zzso in zzso by zzso protein zzso These results support our previous proposal that the various receptors have distinct functions in the zzso zzso
