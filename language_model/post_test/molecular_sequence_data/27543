zzso labeling of linear zzso zzso with zzso zzso displayed excellent selectivity for imaging the pulmonary circulation system in zzso zzso we investigated this particular selectivity and characterized the binding sites found in dog zzso AM and other peptides belonging to the zzso zzso family, including zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were performed by using zzso as a zzso on dog lung zzso It was found that AM bound with potent zzso displaying in fact a high and a low affinity binding zzso Moreover, competition binding zzso using zzso zzso showed the following ranking for zzso zzso approximately zzso or zzso or zzso approximately zzso Thus, these results strongly suggested that the AM binding site found in dog lungs and acting as a clearance zzso is mainly the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso underlying zzso binding affinity and specificity were studied by determining the key zzso zzso the minimal zzso fragment, and some aspects of the secondary zzso So far, it appeared that the zzso segment of human AM is an essential feature for zzso Also, the zzso secondary structure found in the AM zzso would facilitate the zzso recognition process with the AM zzso in dog zzso Our results demonstrated that AM or some zzso or fragments could be suitable zzso agents for lung zzso
