To study the clinical zzso and zzso zzso spectrum in cone zzso with zzso rod response zzso in the Israeli zzso 

Case zzso 

Patients with zzso diseases and unaffected relatives were zzso The protocol was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted and zzso sequencing was performed on zzso chain reaction zzso Whole zzso single zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Single zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, DNA sequence analysis, visual function testing, and zzso 

zzso to study the zzso of inherited retinal zzso in the Israeli and Palestinian zzso we recruited 220 index cases with zzso diseases, of which 2 carried the clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso screening of zzso revealed 2 compound zzso zzso in 2 affected sisters in 1 family and a zzso zzso in the other zzso zzso whether zzso is the cause of disease in the remaining patients with zzso diseases, we performed whole zzso zzso mapping in 52 zzso families (of the initial zzso 2 of which had zzso regions encompassing zzso zzso analysis revealed a different zzso zzso in each zzso In addition, zzso was screened in 4 families in which review of the clinical data suggested zzso zzso The analysis revealed 2 compound zzso zzso in 1 zzso After the genetic analysis and the review of the clinical findings, the diagnosis was revised to zzso in all patients with zzso zzso Clinical data of 13 zzso patients suggested that, although in some cases the classic zzso of zzso was present, others may have zzso zzso responses that are within normal zzso The delay in zzso responses may be a more reliable zzso 

This is the first report of genetic and clinical analysis of zzso in the Israeli population leading to the identification of 4 novel zzso zzso Our results support recent studies showing that zzso can be zzso and therefore screening of zzso for zzso should be considered in patients with zzso diseases, particularly when zzso responses are zzso
