zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso This zzso procedure required very little working zzso The homogeneous zzso exhibited a ratio zzso of about zzso and was obtained in high yield zzso and a good zzso Using zzso as a zzso a specific activity of 120 zzso was determined zzso at 26 degrees C, corresponding to 185 zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso were raised against the homogeneous protein and Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso can undergo defined zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso acid positions 104, 106 and zzso leading to zzso and zzso fragments as revealed by zzso which are still zzso active in their native zzso The zzso was zzso by all zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was correlated with a modification of up to 2 zzso protein of the six zzso zzso present in the zzso Identification of the most zzso zzso was achieved by zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso acid, under zzso conditions, the protein could be protected from modification and, thus, zzso by this zzso zzso mapping by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed one major zzso peak which was not obtained when the protein was modified in the presence of a zzso zzso acid under zzso zzso Isolation and sequencing of the labeled zzso led to the identification of zzso as the zzso zzso zzso
