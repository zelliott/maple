Recent twin studies of clinical malaria and immune responses to malaria zzso have underscored the importance of both major zzso complex zzso and zzso genes in determining variable zzso and immune zzso By using a combination of whole zzso genetic linkage studies of families and candidate genes analysis, zzso genes are being mapped and zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to affect zzso to severe malaria in a large study of West African zzso T zzso that may mediate such resistance have been identified and their target zzso and zzso zzso Some of these zzso show substantial zzso which appears to result from immune selection zzso Natural zzso zzso have been found to escape zzso recognition in zzso and other zzso zzso More recently a novel immune escape mechanism has been described in viral infections, altered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso can zzso or zzso a T cell response to the index zzso The likely implications of such immune escape mechanisms for the population structure of malaria zzso for zzso associations with malaria infection and disease, and for the design of new malaria vaccines, are zzso The evolutionary consequences of such molecular interactions can be assessed by using mathematical models that capture the dynamic of variable host and zzso zzso Combined zzso zzso and mathematical analysis of host and zzso zzso in natural populations can identify some mechanisms driving zzso zzso
