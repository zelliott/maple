A nuclear zzso of zzso zzso which exhibited defects in the zzso of proteins across the zzso zzso was described zzso A zzso zzso at the zzso locus facilitated the cloning of portions of the zzso zzso Strong sequence similarity with zzso genes from bacteria, pea and spinach indicates that zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is either zzso or nearly so, in that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso leaves and zzso zzso is reduced zzso or zzso zzso These results, in conjunction with the zzso zzso described zzso demonstrate that zzso functions in zzso to facilitate the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but does not function in the zzso of zzso and zzso Our results confirm predictions for zzso function made from the results of in zzso experiments and establish several new functions for zzso including roles in the targeting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and in protein targeting in the zzso a zzso zzso zzso Our finding that the zzso of properly targeted zzso and zzso f in zzso zzso zzso is reduced only a zzso despite the near or complete absence of zzso suggests that zzso zzso but is not essential in zzso for their zzso across the zzso
