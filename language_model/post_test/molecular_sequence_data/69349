We report a simple procedure for the detection of zzso virus zzso by in zzso zzso zzso with an alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso This treatment resulted in highly increased populations of cells with zzso transcripts of the zzso membrane protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which was zzso by the induced zzso was mostly dependent on viral DNA zzso as shown by double or single labeling for in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso probe, and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso against zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso established from an adult zzso leukemia patient showed that zzso of the cells contained both zzso and zzso zzso and about zzso of the cells contained zzso zzso indicating that a few of the zzso cells which carried the zzso zzso spontaneously entered the late zzso replication zzso
