zzso deletion zzso was used to study the roles of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso based on their zzso these proteins were previously proposed to be sensor and regulator zzso respectively, of a zzso regulatory system necessary for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in a strain that expressed only 30 to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The inactive zzso form of the zzso large zzso accumulated in this strain, indicating a role for zzso in zzso processing of the zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso containing a deletion of the zzso gene or a double zzso zzso and zzso did not exhibit any zzso activity under zzso conditions, and extracts from these strains were inactive in gel zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of the DNA region upstream of the zzso zzso However, zzso from root zzso formed by all three zzso types zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso extracts from all of these zzso including the wild type, failed to cause a shift of the zzso upstream region used in our zzso It was shown that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso structural gene expression under zzso conditions but not under symbiotic zzso Although symbiotic zzso expression is still zzso dependent, a zzso zzso other than zzso functions presumably upstream of the zzso binding zzso
