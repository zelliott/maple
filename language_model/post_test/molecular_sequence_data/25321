A method is described which uses the zzso III zzso in zzso 19 of the factor VIII gene for zzso family analysis and prenatal diagnosis by the zzso chain zzso The zzso derived from the zzso 19 and 20 sequences allow amplification of the whole zzso 19 resulting in a 730 zzso zzso zzso III restriction of this zzso provides fragments of 250 zzso or 160 zzso and 90 zzso respectively, specific for the zzso zzso III zzso The constant zzso zzso zzso can be used as an internal control to circumvent zzso due to incomplete or failure of zzso Using this method a prenatal diagnosis of zzso A in the first zzso of pregnancy is zzso
