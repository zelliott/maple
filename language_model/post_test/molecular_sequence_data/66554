The zzso zzso carrier protein 2 zzso domain is present in zzso zzso and zzso and has been implicated in the transport and metabolism of zzso We report the zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso circular zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso unfolding experiments show that zzso zzso stability is at pH zzso zzso binds zzso acid and zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, sustaining for the first time the binding of fatty acids and their zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso and other zzso binding proteins in zzso storage and zzso zzso of fatty acids is zzso
