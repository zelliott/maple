The zzso zzso gene zzso belongs to the zzso protein zzso which are zzso expressed in zzso zzso of third zzso zzso Earlier analysis had implied that zzso is located at the zzso zzso We cloned zzso from a zzso covering zzso Despite using a variety of zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso from the zzso led to deletions within the zzso coding zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso sequences revealed that zzso mainly consists of zzso tandem repeats zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso from single zzso clones are zzso in zzso indicating that repeats are zzso By analyzing the expression of zzso zzso in transgenic flies, zzso elements of zzso were mapped to lie within 1 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Band shift zzso revealed binding sites for the zzso factor fork head zzso and the factor zzso zzso binding protein 3 zzso at positions that are functionally zzso zzso and zzso have been shown previously to be involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso of the levels of steady state zzso and of the zzso rates for zzso and zzso reporter genes indicates that zzso zzso is zzso more stable than zzso zzso This has implications for the model of how zzso transcripts accumulate in late third zzso zzso
