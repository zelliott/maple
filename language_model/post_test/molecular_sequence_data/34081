Here we test the hypothesis that zzso zzso can exhibit structural plasticity in zzso due to their ability to shift zzso zzso zzso zzso forming peptides of the sequence zzso where zzso zzso 5, 6, or 7, which range from 21 to 27 zzso in maximum zzso were incorporated into zzso made of zzso lipids with saturated zzso chains containing 14, 16, or 18 zzso which are zzso zzso in zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso were studied with differential scanning zzso and circular zzso zzso We show that zzso forms a stable, zzso gel phase in all three zzso The whole family of zzso peptides appears to form similarly stable, zzso zzso in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing up to 20 zzso % zzso which is the maximum concentration tested, formed gel zzso with melting temperatures that were equal to, or slightly higher than, the pure zzso zzso Given the range of zzso lengths and zzso thicknesses tested, these experiments show that the zzso family of zzso zzso exhibit remarkable structural plasticity in zzso
