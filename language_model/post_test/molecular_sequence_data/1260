zzso zzso zzso highly zzso molecules involved in the presentation of self and zzso peptides to cells of the zzso and innate immune zzso Although zzso zzso genes are well zzso among primates and provide signals to natural killer zzso In this study, we zzso and analyzed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a nonhuman zzso used for zzso zzso and vaccine zzso Among a group of seven zzso the characterization of eight zzso zzso revealed an increased number of zzso sites compared with human zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso from zzso macaque, zzso monkey zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the three zzso species shared six families of zzso zzso zzso and indicated that these families existed in the common zzso zzso million years zzso zzso zzso sites were not concentrated within the zzso pockets, but were distributed throughout the entire zzso The zzso domain of zzso is similar to its human zzso and zzso zzso theoretically capable of binding to zzso molecules were found in the leader sequence of classical zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso acids located in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso molecules have side chains expected to be oriented toward zzso and away from the zzso groove, suggesting that some of them zzso 19, 73, 79 and zzso might be available for interaction with zzso receptors of natural killer zzso
