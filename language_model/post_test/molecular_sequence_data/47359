A zzso zzso zzso I gene zzso zzso was zzso for three laboratory maintained zzso of zzso zzso zzso of sequences representing the zzso zzso obtained from the zzso and Zhejiang provinces of the People's Republic of China, and from the zzso revealed zzso sequence variations of zzso and no zzso variation was zzso The sequences also indicated that while the amplification products of the Zhejiang and zzso zzso contained a recognition site for the zzso zzso there was no such site in the zzso zzso This was tested by digesting amplification products from a number of individual worms with zzso Then an infection experiment was designed to test the value of this genetic marker for studies of the population biology of zzso zzso in the final zzso For this, the two Chinese zzso were zzso Three groups of mice zzso were exposed zzso to a primary infection and then zzso at weeks 4 and 7 of the zzso In group A the first infection was done with the zzso zzso and the two others with the Zhejiang zzso thereby providing a specific, zzso zzso In groups B and C the zzso isolate was used for the second and third zzso All mice were zzso 5 weeks after the last challenge infection, and the zzso was subsequently amplified from DNA of the zzso worms and zzso with zzso The zzso revealed that while infection groups A and B contained mixed populations of the zzso and Zhejiang zzso only Zhejiang worms were present in group zzso We concluded that the zzso of the zzso site in the zzso provides a useful marker for the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso
