In a previous study, we isolated and characterized a new zzso k of zzso zzso from human blood and oral zzso Analysis of the genes involved in zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso k strains revealed that the zzso zzso zzso alignment was commonly present in the zzso region of the zzso gene zzso zzso from the initial zzso compared to the reference zzso and then a method for rapid identification of zzso k strains was developed by use of zzso with zzso designed on the basis of the sequence of the variable zzso zzso zzso with zzso specific for amplification of zzso k strains showed a negative reaction with zzso zzso zzso and f strains and a positive reaction with zzso k zzso with the sensitivity for identification of the zzso k strains shown to range from 5 to 50 zzso Next, the frequency of positive reactions for zzso zzso zzso was surveyed with DNA taken from saliva samples from 200 subjects (2 to 18 years of age), and 10 of those showed a positive reaction, which was higher than the frequency in our previous survey with a zzso zzso In addition, all saliva samples from subjects with zzso k strains in our previous study were shown to be positive with the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that this new zzso method is effective for identification of subjects with zzso zzso zzso zzso
