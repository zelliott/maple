zzso the second gene for the zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso encodes a zzso zzso with predicted structural similarity to zzso channel zzso However, the function of zzso remains zzso We used zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify zzso as an approximately zzso integral membrane zzso zzso from both native zzso and cells in culture is sensitive to zzso H suggesting the continued presence of zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso of zzso shows a pattern consistent with zzso in the zzso zzso This finding is confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso as determined by double indirect zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso translation products truncated at or after zzso retain their exclusive zzso zzso zzso while products truncated at or before zzso additionally traffic to the plasma zzso zzso zzso that traffic to the plasma membrane acquire zzso H resistance and can be zzso on the cell surface in intact zzso The zzso acid region zzso containing two putative zzso sites, is responsible for the exclusive zzso zzso zzso of zzso and is the site of specific interaction with an as yet unidentified protein binding partner for zzso The zzso of full-length zzso to zzso zzso raises the possibility that the zzso gene product is a zzso of zzso channel zzso
