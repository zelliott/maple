The envelope zzso protein of zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso is a zzso complex whose zzso consist of linked surface zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso from a precursor protein by a cellular zzso In addition, a significant fraction of zzso TM is further processed by the viral zzso to remove the zzso 16 zzso acids of the zzso domain, the R zzso This zzso greatly enhances the zzso of the protein and is necessary for the formation of a fully functional zzso protein zzso We have previously proposed that R zzso zzso enhances zzso by altering the zzso of the zzso of the protein zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a series of zzso and point zzso of zzso zzso we now provide direct zzso and zzso evidence that the zzso tail and the zzso region of zzso can influence the overall structure of the zzso of the protein and alter the strength of the zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso in particular, exhibits a markedly different zzso than the full-length zzso
