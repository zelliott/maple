The conversion of cholesterol into zzso acids in the liver represents the major zzso zzso for the removal of cholesterol from the zzso In this complex zzso pathway, at least 10 zzso modify both the ring structure and side chain of cholesterol, resulting in the formation of the primary zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso To gain insight into the details and regulation of this pathway, we have used protein sequencing and molecular cloning techniques to isolate and characterize a zzso zzso the rabbit zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso the first step in the zzso of the side chain of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso as deduced by both DNA sequence analysis of the zzso and protein sequence analysis, reveals it to be a zzso zzso zzso A signal sequence of 36 zzso precedes a coding region of zzso zzso zzso predicting a molecular weight of zzso for the mature zzso The identity of the zzso zzso was further confirmed by expression in monkey zzso cells employing a versatile zzso expression zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso for this zzso is expressed in many zzso and that it is zzso by a low copy number gene in the rabbit zzso
