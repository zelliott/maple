Many sequence variations of the zzso zzso zzso have been isolated through in zzso zzso In an effort to understand how these sequence variations affect zzso site zzso we systematically zzso the zzso core of zzso and measured the zzso activity of each zzso zzso against all 16 possible zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso relationships that suggest how the following zzso positions in the zzso core influence selectivity at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positions zzso and 12 represent a primary zzso of the selectivity at the 3' position zzso of the zzso zzso zzso positions 15 and zzso represent a primary zzso of the selectivity at the zzso position zzso of the zzso site and zzso the sequence of the zzso zzso stem has relatively little influence on zzso site zzso Furthermore, we report for the first time that zzso zzso have the collective ability to cleave all zzso junctions with rate enhancements of at least zzso over zzso Three optimal zzso zzso identified from approximately 75 different sequences that were zzso can collectively cleave 10 of 16 junctions with useful rates of zzso zzso and exhibit an overall hierarchy of zzso towards groups of related junctions according to the order zzso zzso zzso zzso NC zzso zzso
