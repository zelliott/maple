In zzso virus zzso tumors in zzso patients, zzso gene expression is highly zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso is zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso This pattern of zzso expression is generated by usage of the zzso promoter zzso We have determined that the zzso zzso positively regulates zzso zzso In zzso zzso a zzso reporter was activated by zzso zzso and by treatment of cells with the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to bind signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins was directly demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of potential zzso sites reduced zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a role for zzso in zzso function, zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells and cultured zzso zzso zzso cells contained nuclear zzso zzso We investigated whether the inability to maintain zzso zzso cell lines in culture was related to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso led to zzso of expression of zzso which encodes zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso expression zzso linked zzso expression to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso activity in reporter zzso This negative regulation required zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso interference with zzso zzso of zzso The data imply that zzso signaling has a role in zzso zzso
