The systematic status of zzso has been a matter of debate, particularly regarding the apparent inconsistency between zzso and molecular zzso The zzso zzso a master regulator of male sex determination in zzso zzso has not yet been used for zzso analyses of extant zzso The objective of the present study was to clone and characterize the complete gene zzso base zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso The zzso zzso acid identity between zzso and other reported species ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conservation was primarily in the high zzso group zzso box zzso zzso whereas zzso outside the zzso box was zzso The cloned zzso was mapped to the zzso Y zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso this was confirmed to be the first zzso molecular marker identified in zzso Based on zzso zzso analysis for zzso zzso sequences from 36 representative zzso including the zzso zzso zzso was more closely related to zzso than to zzso consistent with the emerging molecular tree zzso from markers not located on the Y zzso In conclusion, this study characterized the gene structure of zzso of the zzso zzso and provided insights into the zzso position of zzso
