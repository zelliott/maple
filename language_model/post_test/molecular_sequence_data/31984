zzso protein 166 zzso is a novel human regulator involved in both zzso and zzso In this study, we generated a specific rabbit zzso zzso against human zzso and assessed the expression of this protein in various human normal and tumor tissue samples by tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels were expressed in a zzso and zzso manner in detected zzso or zzso Strong zzso expression was shown in the zzso zzso of the adrenal cortex, zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso of the esophagus zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso or weak zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, lung zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso in the zzso red zzso and zzso cells in the cerebral zzso Some zzso failed to stain for zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skin, small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In comparing human normal and tumor zzso zzso expression was widely zzso in the cancer zzso Our studies provide the basis for future investigations into zzso functions of this protein in human normal and tumor zzso
