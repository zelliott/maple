zzso studies of zzso zzso gamma R have revealed much exciting new information about the structure and regulation of zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso genes and of the zzso gamma zzso zzso The zzso gamma zzso gene is composed of six zzso whereas the zzso gamma zzso gene is composed of zzso The zzso zzso are zzso by individual zzso in both genes (three in zzso gamma zzso and two in zzso gamma zzso however, the zzso gamma zzso gene shows greatest complexity in the region zzso the zzso tail and membrane spanning region, which is zzso by four zzso compared to only one in the zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso is controlled by elements within the first zzso bases upstream of the zzso initiation zzso The function of the zzso of zzso gamma zzso has been defined with the surprising finding that in the absence of the third domain the first two zzso zzso function as a broadly specific low affinity zzso gamma zzso zzso
