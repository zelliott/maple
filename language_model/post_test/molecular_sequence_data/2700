The 96 zzso zzso is a heat stable protein produced during the late stages of the zzso development of the malaria zzso zzso zzso and is released into the culture zzso or the zzso of infected patients at the time of zzso zzso This zzso identified as a putative protective zzso was shown to be identical to the zzso protein zzso 130 zzso 1988, zzso et zzso zzso We report here that the gene contains a small zzso intervening sequence located immediately after the sequence coding for the signal zzso This shows that in zzso zzso all the genes described so far coding for proteins exported outside the zzso zzso share a common zzso
