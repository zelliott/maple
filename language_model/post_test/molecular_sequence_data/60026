We deduced the zzso acid sequence of zzso coli zzso zzso by determining the zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso this zzso The translated protein was found to contain 208 zzso acid zzso with a zzso leader sequence of 26 zzso acid zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso was in good agreement with the predicted size zzso of the processed zzso A search involving a data bank showed that the zzso sequence of the zzso gene was identical to those of the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso I and zzso I, zzso zzso with the identity of the zzso gene with these two zzso the zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso the zzso gene showed both zzso I and zzso I zzso
