Basic peptides from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein bind to the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso with high affinity and moderate zzso The zzso of the zzso and 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso have been characterized by zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso exists in major and minor forms having different zzso zzso zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso change is observed upon complex formation with zzso consisting of zzso stacking of zzso stems and base triple zzso A zzso base triple is proposed based on zzso zzso zzso data, where zzso forms a base pair with zzso in the major zzso No evidence for base triple formation was found for zzso peptides in which zzso zzso are extensively zzso for zzso
