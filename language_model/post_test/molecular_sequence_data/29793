The newly discovered zzso protein zzso which contains six zzso repeats, has been reported to be involved in the zzso and degradation of the zzso gene product, zzso Using in zzso systems, we have identified a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is responsible for binding of zzso to zzso We further demonstrated a different mechanism for zzso to facilitate the zzso of zzso by binding with zzso zzso 4 zzso This binding does not inhibit the zzso zzso activity of zzso but it competes with zzso binding to zzso and zzso the zzso function of zzso We then showed that binding of zzso to zzso and the zzso counter action of zzso function were not affected by the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the two mechanisms are zzso They also involve different structural regions of zzso While the zzso motif is located at the fifth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the first three or four zzso repeats remaining, are sufficient for binding to zzso and for zzso the zzso function of zzso These results demonstrate the potential importance of zzso in cell cycle control and zzso and suggest an expanded zzso zzso
