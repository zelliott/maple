In this study, we first cloned zzso a second zzso member of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was expressed together with zzso in a broad zzso domain during zzso stages as well as at the zzso boundary and in the zzso zzso to zzso 4 during zzso zzso was also expressed in regions distinct from zzso notably in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso disrupted gene expression in the zzso zzso similar to the effect of zzso zzso We next compared the zzso and zzso sequences to identify and characterize zzso zzso within this zzso We found a zzso domain required for nuclear zzso and two zzso zzso (the zzso motif and a putative zzso zinc zzso required for zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso via its C zzso zzso with zzso and bound to zzso zzso zzso we found two forms of zzso generated from alternative translation initiation sites in zzso These forms have distinct activities, apparently depending on the function of the zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso functions similarly to zzso and define zzso zzso essential for nuclear zzso zzso and zzso binding in this novel family of zzso zzso
