The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to multiple regulators and zzso We show that zzso in a zzso zzso site in these zzso (the zzso zzso disrupt binding to an important subset of their binding partners, including the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Supporting the possibility that zzso and zzso bind to the same region of the zzso they partially zzso for zzso zzso In zzso some of the zzso zzso displayed reduced zzso zzso and all of them exhibited multiple defects in mating and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also defective in zzso repression of zzso We conclude that zzso contain a structurally and functionally zzso zzso site that mediates an overall positively acting network of interactions with zzso zzso sites on their regulators and zzso Key features of this interaction network appear to have been zzso from zzso to zzso
