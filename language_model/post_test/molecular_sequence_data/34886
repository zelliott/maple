Culture independent method was used to study the diversity of rumen zzso zzso diversity of rumen bacteria was analyzed by zzso amplification and sequencing of zzso zzso clone libraries prepared from the rumen content of zzso zzso The total DNA directly extracted from rumen fluid was used as zzso zzso zzso universal primer zzso and zzso was used as zzso Random zzso containing almost full size zzso zzso sequences (about zzso zzso zzso were zzso and subjected to an on line similarity zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that more than half of the sequences belonged to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso similarity levels with cultured species was less than zzso The bacterial community structure was also revealed by zzso tree of known sequences and selected zzso In the library from the rumen fluid, the sequences were mainly affiliated with the following major zzso low G + C zzso bacteria, zzso and the remaining sequences were placed within zzso groups that had an uncertain zzso These several sequences are likely to represent novel zzso zzso The zzso sequences have been submitted to the zzso zzso databases under zzso numbers zzso
