zzso zzso are zzso proteins that function in membrane traffic by zzso the zzso binding protein zzso Numerous zzso zzso contain a BAR domain, a protein structural element that contributes to membrane traffic by either inducing or sensing membrane zzso We have examined the role of a putative BAR domain in the function of the zzso GAP zzso 

zzso N zzso containing the putative BAR domain together with a zzso domain, zzso to form an extended structure that bound to large zzso zzso containing zzso zzso properties that define a BAR zzso A zzso protein containing the BAR domain of zzso together with the zzso and zzso GAP zzso efficiently bent the surface of large zzso zzso resulting in the formation of zzso zzso This activity was regulated by zzso binding to the zzso GAP zzso In zzso the zzso structures induced by zzso zzso contained zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso structures with zzso during recycling of zzso zzso of zzso accelerated zzso trafficking and slowed cell zzso An zzso zzso lacking the BAR domain had no zzso 

The zzso BAR domain of zzso mediates membrane zzso and is necessary for zzso zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso activity is consistent with zzso functioning as an zzso zzso
