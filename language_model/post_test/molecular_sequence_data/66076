The objective of this study was to identify single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the bovine fatty acid zzso zzso gene and to evaluate the extent to which they were associated with beef fatty acid zzso The four zzso in zzso that zzso for the TE domain were zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Angus bulls zzso zzso zzso were classified into three zzso groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was significantly associated with fatty acid composition of zzso zzso muscle of Angus zzso Cattle with the zzso zzso had lower zzso acid zzso P zzso zzso zzso acid zzso P zzso zzso and total saturated fatty acid contents zzso zzso zzso greater health index zzso zzso zzso zzso acid content zzso P zzso zzso and total zzso fatty acid concentration zzso zzso zzso in the total lipids and zzso fraction than did those with the zzso zzso Because of the linkage zzso between zzso zzso and zzso similar significant associations of fatty acid contents with the zzso zzso were zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso and zzso may be used as DNA markers to select breeding stock that have a healthier fatty acid zzso
