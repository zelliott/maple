The couch potato zzso protein is a key zzso involved in regulating zzso through the zzso process of the peripheral and central nervous systems in insects and also recently discovered in a few zzso zzso As such, zzso zzso are interesting model species that have no evidence of zzso zzso The present study is the first to report on the cloning of a putative zzso gene from the salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso as identified by zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression in larvae and adults was evaluated using quantitative real-time zzso The zzso zzso sequence showed zzso base pairs zzso consisting of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of 3' zzso and an open reading frame of zzso zzso for 268 zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso binding regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well the zzso site zzso were also zzso Furthermore, eight single zzso zzso located in the untranslated regions and one located in the coding region were zzso Gene zzso analysis revealed that zzso has ubiquitous expression across zzso stages and in adult individuals, with the highest expression from zzso to zzso zzso The present study suggests a putative biological function of zzso associated with the development of the nervous system in salmon zzso and contributes molecular evidence for candidate genes related to zzso zzso
