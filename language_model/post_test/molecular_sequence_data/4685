A DNA containing zzso zzso was isolated from the water of a very zzso river, the zzso river, near the central district of zzso Aires zzso This zzso zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso species zzso 21 zzso isolated from the same zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and its propagation characteristics are: burst size 30, zzso period 13 zzso and rise period 10 zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter, which possesses a short zzso zzso Its buoyant density in zzso is zzso zzso zzso DNA is zzso double stranded and approximately 40,000 zzso in zzso The viral particle is composed of at least nine zzso zzso patterns of these proteins and of those produced during the host infection, in addition to its zzso and zzso zzso suggested that zzso is similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analysis of zzso DNA fragments confirmed the relationship to the zzso Taking this into account, the partial sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was used to construct zzso relationships between zzso and other related zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first zzso described which uses as host a member of the zzso bacterial zzso
