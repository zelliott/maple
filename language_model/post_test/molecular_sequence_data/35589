Annual influenza zzso aim to protect against seasonal infections, and vaccine strain compositions are updated every zzso This protection is based on zzso that are produced by either newly activated or memory B cells recalled from previous encounters with influenza vaccination or zzso The extent to which the zzso repertoire responds to vaccination and recalls zzso has so far not been analyzed at a genetic zzso is to say, at the level of zzso zzso Here, we developed a consensus read sequencing approach that incorporates unique zzso labels on each starting zzso zzso These labels allow one to combine multiple sequencing reads covering the same zzso zzso to reduce the error rate to a desired level, and they also enable accurate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We validated this approach and analyzed the differential response of the zzso repertoire to zzso or zzso influenza zzso Additionally, we analyzed the zzso repertoire in response to repeated yearly zzso with zzso influenza zzso We found zzso sequences that were present in both years, providing a direct genetic measurement of zzso zzso
