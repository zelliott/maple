zzso are ubiquitous zzso or zzso zzso the function of which is to destroy zzso zzso zzso one of the four plant zzso is a zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein acts as a zzso with an zzso zzso bridge between two zzso zzso A wide range of electron donors and zzso was zzso Unlike type II zzso zzso Q cannot use the zzso or zzso zzso tested, but various zzso zzso and zzso zzso are efficient electron donors with no marked zzso The zzso zzso potential of the zzso Q zzso zzso is zzso zzso at pH zzso explaining why the zzso protein is reduced by zzso but not by zzso Additional evidence that zzso serves as a donor comes from the formation of zzso between zzso Q and zzso zzso of spinach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Q can reduce various zzso zzso but with a better efficiency for zzso zzso than hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso and of a green zzso protein fusion construct indicates that the transit sequence efficiently targets zzso Q to the zzso and especially to those of the guard zzso The expression of this protein and of type II zzso is modified in response to an infection by two races of zzso zzso the zzso agent of the zzso zzso In the case of an hypersensitive response, the zzso expression increased, whereas it decreased during a compatible zzso
