The zzso sequence at the zzso junction in the human zzso gene was analyzed by the zzso method zzso zzso zzso proposed zzso Using the sample score of a zzso sequence at a zzso zzso we studied to what extent such a sequence contains the zzso zzso To examine the zzso of our method, we further studied several zzso of zzso where zzso changes exist at zzso junction sequences of the first and second zzso Other zzso involve point zzso which generate new zzso signals within the first zzso Experimental results on the abnormal zzso in those zzso could be explained in terms of the sample scores of zzso sequences and their locations relative to the branch zzso
