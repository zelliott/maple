The origin recognition complex zzso is required to initiate zzso DNA replication and also engages in zzso zzso in zzso zzso We observed a striking preferential but not exclusive association of zzso zzso with zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein required for position effect zzso zzso zzso with zzso at these zzso zzso with this zzso intact zzso and zzso were found in physical zzso The association was shown zzso to require the zzso and shadow zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contained a strong zzso site, mirroring an interaction found independently in zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso lethal zzso resulted in a suppression of zzso These results indicate that zzso may play a widespread role in packaging zzso zzso through interactions with zzso zzso
