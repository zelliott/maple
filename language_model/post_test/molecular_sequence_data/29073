A group of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins was initially defined by their ability to repress zzso in zzso It was proposed that this regulation be zzso by targeting degradation of key cellular regulators that promote zzso Among them, zzso and the zzso zzso have been hypothesized to fulfill the roles as an zzso zzso zzso and an essential zzso zzso Here we report that zzso encodes a protein similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso is part of a nuclear protein complex and capable of directly interacting with both zzso and the zzso zzso Our data indicates that zzso defines a possible zzso activity, thus zzso the working hypothesis that the zzso zzso group of proteins defined a protein zzso zzso
