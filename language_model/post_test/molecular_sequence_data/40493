DNA zzso use two zzso bound zzso to catalyze zzso the blue zzso repair of DNA that has been damaged by ultraviolet zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for all zzso and is essential for zzso The identity of the second zzso is often zzso zzso Under standard light conditions, the second zzso is considered zzso for zzso because DNA zzso bound to only zzso is sufficient to catalyze the repair of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso strain of zzso In this work, the zzso gene of zzso was cloned through molecular mapping and shown to zzso a protein similar to known zzso zzso Additional results revealed that the zzso strain was deficient in an zzso zzso and that this zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso could be rescued by transformation with DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of a zzso zzso in zzso coli produced a protein that generated a zzso with characteristics similar to zzso Together, these results indicate that the zzso zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso and that optimal zzso in zzso requires zzso a zzso known to serve as a second zzso for DNA zzso
