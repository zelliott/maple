A dramatic rise in the number of resistant zzso to zzso has been documented in human patients and domestic zzso In this study, the mechanism of acquisition of zzso resistance was studied by detecting point zzso in the zzso gene of zzso strains obtained from zzso and strains with in zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the strains that had no point zzso were slightly increased from the source strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso for the strains that had the point zzso at zzso were 100 or 200 zzso 50 zzso and 25 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for the strain that had a point zzso at zzso higher than those for the strains that had the point zzso at zzso but the zzso of zzso and zzso were relatively lower than those for the strains that had point zzso at zzso These findings suggest that the degree of zzso resistance against zzso zzso and zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso strains was associated with the location of the point zzso in zzso On the other hand, a point zzso in all seven resistant strains isolated from zzso was located only at zzso while the zzso of the three zzso varied in each wild zzso This suggests that another mechanism might also be involved in the acquisition of zzso resistance in zzso zzso wild zzso
