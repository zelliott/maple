A major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso 5 (also designated zzso m zzso We have determined the primary structures of two forms of this protein by zzso and protein zzso These two forms with 204 and 205 zzso acid zzso differ in zzso of their sequences but they are zzso zzso Both forms have sequence similarity with a zzso protein of tobacco zzso In a zzso overlap of these zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso were isolated from an expression library in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Several of the zzso were not full zzso but the fusion fragments expressed were zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of the sequential type are distributed throughout the entire zzso of zzso zzso After zzso zzso 5 was also expressed in zzso zzso
