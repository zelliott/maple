The accurate flow of genetic information from DNA to zzso to protein is essential for all living zzso An astonishing array of zzso mechanisms have evolved to ensure that high degree of zzso is maintained at every stage of this zzso One of the most fascinating quality-control mechanisms involves zzso also known as zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a versatile and highly zzso bacterial zzso endowed with the combined structural and functional properties of both a zzso and a zzso The zzso system zzso three key biological zzso zzso recognition and rescue of zzso stalled on zzso zzso zzso disposal of the zzso defective zzso and zzso addition of a degradation tag to zzso protein fragments for directed zzso Although not essential in zzso coli, zzso activity is essential for bacterial survival under adverse conditions and for zzso in some, and perhaps all, zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that in addition to its quality-control function the zzso system might also play a key regulatory role in certain zzso zzso This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of the structural properties, zzso details, and zzso significance of this unique zzso and its principal protein zzso
