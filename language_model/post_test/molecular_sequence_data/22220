zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression is regulated at both the zzso and zzso level in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso In a human zzso zzso cell line zzso with zzso zzso zzso of human zzso protein was observed after 30 zzso exposure to zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells resulted in a zzso zzso increase of zzso protein levels and zzso zzso of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was redistributed to zzso zzso and zzso activity was decreased by zzso zzso despite increased zzso protein zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso protein containing a domain encompassing zzso we show that zzso is a direct zzso for active zzso in zzso These findings indicate a role for zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso activity and the implication of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
