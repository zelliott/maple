zzso coli zzso is a small zzso zzso protein with the active site sequence zzso zzso were made in this region of the zzso gene and the zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli strains lacking zzso zzso proteins with a zzso or zzso zzso ring were inactive in zzso However, zzso zzso with the active site sequence zzso is still able to serve as a zzso for zzso zzso and a reducing agent in the zzso zzso reaction, although with greatly reduced zzso zzso A smaller zzso ring, with the active site sequence zzso does not turn over at a sufficient rate to be an effective reducing zzso zzso in the small ring favors the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to a zzso has little effect on zzso zzso The function of this zzso may be in maintaining the stability of the active site region rather than participation in zzso activity or zzso zzso zzso of the positively charged zzso in the active site to a zzso zzso raises the zzso values with interacting zzso Although it has been proposed that the positive zzso at position 36 is zzso to maintain the zzso zzso on zzso zzso & Holmgren, zzso the presence of the negative charge at this position does not alter the pH dependence of activity or zzso zzso The zzso is most likely zzso to facilitate zzso zzso
