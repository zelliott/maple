The zzso part of zzso a zzso specific protein spanning from the zzso to the zzso mainly consists of a zzso zzso array of zzso and zzso III zzso zzso Since it has been suspected that the zzso zzso might represent zzso binding sites to myosin, we have developed structural models for all of zzso 132 zzso zzso A subset of eight zzso determined zzso structures from a range of zzso including zzso itself, was used as zzso zzso After grouping the models according to their position within the zzso segment of the central zzso zzso region, we analyzed the models with respect to zzso zzso This showed that zzso zzso form an extensive surface pattern predominantly at one side of the zzso whereas zzso outside the central zzso zzso region show generally less zzso zzso Since the zzso surface zzso may function as zzso sites, we zzso studied the binding properties of expressed zzso zzso zzso This revealed that zzso fragments specifically bind to the zzso 1 of zzso We also measured the effect of zzso fragments on the zzso properties of single cardiac zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments significantly enhance active zzso This effect is most pronounced at short zzso zzso and as a result the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso A model of how zzso zzso zzso may influence zzso interaction is zzso
