The zzso zzso of nuclear receptors contains a zzso diverse array of receptors related to the zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have carried out an extensive comparative analysis of this zzso with representatives from fish, birds, zzso and zzso Four novel receptors were isolated from fish, dog, zzso and monkey for this study and combined with a previously reported set of related receptors including human zzso rabbit zzso mouse zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso X receptors zzso zzso and human and mouse zzso A broad range of zzso steroids, and zzso acids were tested for their ability to activate the zzso binding domain of each zzso Three distinct groups of receptors were identified based on their pharmacological zzso 1) the zzso were activated by a broad range of zzso and, along with the zzso zzso included the chicken and fish zzso 2) the zzso were less zzso had high zzso activities, and were generally zzso rather than activated by those compounds that modulated their zzso and 3) the zzso were selectively activated by a subset of zzso zzso and are likely to be specialized receptors for this chemical class of zzso The zzso are differentiated from the other zzso receptors by a stretch of zzso acids between zzso 1 and 3, which we designate the zzso zzso This insert was present in the zzso chicken, and fish zzso but absent in the zzso and zzso Modeling studies suggest that the zzso insert contributes to the zzso of the zzso by zzso the unwinding of zzso and zzso thereby expanding the zzso binding zzso
