The region of the human zzso zzso zzso between the zzso open reading frame and the major zzso zzso zzso is referred to as the unique zzso zzso I protection analysis with human cell nuclear extracts demonstrated multiple protein binding sites in this region of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nelson, zzso zzso zzso However, the function of this region in the context of the viral zzso is not zzso In zzso human zzso human zzso cells zzso for viral zzso there is little to no zzso from zzso We determined that the unique region prevented zzso from the zzso promoter but had no effect on the divergent zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso level of expression from the zzso promoter increased significantly when the zzso unique sequences were zzso In zzso viruses with similar zzso in the unique region, expression from the zzso promoter occurred only after de zzso viral protein zzso typical of an early viral zzso A zzso zzso of the unique sequence caused approximately a zzso increase in the zzso level of zzso from the zzso promoter and a zzso increase in the expression of a downstream indicator zzso This viral negative regulatory region was also zzso at approximately zzso regions zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso Although some repressive effects were detected in the zzso region, zzso of the region zzso to the zzso promoter had the most significant effects on zzso Within the zzso and zzso regions, there are potential zzso sites for known zzso zzso zzso zzso This region may also bind unknown viral zzso We propose that the unique region upstream of the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression from the zzso promoter in zzso human zzso zzso This region may be a regulatory boundary preventing the effects of the very strong zzso zzso on this zzso
