An zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso bacterial strain zzso by screening a gene bank for colonies with zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of only zzso zzso This is the smallest gene zzso an zzso zzso found until zzso zzso of the gene in a zzso expression zzso enabled zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis showed that the protein was a zzso with a zzso size of zzso zzso The zzso oxidized zzso zzso 3- and zzso and 3- and zzso Since the ability to convert zzso is an unusual characteristic for an zzso zzso this reaction was analyzed in more zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence differed from the corresponding sequence of the zzso zzso which had been determined earlier from the zzso zzso from this zzso This indicates that strain zzso carries at least two different zzso zzso
