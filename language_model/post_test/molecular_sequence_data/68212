zzso zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso required for DNA synthesis and zzso The active zzso consists of two dissimilar protein components called zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins from zzso zzso growing mouse L cells showed that the zzso protein but not the zzso protein of zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments of zzso zzso protein showed a major spot containing more than zzso of the total zzso and a minor spot with the remaining zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso zzso protein indicated that zzso occurred exclusively on zzso zzso zzso C, zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso were capable of zzso the zzso protein in zzso whereas zzso zzso II was zzso To determine whether any of these zzso could zzso peptides observed to be zzso in actively growing cells, zzso zzso maps of zzso that had been zzso in zzso were compared with maps of zzso that had been isolated from zzso zzso Only the zzso maps obtained with zzso and zzso matched the pattern found in zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso from different samples were mixed prior to two-dimensional separation demonstrated zzso of zzso obtained by in zzso zzso with zzso derived from zzso or zzso obtained by in zzso zzso These studies indicate that protein zzso zzso may play an important role in the regulation of zzso reduction, DNA zzso and cell cycle zzso and suggest a potentially important zzso and/or zzso regulation point in DNA zzso
