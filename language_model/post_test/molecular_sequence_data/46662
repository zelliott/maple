We have identified a 55 zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso stacking protein of 55 zzso as a component of the zzso stacking zzso zzso is zzso to zzso an zzso membrane protein required for the stacking of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso exists in a complex with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to which it binds directly, and the membrane zzso protein zzso which also functions in the stacking of zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso could not be detected using zzso methods, although a weak interaction was detected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso like zzso is present on the zzso while zzso is on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the protein block the stacking of zzso zzso which is similar to the observations made for zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso function in the stacking of zzso zzso
