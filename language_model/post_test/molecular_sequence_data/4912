zzso channels play a key role in overall K balance by controlling K zzso across the zzso membrane of zzso cortical collecting zzso In contrast to the family of strong inward zzso zzso zzso channels are markedly sensitive to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have confirmed this pH sensitivity at both the single-channel and whole cell zzso Reduction of zzso pH from zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso reduced channel open probability from zzso zzso zzso to near zero zzso zzso zzso without altering single-channel zzso This was due to the appearance of a zzso closed state at low internal zzso We have confirmed that a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso terminal to the first putative zzso segment zzso is primarily responsible for zzso a steep pH sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15: zzso zzso However, the apparent zzso of zzso also depends on another zzso in a highly zzso mildly zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso this neutral zzso zzso with a zzso charged zzso shifted the apparent zzso for inward zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, wild zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso On the other hand, replacing zzso with a positively charged zzso shifted the apparent zzso in the opposite direction, from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, wild zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso The opposite effects of the zzso and zzso zzso at position 51 zzso are consistent with a model in which zzso is physically close to zzso and alters either the local pH or the apparent zzso via an zzso zzso In addition to its effects on pH sensitivity, the zzso zzso also decreased single-channel zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, wild zzso to zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso reversed the zzso gating of the channel, and significantly increased zzso zzso These effects on single-channel currents suggest that the zzso zzso located in a mildly zzso area of zzso also interacts with the zzso region of the zzso zzso
