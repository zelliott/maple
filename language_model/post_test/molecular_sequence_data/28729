The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso goose type zzso was analyzed by direct protein sequencing of peptides obtained by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was deduced to be a zzso group by analysis with a zzso system equipped with the zzso zzso source, and then confirmed by a zzso zzso zzso The blocked zzso is the first reported in this zzso zzso The positions of zzso bonds in this zzso were chemically identified as zzso and zzso zzso zzso was proved to consist of 185 zzso acid zzso and had a molecular mass of zzso Da calculated from the zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso compared to that of reported zzso zzso had identities of zzso zzso and zzso for ostrich, zzso and black swan zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were newly detected in this zzso zzso The zzso zzso acids that might contribute to zzso binding were found at zzso B zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences that formed three zzso and three zzso were completely zzso The zzso bond locations and zzso zzso acid were also strictly zzso The conservation of the three zzso structures and the location of zzso bonds were considered to be important for the formation of the zzso core structure of the zzso site and for maintaining a similar three-dimensional structure in this zzso zzso
