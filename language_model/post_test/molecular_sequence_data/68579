Heart failure in humans is characterized by zzso in zzso zzso signal zzso the most prominent of which is zzso of beta zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso of beta zzso receptors in the failing human heart is related to decreased zzso levels of beta 1 zzso zzso Due to the extremely low abundance of beta 1 zzso zzso zzso were possible only by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso or by zzso protection zzso Because the beta 1 zzso gene is zzso and beta 1 zzso zzso abundance is low, zzso yielded zzso amplification in total zzso and zzso zzso had to be performed in zzso zzso zzso By zzso the concentration of beta 1 zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of left zzso zzso obtained from organ donors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or heart transplant recipients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the respective beta 1 zzso levels measured by zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these same zzso and failing left zzso the respective beta zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abundance in the failing zzso was confirmed by zzso protection zzso in total zzso which also demonstrated a 50% reduction in beta 1 message zzso We conclude that zzso of beta 1 zzso zzso contributes to zzso of beta 1 zzso receptors in the failing human zzso
