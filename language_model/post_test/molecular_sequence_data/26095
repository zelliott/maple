We have identified the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso import zzso for the zzso carrier zzso by functional studies and by zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in which the gene for zzso was disrupted were impaired in specific binding and import of zzso zzso we found a zzso yet significant import of zzso into zzso lacking zzso that occurred via the zzso zzso We conclude that both zzso and zzso can direct zzso into zzso albeit with different zzso Moreover, the precursor of zzso apparently does not require a positively charged sequence at the extreme zzso zzso for targeting to zzso
