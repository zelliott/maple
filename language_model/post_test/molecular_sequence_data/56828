In the present study DNA from 281 unrelated zzso A patients including 15 inhibitor patients has been zzso by Southern zzso zzso Using various restriction zzso cloned factor VIII zzso zzso and zzso fragments we have identified 14 zzso Six of the zzso are novel partial factor VIII gene zzso One deletion affects zzso 1, two deletions concern zzso 6, another zzso of which zzso are zzso takes part of zzso 16 and two deletions affect zzso zzso Besides the zzso eight point zzso have been found at the zzso restriction sites of zzso 18, 24 and zzso Five zzso zzso resulted in nonsense zzso one in zzso 18, one in zzso 26 and three in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso in zzso 24 leading to an zzso zzso Although two patients showed this zzso their clinical zzso were different, possibly due to an additional unidentified sequence zzso A zzso zzso in zzso 26 zzso the zzso with zzso All deletions and seven of the point zzso are associated with severe disease with a zzso inhibitor in the patient with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso is associated with mild zzso but the patient also has developed an zzso zzso these zzso the origin of the zzso could be determined in four zzso one of which showed maternal zzso
