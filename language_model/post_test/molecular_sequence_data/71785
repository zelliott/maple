Cellular zzso zzso and zzso proteins regulate zzso phenomena as diverse as muscle contraction, zzso and cell zzso When zzso is rapidly mixed with slow zzso zzso zzso or zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso of varying duration zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso We have exposed several zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso of various zzso and observed their transient binding of zzso complex formation, and/or zzso A zzso zzso zzso ACT zzso occupied approximately zzso of the zzso regulatory sites of zzso C consistent with their rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso ACT produced approximately zzso transient binding of the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso but little binding of zzso zzso to zzso A zzso zzso zzso ACT was sufficient for the zzso of zzso to zzso bind approximately zzso of zzso light chain zzso zzso while a zzso zzso zzso ACT produced approximately zzso transient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In both cases, the ACT had fallen back to baseline approximately zzso zzso before zzso binding of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso occurred and binding and zzso zzso persisted long after the zzso transient had zzso The use of zzso has allowed us to zzso how the zzso rates of zzso proteins dictate their zzso zzso changes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso of various zzso and zzso By characterizing the response of these proteins to zzso we can predict with greater certainty how they would respond to natural zzso zzso to regulate cellular zzso
