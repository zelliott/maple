A zzso zzso zzso system has been used to display functionally active chicken zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso A synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and displayed on the tips of zzso zzso as a fusion protein with protein III zzso The gene was expressed also as soluble inhibitor in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected by binding to zzso The positive zzso showed binding to zzso in dose dependent zzso The chicken zzso fusion protein was detected with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso III zzso by western zzso zzso zzso soluble inhibitor was identified in the zzso and showed strong zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that functionally active zzso can be displayed on the zzso zzso This technology can be employed further to select inhibitor zzso which differ in their binding affinity to zzso and zzso zzso
