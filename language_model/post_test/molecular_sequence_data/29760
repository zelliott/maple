Little information is available on molecular defects involved in adult zzso disease presenting as motor zzso disease zzso We studied zzso activities of zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso the zzso of zzso in a family of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso with zzso revealed a reduction in zzso A and B activity in zzso zzso Although the activity of both in the mother were intermediate between those of controls and the zzso only zzso B reduction determined with heat zzso was found in the zzso Analysis of zzso gene demonstrated two novel point zzso The first zzso zzso was located at the zzso zzso site of zzso 2 derived from the mother, causing zzso 3 zzso The zzso zzso zzso a shorter zzso which may not form an active zzso The second zzso was a zzso transition in zzso 13 zzso derived from the father and resulted in zzso substitution at zzso acid position zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated a lack of normal zzso activity, indicating that this zzso is zzso zzso zzso of these two zzso may trigger the development of adult zzso disease with a motor zzso disease zzso
