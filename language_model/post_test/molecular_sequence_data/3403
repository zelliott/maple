In this study we describe alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso variable heavy chain zzso genes in three distinct primary B cell zzso zzso zzso In two zzso expressing zzso zzso a zzso center type B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso and a zzso zzso zzso internally spliced zzso gene transcripts were found in which a sequence stretch of 116 zzso between the framework region 1 zzso and zzso determining region 2 zzso had been zzso We provide evidence that for this alternative zzso zzso processing a known cryptic zzso zzso donor site and a previously unidentified cryptic 3' zzso zzso site were zzso zzso zzso showed that the cryptic 3' zzso zzso site had been activated by specific zzso point zzso The zzso further zzso a zzso of the rearranged zzso gene segment including the putative N region and part of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso probably took place via a repeated mechanism of DNA double strand break followed by zzso zzso a mechanism which was recently proposed also involved in the zzso zzso process and is compatible with the zzso center derivation of this zzso Finally, in a zzso expressing diffuse large B cell lymphoma, we observed alternative zzso zzso processing using the same cryptic zzso zzso donor site and the normal zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso The significance of alternative zzso processing in B cell zzso and as a potential mechanism of zzso zzso diversification is zzso
