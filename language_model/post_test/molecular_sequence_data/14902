zzso proteins are added to zzso zzso through zzso of a body protein zzso with the duplicate zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso scaffolds are recruited from a wide range of zzso and with a similar level of diversity of ancestral zzso zzso studies have proven an effective and efficient tool for the discovery of novel toxin zzso In this study, we applied zzso zzso zzso to a wide zzso diversity of advanced snakes and recovered transcripts zzso three novel protein scaffold types lacking sequence zzso to any previously zzso snake toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane outer layer zzso In addition, the first snake zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso of zzso which was only recently zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, novel zzso were also recovered for the only recently zzso zzso toxin class also shared between zzso and snake zzso The additional complexity of snake zzso has important implications not only for understanding their molecular evolution, but also reinforces the tremendous importance of zzso as a diverse zzso
