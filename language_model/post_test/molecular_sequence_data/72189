zzso protein zzso a zzso of alpha and beta zzso is found in all zzso zzso binds to the barbed ends of zzso filaments in zzso and controls zzso assembly and cell zzso in zzso zzso have three alpha zzso zzso 1, alpha 2, alpha 3) produced from different zzso whereas lower organisms have only one gene and one zzso We isolated zzso clones corresponding to the alpha zzso of mouse zzso and found three alpha 1 zzso two of which are zzso and a single gene for both alpha 2 and alpha zzso Their zzso locations were identified by zzso zzso zzso The alpha 1 gene zzso mapped to zzso 3 between zzso and zzso The alpha 1 zzso zzso and zzso mapped to zzso 1 and 9, zzso The alpha 2 gene zzso mapped to zzso 6 near zzso The alpha 3 gene zzso also mapped to zzso 6, approximately 68 zzso zzso from zzso near zzso One mouse zzso zzso maps in the vicinity of the alpha 1 zzso No known mouse zzso map to regions near the alpha 2 or alpha 3 zzso
