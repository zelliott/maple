The zzso protein gene zzso from zzso plays a fundamental role in response to zzso which regulate plant root growth, zzso zzso wounding and healing, and defense against pathogens and zzso zzso zzso in zzso were previously found to abolish all the zzso responses, and the zzso zzso zzso is male sterile and susceptible to pathogen zzso In this study, we isolated an zzso protein gene from zzso which shares significant zzso with the zzso zzso and similarly contains an zzso motif and zzso rich repeats zzso here designated zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso To test whether the sequence zzso and structural similarity are indicative of functional zzso we expressed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The transgenic zzso plants with expression of the zzso gene were found to exhibit normal zzso responses, including zzso plant defense and zzso In addition, the zzso proteins with swapped domain of the zzso motif or zzso between zzso and zzso were shown to functionally complement the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to assemble into the zzso zzso complexes, similar to the formation of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate the soybean zzso protein gene zzso is able to mediate zzso plant defense and fertility in zzso which implies a generic zzso zzso with zzso signal components in different plant zzso
