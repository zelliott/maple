zzso zzso like other zzso has to compete with the host for a limited supply of available zzso zzso iron acquisition is likely to be an important factor for the growth, survival and zzso of this zzso It was previously demonstrated that zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso functional rescue of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso This gene has been previously zzso However, the workers had not observed any functional zzso activity associated with the zzso The zzso with the findings in this report appears to be due to the clone previously reported carrying a zzso piece of zzso zzso zzso zzso shown in this paper demonstrate that zzso zzso is regulated in response to levels of iron and zzso This is the first demonstration of a functional zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso
