The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso ST that codes for the zzso of zzso to zzso acid was zzso Four open reading zzso named zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in this zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso performed with batch and continuous cultures, allowed us to identify the functions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso responsible for the transformation of zzso to zzso zzso codes for the second zzso of the pathway, an zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso and the zzso gene produces a zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso long, was found to be zzso zzso to zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that it might be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be partially zzso to the zzso part of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso while the zzso product did not share significant zzso with any known zzso The fourth open reading frame, zzso could zzso a protein of 502 zzso acids and was strongly zzso to several zzso and zzso zzso zzso The order of the genes zzso to that of the zzso zzso The previously suggested presence of the gene for zzso zzso which directly converts zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been confirmed by sequencing and by zzso zzso performed in continuous zzso A copy of the zzso sequence zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso was identified immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso
