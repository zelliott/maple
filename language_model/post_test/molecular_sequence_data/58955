The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso using a screening procedure developed on zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso encodes a putative protein of 239 zzso acids showing significant similarity with other bacterial zzso zzso zzso from zzso lies an open reading frame zzso which is highly similar to bacterial genes coding for zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analyses indicated the presence of a zzso zzso transcript of zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso and zzso genes are organized in a single zzso
