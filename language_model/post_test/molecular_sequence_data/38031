The basic organization of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 promoter was investigated after cloning the zzso region zzso zzso of the zzso gene from a human zzso zzso zzso functional analysis of various deletions of the zzso zzso zzso upstream of a zzso reporter zzso was carried out in zzso zzso The minimal promoter region identified encompasses the zzso sequence and contains a crucial zzso box zzso and a zzso zzso zzso a region zzso containing a zzso element was zzso We previously showed that the expression of the zzso zzso binding site is strictly dependent upon the zzso differentiation of human colon cancer zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso zzso increases dramatically when zzso cells zzso as measured by zzso protection zzso and reverse zzso A single transcript species of 3 zzso is detected in differentiated cells by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is due to a zzso increase of zzso rate zzso zzso without a change in zzso zzso (9 zzso zzso zzso of various zzso in zzso cells and subsequent analysis of reporter gene zzso during the zzso differentiation process over 25 days of culture, further indicated that the zzso zzso sequence is endowed with the regulatory zzso necessary for zzso regulation of zzso during zzso Altogether, these observations provide the first characterization of the basic organization of the human zzso gene promoter and unravel the crucial role of a short promoter sequence in the strict zzso control of zzso expression during differentiation of human colon cancer zzso zzso
