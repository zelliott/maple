zzso analyses of zzso neutral zzso zzso are systematically performed by ultraviolet zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso acquired in zzso zzso Interestingly, their fragmentation significantly differ each zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the reducing terminal zzso On the other hand, zzso bond zzso zzso zzso takes place zzso in collision induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso similar to that in zzso zzso occurs via a prompt reaction path characteristic of the zzso process zzso The product zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso product zzso zzso During zzso zzso experiments, the zzso molecular zzso survive for several tens of milliseconds after zzso event because the high internal energy zzso precursor zzso are cooled by zzso cooling in the zzso zzso The results obtained suggest that the zzso from the zzso precursor zzso in zzso zzso zzso might proceed as a zzso zzso in the first, a high internal energy zzso molecular zzso is generated as a reaction intermediate during the flight in the drift tube, and in the second, the rapid decomposition from the zzso molecular zzso takes zzso
