In zzso zzso a zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to specify zzso cell zzso zzso of this signaling zzso include a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso complex that can directly zzso zzso but how signaling activates zzso zzso is not yet zzso Here we show that zzso a genetically defined zzso of polarity zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that stimulates the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity requires a zzso zzso analogous to an zzso zzso site in other zzso including zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso polarity signaling in zzso zzso may involve a zzso zzso signaling zzso
