The zzso zzso is one of the largest zzso groups of zzso class I molecules and includes four zzso Of the four, the zzso zzso zzso is relatively rare and is the most zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the rare zzso revealed three zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso tree of zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso 2 and 3 zzso sequences showed that zzso 2 of zzso clusters with zzso zzso whereas zzso 3 clusters with zzso zzso zzso of the tree suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso may reside in the alpha 1 domain, zzso by zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which type as zzso and zzso respectively, are hybrid molecules alternatively using zzso 2 and zzso 3 sequences of zzso and zzso A comparison of zzso 2 sequences for zzso zzso and zzso suggests that the zzso site may have been in the region at the 3' end of zzso zzso Despite being flanked by two highly zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso 2 is relatively well zzso in the zzso and it is characterized by seven to eight tandem repeats of the zzso zzso A high degree of sequence zzso and repetitive sequences are essential for a significant frequency of zzso In this report, we reveal more about the complex evolutionary history of the zzso zzso
