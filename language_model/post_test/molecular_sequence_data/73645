zzso dominance is an zzso phenomenon that describes the formation of zzso around zzso genes inherited from only one parent in the progeny of an zzso zzso Despite numerous zzso studies, little is known about zzso dominance at the level of zzso gene expression in zzso We used zzso zzso protection and primer extension zzso to define zzso dominance at a molecular level in the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso start sites were mapped in three zzso and in three zzso zzso and one zzso species derived from these zzso zzso zzso transcripts of only one zzso were detected in zzso zzso of each zzso zzso was independent of maternal effect, zzso or zzso gene zzso Natural and newly zzso zzso yielded the same results, arguing against substantial evolutionary zzso The hypothesis that zzso dominance in plants is correlated with physical characteristics of zzso gene zzso zzso is not supported in zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso genes silenced in zzso zzso were found to be expressed in all floral zzso including zzso and zzso arguing against the hypothesis that passage through zzso is needed to reactivate suppressed zzso Instead, the transition of zzso to floral zzso appears to be a zzso stage when silenced genes can be zzso
