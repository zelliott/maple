zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso on the cell surface and are thought to be one of the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso was classified into four zzso zzso zzso I to zzso We previously examined the distribution of zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso in zzso patients using a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, some patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned a new type zzso zzso of zzso from dental plaque zzso zzso zzso with type V zzso was isolated from dental plaque of a zzso patient, and the isolate was named zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were compared with those of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso type II strain zzso type III strain zzso and type IV strain zzso and the zzso were found to be 45, 44, 43, and zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the clinical isolate zzso possessed zzso zzso genes sod and zzso However, in terms of zzso zzso type V zzso showed a difference from other types of zzso In addition, type V zzso zzso bacteria were detected in zzso (12 of zzso of the zzso zzso patients with zzso by zzso zzso using specific zzso Thus, a new type of zzso gene is now established, and the zzso zzso could be useful in determining the zzso zzso of zzso zzso involved in the development of adult zzso
