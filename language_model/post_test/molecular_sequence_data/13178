The pathways governing signal zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso systems of the brain are of central importance in a variety of drug actions and neurological zzso We have analyzed the zzso zzso and zzso distribution of the closely related D1 and zzso zzso of zzso receptors in the cerebral zzso and selected zzso structures of zzso monkey using zzso specific zzso The distribution of D1 and zzso receptors was highly differentiated in zzso zzso In the zzso both D1 and to a lesser extent zzso zzso labeled medium zzso zzso while only zzso zzso labeled the large zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso In the zzso nucleus, D1 labeling was concentrated in the spines and shafts of projection zzso whereas zzso zzso predominantly labeled the zzso and less commonly, the spines of these zzso The D1 zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso labeled only a few scattered cell bodies in this zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso in the zzso zzso more intensely than D1 zzso Within the cerebral zzso and zzso D1 and zzso zzso labeling was prominent in zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the two receptors were frequently zzso in zzso of both zzso zzso D1 receptors were especially prominent in zzso spines whereas zzso shafts were more prominently labeled by the zzso zzso The anatomical segregation of the D1 and zzso receptors at the zzso level in cerebral zzso and at the cellular level in zzso areas suggest that these closely related receptors may be zzso associated with different circuit elements and may play distinct regulatory roles in synaptic zzso
