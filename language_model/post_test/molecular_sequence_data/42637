The zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 beta zzso is essential for the zzso of all steroid zzso The zzso zzso the conversion of delta 5-3 zzso to delta zzso We report the isolation of a novel mouse 3 beta zzso zzso 3 beta zzso IV, and describe the zzso expression of its zzso the zzso characteristics of the 3 beta zzso IV zzso and the structural and functional relationships it has to other 3 beta zzso zzso previously characterized in the mouse and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of mouse 3 beta zzso IV is zzso and zzso identical to that of mouse 3 beta zzso I and III, zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the four zzso characterized to date show that 3 beta zzso IV is more zzso related to I, II, and III than these three forms are to each zzso 3 beta zzso IV zzso is only expressed in mouse zzso In zzso zzso of mouse kidney indicates that expression is found only in the zzso and appears to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso expressed 3 beta zzso IV protein could not convert the delta 5-3 zzso zzso or zzso to their respective delta zzso zzso or zzso nor did it have the capacity to convert 5 zzso zzso 17 zzso to zzso characteristic zzso activities of expressed mouse 3 beta zzso I and zzso 3 beta zzso IV could only catalyze the conversion of zzso to 5 zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso Thus, 3 beta zzso IV is a zzso zzso rather than a 3 zzso zzso despite its zzso to the other members of the 3 beta zzso zzso Mouse 3 beta zzso IV is functionally and structurally most closely related to rat 3 beta zzso III, an zzso expressed predominantly in male rat zzso
