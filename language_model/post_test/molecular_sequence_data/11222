The zzso sequence of gene 6 zzso the zzso major zzso protein zzso of zzso strain zzso was determined and compared to that of 20 previously reported strains with known zzso zzso Multiple alignments of zzso acid sequences exhibited a high level of sequence conservation zzso to zzso zzso zzso experiments were undertaken to zzso regions involved in zzso zzso zzso acid positions zzso zzso and a region zzso (or 301 for zzso strain zzso were identified as contributing to zzso zzso A single zzso acid zzso at position zzso or 315 was sufficient to change the zzso specificity of zzso zzso protein from non zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at these sites may be another important mechanism for zzso variation, along with gene zzso
