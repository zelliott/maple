The cloned gene was composed of zzso zzso for coding plus promoter like and zzso sequences ahead of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had high similarity with known zzso The zzso sequence of the cloned zzso seemed to be a signal zzso The gene was introduced into zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso and the expressed protein was recovered from the culture zzso The zzso fraction produced was divided into two components upon the zzso column zzso The zzso acid sequence of one fraction zzso was the same as the mature zzso and the other zzso lacked the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of the mature zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso zzso by the zzso component zzso were measured, and the zzso affinities of the zzso were zzso In conclusion, it was shown that the zzso zzso was the same as the mature zzso functionally and zzso
