zzso peptides are short zzso protein fragments characterized by an zzso distribution of their zzso zzso when zzso They are able to interact with a zzso interface (such as a zzso zzso and to destabilize the organized system into which they zzso They were detected in viral fusion proteins and in proteins involved in different biological processes involving membrane zzso or zzso of the protein in which they are zzso In this paper, we have zzso different protein zzso related to membrane zzso with regard to their zzso zzso They are the zzso signal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso in high amount and the zzso domain from proteins forming pores zzso zzso zzso and zzso From the predictions and the experimental approaches, we suggest that zzso peptides found in those proteins could have a more general role in the mechanism of zzso of proteins zzso zzso For the signal zzso they could help the protein machinery involved in protein zzso to be more zzso In the case of zzso pore formation, they could disturb the zzso zzso the zzso of the other more zzso zzso
