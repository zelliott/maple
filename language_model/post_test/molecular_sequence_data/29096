zzso protein zzso the most abundant urinary protein zzso by the kidney zzso cells, is believed to play important and diverse roles in the urinary system, including zzso water balance, zzso urinary stone formation, and zzso of bacterial zzso In the present study, we describe the isolation of a zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene and show the highly zzso nature of its zzso zzso zzso sequence with that in rats, zzso and zzso We also demonstrate using the transgenic mouse approach that a zzso zzso zzso sequence is sufficient to drive the zzso expression of a zzso reporter zzso Within the zzso zzso expression was confined to the zzso zzso that zzso expressed the zzso zzso which suggests specific zzso activity in the thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso and early zzso convoluted zzso Our results establish the zzso and zzso expression of the mouse zzso zzso The availability of the mouse zzso gene promoter that functions in zzso should facilitate additional studies of the molecular mechanisms of zzso gene regulation and should provide new molecular tools for better understanding zzso physiology and disease through zzso gene zzso
