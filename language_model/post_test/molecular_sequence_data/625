zzso from diverse species and sources have different pH zzso zzso mechanisms with regard to dynamic structural changes, which control zzso activity at varying zzso are zzso Human serum zzso 1 zzso is active solely below pH zzso Here we report the design of a zzso zzso that degrades zzso up to pH zzso Besides highly zzso zzso in close proximity of the active site of most zzso we identified a bulky loop formation located at the end of the zzso binding zzso of zzso to be crucial for zzso zzso The stretch between zzso zzso zzso and zzso which normally contains 13 zzso zzso could be replaced by a zzso sequence of alternating zzso zzso zzso thereby yielding an active zzso with an extended binding zzso This zzso exhibited zzso degradation at elevated zzso This is indicative for appropriate zzso binding and proper positioning being decisively affected by sites far off from the active zzso
