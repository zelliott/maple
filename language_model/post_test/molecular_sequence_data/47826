zzso zzso protein zzso also known as zzso is an zzso protein implicated in the response to viral zzso An equivalent protein has been demonstrated within the bovine zzso in early pregnancy in response to zzso zzso We have previously shown the zzso of zzso within zzso zzso cells of the human and zzso zzso zzso We now show that an increase in zzso gene expression within the zzso zzso cell accompanies these increased protein zzso Using Northern zzso techniques we demonstrate zzso zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and an increase in signal within some zzso specimens of first zzso zzso This signal may represent increased zzso zzso within the zzso of zzso cells that undergo zzso since this cell type exhibits an increase in zzso message as detected by zzso zzso
