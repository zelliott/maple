The zzso tumor zzso protein zzso is a zzso regulator that plays a key role in the development of the zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso is subject to regulation by a suppression region within the N zzso of zzso Using a functional zzso we provide direct evidence that this requires a zzso zzso which we identify as brain acid soluble protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso associate within the zzso of cells that naturally express both zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and elimination of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is present in the developing zzso structures of the embryonic kidney and, zzso with that of zzso its expression is restricted to the highly specialized zzso cells of the adult zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso is a zzso factor that can regulate zzso zzso zzso
