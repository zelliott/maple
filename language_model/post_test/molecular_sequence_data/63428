zzso responsive zzso factors zzso can be grouped into different classes with either gene zzso or zzso zzso We have isolated a tomato zzso zzso clone zzso with sequence similarity to class II zzso class) of the zzso family, which is regulated differently from zzso (a tomato zzso zzso gene that activates other zzso zzso has similarities to other tomato zzso zzso but the DNA or predicted zzso acid sequences have significant zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso was highly expressed during fruit zzso whereas zzso accumulated before and declined sharply after the onset of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso tomato fruit containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso and also in the zzso insensitive zzso never ripe zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso was markedly increased in those zzso Environmental stresses including drought, zzso and low temperature increased significantly the expression level of zzso but markedly reduced the level of zzso zzso zzso wounding induced the zzso of zzso zzso but had no significant effect on the level of zzso These opposing patterns of regulation of zzso zzso are consistent with the zzso function of zzso and a zzso function for zzso in zzso zzso
