Cancer associated zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso and zzso changes that contribute to tumor zzso but the mechanisms responsible for these changes are not well zzso zzso DNA zzso is an important cause of zzso zzso in cancer cells but it is not known how important DNA zzso zzso are to zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso to compare genes induced by the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso in cultured pancreatic cancer associated zzso pancreatic control zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

We found that pancreatic zzso and control pancreatic zzso were less responsive to zzso gene zzso than pancreatic cancer cells zzso of genes induced zzso zzso was 9 zzso 10 genes in 10 pancreatic zzso cultures, 17 zzso 14 genes in 3 control pancreatic zzso cultures, and zzso zzso 85 genes in 4 pancreatic cancer cell zzso We examined zzso expressed genes between zzso and control zzso for candidate zzso genes and identified the zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and zzso in pancreatic zzso lines and zzso in zzso adjacent to primary pancreatic zzso 

Compared to pancreatic cancer cells, few genes are zzso by zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso suggesting these cells do not harbor many functionally important zzso in DNA zzso zzso may also not be very responsive to therapeutic targeting with DNA zzso zzso
