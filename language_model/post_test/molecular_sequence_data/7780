zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli K-12 is thought to be zzso from a single precursor zzso into a zzso form through zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso coli K-12 were zzso and the zzso of the zzso was examined by Western zzso zzso The zzso fraction only contained the mature form of zzso membrane fraction only contained the precursor of zzso and no precursor of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso at the zzso site for processing into the large and small zzso were zzso by zzso zzso The processing zzso of six zzso were examined by Western zzso analysis, and their zzso activities were zzso zzso at the zzso zzso acid zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso and zzso prevented the maturation of the zzso and the immature zzso exhibited no zzso zzso A zzso at the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso had less effect on the processing and zzso zzso These results suggest that the sequence of zzso zzso at the zzso of the small zzso is very important for the processing of zzso coli K-12 zzso and this processing is essential to the expression of zzso activity of zzso coli zzso
