The zzso of bacteria of the zzso zzso has virtually been constructed according to generally accepted peculiarities of the zzso metabolism of the 3 selective zzso The information about the zzso contents of DNA zzso allows to divide all of 67 species included in the zzso into 4 zzso group according to zzso zzso The first group species has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this manner, it will be singled out 4 new zzso in a new proposed family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For further revision of the zzso of the bacteria of the zzso family zzso in the direction of approaching its to the natural one it is essential to study of the degree of zzso similarities of species representatives within being outline 4 zzso group both the molecular zzso using the specific DNA zzso and the restriction analysis of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso
