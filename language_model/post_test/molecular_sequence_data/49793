zzso (or zzso is an ABC membrane protein that zzso a wide range of natural products as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, free zzso is required for zzso to transport several zzso zzso However, the mechanisms regulating the influence of zzso on zzso is poorly zzso and the location of zzso binding zzso within zzso have yet to be zzso To address these issues, we have zzso a zzso labeled zzso of zzso zzso to zzso label zzso Our results revealed that zzso labeled zzso with high zzso and binding was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso of zzso in agreement with observations that both drugs enhance zzso zzso We observed zzso to be the best inhibitor of zzso zzso as compared to oxidized zzso zzso and four different zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso with zzso in a similar manner as unmodified zzso Moreover, using eight zzso zzso each containing zzso A zzso zzso inserted at different sites in zzso we mapped the zzso binding sites in zzso Our zzso analogue zzso labeled four zzso zzso that were located within two zzso zzso in zzso sequences zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso labeling of zzso within zzso and zzso zzso is further confirmed using two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso within the zzso zzso Taken together, this study provides the most precise information to date on the location of zzso binding sites in zzso
