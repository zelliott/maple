zzso raised to an overlapping series of peptides following the zzso acid sequence of the external envelope zzso zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso recognize eight regions in zzso zzso 120 zzso If the zzso molecules are zzso three of these regions show a reduced capacity to bind zzso Of the other five regions, two are zzso and zzso restricts zzso binding to their zzso zzso and three can be recognized by zzso in zzso zzso 120 from an unrelated strain of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso patients bind at high levels to peptides from five regions of zzso zzso Of these regions, two coincide with those recognized by zzso raised to zzso Four of the five zzso recognized by the rat zzso zzso whose ability to bind zzso is influenced most by zzso and three of the five regions which induce high levels of zzso in patients' zzso contain putative zzso sites which are variable between strains of zzso Such sites flank the putative zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso It is suggested that changes in the number and position of zzso zzso following zzso can alternately mask and reveal zzso zzso an zzso can render a virus resistant to zzso whereas virus which binds zzso without being neutralized is able to gain entry to cells bearing zzso and complement zzso Changes in the zzso pattern of zzso 120 may therefore contribute to the control of zzso spread within its zzso
