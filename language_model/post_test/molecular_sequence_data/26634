zzso capture zzso zzso is useful tool for sequencing of peptides and proteins with zzso zzso To increase the sequence coverage for peptides and zzso it is important to develop zzso device with high fragmentation zzso 

zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso was performed by use of electron capture zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a linear zzso zzso zzso trap that was coupled to a zzso mass zzso We applied zzso hot zzso zzso with high electron zzso and zzso for intact zzso zzso zzso of various charge states and evaluated the sequence coverage of their zzso zzso 

Hot zzso produced a higher number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of modified zzso zzso as electron energy increased in lower charged zzso zzso and sequence coverage greater than zzso was obtained compared with the zzso case zzso 

The result indicates that intact zzso modified peptides zzso zzso were correctly identified by use of hot zzso
