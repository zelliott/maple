Native zzso zzso zzso play essential roles in cellular and zzso processes throughout zzso Individual motor molecules consist of a zzso complex of three zzso which, when properly zzso are capable of force zzso Here, we more completely characterize the properties, relationships and associations that each zzso has with one another in zzso zzso All three native zzso zzso II zzso zzso are expressed in close to constant zzso to each other throughout zzso We find that the stability of two zzso the heavy chain and the regulatory light chain, depend on one another whereas the stability of the third zzso the essential light chain, does not depend on either the heavy chain or regulatory light zzso We demonstrate that heavy chain zzso which form when regulatory light chain is zzso associate with the essential light chain in zzso showing that regulatory light chain association is required for heavy chain zzso By zzso we find that the majority of both light chains are associated with the zzso zzso II heavy chain but pools of free light chain and/or light chain bound to other proteins are zzso We identify four zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso VI and zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso as binding partners for the essential light chain (but not the regulatory light zzso through mass zzso and zzso Using an in zzso approach we identify six previously zzso genes that contain zzso and may be essential light chain binding zzso
