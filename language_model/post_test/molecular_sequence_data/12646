We have used zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso to determine the solution structure of a 141 zzso protein containing the zzso zzso domain from the alpha chain of the zzso G protein zzso The domain contains six zzso and is stable and structured in solution despite having been excised from the intact zzso zzso The zzso ten and zzso 11 zzso of the protein are zzso in solution while the core is well determined by the zzso distance and zzso restraints derived from the zzso zzso The final ensemble of 14 structures, generated with a hybrid distance zzso zzso zzso have an average zzso backbone zzso zzso of zzso A for the core zzso 89 to zzso The majority of the structure is remarkably similar to that observed for the zzso zzso in crystal structures of the zzso proteins alpha zzso and alpha zzso However, the zzso of the second zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso differ markedly among the three zzso This structural zzso along with functional studies of zzso zzso suggests that this region of the domain interacts with either the downstream zzso zzso zzso or with some other zzso zzso
