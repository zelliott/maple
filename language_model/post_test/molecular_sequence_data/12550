We report several unexpected findings that provide novel insights into the properties and interactions of the alpha 1 and beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso First, the beta zzso zzso was expressed as multiple species of zzso zzso the zzso species arose from zzso zzso Second, cell zzso and zzso studies indicated that the zzso beta zzso zzso when expressed alone, was zzso Third, the beta zzso zzso increased the membrane zzso of the alpha 1 zzso and the number of cells expressing zzso zzso zzso without affecting the total amount of the expressed alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso currents in alpha zzso zzso zzso cells paralleled the time course of expression of the beta zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the beta zzso plays multiple roles in the formation, stabilization, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
