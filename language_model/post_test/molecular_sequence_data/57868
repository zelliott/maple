There is great concern over the long-term influence of oral zzso on the development of breast cancer in zzso zzso are known to stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells, and this laboratory has previously reported zzso & Jordan, zzso that the zzso zzso could stimulate the proliferation of zzso human breast cancer zzso We studied the influence of the zzso zzso and zzso compared to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso proliferation at a concentration of zzso M, while zzso could not stimulate proliferation at zzso as great as 3 zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso could be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso studies with the reporter plasmids containing an zzso response element or zzso response element zzso zzso and zzso were performed to determine the zzso action of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso the zzso activity zzso at zzso M, and this stimulation was inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso A single base pair zzso in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso in the zzso led to a dramatic decrease in zzso expression by the zzso suggesting that the zzso activity required specific response element base zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso at zzso well below growth zzso zzso This stimulation could be blocked by zzso These studies suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso breast cancer cell growth by zzso the zzso zzso
