Our goal is to understand the assembly and regulation of zzso zzso particularly the zzso inner arm zzso called zzso zzso Here, we focus on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel zzso without notable structural zzso zzso shares zzso with the zzso lung zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso candidate tumor zzso gene implicated in lung zzso zzso independent zzso zzso determined that zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso assembly zzso suggest that zzso interacts with both the zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso motor complex and that zzso is part of a regulatory complex that contains zzso zzso sliding zzso using zzso containing zzso zzso but devoid of zzso show reduced zzso sliding zzso that are not rescued by zzso zzso revealing a critical role for zzso in zzso function and control of zzso zzso
