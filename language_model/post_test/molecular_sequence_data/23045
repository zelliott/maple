zzso zzso structures of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso reveal a fatty acid in the binding zzso Mass zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a ratio of approximately zzso with 11, zzso acid zzso zzso identified as the zzso zzso These are zzso fatty acids acquired from the bacterial expression system, and serve to lock the zzso domain into the activated zzso A requirement for crystal growth, the additive zzso binds near the zzso function zzso where recognition of zzso proteins zzso Our observations suggest potential zzso zzso for human zzso and highlight that reported binding studies must be treated with caution unless zzso fatty acids have been removed from the sample prior to zzso
