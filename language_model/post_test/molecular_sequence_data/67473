zzso and understanding the collection of all zzso resistance zzso presented in the global zzso the zzso zzso provides insight into the evolution of zzso resistance and critical information for the development of future zzso The zzso are zzso antibiotics that target bacterial zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso of the drug target is the zzso mechanism of resistance to this family of antibiotics in the clinic, a number of diverse zzso mechanisms have also been zzso In this report, we investigate a subset of environmental zzso zzso zzso and identify a diverse collection of zzso zzso zzso We describe a single zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso by zzso A draft zzso sequence of zzso (most closely related to zzso zzso according to a zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso and the associated zzso zzso open reading frame, zzso was zzso The role of zzso in zzso resistance was confirmed by its disruption in the bacterial zzso resulting in a loss of zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso Interestingly, examination of the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso suggests that it harbors a resistant target and thus possesses dual mechanisms of zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso could zzso a variety of zzso antibiotics with comparable zzso zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as a zzso resistance zzso from zzso capable of zzso an assortment of zzso adding a new element to the zzso zzso
