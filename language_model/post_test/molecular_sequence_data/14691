zzso supply of new zzso during DNA replication is critical to restore zzso organization and maintain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso function 1 zzso serves a key function in providing zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso We identify zzso as a novel interaction partner of zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso can cause zzso zzso zzso type I zzso characterized by zzso abnormalities in bone zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso zzso complex and binds directly to zzso via a zzso zzso zzso a mutually exclusive interaction with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso depletion zzso the rate of DNA replication and increases the level of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso guards a limiting step in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression arrests zzso progression by zzso zzso in the zzso blocking zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso function in zzso zzso This function is compromised by two zzso zzso that impair complex formation with zzso providing insight into the molecular basis for zzso zzso
