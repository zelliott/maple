zzso zzso zzso I and III consist of multiple zzso Each of these zzso includes two distinct and zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso which are shared only by zzso I and zzso The zzso zzso show limited zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into the structure and function of zzso zzso we cloned and characterized a gene from zzso zzso that encodes a protein of 17 zzso which can functionally replace zzso - an zzso zzso of zzso zzso I and III of zzso zzso - and was thus named zzso zzso has 125 zzso acids and shows zzso identity to zzso over a zzso stretch, whereas the zzso regions of the two proteins are highly zzso zzso of zzso shows that the gene is essential for cell zzso zzso comparison with other zzso zzso from different species showed that zzso contains an zzso acid block that is zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso regions of zzso and zzso confirms that the zzso acid block is important for the function of the zzso zzso
