The effect of nitrogen and carbon status on the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, zzso and zzso activities were five- and zzso higher, respectively, and zzso of the corresponding genes zzso and zzso was similarly zzso zzso activity was also induced in complete medium with added zzso while zzso activity was zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, the level of zzso induction was reduced approximately zzso whereas zzso activity did not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso upstream of zzso reduced the levels of zzso activity zzso under both zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies using a zzso zzso fusion zzso revealed that zzso of zzso is moderately induced zzso zzso by nitrogen zzso indicating that the zzso protein may play a role in signal zzso of the nutritional status of the growth zzso
