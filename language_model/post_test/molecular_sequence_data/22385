The major zzso complex zzso class II alpha chain gene of the zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso We zzso zzso and studied its zzso before evaluating its expression in resting zzso zzso zzso and tumor cells as well as in primed zzso A complete zzso was obtained by overlapping sequence fragments obtained by zzso The full-length zzso comprises zzso zzso with a zzso region of 84 zzso an zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso The putative protein of 242 zzso shows zzso with known zzso class II alpha zzso varying from 71 to zzso in other fish and humans, zzso The protein sequence showed all the important features: leader zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso tree shows that it is included in the cluster containing the zzso zzso and far from the human and shark zzso It is zzso as seen when we zzso the complete zzso of 11 zzso showing most of the zzso zzso changes in the zzso domain, where the zzso region zzso is zzso zzso zzso expression was mainly found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Minor expression was detected in gut, brain, liver and zzso zzso expression studies in isolated zzso zzso revealed, for the first time in the literature, that zzso zzso show high zzso class II gene zzso Apart from these zzso zzso also express the zzso zzso although other cell types may also do the zzso Finally, incubation of zzso zzso with zzso cells or zzso bacteria zzso zzso gene expression whilst incubation with zzso zzso or zzso does zzso The possible involvement of the zzso zzso class II alpha gene in the fish zzso and zzso presentation are zzso
