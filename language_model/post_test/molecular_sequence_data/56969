In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso promoters overlap and are zzso zzso Three tandem repeats of an 8 zzso sequence defined previously as the zzso operator site for zzso repression also overlap the zzso region of the zzso zzso Starting with a zzso double gene fusion, zzso zzso was used to change zzso in each of the repeat units from the consensus zzso Each zzso along with the zzso zzso gene fusion, was cloned into zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes was examined by measuring zzso and zzso levels in zzso coli strains zzso with zzso carrying the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in each of the 8 zzso repeat units disrupt zzso repression for both the zzso and zzso gene zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso genes share a common operator site for the zzso zzso
