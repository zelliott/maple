We used zzso zzso and in zzso analyses to show that zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain protein related to animal zzso zzso is a novel zzso binding protein in zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso zzso protein accumulated in the nucleus and zzso of tobacco zzso zzso It associated predominantly with zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the ability of zzso to bind directly to zzso filaments with high zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso and zzso loss in zzso showed a highly dynamic in zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly delayed zzso of the zzso zzso induced by zzso B zzso zzso also stabilized zzso filaments in zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso leaves zzso significant changes in zzso zzso organization, specifically, fewer and thicker zzso zzso than in control cells, suggesting that zzso functions as an zzso bundling zzso This hypothesis was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and direct observation of zzso zzso that formed in zzso in the presence of zzso Taken together, these data identify zzso as a novel zzso binding protein that increases zzso zzso stability by promoting bundling of zzso zzso
