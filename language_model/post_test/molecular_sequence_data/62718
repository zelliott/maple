Some zzso proteins are known to zzso a specific resistance against a panel of zzso zzso zzso Many diseases due to such viruses are known to affect cattle worldwide, raising the possibility that the identification of an zzso zzso of a bovine zzso protein would allow the zzso of genetic selection programs aimed at improving innate resistance of zzso With this potential application in mind, the present study was designed to isolate the bovine zzso gene including its promoter region and to investigate its zzso zzso and promoter zzso The bovine zzso gene is made up of 15 zzso All zzso boundaries zzso to the consensus zzso A zzso product that contained a approximately zzso zzso region upstream from the putative zzso start site was zzso zzso this DNA region did not contain zzso or zzso zzso A computer scan of the region disclosed a series of putative binding sites for known zzso and zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso typical of an zzso responsive element, between zzso and zzso from the putative zzso start zzso There were also a zzso two zzso binding sites, two zzso sites and five zzso zzso The region also contained 12 stretches of the zzso type, as described in all zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed by Northern zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso bovine kidney cells zzso cell line treated with several zzso In conclusion, the bovine zzso gene and promoter region share the major structural and functional characteristics displayed by their zzso described in the rainbow trout, chicken, mouse and zzso
