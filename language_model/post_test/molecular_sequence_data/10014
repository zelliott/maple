The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso III family of zzso zzso To examine zzso structural features required for efficient zzso by the zzso zzso we tested a variety of zzso and hairpin zzso as zzso for the zzso The zzso zzso required zzso that have a minimal zzso length of about 20 base zzso The zzso cut both strands of the zzso at sites separated by two base zzso However, zzso was also able to make a zzso zzso within an internal zzso of an authentic zzso coli zzso at the same site chosen by zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso the structurally complex zzso VA zzso but was inactive against the short zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso prefers straight, perfect zzso but it can tolerate internal zzso that do not distort the zzso zzso Like its zzso from zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso at two in zzso zzso processing sites in a hairpin structure in the 3' external transcribed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role for the zzso in zzso zzso
