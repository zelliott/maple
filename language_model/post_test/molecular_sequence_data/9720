The involvement of basic zzso of zzso receptors in zzso to the zzso and zzso proteins was investigated by using a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the basic zzso acids in the third inner loop of the zzso does not alter the abilities of the zzso zzso to activate zzso zzso or zzso zzso C zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso with double zzso at zzso zzso and zzso of the second inner loop loses its abilities to activate zzso but retains its ability to activate zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by an zzso zzso that is sensitive to zzso toxin has been previously demonstrated to be zzso through zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso with substitution of Ala for either zzso zzso or zzso can still activate zzso which suggests that either of the two basic zzso in the second inner loop of the zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso
