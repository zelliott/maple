Some of the most zzso short tandem repeats zzso have zzso differing in size by as little as one zzso Since zzso precision with commercially available internal standards zzso does not allow safe discrimination at this level, typing is accomplished through comparisons with zzso ladders run on each zzso Here we introduce the use of zzso spaced zzso zzso as a dedicated internal standard for measurement and typing of zzso zzso We have constructed such a dedicated internal standard for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 (1983) zzso zzso including 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning the size range for zzso at this locus zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso runs of selected zzso with this dedicated standard and the commercial zzso internal standard demonstrate that only the presently described internal standard is suited for direct typing based on zzso length zzso zzso zzso advantages of this typing procedure are that zzso zzso are precise and in accordance with zzso zzso and that the typing procedure via an external zzso zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso used in the internal standard as well as of selected zzso for zzso ladders in two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 (1991) zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso are also zzso To allow zzso length analysis of these two zzso five zzso zzso spanning from 176 to 225 zzso were added to the dedicated internal zzso Performing similar comparisons as for zzso it is demonstrated that even if zzso accuracy is not as good as with zzso typing based on measured zzso size only may be achieved with both other zzso as zzso zzso different zzso for the three zzso triplex zzso runs were performed of a Norwegian population database of 300 unrelated zzso The probability that two unrelated individuals have the same type in all three zzso is 5 zzso zzso and the combined zzso exclusion power zzso indicating that this zzso selection may represent a good choice for forensic genetic zzso
