zzso is a distinctive zzso of the zzso family that encodes a zzso zzso zzso to resolve zzso zzso zzso The internal resolution site of zzso zzso 116 zzso contains two zzso repeats zzso and zzso at the crossover core site, and two additional zzso binding motifs zzso and zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso are not required for zzso in zzso and in zzso Their function is to provide resolution selectivity to the reaction by stimulating zzso between directly oriented sites on a same DNA zzso In the absence of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso gives a mixture of zzso variable products, while deletion between two zzso zzso exclusively produces zzso zzso This demonstrates that zzso binding to the accessory motifs zzso and zzso contributes to the formation of a specific synaptic complex in which zzso zzso zzso zzso act as architectural elements to control zzso sites pairing and strand zzso A model for the organization of zzso zzso complex is zzso
