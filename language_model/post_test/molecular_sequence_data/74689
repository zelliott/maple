The zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso which is found in the zzso zzso and involved in the innate immune zzso Its zzso activity is effective against a wide range of zzso suggesting a relatively zzso mechanism of zzso We review here the specific zzso activities that have been characterized for zzso Although zzso and zzso are primarily associated with the host defense against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso has also an zzso activity, which is not shared by the other, zzso zzso zzso the zzso derived zzso zzso Although there is no evidence for direct involvement in zzso of zzso in the host response to bacterial infection, zzso is active against both zzso and zzso bacterial strains and its mechanism depends on its action both at the bacterial cell wall and zzso membrane zzso Other zzso activities, including zzso activity, are also zzso zzso of the protein activity by zzso modifications and the currently identified zzso are zzso zzso zzso as innate immune proteins with zzso and zzso properties, present substantial therapeutic potential in the drug development industry, both in the search of alternative antibiotics and for the treatment of inflammatory zzso
