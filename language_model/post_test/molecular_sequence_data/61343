zzso protein zzso constitute a novel class of zzso that can modify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that are essential for zzso zzso are among the best characterized proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been considered as highly specific for the zzso of these zzso thereby contributing to zzso zzso However, despite the fact that zzso proteins are more or less zzso among zzso and have a rather ubiquitous tissue distribution we now demonstrate that zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso In zzso expression analysis on zzso sections of adult mouse zzso shows that zzso zzso is abundant in all zzso cells but not in mature zzso zzso zzso activity was found primarily in the zzso and only minimal activity was detected in the zzso In a search for zzso zzso of zzso we found that the zzso zzso human zzso 1 as well as a zzso pool of zzso proteins present in the zzso zzso 1 belongs to a family of small basic zzso proteins that replace zzso during the development of mature zzso The result of this progressive replacement is the formation of a highly compact zzso structure devoid of any zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may have a role not only in zzso zzso but also in the zzso of zzso zzso
