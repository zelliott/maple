zzso of the structure of the zzso zzso state of zzso is central to an understanding of the zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso We examined this state by zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso The derived structure, to which more than one zzso appeared to zzso was compared with the crystal structure of the zzso des zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between the two proteins were evident in the orientation of the zzso zzso in the zzso loop, in zzso and in specific zzso contacts between zzso and zzso zzso However, both had similar secondary structures, in independent confirmation of earlier circular zzso zzso Previously suggested interactions between the zzso zzso and the zzso loop in the zzso were also zzso zzso of the observed differences between the two proteins with demonstrated effects of zzso on the zzso spectrum of bovine zzso and preliminary investigation of the effects of zzso on zzso zzso allowed tentative distinction between the contributions of sequence and zzso differences to the difference in zzso zzso altered by zzso zzso most binding site zzso providing a potential explanation of differences in binding affinity between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso states in turns, zzso zzso and within the zzso segment of the zzso loop suggest that the effects of zzso on zzso zzso reflect the need to adjust the relative positions of the interface segments of the two zzso for optimal interaction with the adjacent zzso and/or reflect the dual role of some zzso as participants both at the interface and in zzso zzso
