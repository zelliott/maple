DNA motifs at several zzso zzso in more than 500 strains of zzso zzso from five zzso were studied by zzso and sequencing to gain insights into the evolution of this gastric zzso Five types of zzso zzso and substitution motifs were found at the right end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the three most common zzso type I predominated in zzso native zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also in native Africans and zzso residents; type II predominated among Japanese and zzso and type III predominated in Indians from zzso zzso in the zzso gene and in zzso type zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso of strains from native zzso were also more like those from zzso than those from zzso These indications of zzso of Latin American and Spanish zzso despite the closer genetic zzso of zzso and Asian people themselves, lead us to suggest that zzso zzso may have been brought to the New World by European conquerors and colonists about 500 years zzso This thinking, in turn, suggests that zzso zzso infection might have become widespread in people quite recently in human zzso
