zzso to zzso zzso can be transferred from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso by the zzso of nine zzso zzso zzso acid zzso yielding zzso zzso To determine whether the hallmarks of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso channels zzso zzso constants, zzso and zzso by other chemical classes of zzso zzso zzso were maintained in zzso we zzso the pharmacological properties of zzso zzso zzso channels after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 86 zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso and zzso zzso 67 zzso to zzso occurred at low zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was highly zzso zzso higher affinity for zzso As with native channels it was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso This suggested that the three-dimensional architecture of the channel pore was maintained within the zzso zzso zzso To predict the three-dimensional arrangement of the zzso zzso we exploited the X-ray structure of a recently zzso bacterial zzso channel zzso as a zzso Our model is based on the assumption that the zzso channel zzso and zzso segments closely resemble the zzso zzso folding zzso In the absence of three-dimensional structural data for the zzso zzso this is currently the most reasonable approach for zzso this zzso zzso Our model predicts that the previously identified zzso zzso form a binding pocket large enough to zzso a single zzso zzso It also implies that the four zzso zzso channel repeats are arranged in a zzso zzso
