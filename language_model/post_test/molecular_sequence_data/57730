We have isolated the zzso zzso a binding protein to the sequence motif of the zzso S zzso region by the southwestern zzso The binding protein designated S zzso zzso specifically binds to zzso zzso DNA containing zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence showed that the S zzso zzso belongs to the putative zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of S zzso zzso zzso is ubiquitous and zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso 4 which also induce class zzso The S zzso zzso gene is zzso among zzso zzso involvement of S zzso zzso in class switching is zzso
