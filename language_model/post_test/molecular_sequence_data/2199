The binding of zzso to bovine zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso of various zzso and human zzso zzso In the absence of initiation factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso do not bind zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso shorter than about 10 zzso The zzso binding domain on the 28 S zzso zzso spans approximately 80 zzso of the zzso judging from the size of the fragments of zzso and natural zzso protected from zzso zzso zzso by this zzso but the major binding interaction with the zzso appears to occur over a zzso zzso Human zzso zzso coding for zzso II and III of zzso c zzso and zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso I) were used in studying in detail the binding of zzso to the small zzso of bovine zzso zzso We have determined that these zzso have considerable secondary structure in their zzso regions and that the initiation zzso of each zzso is zzso in a stem zzso Little zzso was bound to zzso in a manner zzso protection of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso under standard conditions supporting the binding of artificial templates, but such binding was greatly zzso by the addition of a zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso from zzso coli were unable to stimulate the zzso zzso protected binding of these zzso zzso demonstrating a requirement for zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso initiation factors are required for the proper recognition and melting of the secondary structure in the zzso region of zzso zzso as a prerequisite for initiation of protein synthesis in zzso zzso
