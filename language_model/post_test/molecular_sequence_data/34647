The lung zzso zzso consists of type I and type II zzso In zzso the type II cell is the zzso cell from which the type I cell zzso When zzso type II cells are cultured under conventional conditions they rapidly lose their zzso properties and attain characteristics of type I zzso Taking advantage of this zzso we sought to identify genes that are zzso expressed during culture of rat type II zzso Using suppression zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso C2 zzso gene zzso was found to be enriched in freshly isolated rat type II cells compared to those cultured for 4 zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso confirmed the differential expression of zzso during in zzso culture of isolated type II zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced early during in zzso zzso almost zzso reduction was observed after 24 h of incubation as determined by real-time zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso lung zzso cells, an expression pattern similar to that of zzso protein B zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed a unique tissue distribution with zzso expression limited to zzso kidney and zzso The presence and expression of zzso gene transcript zzso resulting from alternative zzso were also zzso zzso of differential expression of zzso in type II cells and further studies of its regulation may provide information useful in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying zzso and functional changes during zzso of zzso zzso zzso
