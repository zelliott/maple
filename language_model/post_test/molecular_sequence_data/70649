The zzso acid zzso protein is the major zzso accessory protein of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso As zzso is not part of the zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso its incorporation requires an anchor to associate with the assembling viral zzso Although the molecular mechanism is presently zzso the zzso region of the zzso corresponding to the zzso domain appears to constitute such an anchor essential for the incorporation of the zzso zzso In order to clarify the mechanism by which the zzso accessory protein is zzso into progeny zzso zzso we tested whether zzso zzso zzso with the zzso using the zzso zzso system and the zzso protein pull-down zzso The present study provides genetic and zzso evidence indicating that the zzso can physically interact with the zzso zzso Furthermore, point zzso affecting the integrity of the zzso zzso motif of zzso completely abolish the interaction between zzso and the zzso and, as a consequence, prevent zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other studies, zzso affecting the integrity of the zzso zinc fingers impaired neither zzso zzso incorporation nor the binding between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso demonstrate that an intact zzso zzso structure is essential for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso demonstrate a strong interaction in zzso as salt zzso as high as 900 zzso could not disrupt the zzso Finally, the interaction is efficiently zzso using zzso zzso Together, these results strongly suggest that zzso zzso into zzso particles requires a direct interaction between its zzso region and the zzso region of zzso The development of zzso interaction zzso may allow the screening of molecules that can prevent the incorporation of the zzso accessory protein into zzso zzso and thus inhibit its early zzso
