The zzso chain reaction zzso with three zzso zzso was used to amplify both 184 zzso and 425 zzso DNA fragments of zzso toxin A zzso gene zzso for detection and identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains in one zzso For enhancing the sensitivity, we have used the zzso detection system for Southern zzso A total of 92 zzso strains were tested by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso coli zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso were also tested for cross zzso Our results indicated that the correlation between the zzso zzso method and the molecular biological zzso method were very zzso The lowest zzso amount of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso is 2 zzso and zzso zzso by zzso detection zzso In this work we report a zzso zzso with a combination of three zzso to detect and identify the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in one zzso The simplified and accurate method is useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso detection and zzso
