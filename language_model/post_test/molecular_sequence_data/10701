zzso growth factors zzso and zzso in biological zzso bind to zzso binding proteins zzso to zzso which transport them and regulate their zzso Limited zzso of certain zzso plays a major role in this zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and in several cell lines by zzso zzso including zzso In earlier studies we reproduced this zzso in zzso using zzso human zzso zzso Two major fragments were zzso the larger retaining weak affinity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso The smaller fragment, though lacking affinity for zzso is a potent growth zzso These zzso fragments were isolated by zzso and their zzso zzso acids zzso Both major fragments contain the zzso region of the intact zzso the larger form corresponding to zzso zzso and the smaller form, to zzso zzso zzso experiments using the zzso zzso cell line showed that the larger zzso is generated before the smaller zzso the latter probably being a product of secondary zzso of the zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso is intimately linked to its biological zzso We propose a model for its action at cellular zzso
