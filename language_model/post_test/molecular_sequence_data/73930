zzso is an zzso zzso zzso expressed primarily in cells of the zzso and germ line zzso Previously identified only in zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from the African clawed zzso zzso zzso The coding region of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 324 zzso which exhibited zzso zzso acid identity with the full-length human zzso zzso zzso was expressed in bacteria as a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein and in zzso zzso zzso acid analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and to a more limited extent on zzso zzso zzso mass zzso was undertaken to locate these zzso sites, and the primary zzso site of zzso was identified as zzso with zzso and zzso being minor zzso zzso which immediately follows the high zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso zzso is also featured in more than 20 other protein zzso To evaluate the importance of the zzso site on the zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso to either zzso or zzso acid, and the zzso were expressed in bacteria as zzso fusion proteins and in zzso zzso These zzso confirmed that zzso is a major zzso site of zzso and indicated that zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso may serve to activate this zzso
