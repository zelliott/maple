The zzso zzso domain is zzso amongst many zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso to specific DNA sites containing a central zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso this motif define the binding specificity of individual zzso In this study we have investigated binding specificity of the zzso from two members of the zzso complex factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso select similar sites from random pools of double stranded zzso based on the consensus sequence zzso However, zzso shows a more relaxed binding site selectivity and binds efficiently to a greater spectrum of sites than does zzso This more relaxed DNA binding site selectivity is most pronounced in zzso located on the 3' side of the zzso zzso This differential zzso specificity is also exhibited by longer zzso derivatives and, indeed by the full-length zzso Our results suggest that the range of potential in zzso target sites for zzso is likely to be greater than for zzso We discuss our results in relation to other similar studies carried out with more divergent zzso
