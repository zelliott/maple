The function of the zzso protein of human T cell zzso virus type I zzso has been under zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this protein at zzso acid 88 and a shorter life of zzso had been reported by another zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients usually have a higher zzso load than zzso zzso carriers zzso and zzso had been suggested to zzso a zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso it is possible that the relatively unstable zzso is less frequent in zzso patients than in zzso To zzso whether zzso and other zzso in the zzso gene were related to the outcome of zzso infection, we zzso the zzso gene in 144 zzso patients, 41 adult T cell leukemia zzso patients, and in 46 zzso zzso was observed in only two zzso patients, but was not present in either ATL patients or zzso Interestingly, a premature termination zzso in the zzso was observed in zzso of zzso patients and in zzso of ATL patients but none was found in zzso The zzso initiation zzso was destroyed in one zzso zzso These zzso zzso with truncated zzso protein or with a destroyed initiation zzso in the zzso gene appeared to have been transmitted in the subjects' zzso These findings suggest that zzso is zzso for the transmission and maintenance of zzso infection, although it is premature to conclude that sequence zzso in the zzso gene is associated with differences in the outcome of zzso zzso
