zzso binding of DNA with multiple proteins is pivotal to many regulatory cellular zzso Due to the lack of experimental approaches, the zzso of assembly and zzso of zzso proteins complexes have never been zzso Here, we report on a first method capable of measuring zzso zzso of such zzso The method is based on continuous spatial separation of different zzso The zzso of multiple complex zzso processes are also zzso zzso which in turn zzso finding their rate zzso Our zzso approach was compared with a conventional zzso approach by using computer simulation of zzso zzso It proved to be much more accurate than the zzso approach and to be a powerful tool for testing hypothetical mechanisms of the zzso of zzso proteins zzso An experimental zzso of the zzso approach was finally demonstrated by using zzso zzso as a separation zzso The interaction between an 80 zzso long zzso DNA and zzso DNA binding protein was zzso zzso complexes with one and two proteins were observed, and rate zzso of their zzso were zzso We zzso that a separation approach will be also developed to study the zzso of the formation of zzso protein zzso
