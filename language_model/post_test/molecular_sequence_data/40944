The potential for zzso electron zzso to stimulate zzso zzso was investigated with zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttling compounds including zzso zzso and soluble zzso substances zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in electron shuttle amended and zzso zzso however, the zzso of zzso zzso in particular zzso and ring zzso products zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were different in zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the absence of electron zzso zzso zzso zzso Most notably, zzso of zzso was zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso amended or zzso zzso was less than zzso within the same time zzso The primary differences in the presence of electron zzso were the increased production of zzso and zzso zzso did not further zzso but zzso was not present at final time points, suggesting that it was the zzso precursor for zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso with zzso reduction rather than nitrate or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction analysis zzso indicated that unique zzso microbial communities zzso and zzso predominated in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that indigenous zzso zzso in zzso environments zzso zzso electron zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may become an effective in zzso option for contaminated zzso
