zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso a zzso zzso is controlled by a complex regulatory network that zzso multiple signal zzso zzso of several zzso zzso is zzso reduced by zzso of zzso but is restored by growth in the presence of a volatile zzso factor zzso produced by zzso strains of zzso zzso The zzso was zzso from spent culture broth by zzso zzso zzso and liquid zzso Gas zzso and mass zzso identified zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso as the major component in the single peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were active at zzso or zzso zzso and had nearly equivalent specific activities for stimulating the expression of zzso (the zzso locus for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the production of three zzso factors by a zzso zzso over zzso to zzso levels, restored normal cell zzso expression of zzso and increased expression of zzso when delivered via the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence suggested that it is a zzso zzso zzso which might zzso synthesis of zzso zzso from a naturally occurring fatty zzso zzso active zzso of zzso zzso zzso were detected before the onset of zzso zzso suggesting that it is an zzso signal that zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso Other than zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso fatty acid zzso shown to be an zzso and may be the first example of a new family of compounds that can mediate long-distance zzso zzso
