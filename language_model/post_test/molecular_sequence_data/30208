zzso response elements involved in the zzso and zzso regulated expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso have been shown to include a zzso sequence element zzso regulatory element zzso We have recently identified a zzso factor, zzso zzso binding zzso that specifically interacts with this sequence and have shown that the binding activity of zzso to zzso is zzso regulated and zzso by zzso Here, we examine further the possible role of zzso in the regulation of zzso and three other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso itself (or other closely related zzso recognizes dissimilar zzso elements present in the zzso regions of these genes and that the ability of the individual, distinct zzso elements to zzso regulated expression on a promoter deletion zzso of the zzso gene is correlated with the relative affinity for zzso zzso elements carrying point zzso that prevent in zzso binding of zzso to two of the zzso elements fail to activate expression in zzso An analysis of major points of contact between the zzso protein and two distinctly different binding sites suggests that binding of zzso to these sequence elements involves a considerable degree of flexibility in zzso zzso These results suggest that the regulated expression of a class of zzso zzso genes involves the interaction of zzso or zzso factors with dissimilar zzso sequence elements and that induction of zzso activity or that of zzso factors by zzso may thus be a limiting step in the induction of this temporally coordinate set of genes during zzso zzso
