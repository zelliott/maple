In acute zzso leukemia zzso two clusters of zzso zzso are known in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain in zzso to zzso of patients, and zzso point zzso in the zzso domain zzso in zzso to zzso of patients, zzso Here, we have characterized a new class of zzso point zzso zzso that cluster in a zzso acid stretch of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells led to zzso growth, zzso to zzso zzso and resistance to zzso cell zzso zzso receptors were zzso and showed a higher zzso zzso rate compared with the zzso zzso zzso As a molecular zzso we could show zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso by all zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso growth of zzso zzso Compared with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso showed a weaker transforming potential related to lower zzso of the zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso of the zzso on the crystal structure of zzso showed that these zzso reduce the stability of the zzso zzso domain, and provides a structural basis for the transforming capacity of this new class of zzso zzso of zzso
