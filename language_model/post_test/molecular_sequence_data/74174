zzso zzso is an insect pathogen zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso The bacteria produce a number of toxins to overcome immune response of insect hosts and kill their zzso We zzso a novel zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso cloned and zzso gene sequence of this novel zzso 

We isolated and zzso the zzso protein by methods of zzso out and zzso from the zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso We tested the zzso of the protein by direct injection into zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein was identified by western zzso The gene of zzso protein was cloned by zzso and analyzed in zzso 

We zzso a novel zzso zzso protein that was named as zzso The zzso zzso potency zzso of zzso was zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso only showed a single - zzso zzso Western zzso with an zzso that was highly specific to the known zzso indicated that zzso was zzso to the known zzso and only existed inside zzso The zzso sequences of zzso gene have been deposited in zzso zzso number zzso zzso The size of the open reading frame of zzso was zzso zzso a zzso of 368 zzso acid zzso with a theoretical molecular weight zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso shared zzso zzso of zzso sequences and zzso zzso acids with those of 13 group zzso 

zzso is high zzso virulent for zzso zzso larvae and its zzso sequence is highly zzso which play a key role during the zzso killing host insects zzso
