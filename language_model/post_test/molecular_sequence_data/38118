The zzso structure of the complex between human zzso zzso zzso and one of its zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution from zzso obtained at pH zzso This structure shows that the binding of the zzso zzso head to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso differs from that found previously with zzso zzso The difference is attributed to a change in the zzso state of the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso when soaked with zzso of human (at pH zzso or pig lens zzso (at pH zzso This work demonstrates how strongly the detailed binding of the zzso polar head depends on its zzso zzso
