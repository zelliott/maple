The product of the zzso gene of zzso zzso which is needed for the initiation of zzso DNA zzso has zzso with known and putative protein zzso This zzso is confined to the zzso zzso domain, which has a unique zzso in zzso To demonstrate that, nonetheless, zzso protein has zzso activity, the gene was zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and translation in zzso was capable of transferring zzso from zzso to zzso This activity was not dependent on zzso or zzso zzso A zzso of zzso constructed in zzso in which the zzso of the zzso zzso domain was converted to that found in all other similar zzso was unable to function in zzso as judged by its inability to complement the zzso zzso This suggests that the abnormal structure of the zzso zzso domain is a key element in the cellular function of this protein in initiating DNA zzso
