zzso are members of the vitamin B12 family of zzso that function in a variety of zzso processes and are zzso only by zzso zzso produced by different organisms vary in the structure of the lower zzso zzso Here we explore the molecular factors that control specificity in the incorporation of lower zzso bases into zzso We find that the zzso gene product, which activates lower zzso bases for attachment, limits the range of lower zzso bases that can be incorporated by zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso specificity of zzso can be predictably altered by changing two active site zzso These results demonstrate that sequence variations in zzso zzso contribute to zzso structural zzso This analysis could open new routes to engineering specific zzso production and understanding zzso zzso
