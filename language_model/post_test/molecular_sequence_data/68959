Human class II zzso genes are regulated in part by a series of zzso upstream sequence elements termed the zzso zzso and Y zzso Class II zzso zzso zzso B cell lines have been defined that differ with regard to the presence of zzso an zzso box zzso zzso To further characterize these zzso cell lines, we tested the ability of these zzso upstream elements to respond to the presence of known zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso promoter reporter constructions carrying zzso binding sites and zzso fusion protein expression zzso were zzso into both wild type B cells and zzso B cells representing the two zzso zzso Regardless of zzso or class II zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could zzso stimulate expression of constructions containing both the zzso and Y zzso zzso and zzso expression was inhibited by the presence of the zzso box in cells that contained zzso In zzso cells that lacked zzso zzso zzso was not zzso In the zzso class II zzso cell line zzso the zzso box zzso activity could be overcome by separating the zzso site from the zzso box by two additional zzso turns, suggesting that the zzso factor is bound at the zzso site and zzso interferes with zzso This was not the case in wild type B cells, suggesting that a stable higher order complex forms in wild type cells and not in the zzso zzso
