zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso lethal skeletal zzso that is classified into the severe zzso zzso zzso group in the international zzso for skeletal zzso The zzso hallmark of zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Recently, based on human and mouse genetic studies, we showed that zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso cause zzso 

To explore further the range of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso whether zzso zzso cause other skeletal zzso that belong to the zzso zzso 

We searched for zzso zzso in five families with zzso and 15 patients with other zzso group diseases, including zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso type and zzso We identified four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso deletion causing the removal of zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso caused skipping of zzso 4 and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso protein lost the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso all these zzso result in loss of zzso No zzso zzso were identified in all patients with other zzso group zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso result consistently in zzso and are exclusive to zzso
