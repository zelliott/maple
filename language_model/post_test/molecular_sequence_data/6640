The class 3 zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso is a potential target for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso peptides spanning the class 3 zzso from the vaccine strain zzso zzso were zzso on pins and screened with serum obtained from Norwegian adolescents zzso with a zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso A strong zzso response to a single zzso zzso located within loop 1 zzso was zzso after three doses of zzso vaccine in three zzso selected on the basis of their zzso response to class 3 zzso No clear linear zzso zzso were recognized by four different zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing loop 1 of the class 3 zzso was zzso and the zzso responses were measured in zzso and zzso serum from 27 zzso zzso zzso rose significantly in 37% of zzso 6 weeks after the second dose and in zzso of the zzso 6 weeks after the third dose of the zzso zzso Most immune zzso reacted distinctly on zzso with zzso class 3 zzso and the zzso zzso correlated strongly with concentration of the zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso When added to a zzso serum from one zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently with the class 3 zzso for specific zzso binding on zzso and in pin zzso The results show that the significant part of the zzso response to the zzso class 3 zzso zzso by vaccination with the Norwegian zzso vaccine was directed against a single continuous zzso
