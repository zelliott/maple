The paper describes a potent zzso method, zzso gel zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This procedure exploits the zzso zzso affinity of such proteins for their enrichment, comparable to recognition site DNA affinity zzso The method was employed to obtain a pure preparation of nuclear factor I zzso from zzso liver from which sequences of partial peptides could be zzso zzso zzso derived from these zzso sequences were used to identify zzso and zzso clones of zzso
