We describe here the characterization of five zzso of zzso zzso organisms representing a novel group based on zzso fatty acid analysis and zzso zzso Two of the five zzso in this study, zzso and zzso were previously considered to belong to zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of cellular fatty acids by zzso zzso indicated a close zzso of this group, which was well differentiated from the other zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization was performed by zzso acid sequencing of the small zzso zzso gene and the gene zzso the zzso heat shock protein and zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of the entire zzso zzso gene showed a unique sequence most closely related to those of zzso triplex and zzso zzso The zzso partial gene sequence was identical for the five zzso with zzso identity to the zzso zzso type zzso However, qualitative whole zzso DNA zzso analysis confirmed that this group is genetically distinct from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for this group resemble those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that this group represents a unique zzso species for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso
