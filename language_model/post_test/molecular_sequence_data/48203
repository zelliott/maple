zzso protein zzso and zzso growth zzso factor zzso are zzso growth and zzso factors that interact with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Each one is a zzso protein zzso a zzso alpha chain and a zzso zzso beta zzso Despite structural similarities between MSP and zzso the primary zzso binding site is located on the alpha chain of zzso but on the beta chain of zzso To obtain insight into the structural basis for MSP beta chain zzso beta chain structure was modeled from coordinates of an existing model of the zzso beta zzso The model revealed that the region corresponding to the zzso specificity pocket in zzso is filled by the zzso interacting pair, leaving a shallow cavity for possible beta chain interaction with the zzso zzso in this region were created, and their binding characteristics were zzso A double zzso of zzso caused diminished binding of the beta chain to the MSP zzso and a single zzso of neighboring zzso completely abolished zzso Thus, this region of the zzso is critical for zzso We also found that at zzso zzso of free alpha and beta zzso alpha chain binding to zzso was zzso at levels considerably lower than beta chain zzso The zzso values determined by quantitative zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso for beta and alpha chain, zzso The data suggest that MSP has two independent binding sites with high and low affinities located in beta and alpha chain, respectively, and that the two sites together mediate zzso zzso and subsequent zzso
