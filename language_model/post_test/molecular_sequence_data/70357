The zzso acid sequences of two zzso of the rat zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso have been deduced by cloning and sequencing the zzso These zzso are identical in zzso sequence except that one has a zzso acid zzso at zzso acid position zzso They are highly zzso to the canine cardiac zzso except for the zzso portion and part of the large central zzso domain zzso acid zzso zzso They are zzso and 925 (with the zzso zzso acid long with calculated molecular masses of zzso and zzso (with the zzso respectively, if the zzso zzso acid zzso are eliminated as a zzso signal zzso zzso of the variable region zzso acids zzso of the zzso by means of the reverse zzso chain reaction and DNA sequencing revealed that many zzso of the zzso are expressed in different rat zzso The two clones isolated in this study are the zzso zzso expressed in zzso stomach, liver, and zzso In cardiac and skeletal muscles, another zzso is dominant, which is equivalent to the canine cardiac zzso In brain, a third type is predominantly zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of these zzso and Southern zzso analysis of rat zzso DNA suggested that each zzso is generated through alternative zzso of the primary zzso
