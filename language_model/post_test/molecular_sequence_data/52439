zzso beta is a potent zzso of immune and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso beta is initially zzso as an inactive zzso zzso that is activated by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso to generate the zzso mature zzso beta zzso This zzso is zzso by a specific zzso that has been designated the zzso beta converting zzso (or zzso beta zzso We have used a human zzso beta zzso zzso to isolate zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso These zzso predicted that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Overall, the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso predicted zzso acid sequence identity with the human zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso mice indicated that the zzso zzso beta zzso is zzso by a single copy gene located on zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed broad zzso zzso being detected in zzso zzso and T zzso cell lines as well as in zzso heart, brain, and adrenal zzso The expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso by treatment with zzso or zzso These studies establish that the zzso beta zzso is an zzso zzso widely expressed zzso that can be regulated at a zzso zzso
