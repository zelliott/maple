To clearly identify specific species and subspecies of the zzso zzso group using zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso techniques alone is zzso The aim of this study was to use the zzso gene for species discrimination in the zzso zzso group, as well as to develop a zzso primer and single zzso zzso primer based on the zzso gene sequence for species and subspecies zzso 

The average sequence similarity for the zzso gene among type strains was zzso and most members of the zzso zzso group could be clearly zzso The zzso primer was designed according to the zzso gene sequencing, which was employed for zzso chain reaction with the template DNA of zzso zzso A single zzso zzso band was found only in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a target gene was also zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso was evaluated using 31 strains of zzso zzso species and was able to zzso discriminate strains belonging to the subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso relationships of most strains in the zzso zzso group can be resolved using zzso gene sequencing, and a novel method to identify the species and subspecies of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed by zzso zzso chain reaction combined with zzso zzso
