The tumor zzso protein zzso plays a role in cellular responses to zzso events by regulating progress through the cell zzso Several recent studies have shown that zzso zzso expression of the members of the zzso zzso family, which are zzso in several zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso zzso activity was induced in three avian cell lines by a sequence mapping 600 base pairs zzso upstream of the cluster of zzso We found zzso start sites for the zzso transcript at the 3' end of this zzso zzso The promoter has no consensus core promoter element, but is organized into a variable number of tandem repeats of zzso harboring zzso elements zzso The minimal functional construct consists of two tandem zzso zzso to change the sequence of the zzso zzso abolished zzso activity, whereas zzso induction enhanced mature zzso zzso The identification of a viral zzso promoter regulated by zzso is biologically zzso because all zzso zzso strains described to date lack the corresponding regulatory zzso whereas all zzso very zzso and zzso strains possess at least two tandem repeats harboring the zzso zzso
