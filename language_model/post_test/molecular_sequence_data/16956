zzso zzso 4 zzso also named zzso or zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso with important roles in a variety of cellular processes such as zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso To further investigate the cellular functions of zzso we isolated and identified zzso proteins using a zzso zzso We found that insulin zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso with zzso and that this interaction was enhanced following zzso zzso We also found that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso decreased the zzso of zzso from 4 to 1 zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso a zzso degradation of zzso as indicated by the zzso of the degradation by a potent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our studies indicate that zzso is subject to regulation by zzso and that zzso mediates zzso degradation of zzso
