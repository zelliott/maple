Using the process of zzso zzso we engineered two zzso molecules carrying in the third zzso region of the heavy chain variable domain a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso of the first zzso domain zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso positions 42 through 49) and zzso zzso positions 41 through zzso These zzso acid sequences are contained in the consensus binding site for the human zzso virus zzso on zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso and were recognized by a zzso zzso zzso to zzso whose binding site is within zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were then used as zzso in rabbits and mice to elicit a zzso response against zzso Only the zzso carrying the sequence zzso induced a response against zzso The induced zzso showed specificity for the zzso acid sequence of zzso engineered in the zzso zzso were able to inhibit the formation of zzso between human zzso T cells zzso and zzso zzso cells that are zzso infected with zzso and stained human zzso zzso T zzso Four zzso zzso zzso were used to analyze the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso binding at the single zzso level, and indicated that recognition of native zzso is not an absolute requirement for zzso of zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso can be used as zzso to elicit zzso and biologically active immunity to zzso The importance of this approach as a general way to induce zzso immunity and as a possible new measure to zzso in zzso infection is zzso
