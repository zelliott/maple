zzso zzso zzso particularly within complex I of the electron transport system, has been implicated in the zzso of Parkinson disease zzso More than half of zzso zzso zzso form part of the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex I zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso variation contributes to zzso zzso we zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso that define the European zzso zzso in zzso white patients with zzso and 340 unaffected white control zzso Overall, individuals classified as zzso J zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso or K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a significant decrease in risk of zzso versus individuals carrying the most common zzso zzso Furthermore, a specific zzso that defines these two zzso zzso is strongly associated with this protective effect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a zzso zzso acid change from zzso to zzso within the zzso zzso 3 zzso of complex zzso After zzso by sex, this decrease in risk appeared stronger in women than in men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated a protective effect for women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an important factor in zzso zzso among white individuals and could help explain the role of complex I in zzso zzso
