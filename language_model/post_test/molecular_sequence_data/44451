zzso acid zzso bacteria were isolated from pristine environments which had no history of zzso zzso By using zzso dye indicator medium or zzso zzso zzso six strains were isolated from eight enrichment cultures capable of degrading zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso DNA zzso sequencing and zzso properties revealed that one isolate from Hawaiian volcanic soil could be classified in the zzso zzso (a member of the beta subdivision of the class zzso and that the other five zzso from Hawaiian volcanic soils, Saskatchewan forest soil, and Chilean forest soil have zzso zzso with high degrees of similarity to those of the zzso group (a member of the alpha subdivision of the class zzso All the zzso grow slowly on either zzso media zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso broth zzso zzso or zzso zzso with mean generation times of 16 to 30 zzso which are significantly slower than previously known zzso zzso zzso media such as zzso zzso and LB medium did not allow their zzso zzso amplification using internal consensus sequences of zzso (a gene zzso an zzso for the first step of zzso zzso found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and some other zzso zzso as zzso and Southern zzso with zzso as a probe revealed that the isolate belonging to the zzso zzso carried the zzso zzso This gene was zzso to zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The other five zzso did not appear to carry zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity could not be detected in cell zzso These results indicate that zzso bacteria in pristine environments are zzso bacteria and that most of their zzso and zzso genes differ from those of zzso zzso typically isolated from agricultural zzso or contaminated zzso
