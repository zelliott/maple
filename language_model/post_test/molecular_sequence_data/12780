zzso The authors describe here the effects of intravenous administration of zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso on conscious zzso of the species zzso zzso which spontaneously present zzso induced zzso zzso zzso Animals zzso zzso 2) were chronically implanted with zzso recording zzso and tested whilst seated in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recorded during a control period of at least 30 minutes before the injection of zzso zzso (1 to zzso zzso zzso and immediately zzso zzso zzso up to the dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not modify zzso background in term of zzso activity in comparison with that observed during the control zzso It did not cause any manifest focal or generalized seizure zzso nor did it consistently enhance or reduce zzso induced zzso zzso zzso From the dose of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso slowed zzso zzso This effect, which lasted for about 30 minutes zzso was most often seen at the higher zzso zzso In another set of experiments, one zzso received the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso at 1 and 3 zzso zzso zzso at 3 and to a lesser degree at 1 zzso zzso induced zzso bursts of slow wave zzso activity and a slowing of the zzso These effects lasted about 1 hour zzso zzso During this period, we observed spontaneous zzso as if the animal were zzso as well as zzso
