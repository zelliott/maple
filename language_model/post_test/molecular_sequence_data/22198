The zzso zzso zzso is required for normal cell fate choice and patterning in zzso To understand how these zzso processes are regulated will require knowledge of how cells receive and respond to the zzso zzso Previously, we have described a zzso zzso factor, zzso which is required for cells to respond to zzso However, it was unknown whether zzso activity is required to activate the zzso response zzso in certain cells or is a component of the response zzso zzso In this study, we describe the identification of a zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso Rapid changes in the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in response to zzso suggest that they are directly downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions between zzso and zzso provides evidence that their ability to regulate diverse targets in response to zzso is partly due to their ability to form zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are therefore direct regulators of cellular responses to zzso
