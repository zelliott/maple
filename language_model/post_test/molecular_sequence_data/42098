Over 30 zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso Most are classified as zzso zzso or zzso zzso similarities among most of the zzso and all the zzso so far zzso from zzso zzso and other zzso justify recognition of a zzso zzso zzso This family shows minimal sequence similarities with other zzso but zzso data for a few zzso zzso show that the family shares a distinctive overall structure with some other zzso and zzso zzso so they are all put in one zzso zzso zzso Fifteen zzso genes have been mapped in zzso zzso and twelve are clustered at two zzso zzso The constitution of each cluster varies across zzso species but two zzso zzso in one cluster are sufficiently zzso that their zzso can be identified among zzso zzso zzso resistance in other zzso zzso differences between two other zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been interpreted against the consensus zzso structure for the zzso zzso family; their sequence differences are widely dispersed across the structure and include substantial divergence in zzso binding sites and the active site zzso This also applies when zzso is compared across species where differences in its expression indicate a difference in zzso However, comparisons within and among species where zzso expression is zzso show that many aspects of the predicted zzso structure are tightly zzso Two notable exceptions are a pair of zzso in the zzso binding site of the zzso in zzso zzso These zzso are associated with differences in zzso interactions in zzso and demographic data indicate that the alternative forms are not selectively equivalent in zzso
