Here we describe zzso of zzso zzso a new member of the zzso mobile element family that is novel and contains two genes whose functions are unknown, zzso and zzso in addition to zzso of two other zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso element zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso in other species are also often zzso as genes that zzso zzso The complete zzso element was found in 10 to zzso of strains obtained from Africa, India, Europe, and the Americas but in only zzso of East Asian zzso zzso comparison of 10 representative zzso elements revealed higher levels of DNA sequence matches zzso than those seen in normal zzso genes zzso to zzso or in other IS elements (95 to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso from the same zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso can insert at many zzso sites with its left end zzso next to zzso with no target specificity for its right end, and without zzso or deleting target zzso A deleted form of zzso containing just zzso and zzso and 37 zzso of zzso found in reference strain zzso was at the same zzso site in 15 to zzso of the strains from many geographic regions but again in only zzso of the East Asian zzso The abundance and sequence zzso of zzso and of this zzso remnant suggested a recent bottleneck and then rapid spread in zzso zzso zzso possibly selected by the contributions of the elements to bacterial zzso
