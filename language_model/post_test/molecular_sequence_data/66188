zzso zzso have been implicated in the control of several cellular functions, including regulation of the zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso in part to zzso and controls zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen and a zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso the light chain of the zzso protein zzso as a novel binding partner for zzso zzso binding and the zzso acid zzso zzso domain of zzso are critical for its binding to zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that this interaction occurs in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression decreased zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression and modified the signaling response to zzso zzso We concluded that zzso is critical for zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is thought to function as an zzso between zzso and other zzso we zzso that the zzso and zzso interactions facilitate zzso zzso trafficking and regulate the trafficking of signaling zzso
