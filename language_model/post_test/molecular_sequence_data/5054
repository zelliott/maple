zzso zzso were isolated from small zzso zzso cells of a single blood group A zzso One very zzso blood group compound was obtained chemically pure upon zzso zzso It was characterized by mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be the type 1 chain blood group A zzso Support for the presence of minute amounts of additional A zzso was obtained by mass zzso and zzso of TLC plates with zzso zzso specific for A type 2 chain, A type 3 and 4 chain, and the zzso zzso Among precursor zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso 1) were zzso identified, whereas no zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso were zzso We addressed the question whether the zzso expression of type 1 chain based A zzso reflects a restricted zzso precursor chain specificity of the alpha 1-2 zzso and/or the alpha 1-3 zzso or if the zzso of the precursor chains themselves is zzso All precursor core zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso could serve as zzso for zzso in zzso when a crude zzso fraction obtained from mechanically released, zzso zzso zzso cells was used as an zzso zzso Under the same conditions an zzso zzso could be transferred to the blood group H structures based on these core zzso zzso zzso but not zzso could serve as an zzso for zzso When the product was zzso with zzso zzso zzso from zzso under conditions where it specifically zzso Gal beta zzso zzso approximately zzso of the zzso was zzso off, indicating that a substantial amount of zzso was made in zzso as opposed to the predominance of zzso structures found in zzso
