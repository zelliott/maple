We have determined the solution structure of an zzso binding domain of protein G, a surface protein of group C and G zzso We find that it folds into a left handed zzso bundle similar to the zzso binding domain of protein zzso from zzso zzso The two zzso share 59% sequence identity, are zzso very stable, and bind to the same site on human serum zzso The zzso binding site, the first determined for this structural motif known as the zzso zzso comprises zzso spanning the first loop to the beginning of the third zzso and includes the most zzso region of zzso zzso The two zzso zzso have different affinities for zzso from different species, and their zzso binding patterns zzso directly to the host specificity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These studies of the evolution, structure, and binding properties of the zzso module emphasize the power of bacterial adaptation and underline ecological and medical problems connected with the use of zzso
