The structure of the gene zzso the bovine type B zzso zzso zzso has been established and compared with those of other zzso zzso The gene is present as a single copy in the bovine zzso as demonstrated by Southern zzso analysis, and spans at least 36 zzso The coding region is divided into 7 zzso separated by 6 zzso one of which is more than 23 zzso in zzso The zzso zzso well to the structural zzso of the zzso the first zzso encodes the first and second zzso zzso and each of the following zzso zzso is zzso by a separate zzso The portion of the zzso protein sequence zzso by zzso 3 is quite different from the corresponding ETA zzso suggesting that this region is responsible for the distinct zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso The second zzso interrupts the zzso zzso zzso which is located at the end of the third zzso domain of the zzso zzso as with the substance zzso substance K, zzso zzso and zzso D3 zzso zzso To map the zzso region of the gene and determine the start of transcription, zzso zzso were cloned and zzso multiple start sites were deduced with no apparent zzso box in the expected upstream zzso Similar results were obtained by zzso protection zzso
