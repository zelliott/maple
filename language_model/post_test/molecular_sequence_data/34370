zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso involved in homocysteine zzso Despite considerable genetic and clinical attention, the reaction mechanism and regulation of this zzso are not fully understood because of difficult production and poor zzso While zzso zzso from zzso organisms are often stable and easy to zzso properties of zzso zzso have not yet been zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso coli zzso has been expressed in zzso coli and zzso The zzso zzso was chiefly obtained as a zzso of zzso and zzso that is, one zzso zzso zzso zzso prosthetic group bound per zzso The crystal structure of the zzso was quite similar to the zzso barrel of zzso coli zzso while that of the zzso was a previously zzso closed zzso In addition, the zzso interface of the zzso in the zzso was different from any of the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso coli zzso Free zzso could be incorporated into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after zzso forming a zzso of zzso zzso of the crystal structures of the zzso and the zzso revealed different zzso zzso indicating a large zzso change upon zzso zzso Most of the zzso properties of the zzso and the zzso were the same, except that the zzso showed zzso activity per zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The different zzso zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso zzso may be related to human zzso properties, such as the zzso regulation by zzso and the enhanced instability of the zzso zzso upon loss of zzso Whereas zzso coli zzso was the only structural model for human zzso to date, our findings suggest that zzso zzso will be another useful model for this important zzso
