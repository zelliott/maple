A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a freshwater shrimp culture pond in Taiwan and was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the closest relatives of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees obtained with zzso zzso gene sequences or the zzso zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso and these three closest relatives formed an independent zzso zzso within the order zzso zzso zzso contained summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso as zzso fatty zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and several zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
