Small zzso zzso sequences have been determined for representative strains of six species of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relationships among these sequences and those of other zzso show that all members of the family zzso belong to the so-called purple bacterial zzso The three representatives of the zzso zzso form a tight zzso cluster within the alpha subdivision of the purple zzso zzso zzso also belongs to the alpha subdivision and shows a distant yet specific relationship to the zzso zzso However, the family as a whole is not zzso in that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of the gamma zzso The former appears to show a specific, but rather distant, relationship to the zzso zzso
