The Chinese zzso torrent zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso zzso demonstrated to both produce and perceive zzso zzso Due to habitat degradation caused by human activity, zzso the species is at the edge of zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the species harbors at least four expressed major zzso complex zzso class II B zzso Four distinct zzso 2 sequences and three zzso 1 sequences were isolated from zzso zzso Additionally, eight zzso were recovered from three zzso samples, of which five could be assigned to three individual zzso while the locus identity of the remaining three zzso could not be zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed for zzso zzso and zzso Of these zzso zzso was zzso in zzso population zzso and zzso displayed low zzso zzso with only three similar sequences obtained from partial zzso In contrast, zzso showed high zzso diversity with 20 unique zzso recovered from the zzso No zzso or zzso zzso was zzso However, 10 positive selected zzso acid zzso and an excess of zzso zzso were detected in the putative zzso binding sites zzso these results combined with zzso evolution suggested some form of balancing selection that maintained higher zzso zzso for the zzso Our findings demonstrate that despite the effects of a severely shrinking population, zzso zzso exhibits high zzso compared to other zzso both in terms of the zzso number and diversity across the zzso class II B zzso
