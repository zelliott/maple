We examined the presence and zzso of human zzso zzso in 20 zzso samples (from 12 zzso of juvenile zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso had been stored for months to 12 zzso Due to the great genetic zzso of zzso we selected a conservative sequence of the viral zzso zzso zzso to identify the vast majority of the zzso Positive results were obtained by zzso zzso amplification with the zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso in only 10 of the zzso After a zzso amplification zzso with zzso zzso the 20 samples proved to be positive demonstrating the higher sensitivity of this zzso In order to amplify a highly variable region of the zzso zzso specific zzso for zzso types 6 and 11 zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients were positive for this zzso Since more that one zzso has been reported in the same sample, the presence of zzso zzso sequences does not exclude that other zzso might be zzso The results of this study show that: 1) zzso is present in zzso 2) The most frequent zzso zzso involved was from the zzso zzso 3) zzso can be successfully used in zzso tissue routinely processed in a laboratory of zzso
