We previously demonstrated that the major zzso zzso zzso in the chicken liver zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davis, zzso & zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of the liver membrane zzso are similar to those of the chicken zzso zzso that we have previously zzso and zzso Using zzso developed against the latter, we have zzso the chicken liver zzso to zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso with a molecular mass of 85 zzso and a specific activity of approximately 1000 zzso zzso Although slightly larger than the zzso zzso zzso the two zzso are nearly identical with respect to their zzso properties and mass of the zzso zzso The primary sequence of the liver zzso deduced from its zzso obtained by zzso cloning also shows only minor differences from that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates the distribution of the zzso in the zzso zzso of the chicken zzso zzso cells zzso with the chicken liver zzso zzso express an zzso activity with characteristics similar to the zzso in its native zzso most significant of these is stimulation of the zzso activity by detergents, which zzso other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stimulation of the expressed liver zzso by zzso indicates that this property is intrinsic to the zzso zzso and cannot be attributed to the zzso environment of the native zzso The molecular identification and expression of a liver zzso reported here for the first time, will facilitate future investigations into the differences between structure and function of the different zzso existence of liver zzso zzso in different species, its zzso in zzso conditions, and its zzso zzso
