zzso zzso called zzso was first isolated from zzso zzso embryonic cells as a novel zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso a nuclear protein with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso of zzso zzso displays zzso similarity to the zzso sequence at the zzso acid level and was shown to be zzso in breast zzso cell lines and zzso Alternative zzso at the 3' end of zzso produces two major zzso zzso and zzso which contain distinct zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso Using fusion proteins of zzso or zzso zzso to the zzso DNA binding domain, we show that both zzso when recruited to the zzso minimal promoter, function to repress zzso We demonstrate that this zzso activity is due to interaction and recruitment of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Furthermore, deletion analysis revealed that recruitment of zzso to zzso and zzso occurs through their common zzso zzso The zzso domain was first described in the zzso zzso zzso protein and is present in a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a function for the zzso domain, highlighting its role in the regulation of zzso
