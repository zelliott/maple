zzso express a battery of potent zzso proteins in response to injury and zzso Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that this response is neither zzso nor completely zzso and that different pathways are responsible for inducing the expression of zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of two closely linked zzso genes from zzso zzso We compare their protein coding sequences and find the zzso acid sequences to be more highly zzso than the zzso zzso suggesting that both genes are zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso expression is strongly induced in infected and injured zzso Unlike others, zzso zzso is uniquely sensitive to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and thus may be regulated by a distinct signaling zzso The number and organization of binding sites for zzso and other zzso factors in the promoter regions of both zzso genes are consistent with strong and rapid immune zzso We demonstrate that these promoter regions are sufficient to direct zzso expression in transformed zzso zzso zzso fat body in a zzso zzso zzso We present a comparison of the promoter regions of the two zzso genes to those cloned from other zzso zzso genes to assist a better understanding of how zzso genes are zzso zzso
