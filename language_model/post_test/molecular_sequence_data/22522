An zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be capable of degrading zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso showed that it clustered with zzso zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso strain and on the previously isolated zzso zzso also involved in zzso degradation but zzso with zzso zzso showed that strain zzso did not zzso with the zzso zzso probe, and neither of the two strains zzso with zzso targeted to the zzso site, zzso analyses performed on the two strains evidenced two new zzso the first one at the zzso zzso zzso site, characterizing the known members of the zzso zzso and the other one at the zzso zzso level, characteristic of zzso zzso Two new FISH zzso were designed zzso tested on control bacterial cultures, and employed for in zzso monitoring of zzso zzso
