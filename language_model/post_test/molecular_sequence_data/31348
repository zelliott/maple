zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that specifically binds the potent zzso zzso A zzso The native form of the major bovine zzso zzso has been analyzed by zzso zzso methods, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The 156 zzso zzso in zzso yield 126 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs counted as zzso Following exhaustive zzso exchange, 44 zzso zzso remain zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso regions of the zzso and zzso data sets indicates that the residual zzso in zzso form a coherent zzso domain which yields zzso zzso features suggestive of a zzso Many zzso of the zzso zzso have been classified according to zzso acid zzso In the aromatic region of the zzso the assignment of the ring spin systems is nearly complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3/4 zzso This has successfully lead to the complete assignment of all of their beta zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and many of the backbone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2/3 zzso In other regions of the spectrum, the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been completely zzso The drug-free zzso and zzso zzso form two discrete protein structures that are in slow exchange on the zzso time zzso zzso of the fingerprint regions from the zzso zzso obtained from the two forms of the protein reveals a minimum of 16 zzso which are clearly shifted upon zzso In fact, on the basis of chemical shift changes observed in assigned zzso and zzso zzso only a relatively few of the zzso acid zzso identified to date are zzso by complex zzso These include 3 zzso zzso 12, and zzso and the zzso in the aromatic region and 2 Ala (7 and 8) in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso region, an assigned zzso and Val spin system and a spin system labeled zzso (an zzso or zzso are affected by complex zzso In addition, a new zzso spin system, labeled zzso which shows a close spatial relationship to the zzso zzso is observed in this region of the zzso In zzso the regions of the protein altered by complex formation can be divided into two zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
