Growth hormone zzso gene expression is not restricted to zzso zzso and has recently been demonstrated in a variety of zzso sites in zzso and the domestic zzso The possibility that zzso gene expression occurs in the male zzso system of chickens was therefore zzso since zzso has established roles in male zzso function and zzso zzso is present in the chicken zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be present in the zzso and zzso zzso of adult zzso Although zzso zzso zzso was of low abundance (not zzso by Northern zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the amplified zzso zzso zzso was cloned and had a zzso sequence zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized by in zzso zzso in zzso and primary zzso of the zzso zzso but unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso was not present in secondary zzso zzso or zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the male zzso tract may indicate zzso involvement in zzso expression in these zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso also suggests they are target sites for zzso zzso These results zzso for the first time, expression of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso in which zzso zzso was zzso localized in primary zzso The local expression of the zzso gene in these cells suggests zzso or zzso actions of zzso during zzso
