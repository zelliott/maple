The zzso gene zzso is zzso in many human breast zzso It is an important therapeutic target and its product protein is a key zzso for breast zzso A zzso zzso repeat sequence zzso in the zzso hypersensitive site of the zzso promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of zzso transcription, possibly involving the formation of a zzso In order to investigate this possibility, an affinity zzso approach was used for in zzso protein capture from nuclear extracts from cultured zzso and zzso cancer cells at zzso and control zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso cells were analyzed by zzso Based on these results, Western zzso was then used to interrogate captured proteins from both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso support the formation of a zzso by zzso indicated by circular zzso zzso that selectively captures zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso promoter in the live zzso zzso These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of zzso DNA structures in gene regulation and provide a more complete picture of the regulation of zzso expression in breast zzso The results also provide a blueprint for development of zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence for in zzso and in zzso detection of proteins related to regulation of zzso gene expression and breast zzso
