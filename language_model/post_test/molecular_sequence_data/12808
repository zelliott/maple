zzso zzso multiple activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the respiratory burst response and membrane transport of certain substances zzso zzso We found that several zzso basic antibiotics are highly concentrated by human zzso and that these drugs also inhibit the respiratory burst response (by a mechanism different from that of zzso Since both zzso and antibiotics will be administered to some patients with serious infections, we have evaluated several types of interactions between these drugs and human zzso and have attempted to identify the mechanisms that produce zzso in cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso were avidly concentrated by zzso zzso and two derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the zzso of these antibiotics by zzso both in the resting state and during zzso zzso zzso zzso and the highly concentrated antibiotics each exerted an zzso effect on the zzso respiratory burst response in zzso The combination of both zzso and a zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibited zzso production to a greater extent than either agent zzso This additive effect might be expected, since zzso and the zzso antibiotics influence the respiratory burst zzso zzso at different zzso The ability of zzso to augment the entry of antibiotics into zzso has important therapeutic zzso The consequences of this phenomenon might include improved zzso zzso activity as well as efficient zzso delivery and release at sites of zzso
