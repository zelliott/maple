zzso disease results from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the functional gene for zzso zzso and its zzso zzso located in close proximity on zzso zzso have been studied zzso the zzso sequence has not been well zzso The recent identification of human zzso zzso immediately downstream of zzso prompted a closer analysis of the sequence of the entire region surrounding the zzso zzso We now report the zzso DNA sequence and organization of a zzso region around zzso including the duplicated region containing zzso and zzso The origin and zzso of the zzso leading to the zzso for zzso and zzso are now clearly zzso We also have identified three new genes within the 32 zzso of sequence upstream to zzso all of which are transcribed in the same direction as zzso Of these three zzso the gene most zzso to zzso is a protein zzso zzso The second zzso zzso has a zzso zzso and shares zzso to a rat zzso carrier membrane protein 37 zzso Finally, zzso a gene of unknown function lies most zzso to zzso The possible contributions of these closely arrayed genes to the more zzso presentations of zzso disease is now under zzso
