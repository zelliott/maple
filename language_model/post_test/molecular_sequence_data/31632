Few drugs are currently licensed to treat influenza A infection, and new therapies are needed, especially for highly zzso zzso Traditional medicinal plants, such as zzso zzso are a potential source of new zzso zzso 

To test 15 zzso zzso isolated from the bulbs of zzso zzso in zzso for zzso activities against influenza virus type A, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso activities of the compounds were tested in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and viral entry zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso of the compounds on zzso and activity of the viral zzso zzso were determined by zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activities, with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These compounds did not affect the function of the outer membrane proteins or the viral entry process and viral zzso zzso As zzso and zzso exhibited stronger zzso activities, they were further zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso complex in the nucleus at an early stage of a zzso and zzso of zzso 

Four zzso zzso were first determined that could exert zzso activities after virus entry into zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso could inhibit zzso export of the zzso complex of virus zzso Thus, these compounds may be developed further as zzso drug zzso
