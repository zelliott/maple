zzso were conducted with water samples from two zzso lakes with differing zzso status in order to examine the effects of zzso amendments zzso as zzso or zzso and zzso as zzso on the zzso structure, and composition of zzso and to test the hypothesis that the community structure of zzso members and that of the other bacteria (without zzso here referred to as zzso the most represented groups within the zzso would be similarly impacted by zzso zzso zzso samples were characterized by high total zzso zzso ratios zzso 39 to zzso suggesting P rather than N was the limiting zzso for microbial zzso zzso with this, P additions zzso zzso growth and affected the community structure of zzso but, surprisingly, not that of zzso N additions did not significantly affect the community structures of zzso and zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The estimated generation time of zzso was 123 zzso These findings could suggest that the generally zzso statement that bacteria (as a zzso are superior to zzso in the ability to obtain zzso under P limitation might actually not hold for zzso zzso might be poor competitors for P that do not respond quickly to the zzso supply, which may help explain why their abundance is low in aquatic zzso The alternative view that zzso could be strong competitors for P zzso it) is also zzso Our findings highlight the need for further studies examining zzso relationships in aquatic zzso
