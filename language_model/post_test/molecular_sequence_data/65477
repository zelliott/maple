zzso is a membrane zzso that zzso O zzso synthesis in zzso zzso by zzso the transfer of zzso zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses at least three predicted structural zzso an zzso region containing four zzso zzso a large central zzso loop, and a zzso domain containing the last zzso zzso and a large zzso zzso In this work, we investigated the contribution of each region to zzso function by constructing a series of zzso zzso proteins and using them to complement O zzso synthesis in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso lacking the zzso loop exhibited altered zzso zzso in O zzso zzso suggesting that this central domain is involved in modulating the zzso distribution of the O zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for zzso of O zzso synthesis in zzso suggesting that the zzso domain carries the zzso zzso zzso However, despite the fact that they zzso the synthesis of O zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso membrane extracts containing zzso derivatives without the zzso domain failed to transfer radioactive Gal from zzso into a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso region of zzso which contains four zzso zzso is essential for the zzso or stability of the protein in the bacterial zzso We propose that the domain structure of zzso enables this protein not only to function in the transfer of zzso to zzso but also to establish critical interactions with additional proteins required for the correct assembly of O zzso in zzso zzso
