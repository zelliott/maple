zzso a major zzso protein of guinea pig zzso has been characterized as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A bovine lens zzso with zzso sequence identity was found to have very different functional zzso While the bovine lens zzso exhibits similar zzso properties, such as molecular weight, zzso profile, and predicted secondary structure, and exhibits strong zzso zzso with the guinea pig and human lens zzso it shows minimal zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, bovine lens zzso but not guinea pig zzso showed a strong binding affinity to zzso DNA zzso that could be zzso with zzso the specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect this characteristic of bovine zzso and the zzso showed no binding affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine lens zzso showed a distinct pattern of zzso charge modification as compared to the guinea pig zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso and computer zzso of the bovine and human forms based on the zzso analyzed zzso coli form, suggest that if loss of a functional zzso accounts for the lowered zzso activity of the bovine zzso zzso 52 of the zzso coli zzso and the equivalent zzso present in all known zzso forms except the zzso is the likely zzso In the bovine form this zzso is replaced by zzso
