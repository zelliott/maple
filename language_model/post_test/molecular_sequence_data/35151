Long terminal repeat zzso zzso are the major class I mobile elements in zzso They play crucial roles in gene expansion, diversification and zzso However, their captured genes are yet to be zzso identified and characterized in most of plants although many zzso have been completely zzso In this study, we have identified zzso and zzso full-length zzso zzso in the rice and zzso zzso zzso High percentages of rice full-length zzso zzso were distributed near zzso region in each of the zzso In contrast, zzso full-length zzso zzso were not enriched in zzso zzso This zzso could be due to the zzso zzso during and after divergence from their common zzso thus might be contributing to species zzso A total of zzso and zzso genes have been captured by these elements in rice and zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso and gene set enrichment analysis zzso showed that no zzso GO term was identified in zzso captured rice zzso For zzso captured zzso zzso GO terms with functions in zzso metabolism and zzso organization were zzso Only zzso of zzso captured rice genes were expressed and expression divergence was estimated as zzso Higher percentage of zzso captured rice genes have evolved into zzso under neutral zzso On the contrary, higher percentage of zzso captured zzso genes were under zzso selection and zzso of them were zzso Thus, higher percentage of zzso captured zzso genes was zzso Small zzso analysis suggested that some of zzso captured genes in rice and zzso might have been involved in negative zzso On the other hand, positive selection has been observed in both rice and zzso zzso captured genes and some of them were still expressed and zzso The data suggest that some of these zzso captured genes might have evolved into new gene zzso
