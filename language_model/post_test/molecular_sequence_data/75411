The accessibility of specific sequences in domain V of zzso coli zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to complementary zzso zzso has been zzso The apparent percentage of zzso engaged in complex formation was determined by incubation of zzso zzso probe with zzso zzso followed by zzso membrane zzso of the reaction zzso and measurement of the bound zzso zzso zzso by liquid zzso counting of the zzso The zzso of zzso were determined by zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso The results of this study indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were available for zzso to zzso zzso Bases zzso which have been zzso to be base paired with zzso were also accessible for zzso
