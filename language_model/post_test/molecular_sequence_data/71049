The zzso zzso regulatory system controls the zzso zzso response in zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso genes which require zzso approximately P for zzso or repression have been zzso The studies reported here were initiated to understand the zzso interaction necessary for zzso promoter zzso The regulatory region of zzso was characterized in detail using zzso zzso zzso I zzso and in zzso zzso zzso These data reveal basic principles of zzso binding relevant to zzso interaction with other zzso zzso zzso Our results show that: zzso a zzso of zzso approximately P is able to bind two consensus repeats in a stable zzso zzso zzso binding is highly cooperative within the core promoter region, which is located from zzso to zzso on the coding strand and contains four zzso zzso zzso specific bases zzso the zzso consensus are essential for zzso zzso but the specific base pairs of the intervening sequences separating the consensus repeats are not important for either zzso binding or promoter zzso zzso the spacing between two consensus repeats within a putative zzso binding site in the core region is important for both zzso binding and promoter zzso zzso the exact spacing between two zzso binding sites within the core region is important for promoter zzso but less so for zzso binding zzso as long as the repeats are on the same face of the zzso and zzso the zzso secondary binding region is important for coordinated zzso binding to the core binding region, making it nearly essential for promoter zzso
