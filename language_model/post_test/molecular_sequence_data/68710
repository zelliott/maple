zzso gel zzso zzso was employed to determine the zzso zzso of 48 DNA fragments that differ by single base pair zzso The approach provides a rapid way for studying how specific base zzso effect the stability of a long DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments differing by single base pair zzso in their first melting domain were zzso zzso were formed by melting and zzso pairs of zzso one of which was zzso on its zzso zzso zzso were separated based on their zzso stability by parallel and perpendicular zzso gel zzso The order of stability was determined for all common base pairs and mismatched bases in four different nearest neighbor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso A, zzso C, or zzso DNA fragments containing a single mismatch were zzso by 1 to 5 degrees C with respect to zzso zzso with complete zzso base zzso Both the bases at the mismatch site and neighboring stacking interactions influence the zzso caused by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were always among the most stable zzso for all nearest neighbor environments zzso zzso zzso were generally more stable than zzso zzso Our results are in very good agreement with data where available from solution studies of short DNA zzso
