zzso zzso an important component of the secondary cell wall, has traditionally been considered to be a hallmark of zzso because zzso and zzso in general lack zzso of this zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was also detected in zzso a zzso that represents an extant lineage of the most zzso of the vascular plants, the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso requires the activity of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Together, these two zzso divert zzso flux from the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso type common to all vascular plants, toward zzso zzso zzso has independently evolved an alternative zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso are directly derived from the precursors of zzso zzso through the action of a dual specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of an zzso from zzso zzso zzso the coding sequence of which is clustered together with zzso at the adjacent zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that can zzso zzso zzso at both the 3- and zzso and function in concert with zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso zzso like zzso evolved independently from its zzso zzso
