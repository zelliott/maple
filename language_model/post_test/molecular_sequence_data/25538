zzso from zzso cells infected with zzso zzso expressing either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or a human structural zzso zzso gene zzso contained an elevated level of a zzso zzso activity that could cleave at pairs of basic zzso acids zzso and zzso The zzso activity zzso shared many properties with zzso including activity at pH zzso and a requirement for zzso By using zzso zzso zzso analysis detected two zzso translation products (90 and 96 zzso while zzso indicated zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso with the mouse zzso growth factor precursor zzso resulted in greatly enhanced conversion of the precursor to mature nerve growth zzso Thus, the sequence zzso shared by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso processing zzso is reflected by significant functional zzso both in zzso and in zzso
