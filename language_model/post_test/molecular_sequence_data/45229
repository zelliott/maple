The role of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso in electron transfer to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was investigated using both in zzso and in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were isolated, zzso and zzso zzso in strain zzso zzso of either gene alone had no apparent effect on the ability of zzso zzso to reduce zzso In a zzso double zzso zzso reduction was largely zzso However, the expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso from a zzso promoter substantially restored zzso zzso activity in the double zzso Using zzso zzso a turnover number of 5 zzso was observed for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso only resulted in a turnover of approximately zzso zzso The turnover experiments indicate that zzso is a major electron donor to zzso zzso but zzso is probably zzso Taken together, these results suggest that there is likely an unidentified electron zzso in addition to zzso that transfers electrons to zzso zzso and that the decreased zzso zzso activity observed in the zzso double zzso probably results from a change in zzso zzso
