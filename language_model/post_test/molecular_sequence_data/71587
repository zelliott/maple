Red blood cell protein zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso In zzso cells, multiple zzso zzso arise from a single gene by alternative zzso and predominantly code for a zzso zzso This zzso contains a 209 zzso acid extension at its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso have been detected within the cell nucleus, nuclear zzso zzso and parts of the zzso apparatus in dividing zzso Using a zzso zzso system, in zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso studies, we show that a zzso zzso zzso specifically interacts with the nuclear zzso apparatus zzso zzso zzso and zzso partially zzso in the zzso nucleus of zzso cells and zzso to the zzso poles early in zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso in the zzso nucleus and forms a complex with zzso pole organizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso during cell zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso alters the normal distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso The minimal sequence sufficient for this interaction has been mapped to the zzso acids zzso by zzso 20 and 21 of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Our results not only suggest that zzso could, zzso play an important role in organizing the nuclear architecture, zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also could define a novel role for its zzso zzso
