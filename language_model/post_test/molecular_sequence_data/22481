zzso shifts associated with functional dynamics in a bacterial community may provide clues for identifying the most valuable members in an zzso A zzso zzso reactor was adapted from use of zzso seeding sludge and was zzso to degrade zzso and remove the chemical oxygen zzso zzso removal efficiencies were achieved after an adaptation period of six zzso Both zzso zzso gel zzso profiling of the zzso zzso gene zzso region and comparison of the zzso zzso gene sequence clone libraries zzso zzso demonstrated that microbial communities in the zzso reactor and seeding sludge were significantly zzso The percentage of the clones affiliated with the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in the zzso reactor and zzso in the seeding zzso zzso quantitative zzso also indicated that species of the zzso zzso and zzso increased in abundance by about one order of magnitude during the period of zzso The greater abundance of zzso and zzso in association with higher efficiency after adaptation suggested that these zzso might play an important role for zzso and chemical oxygen demand removal under zzso zzso
