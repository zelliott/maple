A new zzso zzso (formerly called zzso zzso a regulator with a central zzso domain was found in zzso zzso This gene controls the zzso of zzso and zzso as sole nitrogen zzso Seven zzso previously called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and now referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located downstream from the zzso gene in zzso zzso The products of these genes are similar to zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and four components of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was abolished in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The seven genes appear to be organized as an zzso zzso transcribed from a zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso was induced by the presence of zzso or zzso in the growth medium and depended upon the presence of the zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso 54 zzso zzso of this zzso was abolished in strains containing a zzso zzso in the regulatory gene zzso zzso analysis showed that upstream zzso sequences are involved in the expression of the zzso zzso and are probably the target of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is also zzso controlled by zzso a global regulator of gene expression in response to nutritional zzso
