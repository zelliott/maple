zzso zzso are important zzso factors for the establishment of zzso coli urinary tract zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors of zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso Previous studies have attributed differences in zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso coli to sequence variation in the zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso express the same zzso and affinities for zzso zzso The only exceptions are zzso from zzso strains that carry a zzso zzso in the zzso pocket that zzso all zzso A zzso zzso shows that all zzso are bound by zzso and that the largest zzso is not necessarily the best zzso zzso zzso demonstrate a strong preference towards zzso exposing zzso at their zzso zzso zzso is further enhanced by the zzso to zzso where binding is zzso better than that of zzso zzso a major zzso present in the urine of zzso patients, thus constitutes a zzso zzso zzso zzso in affinities for zzso structures are at least zzso larger than differences in numbers of adherent bacteria between zzso and zzso zzso Our results imply that the zzso expression profile of targeted host zzso and of natural zzso in zzso such as zzso zzso are stronger zzso of zzso than zzso zzso
