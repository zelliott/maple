zzso zzso is often used in attempts to enhance protein stability, but is not always successful as it is possible to remove stabilizing or introduce zzso interactions in the zzso zzso of the zzso WW domain, a zzso zzso zzso structure, removes a favorable zzso interaction between its zzso Nevertheless, zzso of the zzso connecting the zzso and zzso using information based on the previously determined ensemble of zzso structures leads to zzso that are more stable than those derived from the linear zzso zzso that are too short or too long introduce strain, likely zzso native zzso leading to zzso folds that are less stable than that of the linear zzso
