Many species of frogs of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides from their skin zzso These peptides are normally zzso compounds and may have one, or more of the following activities; smooth muscle contraction, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso Two zzso species of the zzso zzso Group that have been studied before, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are different from other species of the zzso zzso in that they produce small peptides that show neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso In this study we have used zzso mass zzso together with zzso sequencing to identify eight skin peptides of the third member of this Group, zzso zzso surprisingly, none of these peptides show activity in our biological screening zzso However, two major peptides zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso at the zzso zzso
