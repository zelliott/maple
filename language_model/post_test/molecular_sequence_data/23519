zzso analysis of sequences from gene families and zzso genes from species of varying divergence can be used to identify zzso zzso regulatory zzso In this study, zzso analysis of zzso sequences was zzso using zzso a zzso zzso gene from zzso and five additional zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences among the zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso were identified with the aid of the software program zzso and by screening for known zzso zzso zzso for 7 of 8 zzso sequence matches within aligned zzso segments of the zzso genes identified many of the zzso previously characterized by zzso analysis in zzso zzso plus several additional putative regulatory zzso zzso in the composition of zzso zzso sequences among zzso genes were related to variation in zzso gene zzso levels in different zzso and to response to zzso treatment using zzso zzso of a zzso element in the promoter of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso was correlated with an approximately zzso reduction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, we conclude that zzso analysis of gene families among rice, zzso and zzso will help identify regulatory sequences in the zzso regions of genes and contribute to our understanding of grass gene regulatory zzso
