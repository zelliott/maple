Walnut zzso suffer from a blight caused by the bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso These bacteria can be infected by viral zzso and this study was carried out to isolate and characterize zzso from walnut zzso located throughout the South Island of New zzso Twenty six zzso zzso zzso were isolated from three hundred and zzso six samples of plant material representing zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were characterized by zzso plaque and particle zzso restriction digest and zzso analysis and stability under various storage zzso From zzso and tail dimensions the zzso were considered to belong to the zzso DNA families zzso and zzso Of the zzso six zzso zzso belonged to zzso and were found both in the zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso were present only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso sizes ranged from zzso to zzso zzso from a zzso III restriction zzso and had in common a 400 zzso zzso that was identical at the DNA zzso Despite the similar restriction patterns, maximum zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso were members of different zzso Finally, we zzso that these zzso might have use in a zzso strategy and therefore storage stability and efficacy was zzso zzso declined more than 50% over a zzso storage zzso zzso temperatures zzso increased while zzso decreased the zzso
