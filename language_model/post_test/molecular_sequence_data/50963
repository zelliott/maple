By comparison with the DNA sequences coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso A, B, C, D and zzso zzso unique to the zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso and used as zzso zzso zzso for the specific detection of type A, D or E zzso zzso zzso The relative molecular weights of the zzso products amplified with these zzso were 210, zzso and 456 zzso zzso Despite the high zzso among these zzso zzso zzso zzso each primer pair allows specific detection with total discrimination from other types of zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso or from zzso zzso would not interfere with the zzso results zzso zzso designed for zzso detection allow the discrimination of zzso strains that when zzso by a zzso method might be classified as zzso zzso Study of the detection sensitivity showed that by using these zzso DNA from zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso could be detected zzso When these zzso zzso were used for the detection of zzso zzso in foods, zzso cells per gram of food could be detected and the naturally zzso zzso in the food sample did not interfere with the zzso
