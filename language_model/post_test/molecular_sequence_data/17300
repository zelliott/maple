zzso gene repression occurs as the result of the interactions between DNA and a number of zzso including zzso binding protein 2 zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso that shows deduced zzso acid identity with zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso gene was mapped to linkage group 8 using the zzso radiation hybrid cell zzso The zzso organizations of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso Relatively high levels of expression of zzso zzso were found in zzso at 1 to 4 h zzso zzso after 24 zzso and in adult brain and zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso was performed on zzso and revealed ubiquitous zzso expression during early zzso zzso At 24 and 48 zzso the highest levels of expression are found in the zzso zzso zzso zone, and the zzso zzso In adult zzso zzso cells were found throughout the zzso zzso that are enriched in zzso zzso include the zzso layer of the zzso the zzso area, the zzso zzso zone, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In the zzso high expression is found in the zzso and zzso type 2 zzso
