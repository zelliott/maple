A highly repetitive satellite DNA sequence from the zzso of zzso zzso with a length of 181 zzso has been cloned in the zzso zzso The sequence zzso to the zzso of all zzso but the Y of zzso zzso and produces a zzso zzso pattern with zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso I with the zzso bands at zzso lengths in multiples of 181 zzso A similar pattern is found when the zzso DNA comes from zzso zzso or, though less clear, from zzso zzso Additional bands appear in the zones of high zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, the 181 zzso sequence is found in fragments with a length of a few zzso zzso The 181 zzso sequence is zzso arranged in the zzso of zzso zzso and has a copy number of about zzso per zzso zzso zzso 10 per cent of the total zzso A sequence comparison among four independently cloned copies of the family from zzso zzso and another zzso sequence from zzso zzso found by chance, shows a one to six per cent variation in zzso zzso However, low divergence zzso one per zzso between two copies of zzso zzso and between the one of zzso zzso and one of zzso zzso was observed, and high divergence (six per zzso between these two zzso This is discussed and explained as the evolutionary consequence of an existing homogenization process by unequal crossing zzso
