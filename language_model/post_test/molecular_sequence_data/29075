zzso zzso zzso zzso are a common zzso interaction motif in proteins involved in the DNA damage response and DNA zzso The zzso response protein zzso has two zzso zzso that bind to the zzso domain of zzso The zzso zzso region is zzso to the zzso region of zzso which is involved in zzso break repair and zzso zzso and which binds zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the structures of a human zzso complex and of the rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure shows that the two zzso repeats are arranged zzso and pack extensively through an interface that also involves the zzso zzso The first zzso repeat and the zzso together bind zzso on a region that zzso with the zzso surface of zzso and involves zzso zzso that are zzso in cancer and are important for DNA zzso zzso with the structure of the zzso region of zzso shows a remarkable conservation of the repeat arrangement and of the zzso repeat zzso Analysis of human zzso zzso zzso and conservation identifies a potential zzso site that we show through zzso is involved in zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso consists of a unique zzso in the first zzso repeat and the zzso zzso and is analogous to the region of zzso that binds zzso
