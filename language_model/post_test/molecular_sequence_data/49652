zzso human zzso virus zzso vaccines have been studied for more than a decade, with some successes in zzso challenge experiments in nonhuman primates but with no clear successes in clinical zzso To gain insight into the breadth of the immunity zzso by such vaccines, we have dissected the zzso cell response of zzso mice to an individual, zzso cloned envelope zzso Here, we report that zzso cells responsive to zzso type 1 zzso envelope are very highly restricted in zzso zzso seven different zzso recovered from five separate mice recognized the same zzso zzso located in the C2 region of zzso Three of these zzso were tested on a natural zzso of the zzso but failed to zzso A more extensive analysis of whole zzso populations from other zzso mice zzso with the zzso envelope zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso response was almost exclusively focused on a single zzso We conclude that zzso vaccines may frequently fail to provoke an immune response sufficiently diverse to recognize zzso sequences among circulating zzso The results encourage the inclusion of more than one envelope in future vaccines to enhance the potential diversity and respective surveillance capacities of responding zzso cell zzso
