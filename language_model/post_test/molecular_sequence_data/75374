Human zzso leukemia virus types I zzso and II zzso are human zzso which normally zzso zzso zzso zzso infection is associated with adult zzso zzso and zzso is associated with an zzso form of zzso zzso To identify potential zzso regulatory elements of these two related human zzso we performed zzso I zzso of both the zzso and zzso long terminal repeats zzso by using extracts prepared from zzso T cells, zzso and zzso transformed T cells, and zzso zzso Five regions of the zzso zzso and three regions of the zzso zzso showed protection by zzso I zzso All three of the zzso repeats previously shown to be important in zzso zzso regulation were protected in the zzso zzso whereas only one of these repeats was protected in the zzso zzso Several regions exhibited altered protection in extracts prepared from zzso cells as compared with zzso cells, but there were minimal differences in the protection patterns between zzso and zzso zzso zzso A number of zzso and zzso zzso fragments which contained regions showing protection in zzso I zzso were able to function as zzso zzso elements in transient zzso gene expression zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso in the pattern of the cellular proteins which bind to the zzso and zzso zzso may in part be responsible for differences in the zzso regulation of these two related zzso
