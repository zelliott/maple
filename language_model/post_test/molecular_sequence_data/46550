The zzso cell line zzso has been derived from primary zzso zzso cells by transformation with human zzso type 2 zzso Each cell contains 2-3 copies of zzso DNA inserted into host DNA at apparently identical zzso The site of the junction between the right zzso of zzso DNA and zzso cell DNA was cloned and zzso The eight zzso right terminal zzso of zzso DNA were zzso The unoccupied cellular DNA sequence in cell line zzso , corresponding to the site of the junction between zzso and zzso cell DNA, was also zzso zzso zzso in the cellular DNA were found to be identical to the cellular DNA sequence in the cloned junction DNA fragment, up to the site of the zzso The unoccupied and the occupied cellular zzso and the adjacent viral DNA exhibited a few short zzso zzso zzso zzso ranging in length from zzso - to zzso were detected by computer analyses at locations more remote from the junction zzso When the right terminal zzso sequence of zzso DNA was matched to randomly selected sequences of 401 zzso from zzso or zzso DNA, similar zzso were zzso It is likely that foreign zzso DNA can be inserted via short sequence zzso at many different sites of cellular zzso
