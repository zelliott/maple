We recently reported molecular cloning of the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso the first zzso protein zzso to be cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Harris, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From a search for proteins related to the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso the 434 zzso acid zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from a rat heart zzso zzso Evidence that the clone codes for zzso zzso zzso includes: zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence is identical to the partial sequence of the zzso determined by direct zzso zzso expression of the zzso in zzso coli resulted in synthesis of a protein that zzso and zzso the zzso zzso complex; zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein is sensitive to zzso by a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein recognized the protein zzso known to zzso to zzso zzso zzso in a highly zzso preparation of the zzso zzso zzso Like the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks motifs usually associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity exists between these zzso protein zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso family, a diverse set of sensing and response systems important in the regulation of bacterial zzso Thus, molecular cloning of these proteins establishes a new zzso family of protein zzso that is related to a zzso family of protein zzso
