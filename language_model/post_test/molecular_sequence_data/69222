The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a previously described open reading frame that lacks a zzso transcript but potentially encodes a zzso with sequence similarities to zzso protein zzso only at its zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso is an essential zzso as demonstrated through gene disruption by particle zzso zzso zzso We also show that an zzso is present and structurally zzso in all of the two or three major zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an unusual zzso gene that contains a large translated intervening zzso
