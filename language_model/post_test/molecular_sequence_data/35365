Aedes zzso is a major zzso of dengue and zzso zzso zzso plays a vital role in guiding zzso behaviors and contributes to their ability to transmit zzso zzso proteins zzso are abundant in insect zzso zzso and involved in the first step of zzso zzso While comprehensive descriptions are available of zzso from Aedes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only a few genes from zzso zzso have been zzso In this study, zzso putative zzso genes were cloned using their zzso in zzso aegypti to query an zzso zzso partial zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso display a remarkable similarity in their overall folding and binding pockets, according to molecular zzso zzso affinity zzso indicated that zzso and zzso had overlapping zzso affinities and are affected in different pH zzso zzso zzso and behavioral tests show that these two genes were involved in zzso zzso An improved understanding of the zzso zzso zzso is expected to contribute to the development of more efficient and zzso zzso control zzso
