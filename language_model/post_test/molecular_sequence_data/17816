The abnormal factor IX gene of a patient with severe zzso B zzso B zzso was selected for zzso All of the coding and their zzso regions and parts of the zzso and zzso regions of the factor IX gene were amplified from the patient's zzso DNA by using the zzso chain reaction zzso By analyzing the zzso sequence of the zzso products we have identified two zzso in the patient's factor IX zzso zzso a zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso site consensus at the zzso zzso B boundary, and a point zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso 8) of factor zzso which changes the zzso for zzso zzso zzso to one for zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 from 45 normal males and 55 normal females had the zzso for zzso We propose that the deletion within the donor zzso consensus is the cause of the disease in this individual, whereas the substitution of zzso by zzso may be a neutral zzso which is, at least, very rare in the normal zzso In a family study the DNA sequence of the patient's mother shows both the G to A transition in zzso 8 and the zzso zzso consensus deletion in zzso B in one zzso
