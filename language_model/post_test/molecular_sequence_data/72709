In contrast to the intact zzso gene (a zzso of the central regulator of zzso stress response in enteric zzso in zzso zzso this gene is inactive in all strains of zzso zzso In both species, zzso is zzso transcribed from zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso To initiate investigations of the regulation of zzso stress in zzso and consequences of the elimination of zzso in zzso zzso in this work we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso acts as a DNA binding protein and analyzed its interactions with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and its binding to the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso was zzso By using a sequential series of overlapping DNA fragments, the minimal zzso binding site was zzso to a zzso DNA segment which included a zzso sequence zzso with the established rules for the zzso family of zzso A consensus sequence for the zzso zzso recognition site zzso was deduced based on its conservation in different zzso A zzso in two potentially critical zzso within this site was observed in zzso zzso in keeping with its reduced affinity for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso protection and zzso fusion zzso Two zzso zzso ends were detected in each zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The binding site for zzso overlapped zzso reminiscent of the zzso zzso controlling expression of zzso in enteric bacteria and characteristic of the zzso zzso in zzso This site was also centered 65 zzso upstream of zzso matching the usual position of zzso recognition sequences in relationship to positively controlled zzso zzso on these features was the less zzso presence of multiple transcripts and their unique arrangement, including a region of zzso at the zzso ends of the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the existence of complex regulatory relationships controlling zzso and zzso expression in zzso
