zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which has a complex life cycle that includes development zzso body zzso The gene for zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated and highly zzso In this report we show that the zzso zzso is exceptionally stable for a zzso zzso exhibiting a chemical half life zzso of 150 zzso at 18 h of zzso The zzso zzso was not stable in zzso growing cells nor was it stable when expressed in zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso of the zzso gene to zzso some of the zzso which mediate the stability of the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso region zzso were found to be crucial for zzso zzso This region of zzso can potentially form an extremely stable zzso structure immediately adjacent to the zzso stop zzso A deletion within this region caused a zzso increase in the zzso rate of the zzso Furthermore, conditions which were associated with reduced zzso translation or zzso that caused premature termination of translation drastically reduced zzso stability even in the presence of the wild type zzso These results suggest that a significant aspect of zzso zzso stability involves a synergistic interaction of the zzso machinery with sequence elements within the zzso
