We have investigated the roles of the zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 2 zzso and type 3 zzso fusion zzso proteins in protein transport and cell fusion zzso By using the zzso zzso transient expression system, a series of F protein zzso tail zzso zzso was studied with respect to zzso and surface expression and the ability to induce cell fusion when zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso tail zzso zzso of zzso were expressed at high levels zzso or on cell surfaces as measured by zzso and cell surface zzso zzso In addition, when zzso with zzso these zzso zzso of zzso were all found to be essentially zzso in the ability to induce cell fusion as measured by a quantitative cell fusion zzso In contrast, surface expression and cell fusion activity were found to be eliminated by a zzso of zzso in which the entire zzso tail was deleted, and the zzso protein appeared to be unable to assemble into a zzso zzso zzso To further investigate whether there is a specific sequence requirement in the zzso tail of zzso a zzso protein consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso tail was zzso This zzso protein was detected on the surface, and it was capable of inducing cell fusion when expressed together with zzso although the zzso activity was reduced compared with that of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that although zzso and zzso viruses belong to the same zzso virus zzso these viruses show marked differences with respect to functional requirements for the zzso tail of the F zzso
