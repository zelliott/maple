Recently, we and others have shown that zzso zzso recycling via zzso zzso channels is required for gastric zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso strongly diminished zzso zzso The present study aims at clarifying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation and pharmacology in zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we identified zzso as the beta zzso of zzso in the zzso membrane compartment of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso channels were activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similar results were obtained in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso from zzso towards the zzso pole of zzso cells, whereas distribution of zzso zzso channels did not change to the same zzso In zzso cells the zzso substance zzso blocked zzso with an zzso of 8 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso channels was weaker with zzso values of 370 and 440 zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso with zzso to form zzso zzso zzso channels of zzso zzso zzso is activated during acid zzso via several pathways but probably not by targeting of the channel to the zzso zzso could serve as a leading compound in the development of zzso zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso
