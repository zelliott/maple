zzso is a zzso zzso factor involved in zzso zzso during which it interacts with the zzso portion of the zzso nut zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso exhibits an zzso fold, and that the protein from zzso coli forms zzso while zzso tuberculosis zzso is a zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso is zzso We have determined five crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso In three crystal forms the protein appeared zzso whereas the two other crystal forms contained zzso which resembled the zzso tuberculosis zzso In solution, zzso zzso zzso could be zzso as zzso but it migrated as a zzso in zzso zzso suggesting a zzso equilibrium with a preference for the zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequences could be detected by zzso analyses and zzso zzso An zzso zzso sequence is a probable zzso binding site of the zzso exhibiting aromatic zzso as potential stacking partners for the zzso zzso zzso located in various structures support the assignment of this zzso binding zzso The proposed zzso binding region is hidden in the zzso interface of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that such zzso have to undergo a considerable zzso change or zzso for engagement with zzso zzso in certain organisms, zzso may be employed to package zzso in an inactive form until recruitment into zzso zzso
