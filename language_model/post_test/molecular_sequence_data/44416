Type III collagen is present in zzso zzso but not in zzso formed during zzso zzso However, cultured chick zzso contain an unusual transcript of the type III collagen gene in which zzso zzso are replaced with a previously zzso zzso zzso this alternative transcript does not zzso type III zzso This observation suggested that, although production of type III collagen zzso is zzso in zzso zzso of the type III collagen gene may continue from an alternative zzso To test this zzso we isolated and characterized both the upstream and internal promoters of this gene and tested their ability to direct zzso in zzso and skin zzso The upstream promoter is active in zzso but inactive in zzso indicating that repression of type III collagen synthesis during zzso is zzso zzso Additionally, sequences in zzso 23, preceding zzso zzso function as a highly active promoter in zzso zzso from this promoter is zzso in zzso Thus zzso control of the type III collagen gene is highly complex, with two promoters separated by at least 20 zzso of DNA that are zzso expressed in different cell types and give rise to zzso with different structures and zzso
