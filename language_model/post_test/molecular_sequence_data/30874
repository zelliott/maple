zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso require at least two signal zzso an zzso or closely related sequence located zzso base pairs zzso upstream of the site of processing, and a zzso or zzso sequence located 3' to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso gene contains two copies of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We have shown that the first zzso and the zzso region are essential for efficient processing, both in zzso and in zzso whereas the second zzso does not appear to play any role in the formation of zzso zzso 3' zzso The failure of a signal containing only the second zzso and the zzso element to signal zzso and zzso suggested that these two elements might be too close together to constitute a functional zzso zzso The experiments described in this report were directed at determining the effects on zzso 3' end formation of zzso in spacing between signal zzso zzso zzso contains 19 zzso between these two zzso zzso were made in which an zzso and the zzso region were separated by various distances ranging from 7 to 43 zzso The quantity and location of 3' ends of the zzso zzso produced by these zzso in zzso cells were measured by zzso zzso protection zzso Signal efficiency was gradually reduced as the separation between the two signal elements was zzso with a separation of 43 zzso the signal functioned at approximately one-eighth the efficiency of the parental zzso Bringing the two signals closer together resulted in decreased signal zzso with a separation of 7 or 9 zzso no zzso zzso zzso within the normal region was zzso zzso the sequences between these two elements without changing the distance had small effects on processing zzso
