We report the use of zzso drug design to create a selective zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso together with a sequence alignment of the zzso zzso of a representative set of zzso and zzso protein zzso we have examined the zzso binding site for potential positions to attach an irreversible zzso This information, combined with zzso modeling of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has led to the identification of zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso which are structurally equivalent to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential target zzso The X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso shows zzso to be involved in a zzso interaction with the zzso of the zzso portion of zzso Using molecular zzso it was predicted that the zzso side chains in zzso and zzso performed an analogous role, and it was zzso that the replacement of the zzso of zzso with a zzso might allow for a zzso bond to zzso Since only zzso and zzso have a zzso at this position, the inhibitor should be zzso This model was subsequently tested zzso by chemical synthesis of zzso and zzso against the full length zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso rate constant of zzso zzso 2000 zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso is fully reversed by 1 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso involves the modification of a zzso zzso at the active site, presumably zzso The rate of zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso suggesting that zzso occurs through initial formation of a zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by the slow formation of a zzso bond with a rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach may have application in the design of selective irreversible zzso against other members of the zzso zzso
