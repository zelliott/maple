During infection of zzso zzso leaves, zzso 3 of the zzso zzso of beet zzso yellow vein virus directs synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso 600 zzso of the zzso 3 zzso zzso active zzso transcripts have been prepared from full-length zzso of zzso 3 cloned behind a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 transcripts carrying deletions in the vicinity of the zzso zzso initiation site were produced by zzso zzso at the zzso level and then tested for their capacity to direct zzso zzso synthesis in infected zzso The zzso domain essential for normal levels of zzso zzso production in zzso (the zzso zzso did not extend in the zzso beyond position zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso The zzso of the core promoter domain was located somewhere between positions zzso and zzso zzso of the promoter domain to an upstream site in zzso 3 produced a new zzso zzso starting at or near the predicted upstream zzso
