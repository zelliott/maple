Human zzso type IV zzso zzso has been expressed in insect cells and zzso into the cell medium via a zzso expression zzso The expression level of the zzso from zzso zzso cells was estimated to be zzso zzso 300 zzso of cell zzso The zzso protein was zzso in a single step using zzso zzso with an overall yield of zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be activated in zzso using zzso zzso to yield an active zzso zzso analysis of the activated zzso zzso demonstrates that this material is comparable to activated zzso from natural human zzso The zzso zzso provides a useful source of protein for a variety of zzso and zzso studies aimed at zzso the structure and function of human zzso
