zzso zzso zzso channels zzso contribute to the normal function of skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso The chick inward zzso zzso channel zzso is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, but not in zzso a distribution similar but not identical to that of mouse zzso We set out to explore regulatory zzso of the zzso promoter that enhance or inhibit expression of the gene in different cell zzso 

We cloned and characterized the zzso region of zzso zzso contains two zzso with zzso sites in the zzso region, a structure similar to mouse and human zzso zzso has multiple zzso initiation sites, a feature also seen in zzso However, while the chicken and mouse promoter regions share many regulatory zzso zzso possesses a zzso promoter and a putative zzso box, which appears to positively regulate gene zzso We report here the identification of several candidate zzso specific zzso regulatory zzso by comparing promoter activities in expressing zzso and zzso zzso cells using in zzso zzso zzso 

While multiple zzso initiation sites and the zzso function of several zzso in zzso zzso expression are similar to those seen in zzso the zzso promoter differs by the presence of a putative zzso zzso In addition, several zzso that regulate the zzso expression zzso in muscle zzso and zzso cells zzso were zzso These results provide fundamental data to analyze zzso zzso zzso The control elements identified here may provide clues to the zzso expression of this zzso zzso
