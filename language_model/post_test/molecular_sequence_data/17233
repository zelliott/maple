zzso predicts that sexual selection can promote the evolution of zzso isolation and zzso Those cases in which sexual selection has led to zzso should be characterized by significant differentiation in male display traits and correlated female preferences in the absence of zzso isolation, accompanied by little genetic or other zzso zzso Previous evidence indicates that a cluster of populations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Venezuela, the zzso zzso differs significantly in female preferences from a nearby zzso population zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2002, zzso Here, we further document sexual isolation between these zzso In addition, these populations exhibit significant divergence in male display traits correlated to differences in zzso mating success, little zzso genetic zzso and we find no evidence for genetic zzso between a zzso population and several geographically isolated zzso These results suggest that divergent sexual selection has contributed to differentiation of the zzso zzso and this may be the first example of zzso zzso in the zzso
