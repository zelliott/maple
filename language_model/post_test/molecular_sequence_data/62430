zzso zzso zzso has previously been identified as a zzso with a series of zzso properties that may be relevant in animal and human nutrition, both for zzso zzso acid degradation and for increasing mineral and zzso acid zzso To study the natural zzso in zzso acid sequence and its impact on the zzso properties of the zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso genes and proteins from six new zzso zzso zzso zzso Five of these zzso displayed zzso zzso 2 zzso acid zzso and had virtually identical stability and zzso properties when compared with the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso from isolate zzso zzso ( zzso zzso the zzso of which was identified as zzso zzso was more divergent zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso had a higher specific activity with zzso acid, and displayed distinct differences in zzso specificity and zzso zzso Finally, comparative experiments confirmed the zzso stability and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso
