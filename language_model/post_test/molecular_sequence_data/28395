The zzso of a truncated human zzso gene product zzso zzso in the zzso form and in the zzso gamma zzso form were compared by two-dimensional nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso As for the zzso zzso zzso three zzso cross zzso were observed in the region of zzso zzso indicating a regular zzso zzso zzso On the zzso exchange from zzso to zzso gamma zzso one of the three zzso cross zzso disappeared and the other two cross zzso were appreciably zzso By analysis of the effects of specific zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to consist of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso around zzso and zzso are of the regular zzso zzso type in the zzso state, and largely distorted in the zzso gamma zzso state, which is probably related to the zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso proteins by zzso exchange from zzso to zzso gamma zzso
