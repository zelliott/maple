To characterize zzso zzso bacteria associated with zzso in farmed Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were collected for zzso conventional transmission and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and DNA extraction during zzso outbreaks in Ireland and Norway in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and compared by zzso and zzso to zzso zzso from Ireland zzso in zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso was used to amplify zzso zzso DNA zzso for molecular zzso zzso zzso inclusions from zzso zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso bodies, examples of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso intermediate bodies, whereas inclusions in zzso zzso had typical zzso zzso stages plus distinctive zzso zzso zzso processing using zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso bodies from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified directly from Irish (1999) and Norwegian zzso zzso samples demonstrated zzso zzso identity, and zzso transcribed from cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso from Norwegian zzso zzso with inclusions in zzso zzso from Irish (1999) and Norwegian zzso zzso A zzso consensus zzso zzso gene sequence representing the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso had the highest percent zzso identity with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships zzso from zzso zzso gene sequences using distance and zzso indicated that the zzso from zzso zzso zzso with members of the order zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso associated with zzso from zzso zzso of Atlantic zzso which exhibits zzso stages different from those identified in zzso zzso
