zzso is zzso by the incorporation of zzso into zzso where the zzso zzso in the open reading frame does not act as a stop signal but is translated into zzso The dual functions of zzso result in zzso or lack of zzso in the zzso zzso of many zzso Available zzso tools fail to correctly predict zzso Thus, we developed a new method to identify zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Based on released zzso information, several programs were edited with zzso language to identify zzso zzso sequence zzso element, the coding potential of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso genes were terminated with zzso zzso zzso of which contained zzso zzso zzso search revealed that 58 genes contained zzso pairs and similar zzso regions around zzso zzso zzso Finally, 7 genes were found to fully meet requirements for zzso although they have not been zzso as zzso in zzso zzso zzso from their basic properties, the newly found zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso are possibly related to in zzso zzso tolerance and protein regulation in order to interfere with zzso zzso capacity of zzso This study may also provide theoretical bases for the prevention of malaria from zzso zzso
