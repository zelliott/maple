The most variable human zzso show extreme zzso instability dominated by complex zzso zzso plus a lower frequency of zzso transfers of repeat zzso In contrast, little is known about zzso instability at such zzso We have therefore used zzso zzso to analyze zzso at zzso zzso zzso in human blood zzso zzso zzso were rare and involved only relatively simple zzso events, with no bias toward expansions, in sharp contrast to the complex zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso and zzso zzso processes were further analyzed in mice transgenic for a zzso insert containing zzso zzso molecules in transgenic zzso and blood were detected but only at the low zzso seen in human blood and arose mainly by simple zzso and deletions as seen for zzso zzso in zzso These data suggest distinct pathways for zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso instability involving zzso repair of zzso zzso breaks and zzso zzso arising by replication zzso or zzso zzso The problem of transferring zzso features of zzso instability from human to mouse suggests, with other recent zzso that long-range zzso zzso may be required for the zzso mode of zzso instability at human zzso
