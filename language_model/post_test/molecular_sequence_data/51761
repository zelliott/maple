The complete zzso acid sequence of a novel zzso zzso release channel from rabbit brain has been deduced by cloning and sequence analysis of the zzso This protein is composed of zzso zzso acids and shares characteristic structural features with the skeletal muscle and cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the brain zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in corpus zzso zzso and zzso whereas the cardiac zzso zzso is more zzso expressed in the zzso The brain zzso zzso gene is transcribed also in smooth zzso
