A major challenge for zzso disease association studies is the high cost of zzso large number of single zzso zzso zzso The correlations between zzso however, make it possible to select a zzso set of zzso zzso known as zzso zzso able to capture most variation in a zzso zzso research interest has recently focused on the development of methods for finding such zzso In this paper, we present an efficient method for finding tagging zzso The method does not involve zzso search for zzso zzso but zzso redundant zzso using a feature selection zzso In contrast to most existing methods, the method presented here does not limit itself to using only correlations between zzso in local zzso By using correlations that occur across different zzso regions, the method can reduce the number of globally redundant zzso Experimental results show that the number of tagging zzso selected by our method is smaller than by using zzso zzso
