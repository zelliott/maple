zzso zzso catalyze the formation of zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in many aspects of cellular regulation, including the fundamental biological processes of cell growth and zzso A diverse range of cell zzso induce zzso of human zzso zzso 1 zzso and, commonly, its zzso to the plasma zzso Although the zzso of zzso in response to at least some zzso occurs directly via its zzso at zzso by zzso many aspects governing the regulation of this zzso and subsequent zzso remain zzso Here, in an attempt to understand some of these zzso we have examined the known interaction of zzso with zzso zzso By using a combination of limited zzso zzso interaction analysis, and zzso zzso we have identified that the zzso site of zzso resides in the region spanned by zzso zzso Specifically, zzso and zzso are critically involved in the interaction because a version of zzso incorporating zzso of both zzso zzso Ala and zzso zzso zzso failed to bind zzso We have also shown for the first time that human zzso zzso 2 zzso binds zzso and does so via a zzso binding region that is zzso with zzso because comparable zzso in zzso also zzso zzso binding to this zzso By using the zzso version of zzso we have begun to zzso the role of zzso in zzso regulation by demonstrating that disruption of the zzso site zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso while having no effect on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
