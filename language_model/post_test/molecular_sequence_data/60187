zzso zzso is a highly selective zzso in zzso coli, which consists of two types of zzso the regulatory zzso with zzso activity, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In order to examine the possible association of plant zzso zzso with the degradation of protein in zzso zzso we isolated a zzso clone for zzso which is a plant zzso of zzso from zzso zzso in addition to zzso which we had isolated earlier zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also isolated a clone for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones for putative nuclear zzso genes zzso We analyzed the expression of these zzso genes in zzso leaves after various dark periods and during natural zzso The expression of zzso was increased by zzso and by natural zzso as reported earlier zzso et zzso (1997) Plant zzso zzso zzso while that of zzso was zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed high expression in naturally zzso leaves, but the expression of zzso and the other zzso was not zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein and in zzso import analysis demonstrated that both zzso regulatory zzso as well as zzso were localized in the zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso is composed of very complicated combinations of zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso have a role in the concerted degradation of protein in zzso zzso
