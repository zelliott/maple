We characterized chicken zzso and human zzso zzso by zzso studies and zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso of zzso zzso resistant to zzso K zzso heat stable, and contained zzso In mature chicken zzso and human zzso zzso was localized at the marginal band, a zzso peripheral zzso zzso and displayed properties of bona fide zzso proteins such as zzso Red blood cell zzso association with the marginal band was confirmed by zzso zzso of zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso with coalescing zzso during marginal band zzso In addition, zzso was found in the zzso of mature zzso but was not zzso in those of bone zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has a function in marginal band formation and possibly in protection of the marginal band from damaging effects of zzso oxygen species by zzso iron in the mature zzso Moreover, our data suggest that zzso and zzso a previously identified zzso zzso zzso are zzso Nuclear zzso might contribute to zzso zzso or, zzso constitute a zzso zzso
