This paper reports the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso donor of zzso zzso By analysis of bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones positive for zzso with an zzso zzso probe, seven unique zzso zzso genes were zzso These genes were zzso including their untranslated 3' and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the genes revealed four putative active genes and three zzso All these genes had a very high level of similarity to zzso zzso characterized in zzso zzso The predicted molecular weights of the mature proteins were between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the predicted zzso points of the proteins were between zzso and zzso All the deduced proteins were of the zzso zzso The organization of the seven zzso zzso genes appears to be zzso over at least several hundred zzso base pairs, as indicated by the presence of only one gene or zzso per zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA of zzso zzso and the zzso clones containing the seven zzso zzso genes indicated that the zzso clones contained all zzso zzso bands present in the zzso zzso gel zzso of an zzso zzso extract from zzso zzso was conducted and showed the presence of at least 11 distinct zzso Further analysis indicated that some of the observed proteins were modified zzso These results suggest that the actual number of typical zzso zzso may in fact be much lower than previously thought, with a number of modified zzso also being present in the zzso zzso
