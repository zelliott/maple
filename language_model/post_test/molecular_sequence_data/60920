zzso zzso modify bacterial zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso The motif that is recognized by zzso zzso is contained within zzso 73 of zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso region around zzso An zzso transcript of 72 zzso that displays this motif functions as an efficient zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were formed by doping zzso positions that extend over and beyond the putative zzso recognition motif within the zzso zzso The zzso were passed through a series of rounds of zzso with zzso After each round, zzso were selected that had partially or completely lost their ability to be zzso After several rounds of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso contained zzso at single sites, and these are confined to 12 zzso zzso These zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso presumably comprise the zzso recognition motif for zzso zzso The structure formed by these zzso is highly zzso throughout bacterial zzso and is proposed to constitute the motif that is recognized by all the zzso zzso
