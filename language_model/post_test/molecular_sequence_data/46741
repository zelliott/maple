The zzso protein complex consisting of zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso is assembled on the zzso region of 23 S zzso termed the zzso zzso We replaced the zzso complex in zzso coli 50 S zzso with the rat counterpart P protein complex consisting of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso complex was removed from the zzso with 50% ethanol, 10 zzso zzso zzso M zzso at 30 degrees C, and the rat P complex bound to the core zzso zzso of the P complex to the core was prevented by addition of zzso zzso covering the zzso domain of zzso coli 23 S zzso to which rat P complex bound zzso suggesting a direct role of the zzso domain in this zzso The zzso hybrid zzso showed zzso zzso zzso factor zzso but not zzso zzso zzso activity comparable with rat 80 S zzso The zzso activity was dependent upon the P complex binding and was inhibited by the zzso zzso a zzso for a portion of the zzso domain of zzso zzso This hybrid system clearly shows significance of binding of the P complex to the zzso zzso domain for interaction of zzso with the zzso The results also suggest that zzso coli 23 S zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso activity in the hybrid zzso
