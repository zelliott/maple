We have previously examined 29 cervical cell zzso for human zzso type 16 zzso sequence variations in the zzso zzso and zzso coding regions, and the long control region zzso Twenty-five of these zzso as well as 23 additional zzso are characterized here as we present the complete zzso coding segment and the zzso hinge zzso Eight zzso acid variations were observed in the zzso coding segment, 13 were identified in the zzso hinge region and 5 were observed in the overlapping zzso coding zzso These zzso acid variations may be relevant to differences in biological functions and may result in altered zzso or zzso immune responses to zzso zzso The characterization of sequence variation within high-risk zzso types might be important in the search for zzso zzso of cervical cancer zzso This work zzso and extends zzso zzso sequence information from specific zzso previously reported by our zzso
