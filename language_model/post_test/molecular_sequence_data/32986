A zzso zzso activity was identified in a zzso zzso protein production zzso This report describes the strategy applied to characterize and isolate the zzso responsible for this degradation by combining cell culture investigation and dedicated zzso zzso After isolation and sequencing of the clipped zzso generated in zzso material, zzso activity was traced in different culture conditions, allowing identification of viable zzso cells as the source of zzso zzso and pH screenings showed that the zzso belongs to an zzso zzso family and is preferably active at zzso zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso on a zzso A column and characterized as a protein related to zzso zzso An additional zzso inhibited by zzso was identified with an optimum activity at neutral zzso This study is an example of how quality and stability of therapeutic zzso molecules are strongly influenced by cell culture zzso
