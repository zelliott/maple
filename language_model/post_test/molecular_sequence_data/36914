To zzso the regulatory mechanism for zzso gene expression in zzso we zzso a mouse zzso zzso zzso into the zzso eggs of zzso zzso zzso As a result, we obtained six pigmented founder mice that exhibited zzso coat color variations as well as the zzso zzso These founder mice were subsequently crossed with zzso zzso mice to establish the transgenic zzso As a consequence, two primary lines and five zzso have been obtained from four of the six founder zzso We found that not only zzso pigmented zzso but also patterned zzso were inherited by their zzso The possible underlying mechanism of the patterned zzso is zzso
