In the presence of zzso and zzso aromatic zzso the zzso gene is regulated through induction after zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to nuclear zzso and binding of the zzso to zzso element zzso zzso an event that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We recently established a human zzso cell line zzso integrated with the human zzso promoter and zzso zzso sequences fused to the zzso zzso zzso This cell line, zzso was used to determine whether the induction of zzso by zzso a gastric zzso pump zzso is zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with either 50 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso for zzso zzso resulted in zzso activity at 24 zzso for both zzso A zzso curve for zzso induction at 24 zzso was determined and the zzso for zzso induction of the human zzso gene was estimated to be 100 zzso The induction of the zzso gene by zzso zzso to increases in zzso zzso To examine whether zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso with nuclear zzso of the zzso binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso was zzso When gel mobility shift zzso were performed using nuclear extracts isolated from zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso specific binding of the zzso to the zzso was zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and that induction of the human zzso gene by zzso is zzso zzso
