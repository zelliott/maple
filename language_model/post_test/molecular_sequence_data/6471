zzso cell death zzso is a normally occurring process used to eliminate unnecessary or potentially harmful cells in zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrate that the molecular control of this process is zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso which encodes a novel 113 zzso acid zzso was originally identified in a zzso zzso cell line zzso that zzso zzso at restrictive zzso We have identified a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso whose predicted product is zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso A search of the sequence databases indicated that zzso proteins are also expressed in two plant zzso zzso of either human zzso or zzso under control of a zzso zzso promoter resulted in a reduction in the number of programmed cell death corpses visible in zzso zzso Extra surviving cells were present in these animals, indicating that both the human and zzso zzso genes can suppress zzso programmed cell zzso zzso was found to rescue zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso death as efficiently as the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso which is necessary for cell survival in a zzso cell line, is sufficient to suppress some programmed cell death in zzso
