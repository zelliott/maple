A zzso clone zzso the mouse zzso gene has been isolated and characterized by DNA sequence zzso The gene is approximately zzso 9 zzso in length and contains eight zzso the zzso sixth and eighth of which zzso the three zzso zzso The gene has been located on zzso 9 in the order zzso by genetic zzso zzso of zzso is universal in all zzso of the zzso but is slightly elevated in liver, skeletal muscle and kidney zzso while being depressed in zzso In cultured mouse zzso zzso cells or human zzso cells, zzso zzso levels are low under normal conditions, but can be induced zzso higher in both lines by treatment with the zzso acid analog zzso A similar induction is seen in cells treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that elevated zzso expression may be coupled to protein zzso Surprisingly, expression of the human zzso gene is also regulated by zzso position being zzso higher in late zzso cells as opposed to the levels in early zzso zzso
