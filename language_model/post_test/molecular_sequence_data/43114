We have genetically characterized a zzso zzso protein zzso of the coronavirus mouse zzso virus zzso This zzso designated zzso is both zzso and zzso and its N protein is smaller than zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso N gene revealed that it contains an internal deletion of 87 zzso producing an zzso deletion of 29 zzso zzso All of these properties of zzso made it ideal for use as a recipient in a targeted zzso zzso experiment in which the deletion in zzso was repaired by zzso with synthetic zzso the smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso were selected for zzso zzso zzso analysis of candidate zzso showed that they had regained the material that is deleted in the zzso zzso They also had acquired a five zzso zzso in the 3' untranslated region, which had been incorporated into the synthetic zzso as a molecular zzso The presence of the tag was directly verified, as well, by sequencing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This provided a clear genetic proof that the zzso zzso was due to the observed deletion in the N zzso In addition, these results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable, independently replicating progeny from zzso between zzso zzso zzso and a tailored, synthetic zzso zzso To date, we have constructed three additional zzso by this zzso For two of these, a zzso point zzso that reverts the zzso zzso has been zzso into a wild type background, which does not contain the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
