zzso zzso contain, at least, an zzso zzso region, an zzso site, and a zzso zzso Recently, we found that the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso is essential for zzso binding and therefore for zzso In this study, we tried to identify additional components within zzso zzso required for efficient zzso binding by using zzso as a zzso We demonstrate by zzso and zzso studies that an internal hairpin and an immediately upstream zzso sequence also are required for efficient zzso zzso We propose that the functional zzso module of zzso consists of an internal hairpin preceded by a zzso sequence and a zzso zzso with a long zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso alone can act as a functional zzso module when it is preceded by an internal zzso zzso The 3' region of most known zzso share the features corresponding to either a double- or zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that increasing the spacing between the zzso region and the zzso module reduces or zzso the zzso zzso These findings allowed us to design synthetic zzso zzso to target desired zzso
