A shared feature of the zzso stages zzso of malaria zzso is a cortical zzso structure termed zzso network zzso thought to define and maintain cell zzso zzso zzso comprise structural components of the zzso and zzso gene knockout causes zzso abnormalities that coincide with markedly reduced zzso strength of the affected zzso indicating the zzso are prime cell shape zzso Here, we characterize a novel zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso and zzso named zzso zzso at position zzso which is structurally unrelated to zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso transmission and causes zzso zzso and zzso defects similar to those observed in zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso contributes little to zzso strength, arguing against a zzso relationship between zzso strength and cell zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso zzso display an abnormal arrangement of their zzso zzso These results provide important new understanding of the factors that determine zzso zzso as well as the potential roles of the cortical zzso in gliding zzso
