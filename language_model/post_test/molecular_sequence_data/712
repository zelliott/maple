zzso zzso finger genes comprise a large family in the plant kingdom and play important roles in various zzso processes of plant zzso In this study, we identified 29 zzso zzso finger family genes in rice zzso zzso by database zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of three zzso motifs with unknown functions within the predicted zzso zzso analysis found 196 zzso in the zzso upstream regions of these zzso including a zzso element, a zzso element, and a zzso zzso In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis of these genes has been performed using zzso data obtained from 27 zzso or zzso of three rice zzso zzso 63, zzso 97, and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that five zzso zzso finger genes are zzso expressed in zzso zzso or zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso finger genes under zzso stresses suggests that twelve genes are zzso regulated by hormones or stress in rice zzso These results would be useful for zzso their roles in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice zzso
