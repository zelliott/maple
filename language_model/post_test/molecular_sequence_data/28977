zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) zzso the zzso anti elimination of zzso from zzso acid to give zzso zzso This reaction lies on the main zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso requires zzso and zzso zzso zzso for full zzso zzso The zzso has attracted interest because of its potential use as a zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso has been solved to zzso resolution by the zzso anomalous zzso zzso A zzso metal zzso complex of the protein has also been zzso zzso is a zzso with each zzso consisting of two zzso One is an zzso and the other smaller domain is mainly zzso The smaller domain partially zzso the C zzso of the barrel and forms a large zzso The structure identifies zzso as belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso The metal zzso site is located in a large zzso between the zzso Potential active site zzso have been identified based on a combination of their proximity to a metal zzso site, molecular zzso and sequence zzso In common with all members of the zzso zzso the zzso acid of the zzso is zzso by the metal zzso and a zzso adjacent to a zzso acid group of the zzso is zzso by a zzso In zzso it appears that zzso removes the zzso of zzso zzso This motif is the defining zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso of which all have a common zzso The degree of structural conservation is remarkable given only four zzso are absolutely zzso
