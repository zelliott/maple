zzso zzso zzso zzso is a newly cloned zzso gene that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso of zzso can cause zzso type zzso an zzso dominant disease characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso We explored the expression and regulatory mechanism of zzso in the human zzso which is a key regulator of blood zzso zzso of zzso was determined by zzso zzso initiation site and regulatory elements in the promoter region of zzso were systematically analyzed with a combined set of experimental and zzso zzso Using zzso we have determined the zzso initiation zzso We identified a number of putative zzso elements by analysis of the promoter region with the zzso zzso these were subsequently confirmed with an zzso mobility shift zzso As confirmed by a zzso reporter zzso the promoter region of zzso has a high level of zzso zzso Several hormones, in particular zzso can suppress the level of zzso zzso These results have shed light on the regulatory mechanism of zzso expression in zzso as well as the influence of various hormones on expression zzso This should prove useful for studies on the roles of zzso in the zzso of zzso
