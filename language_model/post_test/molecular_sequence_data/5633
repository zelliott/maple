The zzso hormone zzso zzso regulates the expression of target genes upon binding to zzso zzso response zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso recruits zzso proteins that both zzso and integrate the zzso zzso We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the zzso zzso domain as bait in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a zzso sequence that encodes a protein of 920 zzso acids with a size of 120 zzso zzso zzso with known sequences shows zzso to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso domain in the presence of zzso through a zzso acid zzso Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrate that zzso enhances zzso zzso on multiple zzso response elements in the presence of zzso In addition, zzso protein zzso with zzso to enhance this zzso When linked to the zzso zzso domain, zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso a number of important criteria as a nuclear zzso zzso
