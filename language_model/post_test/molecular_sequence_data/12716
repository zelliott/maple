We report isolation of human zzso highly zzso to zzso zzso a gene for one of the zzso initiation factors involved in the binding of zzso to the zzso This zzso which encodes a zzso zzso belongs to a zzso gene family, the zzso gene zzso The human zzso of zzso was expressed in all normal zzso zzso but in variable zzso being highly expressed in skeletal muscle and zzso and less abundantly in liver, zzso and zzso Furthermore, we have localized the human zzso to zzso zzso by fluorescent in zzso zzso
