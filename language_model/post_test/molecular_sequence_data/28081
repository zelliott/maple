The minimal structure in the zzso inhibitor protein of zzso protein zzso required for a low zzso potency of zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso While primary structural zzso for interaction with the protein zzso are distributed throughout the 17 zzso of this zzso we have previously shown that zzso 10 in the zzso portion is a particularly important zzso for high affinity binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reed, zzso and Walsh, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate this requirement further, zzso zzso of zzso in which various natural and zzso zzso acids are zzso for zzso 10 have been zzso and tested for zzso potency against the zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso with the importance of the zzso of zzso an zzso 10 substitution analog exhibited a zzso decrease in zzso zzso whereas the zzso 10 analog lost only zzso in activity as compared to the parent zzso zzso zzso containing the spatial zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso less potent than the parent zzso zzso containing various zzso zzso at position 10 were only zzso less zzso One exception to this was zzso zzso which was nearly zzso with the parent zzso The most potent zzso were those peptides containing highly aromatic zzso at position zzso The zzso 10, zzso zzso 10, zzso 10, and the zzso 10 zzso were zzso less zzso zzso slightly more zzso and zzso more potent than the parent zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso 10 in zzso and presumably in the native protein zzso interacts through specific zzso and/or aromatic binding to a zzso pocket or zzso near the active site of the protein zzso
