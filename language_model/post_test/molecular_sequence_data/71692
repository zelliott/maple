A three-dimensional model of the zzso region of neutral zzso zzso zzso was constructed zzso the results of secondary structure predictions and sequence zzso with the bacterial zzso zzso Additional data were extracted from the structure of two other zzso zzso and zzso The resulting model accounts for the main biological properties of zzso and has been used to describe the environment close to the zinc atom defining the zzso zzso The analysis of several zzso zzso zzso in the model active site, revealed the presence of a large zzso pocket at the zzso zzso zzso This is supported by the nature of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso energies of bound zzso zzso with the relative affinities of the zzso of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso The model could be used to facilitate the design of new zzso zzso as illustrated in the zzso
