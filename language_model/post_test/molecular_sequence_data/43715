The ITS sequences of zzso zzso are the shortest so far identified in any zzso and are among the shortest seen in zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso The ITS sequences were also highly zzso but base composition and secondary structure prediction indicate that divergent sequence zzso are unlikely to be zzso The pattern of variation was unusual in several other zzso zzso two distinct zzso types were detected in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso species known to zzso in zzso with high success rates, and a putative intermediate zzso form was also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained two distinct zzso zzso zzso These data are consistent with a zzso evolutionary history for the zzso zzso
