zzso sequence comparison of the related zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, revealed a zzso approximately zzso zzso backbone structure that is interrupted by zzso zzso Various highly zzso zzso structures and an zzso that could code for a zzso protein were identified within the backbone structure and may be involved in zzso maintenance and zzso Each zzso contains at comparable locations a module which specifies components of different zzso zzso zzso The zzso module of zzso zzso in addition to the genes of the zzso zzso system zzso an zzso which may be involved in repair of zzso zzso generated by zzso of zzso at high zzso
