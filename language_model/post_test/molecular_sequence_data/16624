Most drugs used for prevention and treatment of zzso zzso pneumonia target zzso involved in the zzso of zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso drug resistance has been suggested by the association between failure of prophylaxis with zzso drugs and zzso in zzso However, data on the occurrence of zzso in zzso the target of zzso and zzso are zzso We examined zzso in zzso zzso zzso from 33 patients diagnosed with zzso zzso pneumonia who were receiving prophylaxis with a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso prophylaxis without a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or no prophylaxis zzso zzso zzso Compared to the zzso sequence present in zzso 19 zzso zzso substitution sites were found in 18 patients with 3 synonymous and 16 zzso zzso Of 16 zzso acid changes, 6 were located in positions zzso among distant organisms, and five of these six positions are probably involved in the putative active sites of the zzso Patients with failure of zzso including a zzso zzso were more likely to harbor zzso zzso zzso than those who did not receive such prophylaxis (9 of 15 patients versus 2 of 18; P zzso zzso Analysis of the rate of zzso versus synonymous zzso was consistent with selection of zzso acid zzso in patients with failure of prophylaxis including a zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso populations may evolve under selective pressure from zzso zzso in particular zzso and that zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso drug zzso
