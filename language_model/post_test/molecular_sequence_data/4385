zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso by both normal prostate zzso cells and prostate cancer zzso The major zzso zzso for zzso are the zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso I and zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso map for zzso I and II, a series of small peptides zzso zzso or zzso 7 zzso zzso was zzso and coupled at the zzso zzso to zzso zzso Using these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined for zzso zzso and the zzso were also tested for activity against a panel of zzso zzso Previously, a variety of zzso zzso have been used to zzso the zzso activity of zzso The present studies have identified a zzso sequence with a high degree of specificity for zzso zzso no zzso zzso by zzso and improved zzso and zzso over previously used zzso On the basis of these zzso the best zzso zzso for zzso has the zzso acid sequence zzso Using zzso human prostate cancer zzso and human prostate zzso this zzso zzso was used to document that prostate cancer cells zzso zzso active zzso into the zzso fluid but that once in the blood, zzso is not zzso zzso On the basis of this information, it should be possible to use the zzso zzso as a carrier to target zzso zzso for selective zzso within sites of zzso zzso prostate cancer cells and not within the blood or other zzso normal zzso
