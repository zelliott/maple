Early development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs inside a highly resistant zzso and the developing zzso is bathed in zzso zzso zzso gel analysis of zzso fluid from zzso larvae reveals seven major zzso a zzso zzso one of these, zzso has been zzso zzso and protein expressed in zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibits similarities to the zzso zzso protein zzso family including zzso and fatty zzso proteins zzso zzso is unusual in that it possesses a zzso leader that is not present in the mature zzso the zzso regulation of its zzso and in terms of its predicted zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso with a high affinity for both a fluorescent fatty acid analog zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso reveals a high zzso content zzso which is consistent with secondary structure for the protein predicted from sequence zzso and the structure of zzso zzso features are apparent in a structural model of zzso generated from existing crystal structures of zzso zzso is not found in zzso eggs, begins to be zzso at about day 3 of development, reaches a zzso concentration with the formation of the zzso zzso and remains abundant in the zzso fluid of the second-stage zzso Since zzso is not present in the zzso third-stage zzso or adult zzso zzso it appears to be exclusive to the zzso Surprisingly, however, Northern zzso analysis yields zzso for zzso not only in the early zzso zzso but also the zzso egg, third-stage larvae, and zzso of adult zzso even though the protein is not zzso from any of those zzso zzso may play a role in zzso potentially toxic fatty acids and their zzso products, or it may be involved in the maintenance of the zzso zzso layer of the zzso
