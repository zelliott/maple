The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family is the largest family in plant that functions as zzso zzso and is important for various aspects of plant zzso In the present study, we identified 27 members of this family in rice zzso The zzso tree divided the land plant zzso zzso proteins into 6 distinct zzso Although the main characteristic of this family was established before the origin of seed plants, they also showed some differences between the members of zzso and seed zzso The zzso genes in rice were found to have expanded in zzso manner after the split of zzso and zzso and both zzso zzso events and tandem zzso events contributed to the expansion of this zzso zzso divergence analysis for this family provided statistical evidence for shifted evolutionary rate after gene zzso Further analysis indicated that both point zzso with positive selection and gene conversion events contributed to the evolution of this family in zzso
