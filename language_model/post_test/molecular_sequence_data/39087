zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso involved in DNA replication and zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso zzso termed zzso zzso a protein which shows zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso DNA zzso analysis using different zzso DNA structures indicated that zzso protein possesses both zzso zzso and zzso to 3' zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso and zzso Y structure one base 3' of the zzso point in the duplex zzso The zzso properties indicated that we succeeded in obtaining the gene and the protein of a plant counterpart of zzso zzso transcripts were expressed strongly in zzso zzso such as root tips and young leaves that contain root zzso zzso and marginal zzso zzso No expression was detected in mature leaves although the leaves were exposed to zzso We analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of zzso transcripts by in zzso zzso In the shoot zzso zzso zzso was abundant in the shoot zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso and marginal zzso of young zzso In the roots, the transcript accumulated to high levels in the root zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is expressed in zzso rich in zzso cells, and its expression may be required for cell growth and organ zzso
