Recent studies using highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and rice have demonstrated that zzso a group of zzso zzso act as a new hormone class, or its zzso zzso in zzso shoot zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso rice zzso and may act as a new zzso of the zzso branching zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibits increased shoot zzso with reduced plant height like the previously characterized zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso double zzso is zzso indistinguishable from the zzso and zzso single zzso consistent with the idea that zzso and zzso function in the same zzso However, unlike with zzso the zzso branching zzso could not be rescued by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso contained a higher level of zzso than the wild zzso zzso cloning revealed that zzso encodes a protein of the zzso zzso zzso some members of which play a role in metabolism or signaling of plant zzso We propose that zzso functions downstream of zzso zzso as a component of hormone signaling or as an zzso that zzso in the conversion of zzso to the zzso zzso
