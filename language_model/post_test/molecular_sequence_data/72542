We describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso for zzso the human zzso of the mouse zzso nuclear factor zzso head zzso 4 zzso zzso a member of the zzso head (also called winged zzso gene zzso Members of this gene family contain a zzso DNA binding region of zzso 110 zzso acids and are thought to play an important role in zzso zzso Previous analysis of the mouse and rat zzso zzso revealed a distinct pattern of expression for this zzso suggesting that the gene plays an important role in the differentiation of lung and zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Analysis of the human zzso gene confirmed this pattern of zzso We also found expression in adult human brain cortex, which we were able to confirm for the zzso The expression pattern of zzso confined to zzso cells, leads us to believe that the gene plays an important role in the regulation of zzso structural zzso We show that the human gene for zzso lies on zzso 17 zzso with the zzso location of the mouse gene strongly suggests zzso and that the zzso which is zzso 6 zzso contains a single zzso zzso the fork head DNA binding zzso Such a disruption of a functional unit provides strong evidence for the theory of zzso zzso during gene zzso The expression of the gene is probably controlled by the zzso island, which is located in the promoter region of the zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso gene is highly zzso among a wide variety of species, including zzso
