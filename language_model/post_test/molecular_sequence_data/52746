We have previously characterized a large panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their products arising in zzso of zzso transgenic zzso Here, we show that these zzso zzso represent two clearly distinct zzso In the first class zzso zzso zzso zzso were clustered just upstream of sequences zzso the zzso zzso Type I zzso zzso produced two types of zzso zzso zzso one of which zzso the entire zzso zzso domain zzso and the other of which zzso a soluble zzso zzso which, in contrast to the processed zzso zzso zzso did not reside at the cell surface and became zzso in a zzso zzso A second, novel class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso motif deleted zzso The type II zzso protein was expressed as a normally processed zzso zzso and zzso at the cell surface, and its zzso was found to be shed into the zzso medium in a zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that both type I and type II zzso generate two structurally distinct zzso zzso and zzso proteins that may participate in tumor formation, in collaboration with the zzso zzso through distinct zzso zzso type I zzso and type II zzso expression may enhance zzso zzso zzso while zzso or shed type I zzso and type II zzso proteins may zzso interact in an zzso or zzso fashion with zzso of zzso and affect their zzso
