The zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso T zzso cell zzso To analyze the early genetic response to the zzso signals of zzso a zzso library was constructed from zzso T cells zzso for 4 h with zzso and the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso Of 26 distinct clones isolated by differential zzso one zzso designated zzso exhibited extremely rapid but transient zzso of induction by zzso and zzso by zzso plus zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso gene zzso was induced greater than zzso within 30 to 60 zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, DNA sequence analysis of zzso zzso revealed that this zzso zzso gene is the rat zzso of the mouse zzso factor zzso factor 1 zzso sharing zzso coding sequence similarity with mouse zzso At the protein level, rat zzso shares zzso and zzso zzso with mouse zzso and human zzso respectively, suggesting that this zzso has been functionally zzso throughout zzso Our studies show that the gene for zzso is an zzso gene in zzso T cells, which suggests that zzso is a zzso zzso In addition to its role in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso may, therefore, also play a zzso role in cell zzso The gene for zzso is one of the earliest genes known to be zzso regulated by zzso
