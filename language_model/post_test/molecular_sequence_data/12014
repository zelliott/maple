In this study we have defined the in zzso requirements for zzso regulation of the zzso zzso in response to the zzso and zzso zzso proteins and addressed potential mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso contains a duplicated zzso zzso zzso structure in contrast to the single zzso structure found in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure was more important for in zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso proteins than the zzso zzso zzso zzso though this downstream zzso element itself was able to zzso zzso The role of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences was less critical than the loop sequences for in zzso zzso zzso by zzso In addition, we demonstrated that replacing the zzso zzso element with that of zzso markedly reduced the overall level of zzso zzso The role of the zzso and zzso proteins on the synthesis of zzso and zzso promoter zzso and promoter zzso transcripts was then zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter, the zzso promoter generated abundant levels of short transcripts in zzso zzso zzso likely due to the structure of its duplicated zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso increased the level of transcripts extending to the end of the zzso and zzso zzso elements as well as the level of transcripts extending more than 500 zzso from the zzso initiation zzso However, the synthesis of transcripts within 30 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso initiation site was unchanged in either the presence or absence of zzso while the level of transcripts extending increasing distances from the zzso zzso zzso initiation site were progressively zzso in the presence of zzso Though the zzso zzso protein was a stronger zzso of zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso we did not detect differences in the binding of these proteins to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This suggested that differences in their zzso properties may be due to zzso in their association with zzso zzso II or associated zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
