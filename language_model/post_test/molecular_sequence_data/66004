zzso zzso imbalances contribute significantly to the genetic zzso of human zzso Here, we report a novel zzso hot spot at zzso identified in six unrelated families with predominantly zzso zzso All zzso segregate with the disease, including the large families zzso and zzso The zzso commonly duplicated region contains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be excluded on the basis of its absence of expression in the brain and because it escapes X zzso in zzso For the other zzso expression array and quantitative zzso analysis in patient cell lines compared to controls showed a significant zzso of zzso and zzso as well as several important genes in their molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso have previously been associated with progressive neurological disease and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso regulation of the zzso cell zzso Here, we also report segregating sequence changes of highly zzso zzso in zzso in three zzso zzso these changes are possibly associated with the zzso Our findings demonstrate that an increased gene dosage of zzso zzso or both contribute to the zzso of zzso and suggest that point zzso in zzso are associated with this disease zzso
