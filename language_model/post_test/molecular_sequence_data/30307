The zzso gene of zzso coli encodes a protein that binds the zzso zzso to activate the zzso of three zzso zzso In a study to determine the functional zzso within the zzso zzso we have generated a set of overlapping deletions from the zzso end of the zzso zzso We found that the removal of up to nearly zzso of the coding sequence of this protein still allows zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso up to zzso that of the wild zzso These truncated zzso however, no longer require zzso for zzso The zzso zzso change apparently either releases or zzso an existing functional domain within zzso rather than generating a new zzso that is required for zzso of the promoter of zzso Since the truncated protein of the zzso zzso (which lacks 153 zzso acid zzso from the N zzso retains DNA binding zzso the zzso domain is localized in the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso proteins were unable to repress zzso or zzso in zzso even though they were able to bind all zzso zzso We propose that the zzso half of zzso is essential for the formation of the DNA zzso that are responsible for repression of zzso and for zzso of zzso
