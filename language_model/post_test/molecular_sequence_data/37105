zzso zzso zzso have gained prominence in the recent years because of their potential applications in zzso zzso In particular they have been used as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that selectively and specifically cleave target DNA, and zzso as zzso of gene zzso In this zzso we have made an attempt to highlight the characteristics of these zzso and the effects of various modifications in the zzso backbone as well as in the zzso and zzso zzso which contribute to the stability and efficiency of triplex zzso Studies to explore the mechanism of zzso of zzso of various genes suggest that at least some zzso exert their effect by zzso binding of specific zzso factors to their zzso zzso zzso Recent reports indicate the presence of these potential zzso DNA structures in the zzso of zzso and zzso that may play a major role in target site selection and zzso segregation as well as in the cause of zzso zzso Finally, some potential problems in the development of these zzso as zzso therapeutic agents have also been zzso
