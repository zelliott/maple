zzso evidence indicates that chicken reproduction is strictly regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and the genes included in the zzso axis have been studied zzso However, the question remains as to whether any other genes outside of the zzso system are involved in regulating chicken zzso The present study was aimed to zzso on a zzso level, novel genes associated with chicken zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association study zzso and zzso zzso were used to identify novel genes underlying chicken zzso Single zzso association analysis with a large population and zzso frequency spectrum analysis were used to confirm the effects of candidate zzso Using two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a candidate gene involved in chicken zzso by zzso zzso Its expression levels in the zzso and zzso were significantly higher in brooding chickens than in zzso zzso zzso analysis with a zzso two tail sample showed that zzso zzso were significantly associated with egg number at 300 d of age zzso Among the zzso zzso 2 zzso composed a block overlapping the zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis with another two tail sample of zzso showed that zzso was strongly associated with zzso and age at first egg zzso Single zzso association analysis in zzso female zzso chickens confirmed that variation in this gene was related to zzso and zzso The zzso frequency spectrum of the zzso zzso among 5 different populations supported the above zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso were used to analyze alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso detected 5 transcripts and revealed that the transcript, which has a 141 zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that the zzso gene contributes to chicken zzso zzso
