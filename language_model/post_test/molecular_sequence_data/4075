We describe here the construction of zzso zzso bearing the human zzso gene coupled to the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene is responsible for spinal muscular zzso zzso a frequent human infantile genetic zzso We introduced the zzso zzso into the multiple cloning site of zzso This zzso bears the zzso sequence and the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso It results in the expression of a fusion protein bearing zzso coupled to a zzso zzso tag, used for zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary human zzso with zzso or zzso revealed that zzso is zzso localized within the zzso as well as in the nucleus, while the fusion protein zzso localized within the nucleus in prominent zzso structures termed zzso These data demonstrate that human primary muscle cells can be efficiently zzso and may have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies in zzso
