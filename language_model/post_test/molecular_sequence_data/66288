A new zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from sewage and shown by electron zzso to belong to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains a zzso protein with 50% overall sequence identity to the tail spike zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to their bacterial hosts is normally zzso by long and short tail fibers attached to a zzso tail, whereas zzso do not contain fibers but attach to host cells through zzso tail spikes attached to a very short, zzso zzso The zzso 150 zzso of the zzso protein lack zzso to the zzso tail spike and are probably responsible for binding to the base plate of the zzso zzso zzso tail spike lacking this putative zzso domain was zzso from zzso coli, and zzso zzso of the protein were zzso The structure, determined by molecular replacement and refined at a zzso resolution, is very similar to that of zzso zzso tail zzso Fluorescence zzso with an zzso suggest zzso tail spike to bind its zzso zzso somewhat less tightly than the zzso tail zzso The zzso tail spike is even more resistant to zzso unfolding than the already exceptionally stable zzso from zzso zzso and assembly of both zzso proteins are equally temperature sensitive and equally zzso Despite the close zzso zzso and sequence similarities between both zzso the zzso tail spike lacks both zzso zzso previously proposed to form a transient zzso during zzso tail spike zzso Our data suggest zzso module exchange between zzso and zzso in the course of zzso zzso
