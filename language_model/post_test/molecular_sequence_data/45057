zzso zzso zzso are zinc zzso that cleave zzso proteins to elicit zzso paralysis by zzso the fusion of zzso zzso to the plasma membrane of peripheral zzso There are seven zzso of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso A and zzso E cleave zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike other zinc zzso the zzso recognize extended regions of zzso for zzso The basis for this extended zzso recognition and specificity is zzso zzso zzso and deletion mapping identified zzso zzso of zzso as the optimal zzso domain for zzso whereas the optimal zzso domain for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Two zzso were resolved within each optimal zzso domain, which included a recognition or active site zzso domain that contained the site of zzso and a binding zzso domain, which contributed to zzso zzso Within the AS zzso the zzso zzso and zzso sites of zzso contributed to zzso bond zzso by zzso whereas the zzso and zzso sites of zzso contributed to zzso bond zzso by zzso These studies provide insight into the development of strategies for small zzso zzso of the zzso
