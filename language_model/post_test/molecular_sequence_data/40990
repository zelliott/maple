Exposure of zzso zzso to weak organic acids such as zzso zzso or zzso rapidly zzso the plasma membrane ABC zzso zzso requiring the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso acid stress rapidly triggers zzso zzso but its role for zzso function is not clear zzso Here, we provide new insights into zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso is still zzso in response to zzso stress, indicating that zzso zzso occurs independently of DNA zzso To map and identify zzso zzso zzso from stressed and zzso cells was subjected to zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso we show that weak acid stress causes a dramatic zzso of several already zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring combinations of zzso identified zzso were generated, some of which display altered gel zzso Certain zzso combinations almost completely abolish zzso zzso suggesting alternative zzso Surprisingly, zzso expression levels are similar in these zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso zzso absence of zzso in response to stress leads to a faster stress adaptation, suggesting that zzso might play a role in stabilizing zzso activity on the promoter zzso hence changing the dynamics and zzso of the stress zzso
