During the development of zzso organisms the formation of complex patterns relies on specific zzso signaling zzso For zzso to become zzso organized and cells to become committed to specialized fates it is absolutely crucial for proper development that the underlying signaling systems receive and route information zzso Recently, a wealth of genetic and zzso experimental data has been collected about prevalent evolutionary zzso signaling families, such as the zzso zzso and zzso in flies, zzso and zzso Paradoxically, members of a particular signaling family often have receptors with similar zzso binding properties, though they activate different zzso pathways in zzso and can be zzso zzso How are their specific biological responses then zzso With respect to signaling specificity in zzso zzso zzso is an intriguing zzso in zzso zzso it is required in two distinct signaling zzso that share zzso receptors of similar structure, but have distinct zzso signaling zzso Recent results suggest that zzso is a zzso protein at the crossroads of divergent zzso zzso zzso appears to be a key factor in zzso signaling to zzso signals coming from the plasma membrane and route them into the correct zzso zzso
