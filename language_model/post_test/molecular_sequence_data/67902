The sequences of the zzso domain of the zzso encephalitis zzso virus zzso protein have two zzso acid zzso 16 zzso and 45 zzso in the highly zzso and poorly zzso strains of the virus, zzso Two models of the zzso zzso complex for the highly zzso and poorly zzso strains of the virus were constructed by zzso modeling using the crystal structure of West Nile virus zzso zzso as a zzso zzso molecular dynamic simulations were performed for both models, the zzso of the dynamic simulations were zzso and the averaged distance between the two models was calculated for each zzso zzso differences between two models were revealed in the identified zzso The different zzso of the pocket resulted in different zzso of the zzso segment located near the zzso zzso In the model of the highly zzso zzso virus the identified pocket had a more open zzso compared to the poorly zzso zzso We propose that zzso changes in the active zzso center, caused by two zzso acid zzso can influence zzso functioning and the zzso of the zzso
