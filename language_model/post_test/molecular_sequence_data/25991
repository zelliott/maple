A computer program that can be implemented on zzso compatible zzso has been used to interpret the zzso zzso of a series of zzso zzso The program compares the chemical shifts of zzso in the zzso of unknown zzso with those in a standard library constructed from data in the zzso The program then compiles the identified sequences into possible structures, which, together with a second component of the program from which the individual assignments of chemical shifts can be made, zzso ready access to the literature data for final confirmation of the zzso
