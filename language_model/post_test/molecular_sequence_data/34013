zzso fibers are essential components of zzso which are highly zzso across the animal kingdom and could be extremely useful in tissue zzso The formation of these zzso fibers depends on molecular zzso zzso of the basic building blocks of collagen called zzso Several attempts to produce zzso collagen have been zzso however the best method to achieve the optimal material for tissue engineering has not been zzso Here, we describe a bottom-up approach to design two zzso zzso molecular models that use zzso interactions to zzso triple zzso of zzso molecules and thus promote zzso zzso a graph theory approach in the software FIRST reveals the hotspots that are crucial for the overall rigidity of the zzso zzso structures and the remaining zzso available for zzso The zzso models were further decorated with zzso a known collagen cell binding zzso to depict a zzso zzso In addition to their recognized role of cell zzso the charged zzso of the binding motif appeared to enhance further the zzso zzso zzso These findings could help to produce zzso collagen for biomedical zzso
