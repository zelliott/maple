zzso proliferation is suppressed by zzso D3 zzso the active zzso of vitamin zzso and is associated with a decrease in zzso 2 zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso We report here that zzso repression in zzso cells is zzso zzso suggesting that it is a direct zzso repressive effect on zzso expression by the vitamin D3 zzso zzso We therefore examined vitamin zzso repression of activated zzso expression by zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and by DNA zzso We delineated an element zzso both DNA binding by the zzso in zzso and zzso repression in zzso to a short zzso region encompassing an important positive regulatory element, zzso which is bound by a zzso zzso factor, zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso zzso were unable to either bind to this element in zzso or repress in zzso the zzso zzso domain alone, however, bound the element but also could not repress zzso zzso These results indicate that DNA binding by zzso is necessary but not sufficient to mediate zzso zzso By combining partially zzso proteins in zzso we observed the loss of the bound zzso complex upon inclusion of zzso or zzso X zzso Order of addition and zzso experiments indicate that the zzso X zzso zzso blocks zzso complex formation and then zzso associates with the zzso zzso This direct zzso by a nuclear hormone zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso gene may provide a zzso explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent zzso zzso
