Signaling by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can lead to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to the zzso of zzso and zzso channel zzso At present, very little is known about how these different actions are integrated and eventually turned zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions is crucial for understanding zzso regulation of synaptic zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is subject to feedback zzso zzso by protein zzso C zzso In this study, we provide evidence for a differential regulation by zzso and protein zzso A of two distinct zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso but does not affect zzso signaling via zzso In contrast, protein zzso A zzso zzso signaling of the zzso via zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the selectivity of zzso action on zzso signaling rests on zzso of a zzso zzso located in the G zzso domain of the zzso zzso at zzso selectively zzso zzso interaction without affecting signaling through zzso Together, these data provide insight on the mechanisms by which selective zzso of a specific zzso signaling zzso can be achieved and on how zzso between different second zzso zzso may contribute to fine-tune zzso and long-term zzso zzso
