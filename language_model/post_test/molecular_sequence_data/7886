zzso zzso between zzso in a natural population may result from various evolutionary forces, including random genetic drift due to sampling of zzso during zzso restricted migration between zzso in a subdivided population, or zzso zzso In this report, we present evidence that the majority of significant linkage zzso observed in zzso of the alcohol zzso locus zzso of zzso zzso are due to zzso selection maintaining secondary structure of precursor zzso zzso Based on zzso analysis and a likelihood approach, we propose secondary structure models of zzso zzso for the regions of the adult zzso and zzso 2 where zzso of linkage zzso has been zzso Furthermore, we applied the likelihood ratio test to the zzso predicted secondary structure in zzso zzso In contrast to the other two structures, zzso associated with the more zzso zzso structure of zzso 1 are in low frequency, and linkage zzso have not been zzso These findings are zzso consistent with a model of zzso fitness zzso This model assumes that zzso zzso pairing in a secondary structural element are individually deleterious if they destabilize a functionally important zzso a second zzso zzso however, may zzso the structure and restore zzso
