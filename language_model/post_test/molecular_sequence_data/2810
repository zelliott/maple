The complete zzso sequence of the zzso of an zzso zzso plum pox virus zzso isolate has been determined from five overlapping zzso zzso zzso prepared by primer extension was used to determine the zzso zzso The assembled zzso is zzso zzso in zzso excluding a 3' terminal zzso zzso One large open reading frame starts at zzso positions 36 to 38 and is terminated with an zzso zzso at positions zzso to zzso The putative start zzso is located at positions 147 to zzso The zzso zzso has a predicted Mr of zzso zzso of zzso from tobacco vein zzso virus and tobacco etch virus with those predicted for zzso indicated a similar zzso zzso A highly zzso sequence of 12 zzso was found in the zzso zzso region of these three zzso The potential zzso signal from zzso zzso was found in the 3' zzso region of zzso and several other members of the zzso zzso
