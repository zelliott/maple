The zzso and zzso zzso binding modes at the lower zzso binding zzso zzso zzso of chicken zzso were investigated by utilizing zzso zzso zzso from zzso We constructed the following zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso to zzso deletion of zzso and zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso substitution of zzso to zzso zzso of their activities and zzso binding abilities showed that zzso and zzso are involved in the initial zzso complex and zzso is involved in the transition zzso These results support an earlier proposal that interactions between zzso and zzso at the left side of zzso stabilize a zzso inactive zzso complex, while interactions between zzso and zzso at the right side stabilize the zzso active complex zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso These results are also consistent with the proposed kinetic mechanism for zzso reaction that the zzso of an initial zzso complex zzso to another complex zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Holler, zzso Hess, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1975) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
