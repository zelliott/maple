zzso factors zzso are well known to zzso formation of distinct communal cell types from identical zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso remains zzso We report complimentary in zzso and in zzso experiments identifying one of two approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso as responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins possess six zzso zzso zzso to zzso type I fatty acid zzso zzso but feature an zzso type III zzso zzso zzso in place of the expected zzso zzso zzso used to off load fatty acid zzso This new domain arrangement likely zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso products directly to the zzso type III zzso active sites, which catalyze both zzso zzso extension and zzso The crystal structure of a zzso zzso domain confirms conservation of the zzso type III zzso zzso These findings suggest new zzso strategies for expanding the scope of fatty acid and zzso zzso
