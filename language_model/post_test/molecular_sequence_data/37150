To characterize the zzso C strains of zzso type 1 that circulate in Brazil, especially those originated from the southern part of the zzso 

One hundred and twelve zzso subjects had their plasma viral zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso regions were zzso chain zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso C strains were selected and compared to other strains of this zzso from the database, and specific zzso acid signature patterns were zzso 

Brazilian zzso C viruses form a very strong zzso group when compared to zzso C viruses from other countries and presented specific signature zzso zzso zzso between zzso C and B viruses have been documented in areas of zzso The zzso of primary zzso and zzso inhibitor resistance zzso in zzso subjects was zzso An increasing number of secondary resistance zzso was also seen, some of which are characteristic of zzso zzso zzso 

Introduction of zzso C of zzso in Brazil was likely a single event of one or a mixture of similarly related zzso zzso between zzso C and B viruses is an ongoing process in the zzso zzso and secondary drug resistance zzso were observed, although some of the secondary zzso could be associated with zzso C molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sequences found in this zzso C Brazilian zzso might influence this emergence and have an impact on zzso treatment and on vaccine development in the zzso
