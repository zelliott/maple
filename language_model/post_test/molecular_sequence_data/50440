Although the reverse zzso zzso of human zzso virus zzso uses human zzso as a primer of viral zzso DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso binds zzso coli zzso zzso and in zzso human zzso zzso with nearly equivalent zzso We show that zzso zzso can use either zzso or zzso as a primer for DNA synthesis in zzso without the addition of any other host or viral zzso zzso coli zzso can serve as a primer for zzso zzso if a zzso site sequence complementary to the 3' end of zzso is at the 3' end of the zzso With this reduced template, the specificity of binding the proper zzso is due to zzso between a bound zzso to the zzso site of the viral zzso template rather than zzso recognition of zzso by zzso If an zzso viral sequence 3' to the zzso site is included in the template, then addition of zzso or zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso now fails to prime zzso The latter result implies that a template sequence adjacent to the zzso site and containing 6 zzso complementary to the zzso loop of human zzso plays an active role in zzso zzso
