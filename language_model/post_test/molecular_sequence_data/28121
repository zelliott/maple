We have performed a detailed analysis of the zzso properties of the human zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso gene product to zzso its function during virus zzso Our data suggest that zzso is zzso modified by zzso since a zzso zzso can be specifically zzso with both a serum from an zzso individual zzso zzso and a zzso zzso In contrast, our results suggest that zzso is not zzso even though the protein contains a potential zzso zzso In zzso translation studies demonstrated that zzso is zzso integrated into zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is an integral membrane zzso While zzso was found in significant quantities in zzso cells, the protein could not be detected in zzso culture zzso and is therefore most likely not zzso zzso zzso of viral precursor proteins was unaffected by the absence of zzso and no differences were detected in the protein compositions of zzso and zzso zzso However, virus release from cultures producing zzso virus was found to be delayed, resulting in the zzso zzso of viral zzso Our data suggest that zzso has a function in the release of virus particles from infected zzso
