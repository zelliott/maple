Following treatment of the human zzso zzso line, zzso with the zzso zzso a rapid decrease in viability occurred after 40 h which coincided with fragmentation of DNA in these zzso A similar pattern of DNA fragmentation was observed when these cells were zzso or treated with zzso zzso zzso changes occurred after treatment, indicating a form of cell death, regulated from zzso termed zzso A set of nuclear proteins ranging in size from zzso zzso appeared by 40 h following treatment with zzso Treatment of cells with zzso or zzso also produced the same protein zzso This set of zzso and a zzso approximately 55 zzso in size, had apparent zzso activity which was not observed in zzso zzso However, protein zzso of these bands in the zzso zzso region revealed that they were zzso zzso These results cast doubt on a recent report which provided evidence that these proteins were induced zzso
