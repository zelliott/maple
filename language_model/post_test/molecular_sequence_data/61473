Growth of the zzso fungus zzso zzso begins when the zzso breaks dormancy and grows zzso Eventually a germ tube emerges and the axis of growth remains fixed in the primary zzso while new growth axes are established zzso to form secondary germ tubes and lateral zzso zzso is a zzso family zzso that has been shown to be involved in polarity establishment and cell wall deposition in zzso zzso A gene predicted to zzso a zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso and named zzso zzso carrying zzso copies of the zzso active zzso zzso or the dominant zzso zzso were created and zzso The zzso active zzso strain grew slowly relative to wild type and showed an abnormal clustered pattern of branch zzso The zzso strain also labeled intensely with zzso showed elevated levels of cell wall zzso and had unusually thick cell zzso The dominant zzso was accelerated in the emergence of secondary and zzso germ tubes, and lateral branches relative to wild type and showed zzso with prolonged zzso The zzso strain also was hypersensitive to the cell wall zzso agents zzso and zzso zzso and showed an increase in cell wall zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso proper branching pattern, and cell wall zzso
