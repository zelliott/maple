The zzso crystal zzso zzso or zzso zzso is a characteristic protein of human zzso and zzso recent work has demonstrated that the zzso protein is both structurally and functionally related to the zzso family of zzso binding zzso The zzso as a group share a number of features in common, including a linear zzso binding site zzso on a single zzso In this work, we demonstrate that the zzso structure of the gene zzso zzso is analogous to those zzso the zzso The coding sequence of the zzso gene is divided into four zzso with the entire zzso binding site zzso by zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso binding sites from both orangutan zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso on single zzso and noted conservation of the zzso acids shown to interact directly with the zzso zzso The most likely interpretation of these results suggest the occurrence of one or more zzso zzso and zzso events, resulting in the distribution of this zzso domain to zzso as well as to the multiple zzso zzso
