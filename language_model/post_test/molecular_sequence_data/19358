Among zzso spices, mustard represents 1 of the most important in terms of zzso potency and widespread zzso An zzso zzso zzso a 2) has been isolated from yellow mustard seeds and identified as a new major zzso 

Cloning and sequencing a zzso zzso a zzso a 2 zzso and producing the zzso as a zzso zzso 

zzso a 2 zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso The zzso was produced as a zzso protein in zzso coli and used for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from patients with mustard zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso comprises an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 510 zzso zzso in which the first 23 zzso zzso to the signal zzso zzso alignment with other zzso zzso zzso showed levels of sequence identity ranging between zzso and zzso Three peptides described as zzso in zzso h 3 were moderately zzso in zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding to natural zzso a 2 was inhibited by the zzso zzso using zzso from patients with mustard zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso from yellow mustard seeds produced in E coli retained the zzso capability of the natural zzso 

The availability of zzso a 2 sequence and its zzso production could help to develop future therapeutic approaches and might well open new investigation lines to resolve whether zzso zzso are proteins implicated in zzso processes involving mustard zzso
