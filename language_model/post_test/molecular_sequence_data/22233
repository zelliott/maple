zzso calcium channels control many zzso functions in the zzso The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso channels zzso alternative zzso at multiple zzso This results in channel zzso with different zzso However, the zzso patterns of alternative zzso events at two or more zzso and hence the diversity of zzso zzso are incompletely defined for specific brain regions and types of brain zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have identified multiple zzso transcript zzso defined by different pairs of zzso events in the zzso of adult zzso We have uncovered new zzso variations between zzso 28 and 34 zzso of which predict a premature stop zzso and a new variation in zzso 47 (which predicts a novel extended zzso Single cell zzso reveals that each individual zzso zzso zzso also expresses multiple alternative zzso zzso but the assortment is smaller than in the zzso Two of these zzso zzso different extended zzso which are not the same as those previously reported in zzso cells of the zzso Our zzso recordings show that calcium channel currents in the zzso and zzso of zzso cells are largely inhibited by a concentration of zzso zzso selective for zzso over zzso channels, suggesting that the different transcripts may form zzso zzso of zzso calcium channels in zzso zzso These results expand the known diversity of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso cells, and propose the selective expression of distinct zzso of zzso transcripts in different brain zzso and zzso
