zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso of total zzso prepared from alfalfa plants, zzso and zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso revealed the presence of a zzso tail on independent alfalfa zzso zzso A highly zzso sequence motif zzso identified about zzso upstream from the 3' ends of the alfalfa zzso zzso was suggested to be one of the possible regulatory elements in the 3' end formation and zzso Three out of the four zzso zzso zzso have more than zzso zzso with a zzso clone and zzso the same zzso While the fourth represents a minor species with only zzso zzso to the coding region of the zzso clone and encodes a zzso zzso with four zzso acid zzso On the basis of compilation analysis we suggest a consensus sequence for plant zzso zzso which differs from that of zzso by four zzso acid zzso
