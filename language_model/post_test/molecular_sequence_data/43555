During zzso of zzso channels, the zzso loop connecting zzso III and IV is thought to fold into the channel protein and zzso the pore through interaction of the zzso motif zzso zzso with a zzso zzso We have searched for zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso motif which may contribute to formation of molecular hinges that allow this motion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which often are components of molecular hinges in zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for normal fast zzso zzso of these zzso slow the time course of zzso zzso Single channel analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that the slowing of zzso zzso is produced by increases in open duration and zzso to first zzso These zzso channels also show a higher probability of entering a slow gating mode in which their zzso is further zzso The effects on gating transitions in the zzso to open zzso channels indicate zzso zzso of zzso to transitions in the zzso zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that these zzso and zzso zzso contribute to hinge regions which allow movement of the zzso gate during the zzso process of zzso zzso
