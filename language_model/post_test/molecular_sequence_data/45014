Under salt stress conditions, the level of zzso (N is any zzso of the nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso sequences zzso zzso A or zzso increases zzso and is coupled with zzso of satellite DNA on zzso of zzso to the zzso acid metabolism zzso zzso of carbon dioxide zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso sequences is not changed in both the zzso region of the gene of zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso and zzso and in the nuclear zzso zzso Thus, a specific zzso of satellite DNA has been found under conditions of expression of a new zzso zzso The functional role of the zzso of satellite DNA is probably associated with formation of a specialized zzso structure simultaneously regulating expression of a large number of genes in the cells of zzso zzso plants on their adaptation to salt stress and zzso to zzso zzso
