We have zzso two peptides that zzso to unique regions of the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso 59 and 57, zzso were chosen on the basis of zzso ratios as well as overall zzso zzso These peptides were then used as zzso to produce zzso zzso that recognize and interact with human zzso in a variety of physical zzso zzso directed against each zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso on Western zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso these zzso recognize and form stable complexes with zzso and zzso forms of the zzso indicating that neither zzso is zzso when the zzso exists in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of the zzso are also recognized by both zzso The interaction of zzso 59 and 57 with human zzso in various states is highly specific based on the observation that zzso of either zzso with the appropriate zzso completely zzso the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals that an increase in the zzso concentration cause discrete increases in the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso These shifts occur under high salt conditions and are consistent with the formation of multiple stable zzso zzso Interestingly, neither zzso interferes with the ability of the zzso to be activated into a zzso form or with the ability of the activated zzso to interact with DNA zzso zzso with these zzso both zzso recognize and form stable complexes with zzso when the zzso is associated with DNA fragments that contain specific zzso zzso Thus, both zzso appear to recognize all known forms of the human zzso zzso Using zzso techniques to zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells as well as in Chinese zzso zzso cells that zzso express zzso human zzso a zzso location for zzso is observed in the absence of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is predominantly nuclear after hormone treatment, further supporting a role for nuclear zzso in zzso zzso
