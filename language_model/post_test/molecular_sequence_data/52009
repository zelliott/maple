A strategy based on the use of zzso zzso repetitive sequence zzso amplification was used to isolate regional DNA markers in the vicinity of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso A radiation hybrid zzso resulting from a fusion of an zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso and a zzso zzso deficient zzso zzso cell line zzso was identified as containing multiple X zzso fragments, including DNA markers spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso within region zzso From this zzso a panel of zzso was constructed and analyzed by zzso amplification to zzso identify zzso containing a reduced number of X zzso fragments spanning the zzso zzso and zzso construct a mapping panel to assist in identifying regional DNA markers in the vicinity of the zzso zzso By using this strategy, we have isolated three different zzso amplification products that map to a region between zzso X zzso zzso zzso A total of nine DNA sequences have now been mapped to this zzso using these DNA markers for zzso zzso we obtained a probe order zzso These DNA markers provide a starting point for identifying overlapping zzso sequences spanning the zzso zzso zzso the availability of zzso zzso zzso should assist the molecular analysis of this zzso
