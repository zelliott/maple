zzso zzso symbol zzso a new member of the zzso zzso gene family, was recently identified in zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso The pattern of expression suggested that this gene product might be important for control of zzso development and/or regulation of insulin zzso We now report cloning of human zzso characterization of its zzso structure, and its zzso zzso The predicted protein of human zzso contained zzso zzso acids and had zzso identity to the zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions were identical between human and zzso suggesting functional importance of these zzso The coding region spanned approximately zzso zzso and was composed of three zzso The gene was localized to four zzso zzso zzso artificial zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a nearby zzso marker zzso on zzso 4 was identified zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we also determined that zzso maps to zzso
