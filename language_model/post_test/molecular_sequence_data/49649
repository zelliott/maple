The fusion zzso zzso of zzso virus strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso effects and strengths of zzso zzso interaction on a zzso zzso zzso They differ in just two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso versus zzso and zzso in zzso both of which lie in the relatively zzso zzso zzso By comparing the sequence of zzso F with those of the zzso virus zzso and zzso disease virus zzso F zzso the structures of which are known, we show that zzso zzso also possesses a potential zzso repeat zzso C zzso In zzso the zzso half of zzso interacts with zzso in zzso while the zzso half is induced to zzso outward by a central zzso zzso We found that this zzso is part of an zzso motif zzso in all three zzso zzso and transport of zzso F require this motif to be intact and also require zzso interaction of zzso zzso that probably support the potential zzso zzso zzso acids 94 and 101, both located in zzso positions of the zzso zzso wheel, lie in the potentially zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that their effect on zzso zzso and zzso interaction is zzso solely by zzso acid zzso zzso at position 94 with polar or charged zzso acids are tolerated poorly or not at all, while changes to smaller and more zzso zzso acids are tolerated in both zzso expressed F protein and zzso zzso zzso F zzso and zzso F zzso viruses induce extensive zzso formation and are zzso or almost completely, resistant to a known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso changes in zzso F protein required to expose the fusion zzso involve the zzso half of the zzso zzso specifically zzso acid zzso
