Two distinct zzso were zzso from zzso zzso zzso Their complete zzso acid sequences were determined by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I and II were composed of 64 and 111 zzso zzso respectively, with molecular weights of zzso and zzso excluding iron and sulfur zzso Both contained two zzso clusters in their zzso acid zzso The first cluster of zzso I and the second cluster of zzso II had a zzso zzso in common with the zzso found in zzso The second cluster of zzso I had a zzso zzso with extra zzso acids between the second and third zzso which has been reported for other zzso bacterial zzso and putative zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria, and with a unique occurrence of zzso The first cluster of zzso II had a zzso zzso with two additional zzso acids between the second and third zzso a characteristics feature of zzso zzso zzso II was also similar to zzso zzso with an extended zzso zzso terminal sequence compared to the common zzso The evolutionary relationship of the two together with a putative one recently found to be zzso in zzso region in this zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
