The analysis of DNA for the presence of particular zzso or zzso can be readily accomplished by differential zzso with zzso zzso zzso The in zzso DNA amplification technique, the zzso chain reaction zzso has facilitated the use of these zzso by greatly increasing the number of copies of target DNA in the sample prior to zzso In a conventional zzso with immobilized zzso product and labeled zzso zzso each probe requires a separate zzso Here we describe a method by which one can simultaneously screen a sample for all known zzso zzso at an amplified zzso In this format, the zzso are given zzso tails with terminal zzso spotted onto a nylon zzso and zzso bound by zzso zzso Due to their long zzso the tails are zzso bound to the zzso leaving the zzso probe free to zzso The target segment of the DNA sample to be tested is zzso with zzso zzso and then zzso to the membrane containing the immobilized zzso under stringent zzso zzso is detected zzso by binding of zzso zzso to the zzso DNA, followed by a simple zzso zzso This technique has been applied to zzso zzso (six zzso and to the detection of Mediterranean zzso zzso zzso zzso
