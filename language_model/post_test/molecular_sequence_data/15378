Fourteen (9 zzso zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restricted to zzso and specific to zzso response were zzso The zzso zzso responses of these synthetic peptides in malaria exposed and zzso exposed healthy adult volunteers were detected using the ex zzso zzso zzso Five peptides from zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased zzso responses of zzso in zzso zzso There is no statistically significant difference in positive zzso response induced by any peptides in malaria exposed volunteers when evaluated as a zzso The frequency of expressed zzso in zzso and zzso healthy adults living in northwest and central Thailand was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although no association between positive zzso response and zzso was found, due to the low number of positive zzso zzso one positive zzso in zzso exposed group was presented as zzso
