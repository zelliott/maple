zzso studies of zzso zzso have identified many components acting to deliver specific proteins to their cellular zzso Genome analysis, however, has indicated that additional genes may also participate in such protein zzso The product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promotes the signal recognition zzso zzso of zzso proteins through the zzso zzso Here we describe the identification of a new gene family of proteins that is well zzso among different zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso zzso that share the same protein domain distribution and, like zzso may play an important role in the early steps of the signal recognition zzso zzso zzso We have identified five zzso of the zzso zzso four of them from the zzso zzso zzso and the other from zzso zzso We generated a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the closest zzso to zzso zzso zzso and used different soluble zzso Y, zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso proteins to study its zzso A large zzso of soluble protein precursors was detected in the zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso is localized in the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso gene is a new and important component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane and that it functions in protein zzso of zzso proteins through or into this zzso
