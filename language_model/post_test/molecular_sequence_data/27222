zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso However, recent studies have shown that zzso is also expressed in several active zzso zzso zzso zzso and exists in a variety of zzso We have investigated zzso expression in various mouse zzso using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso To identify zzso gene zzso we screened a mouse tooth zzso library as well as isolated and characterized zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is predominantly expressed in teeth and moderately in bone zzso We also have characterized a full-length zzso zzso clone with an zzso frame of zzso zzso and this zzso zzso Compared to previously reported mouse zzso zzso 13 sequence variations were identified, including 8 zzso single zzso zzso and an zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso at zzso domain of the mouse zzso These 8 zzso acids are rich in zzso acid and zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso showed a prominent band at zzso zzso demonstrated that this mouse zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso The predicted secondary structure of zzso domain of this zzso showed differences from the previously published mouse zzso zzso that they play different roles during tooth development and zzso
