zzso tolerance of the fetal zzso remains poorly zzso In humans, expression of the highly zzso classical zzso and zzso zzso is zzso while expression of the zzso zzso locus is zzso at the zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso class I zzso zzso exhibits limited diversity, but certain characteristics of zzso distinguish it from other zzso zzso class I zzso it has a truncated zzso domain, it is the product of alternatively spliced zzso and it is expressed primarily in the zzso We have examined zzso class I expression in the zzso of the zzso monkey to determine whether this animal is a suitable model in which to study the function of zzso Although the zzso monkey possesses zzso of many zzso class I and II zzso found in humans, the zzso zzso is a zzso in this nonhuman zzso zzso In this study, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso class I locus expressed in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although unrelated to zzso zzso encodes zzso with all of the characteristics of zzso These zzso zzso are limited in their diversity, possess truncated zzso zzso are the products of alternatively spliced zzso and their expression is restricted to the zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso evolution may have resulted in the expression of a unique zzso zzso class I zzso in the zzso monkey zzso and that the common structural features of zzso and zzso may be functionally zzso
