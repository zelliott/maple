Two new cloned human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose to call these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso giving the name zzso to the well known zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed more highly in zzso and zzso and zzso more highly in cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso site mapping places zzso on zzso 15 in a region near a zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso is spliced only at a very low level, and Northern blots in 24 zzso show exclusively the zzso zzso zzso has much lower activity on zzso zzso than either of the other two zzso Its sequence contains a zzso motif characteristic of the zzso center of zzso zzso of the zzso cascade but no region characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso site mapping places zzso on zzso 19 near zzso zzso lacks the C2 domain, which gives zzso its zzso sensitivity, and accordingly zzso has no dependence upon zzso although zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso site motif and appears to be largely zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso do not appear to be well zzso in either new zzso In contrast, all three previously known zzso zzso as well as one additional essential zzso zzso in zzso are zzso in both new zzso zzso zzso shows strong dependence on these zzso for zzso activity of all three zzso
