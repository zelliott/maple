zzso zzso is a zzso Web site for comparing two long DNA sequences to identify zzso segments and for producing zzso high-resolution displays of the resulting zzso One display is a percent identity plot zzso which shows both the position in one sequence and the degree of similarity for each aligning segment between the two sequences in a compact and easily understandable zzso zzso along the horizontal axis can be labeled with features such as zzso of genes and repetitive zzso and colors can be used to clarify and enhance the zzso The web site also provides a plot of the locations of those segments in both species zzso to a dot zzso zzso is appropriate for comparing zzso sequences from any two related species, although the types of information that can be zzso zzso zzso regions and zzso zzso depend on the level of conservation and the time and divergence rate since the separation of the zzso Gene regulatory elements are often zzso as similar, zzso sequences in species that zzso as much as zzso million years ago, such as humans and mice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso supports analysis of unfinished or zzso zzso sequences by permitting one of the two sequences to be in zzso and zzso zzso
