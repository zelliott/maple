We used zzso zzso to delineate sequences within the human zzso virus type I zzso long terminal repeat zzso required for zzso by the viral zzso gene zzso We demonstrated that sequences 3' to zzso position zzso are zzso for zzso but that almost all of the zzso tested located between positions zzso and zzso greatly reduced zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso However, displacement of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso 3' by zzso of up to 32 base pairs between the zzso zzso box and cap site had little effect on zzso An analysis of the zzso I hypersensitivity profile of the zzso zzso in zzso cultures suggested the presence of at least two zzso zzso sites, including one which extends into the viral zzso zzso however, neither of these sites appeared to be significantly affected by zzso zzso These results allow more precise zzso of the sequences important for zzso function and suggest that the zzso may be recognized by a zzso zzso protein rather than by the zzso protein zzso
