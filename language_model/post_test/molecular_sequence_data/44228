Although many bacteria are zzso and in some cases zzso acts as a zzso factor, the zzso zzso has not been analyzed in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso In this study, approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso representing the principal zzso were found to harbor the zzso structural zzso zzso and these were localized on large plasmids that often zzso in addition, the lethal zzso or iota toxins or the zzso This represents the first report of a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was highly similar to the zzso of other bacteria and zzso with zzso raised against the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso production was inhibited by zzso and induced under growth conditions where the availability of nitrogen sources was zzso To date, this form of regulation has been observed only for zzso zzso zzso
