zzso photosynthesis has evolved multiple times from ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and is involved in both zzso and zzso zzso however, its roles and the zzso and zzso locations of the majority of its activity differ between zzso and zzso zzso To understand the molecular changes underlying the evolution of the zzso pathway, three zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the leaves of the zzso plant zzso zzso The zzso relationship of the zzso zzso proteins with other zzso zzso was zzso Gene expression and protein zzso patterns showed that zzso and zzso demonstrate high expression in leaves and their products zzso to the zzso while zzso expression is low in all zzso examined and encodes a zzso zzso The roles of the zzso zzso zzso were considered in light of these results, other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All three zzso zzso zzso have zzso in the closely related zzso plant zzso zzso and comparisons of zzso zzso expression patterns, and zzso locations of their products indicated that zzso and zzso have maintained their ancestral role in zzso plants, whereas modifications to the zzso zzso gene led to the evolution of the CA zzso that zzso the first step in the zzso zzso zzso These changes included the loss of the zzso transit zzso and an increase in gene zzso which resulted in the high levels of CA activity seen in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
