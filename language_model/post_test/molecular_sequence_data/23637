A bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso walking, starting from the zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were newly zzso The size of the zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso the lab and zzso 2 zzso estimated to be more than 2 zzso The zzso zzso cluster was mapped to linkage group zzso zzso The lab gene was mapped on the same zzso but far apart from the zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the major zzso gene cluster and lab were at different locations on the same zzso in zzso zzso
