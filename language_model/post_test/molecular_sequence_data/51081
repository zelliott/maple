zzso zzso zzso mediate lung inflammation by producing zzso and zzso molecules that attract zzso zzso to the zzso Recently we described two zzso proteins called zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso that are zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso We report here the cloning of the full-length zzso which code for each zzso zzso AM were zzso for 4 h in zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso and a zzso library was created from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were amplified from the zzso AM zzso library by the zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso primer pairs derived from the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso These zzso were used to isolate 2 full-length zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso base zzso Both zzso code for proteins with four zzso zzso containing the zzso sequence characteristic of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso shares zzso identity with human zzso and zzso identity with rabbit zzso and likely represents the zzso zzso of zzso By contrast, zzso has no obvious human zzso zzso shares zzso identity with human zzso zzso zzso zzso Its shared identity with the zzso proteins is as high as zzso zzso zzso and its shared identity with the 78 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso may represent a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
