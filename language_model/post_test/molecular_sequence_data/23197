An zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso forest floor solution (in zzso pH of zzso zzso of zzso stained zzso did not form spores, and were not zzso zzso were zzso approximately 1 zzso long and zzso zzso zzso mostly in pairs, and contained a zzso cell wall and zzso zzso Growth was observed at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported zzso zzso ethanol, zzso and zzso were end zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso and only very minor amounts of zzso were zzso The relative amount of a particular product was dependent on the zzso zzso and product profiles indicated that zzso zzso were initially zzso to zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were responsible for the subsequent metabolism of zzso zzso was not significantly zzso and was not toxic to zzso zzso did not contain zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso Thus, zzso was characterized as an zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The G + C content of the DNA was zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso to that of its closest zzso relatives (which were in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso constitutes the type species of a new zzso Based on the collective properties of zzso it is proposed that zzso be termed zzso zzso
