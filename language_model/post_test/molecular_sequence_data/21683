zzso G has been estimated to represent the fourth most prevalent zzso in the zzso pandemic and zzso F is widely circulating in parts of South America zzso within zzso zzso zzso and in zzso However, functional envelope clones of these zzso are zzso which are needed for studies on zzso zzso zzso zzso and efficiency of viral entry inhibitor zzso Here we report the construction, zzso properties, and zzso usage of zzso functional envelope clones of zzso G zzso zzso zzso and F zzso zzso zzso These clones were obtained through zzso amplification of zzso zzso from plasma zzso and were used for zzso zzso All 15 zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso by zzso broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while a majority were neutralized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso With regard to the zzso F envelopes, all seven zzso were resistant to zzso and zzso six were resistant to zzso and six were neutralized by zzso zzso usage testing revealed that 21 of 22 envelopes were zzso including all 15 zzso G envelopes, seven of which were from patients with zzso T cell counts zzso These results confirm the broadly zzso activity of zzso on envelope clones across all tested group M zzso including zzso G and zzso reveal the resistance of most zzso zzso zzso to broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that, similarly to zzso C, zzso zzso is uncommon in zzso G, even at advanced stages of zzso
