An expanded zzso zzso repeat is the genetic trigger of zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso but its mode of action has yet to be zzso The sequence of the HD gene places the zzso repeat near the zzso end in a region where it may be translated as a variable zzso segment in the protein product, zzso 

zzso directed at zzso acid stretches predicted by the DNA sequence upstream and downstream of the zzso repeat were used in Western zzso and zzso analyses to examine zzso expression from the normal and the HD zzso in zzso cells and zzso brain zzso 

zzso repeat segments of both normal and expanded HD zzso are indeed zzso as part of a discrete approximately zzso protein that is found primarily in the zzso The difference in the length of the zzso zzso segment is sufficient to distinguish normal and HD zzso in a Western zzso zzso 

The HD zzso does not eliminate expression of the HD gene but instead produces an altered protein with an expanded zzso stretch near the N zzso Thus, HD zzso is probably triggered by an effect at the level of zzso zzso
