zzso including zzso zzso zzso bind to major zzso complex class II molecules and interact with T cells bearing particular V beta zzso zzso was shown to induce the expression of zzso zzso beta and tumor necrosis factor zzso genes in human peripheral blood zzso bearing zzso class II zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso abolished the zzso expression of both the zzso beta and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso class II molecules zzso the gene zzso zzso we investigated the signal zzso mechanism responsible for the expression of zzso beta and zzso genes induced by binding of zzso to the zzso class II zzso Three protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso each of which has a different mechanism of action, strongly inhibited the expression of the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso activity revealed that zzso induced a rapid increase of zzso zzso activity and this was blocked by zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the expression of the zzso zzso induced by zzso suggesting the involvement of protein zzso C zzso in the signaling zzso The involvement of zzso was confirmed by the observations that zzso zzso zzso zzso a direct zzso of zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso and that zzso evoked the zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso of zzso and expression of the zzso zzso induced by zzso appeared to be inhibited by zzso but those induced by zzso were zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that both zzso and zzso play essential roles in zzso class II zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso and that zzso zzso may zzso zzso zzso in the signaling zzso
