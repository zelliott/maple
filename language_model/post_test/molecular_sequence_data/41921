Two zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B to zzso were isolated from the human spinal zzso These zzso were found to be competitively inhibited by a new class of synthetic zzso zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso 20 zzso were the zzso protected peptides zzso and zzso both containing zzso zzso acids at the zzso zzso zzso zzso were converted in water solution to the corresponding zzso acids and no zzso of the zzso bond within the inhibitor sequence was observed after prolonged incubation with the zzso It is anticipated that these synthetic compounds may serve as potential pharmacological tools for in zzso studies on zzso zzso
