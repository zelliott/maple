In zzso coli, expression of the major outer membrane zzso zzso and zzso is regulated in response to the medium zzso and other environmental zzso A zzso signal zzso system, zzso by zzso and zzso is zzso responsible for this zzso regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso In this study, an zzso coli gene was zzso which interferes with expression of both the zzso and zzso genes at the level of transcription, provided that the cloned gene was introduced in zzso coli cells by a zzso zzso The gene product was identified as zzso which was previously characterized as a hypothetical protein in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso containing 107 zzso acids appears to be highly zzso and has a sequence similarity to the zzso type of zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was examined zzso mainly by using a set of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso interferes specifically with a function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms by which zzso affects the zzso function are zzso
