The analysis of mass zzso data is still largely based on identification of single zzso zzso and does not attempt to make use of the extra information available in multiple zzso zzso from partially or completely overlapping zzso Analysis of zzso zzso from multiple overlapping peptides opens up the possibility of assembling zzso zzso into entire zzso similarly to the assembly of overlapping DNA reads into entire zzso In this paper, we present for the first time a way to zzso score, and interpret zzso between zzso zzso zzso in an attempt to sequence entire proteins rather than individual zzso We show that this approach not only extends the length of reconstructed zzso acid sequences but also dramatically improves the quality of de zzso zzso sequencing, even for low mass accuracy zzso zzso
