The zzso zzso zzso acid type zzso zzso which mediates most zzso in the brain, is regulated zzso to maintain an optimal level of zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso of the zzso plays a pivotal role in this zzso This zzso which is expressed zzso on the zzso normally has low expression in the brain, but displays a remarkable degree of zzso It can also be a sensitive target for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso a zzso and positive zzso of the zzso which is released during stress, although the effect of the steroid is zzso such that it increases inward zzso but decreases outward zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is also tightly regulated by fluctuating levels of zzso as seen at the onset of zzso zzso levels of zzso resulting from the decrease in zzso at zzso are compensated for by an increase in zzso zzso along the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, which reduces zzso zzso by decreasing the input zzso However, excessive decrease of zzso function is averted when zzso levels rise, as would occur during stress, because this steroid decreases the outward zzso zzso current via zzso of zzso zzso thereby restoring measures of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Thus the zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression plays an important role in maintaining ambient levels of zzso zzso at zzso
