A zzso zzso a novel plant type III zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli accepted zzso as a starter, carried out six successive zzso with zzso and subsequent zzso to yield an aromatic zzso zzso The zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso and maintains almost identical zzso binding site and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso modeling predicted that the zzso protein has the same overall fold as zzso This provides new insights into the zzso functions of type III zzso and suggests further involvement in the zzso of plant zzso
