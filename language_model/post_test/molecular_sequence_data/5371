The zzso associated zzso zzso factor zzso reveals the signature sequence associated with the zzso structural zzso A number of different zzso fragments of GAP were zzso zzso and zzso by circular zzso and by an in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the two individual zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the entire zzso motif show significant zzso propensity in circular zzso zzso However, a zzso corresponding to the loop sequence shows no zzso zzso zzso the zzso corresponding to zzso motif was found to inhibit zzso zzso and augment circulating levels of zzso in the in zzso zzso other shorter peptides did not show such zzso The activity profile of the zzso zzso was zzso and very similar to that of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso activity of this factor is defined by its zzso motif as in the case of the zzso factors of zzso zzso The structural features of a zzso model of GAP in complex with zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso gene regulator, are consistent with the structural requirements of the negative regulation of zzso by zzso zzso
