In zzso zzso zzso abnormalities of the cortical zzso zzso such as disorganization of the zzso zzso array and lack of the zzso band before zzso markedly affect cell shape and arrangement as well as overall plant zzso We present the molecular isolation of the zzso zzso which is highly zzso in higher plants and has a zzso zzso of unknown zzso It encodes a protein similar in its zzso part to zzso regulatory zzso of type 2A protein zzso zzso We show that the zzso protein interacts with an zzso type A zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso system and thus likely defines a novel zzso of zzso zzso that are possibly involved in the control of zzso structures in zzso
