A novel broad host range zzso substance, zzso 13, has been isolated and zzso from the growth medium of zzso zzso zzso 13 is composed of the zzso zzso zzso (Mr of zzso and the enhancing factor zzso (Mr of zzso the latter zzso increased the activity of zzso approximately 40 zzso Both peptides are zzso by a single zzso and an zzso ratio was optimal for zzso 13 zzso Despite the zzso activity of zzso 13, neither zzso nor zzso contain the zzso consensus sequence of zzso zzso and zzso modifications comparable to that in the zzso are also zzso Mass zzso did reveal the apparent zzso of zzso in zzso which resulted in a zzso that could not be enhanced any longer by zzso whereas the intrinsic zzso activity was zzso zzso 13 dissipated the membrane potential and the pH zzso in zzso and this activity was independent of membrane components from a sensitive strain zzso zzso or zzso zzso Models of possible zzso complexes formed are proposed on the basis of sequence zzso structure predictions, and the functional analysis of zzso zzso
