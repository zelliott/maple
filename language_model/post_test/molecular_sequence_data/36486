To identify zzso elements involved with the expression of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso containing various regions of the zzso region of the zzso gene attached to the zzso reporter gene were zzso expressed in cell lines derived from zzso zzso and zzso liver zzso and kidney zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene spanning the major zzso initiation site zzso to zzso are sufficient for low levels of zzso zzso is enhanced 3- to zzso by sequences present between zzso and zzso in all cell lines zzso zzso between zzso and zzso influenced zzso activity up to zzso in some, but not all, cell zzso There was no correlation between the zzso activities of the various zzso and the level of zzso zzso zzso in the cell lines, indicating that the zzso elements responsible for the large variations in zzso zzso zzso levels are not present within zzso to zzso The region between zzso and 45 was examined in greater detail using transient expression zzso and zzso protection zzso zzso activity is enhanced in zzso and zzso cells by sequence present between zzso and zzso this region contains a potential zzso box, which binds factors present in zzso nuclear zzso Other regions between zzso and 80 that bind proteins in the zzso nuclear extracts include the major zzso initiation site, which has zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso initiation sites zzso and zzso and sequences with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core, and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso expression of the zzso gene from its major zzso initiation site, which does not contain an zzso zzso box, is primarily under the control of an zzso element together with an upstream zzso zzso
