The zzso inhibitor zzso is an integral part of zzso signaling zzso which plays roles in a variety of immune responses, such as bacterial infection zzso By interacting with nuclear zzso factor zzso zzso controls a variety of biological immune gene zzso In this study, full-length zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was obtained by zzso and zzso and included a zzso untranslated region zzso zzso zzso a 3' untranslated region zzso zzso zzso and an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 311 zzso zzso zzso had high zzso with other zzso containing a zzso zzso repeat domain, which was required for interacting with zzso a zzso sequence in the zzso and a signal responsive domain in the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Nile tilapia, and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nile tilapia, and zzso zzso were in the same zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso expression was highest in the liver, zzso zzso and zzso then followed by the zzso brain and muscle, and was lowly expressed in the zzso Likewise, after zzso zzso infection, the zzso level of zzso zzso in the liver was also zzso
