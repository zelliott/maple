A single pair of zzso zzso was used for zzso chain reaction amplification of a zzso or zzso region of zzso coli zzso toxin zzso genes from crude zzso culture zzso Genes were typed by zzso of the zzso chain reaction products to zzso or zzso zzso zzso The procedure was capable of detecting fewer than 10 zzso zzso coli organisms per zzso of culture against a background of more than zzso other organisms per zzso and provides a rapid and sensitive means of screening primary zzso cultures for the presence of such zzso When this procedure was used to test primary cultures from gut contents or feces from various patient groups, including apparently healthy zzso approximately half of all samples yielded positive results for zzso and/or zzso zzso
