A zzso clone of zzso was isolated from an alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library and zzso Although this clone has structural features similar to a functional zzso the second zzso is interrupted by a stop zzso and thus is not fully zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso showed a high sequence zzso to the zzso sequences of the zzso gene from zzso The regions of zzso contain many important zzso elements shown to be essential for regulation of the zzso gene in zzso The promoter of this alfalfa zzso clone was used in a zzso fusion to test its ability to control the expression of the zzso reporter gene in an zzso nuclear zzso High levels of zzso zzso activity were zzso These strong levels are comparable to some exceptionally high levels produced in other studies following the use of photosynthesis gene promoters in zzso with the zzso reporter zzso
