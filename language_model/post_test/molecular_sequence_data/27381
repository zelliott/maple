zzso zzso was in zzso isolated during the first recorded outbreak of bovine zzso in zzso zzso characterization of the new zzso named zzso revealed almost zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso obtained in zzso Spain, Israel or South Africa, when partial sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the internal transcribed zzso 1 and of the zzso zzso gene were zzso zzso obtained from skin tissue of one bull were infectious for zzso knockout zzso mice by zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso liver and lung of the mice 5 days zzso The zzso could be maintained in zzso mice by zzso zzso for at least 5 zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were obtained from infected mice and used to zzso five cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The best growth of zzso was observed in zzso cells, but replication occurred to a smaller extent also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparative analyses revealed that after direct infection of these cell lines with zzso derived from bovine skin, the growth was best in zzso zzso zzso replication was also observed in the zzso and zzso cell zzso Our observations on the growth characteristics of zzso partially contrast those for other zzso The preferential growth in particular cell lines may be characteristic for particular zzso zzso zzso A potential association between growth properties and differences in zzso remains to be zzso This is the first in zzso isolation of zzso zzso from cattle in zzso
