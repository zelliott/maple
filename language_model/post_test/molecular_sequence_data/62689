zzso are a class of microbial proteins with the ability to excessively activate T cells by binding to the T cell zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are closely related in structure and possess an zzso domain that resembles an zzso fold and a zzso domain similar to a zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have no significant zzso acid similarity to other zzso We have determined the crystal and solution structures of zzso which show that the protein has a zzso zzso The closest structural neighbors to zzso are viral zzso proteins and members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso In the crystal structure, zzso packs as a zzso another feature shared with viral zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso However, in solution zzso behaves as a zzso and any functional relevance of the zzso observed in the zzso is yet to be zzso
