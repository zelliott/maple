The ability of several zzso and zzso insect cell lines to express human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, transformed with the zzso gene under control of a zzso zzso promoter, were able to zzso express the protein and correctly attach it to the outer cell membrane via a zzso anchor as demonstrated by zzso zzso In contrast, stable zzso expression could not be demonstrated with cell lines derived from either zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso despite the observation that zzso could be detected in transient expression zzso This may indicate that the long-term expression and zzso of zzso is zzso to zzso cells, possibly due to improper zzso of the protein and zzso competition for cellular zzso In zzso transformed zzso cells, zzso was expressed on the cell at a zzso level of zzso zzso cells and was zzso at a zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso This level was comparable to the amount expressed with the zzso system zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso and transformed zzso cells zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site resulted in an zzso increase in the zzso rate of zzso when compared to the intact construct suggesting that the zzso step involves processing of the zzso zzso
