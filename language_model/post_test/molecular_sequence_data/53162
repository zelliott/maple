We have examined the location of the zzso protein in fetal and adult zzso and human specimens and found that there is a shift from a predominantly nuclear to a predominantly zzso distribution of the protein in human zzso In rat zzso and human zzso however, the protein is zzso if not exclusively, zzso throughout germ cell zzso One possible explanation for this could be that the zzso protein is responsible for the nuclear zzso of zzso in human zzso We have tested this hypothesis by examining the zzso of zzso which lack the Daz genes and have found that the zzso protein is both nuclear and zzso in zzso and by analyzing zzso sections from zzso patients in whom the zzso location of zzso is evident in remaining germ zzso zzso experiments indicate that the differences in zzso expression between zzso and humans are not caused by the zzso acid differences between the 2 zzso and that zzso is a zzso protein per zzso Variations in location seem to be independent of the presence of the zzso protein are species specific and, as in zzso may not have great functional zzso
