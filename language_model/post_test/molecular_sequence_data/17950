The major zzso of birch zzso zzso zzso v I) was previously isolated by molecular weight exclusion zzso and zzso in the molecular weight region of zzso zzso Further zzso of this fraction on an zzso M zzso exchange zzso allowed 6 zzso of which which the 4th zzso and 6th zzso included two dominant zzso birch zzso zzso designated zzso v I and zzso v zzso Final zzso using the zzso zzso zzso Micro zzso System, revealed two sharp zzso with a high degree of zzso This was zzso by automatic zzso zzso acid zzso sequence analyses which showed high average repetitive yields of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso AA analyses of the two zzso allowed 51 zzso with correct identifications of zzso zzso for 3 zzso The sequence data of the two zzso showed large zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso a I, the birch zzso zzso zzso 23, and the translated zzso sequence derived from cloning birch zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso support that zzso zzso zzso were derived from a gene family expressing several zzso zzso 2 of which with 13 variable zzso in a segment of 51 zzso The zzso of the two zzso zzso v I and zzso v II, was demonstrated by fused rocket zzso zzso and by crossed zzso zzso giving single symmetrical zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
