Mice with a deleted zzso gene zzso zzso develop zzso abnormalities and insulin zzso From zzso DNA of patients with zzso zzso and zzso who had no zzso in any known zzso zzso we used DNA sequence analysis to screen the coding regions of human zzso zzso zzso 

We found a zzso zzso zzso in zzso designated zzso in a female patient who had zzso partial zzso with subcutaneous fat loss affecting the upper part of her body and face, but sparing her legs, zzso region and visceral fat zzso She had severe type 5 zzso with zzso zzso In addition, she had some zzso features, including zzso zzso and neurological zzso Her father was also zzso for this zzso and had a similar pattern of fat zzso zzso and zzso zzso with milder neurological zzso An unrelated patient had a different zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso designated zzso He also had a partial zzso zzso with subcutaneous fat loss affecting the arms, legs and zzso region, but sparing his face, neck and visceral fat zzso He also had severe type 5 zzso with zzso zzso however he had no clinically apparent neurological zzso The zzso were absent from the zzso of zzso healthy zzso 

Thus, very rare zzso zzso zzso appear to be associated with zzso zzso and zzso
