A mouse DNA zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso amplification and zzso library zzso The zzso zzso has a length of zzso zzso and the open reading frame zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with an zzso of zzso The zzso identity to the proteins zzso by the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso and Homo sapiens zzso is very zzso The identity to the Pol delta from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is around zzso An zzso comparison between all available Pol delta sequences reveals several common structural zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso synthetic zzso deduced from the zzso specifically recognize Pol delta zzso from human cells and calf zzso in an zzso
