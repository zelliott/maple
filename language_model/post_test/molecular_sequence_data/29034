Blue light regulates processes such as the development of plants and zzso and the zzso of zzso Two types of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso which have partial similarity to zzso and zzso which are zzso protein zzso The former have also been found in animals with evidence of essential roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso abruptly changes its swimming direction after a sudden increase or decrease in incident blue light intensity, that is, zzso or zzso zzso responses, resulting in zzso or zzso zzso Although these zzso of zzso have been studied for a century, the zzso molecules zzso them have remained zzso Here we report the discovery and zzso characterization of a new type of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with molecular genetic evidence that it mediates the zzso zzso zzso
