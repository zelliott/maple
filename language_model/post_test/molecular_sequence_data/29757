As higher density formats become more and more common in zzso labs, the expectations for maintaining faster, lower cost screens puts great pressure on traditional zzso zzso In some cases higher density formats are not compatible with the zzso This seems especially true in zzso zzso In our case, the nature of the zzso response forced us to remain in zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the development of a zzso reporter zzso and its performance in two detection zzso flash and zzso The advantages in cost and zzso for each technique are zzso along with automation zzso An additional new technology, the use of pins for zzso zzso is also briefly described because of its dramatic effect on our zzso zzso However, it will be more thoroughly presented in a future zzso Comparing the technologies available for zzso aids in designing automated systems that meet the unique needs of each zzso
