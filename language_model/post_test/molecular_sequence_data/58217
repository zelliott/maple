A series of peptides derived from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 regions of the zzso and zzso molecules was zzso with an automatic zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed and zzso by zzso high pressure liquid zzso zzso zzso purity was zzso zzso The effect of B7 peptides on mixed zzso cultures was tested in zzso The zzso in the cultures with B7 peptides was strongly zzso The peptides that were most effective inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso The data show that the peptides are zzso and that they are zzso by both the direct and indirect zzso Further, the mechanism of zzso recognition was zzso We coupled zzso B7 zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with these peptides at 37 degrees C for 90 zzso and cell zzso measured by flow zzso The B7 zzso was bound by zzso of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso as a negative control, bound only zzso The molecular size of the zzso to which the peptides bind are being characterized by zzso
