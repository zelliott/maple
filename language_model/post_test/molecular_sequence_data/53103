zzso plants zzso zzso zzso Europe) zzso with zzso zzso 2011 (formerly zzso zzso de zzso et zzso 1994) were cultivated for 14 days under standardized growth conditions in mineral medium with addition of the heavy metal cadmium or the zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso These zzso significantly reduced the numbers of root zzso before any visible damage to the plant could be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reducing zzso shoot and root fresh weight by 10, 50, or zzso compared to the control without zzso were zzso zzso for cadmium ranged from zzso zzso zzso to more than 20 zzso zzso fresh zzso Testing zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso values of more than 35 zzso zzso for shoot and root biomass production, indicating that the effect zzso zzso is zzso more sensitive than shoot and root fresh zzso With zzso differential display techniques the effects of both zzso on gene expression in alfalfa root systems were zzso 37 zzso displayed transcripts were zzso Two of them, called zzso and zzso were confirmed by northern zzso to be zzso in the presence of the zzso The expression of transcript zzso was enhanced in alfalfa control plants zzso with zzso the transcript level was increased zzso compared to zzso zzso This positive effect of zzso was zzso partly by 35 zzso zzso zzso and totally by 20 zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso was highly affected by the cadmium concentration with an zzso of zzso zzso Compared to zzso almost identical zzso zzso and zzso values were found for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a significant overall zzso zzso zzso to a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso with high similarity to a copper transporting zzso High levels of transcript zzso were observed in control plants with a 50% decrease in the zzso zzso zzso gave a strong zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso
