A zzso zzso smooth muscle cell zzso zzso library was screened for the presence of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the coding frame of the known human zzso gene were used as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated only eight zzso zzso zzso when compared with the coding frame of human zzso The authenticity of the zzso zzso zzso was further confirmed by zzso screening of the library with the zzso probe and sequencing of positive zzso On Northern blots from cultured zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso of 800 zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of cultured zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also demonstrated in cultures of zzso cells and zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso protein is localized to the zzso layer of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso across species and localized to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
