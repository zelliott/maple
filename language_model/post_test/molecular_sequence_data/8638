zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are widespread and functionally zzso In other classes of zzso channels, functional zzso derives from large gene families, alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso The molecular basis of zzso BK channel zzso is unknown, since only a single gene zzso has been zzso BK channels in native vascular smooth muscle have an apparent zzso sensitivity approximately zzso greater than native brain or skeletal muscle channels, or cloned zzso zzso Using zzso as a zzso probe, we screened human zzso smooth muscle and zzso libraries extensively in search of genes or zzso zzso with novel zzso We isolated the human zzso of zzso including two novel zzso zzso forms, but found no other related zzso zzso characterization of the zzso clones in zzso zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells gave BK currents that were not measurably different from zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with a recently cloned zzso derived from smooth muscle dramatically increased apparent zzso zzso Thus zzso alone may not determine zzso sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle BK zzso zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso and the zzso structure was zzso Immediately after the zzso zzso two unusual regions of zzso repeating sequences are zzso The first of these regions encodes zzso and the second encodes zzso Both regions of repeated sequence are zzso between the mouse and human zzso
