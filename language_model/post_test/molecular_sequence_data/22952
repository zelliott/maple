The core protein of zzso is released from the zzso by viral and cellular zzso Here we report on an additional zzso zzso step that generates the C zzso of the core zzso zzso processing of the core protein of classical zzso fever virus zzso was blocked by the inhibitor zzso which is specific for signal zzso zzso zzso The same effect was obtained by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso reduced the viability of zzso almost zzso in a zzso zzso Reduction of virus viability was also observed in infection experiments using a cell line that zzso expressed zzso zzso The position of zzso zzso was determined by zzso sequencing of core protein zzso from zzso The C zzso of zzso core protein is zzso and is located in the zzso center of the signal zzso The zzso generation of the C zzso of the zzso core protein is almost identical to the processing scheme of the core protein of zzso C zzso
