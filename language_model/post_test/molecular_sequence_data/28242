zzso from the zzso promoter of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso (the product of the zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and activated by zzso in the presence of zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso promoter has weak zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso promoter shows candidate zzso and zzso sequences at the unusually high spacing of 19 zzso We have selected for spontaneous zzso in the zzso promoter that zzso an zzso zzso Four different zzso have been zzso Three of these are single zzso deletions between the zzso and zzso zzso A fourth removes the zzso sequence entirely, and places a second potential zzso sequence 17 zzso from the zzso zzso None of these zzso promoters are induced by zzso in the presence of zzso Two of them are zzso by zzso irrespective of the presence or absence of zzso Models for the mode of action of the zzso protein are discussed in the light of these zzso Our data support a mechanism in which the zzso protein in the presence of zzso acts to change the zzso of DNA in the zzso zzso
