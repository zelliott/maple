zzso DNA zzso are an important tool in molecular zzso To exploit the zzso repertoire of proteins involved in DNA replication for use in zzso we zzso the network of proteins implicated in this process in zzso zzso To this end, we performed extensive zzso zzso screens using putative zzso replication factors as starting zzso This approach yielded a protein network involving 30 proteins potentially implicated in zzso DNA replication including several novel zzso Based on these results, we were able to improve zzso reactions zzso by zzso DNA zzso by supplementing the reaction with predicted zzso zzso In this approach we concentrated on the zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso This protein is known to zzso DNA as a ring in zzso zzso other proteins to zzso Indeed, addition of zzso zzso zzso resulted in marked stimulation of zzso product zzso The zzso domain was determined, and a hybrid DNA zzso was constructed by zzso this domain onto the classical zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso to zzso reactions zzso by the fusion protein greatly zzso product generation, most likely by zzso the zzso to zzso This sliding zzso increase of zzso performance implies a promising novel zzso principle for the development of zzso zzso with enhanced zzso
