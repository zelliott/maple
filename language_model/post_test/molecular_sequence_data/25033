The zzso coli zzso protein export zzso zzso folded proteins zzso with zzso zzso signal zzso zzso signal sequences contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence motif which is required for protein export by the zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as terminal electron zzso Here, we describe zzso strains constructed with modified zzso zzso signal zzso zzso of the second zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso motif with either zzso or zzso or the simultaneous substitution of both zzso with zzso zzso completely abolished zzso In each case, the now zzso zzso zzso retained full zzso activity with the artificial electron donor zzso zzso However, the zzso strains were incapable of zzso growth with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso of the zzso strains was exploited in a genetic screen with the aim of identifying zzso zzso zzso that allowed export of the modified zzso zzso
