Most zzso peptides recognized by zzso zzso are produced by zzso and delivered to the zzso zzso by the TAP zzso associated with zzso zzso Alternative zzso also produce zzso zzso but their actual relevance is zzso There is a need to zzso the contribution of these supplementary pathways in zzso and in zzso A zzso zzso zzso route of zzso processing involves the zzso network zzso zzso zzso of this route by using zzso zzso zzso by zzso viruses indicates that it provides approximately one-third of all surface complexes of zzso and zzso class I zzso Generation of the zzso zzso zzso is a dramatic zzso step, since bypassing it increased efficiency by at least zzso zzso the zzso construct activated a similar percentage of zzso zzso T cells in wild type as in zzso mice, which allow only zzso routes but which have a zzso to zzso smaller zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso zzso zzso T zzso accomplished elimination of zzso cells in zzso The results obtained with this experimental system underscore the potential of zzso pathways of zzso class I zzso presentation to elicit functional zzso T zzso in zzso and support the hypothesis that zzso processing mechanisms may compensate in zzso for the lack of zzso participation in zzso processing in persons genetically deficient in TAP and thus contribute to pathogen zzso
