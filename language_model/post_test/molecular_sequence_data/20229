zzso are coated with a zzso surface zzso zzso that is so densely packed that it physically protects underlying proteins from zzso of the host immune zzso Periodically cells expressing a distinct zzso arise in a population and thereby evade zzso The main structural feature of zzso are two long zzso that form a coiled zzso and sets of relatively zzso zzso that are zzso to the plasma membrane and contain most or all of the protective zzso The primary structure of different zzso is highly zzso typically displaying only zzso identity with each zzso The zzso has nearly 2000 zzso zzso which are located in zzso Only one zzso gene is expressed at a time, and switching between zzso primarily involves gene conversion zzso The archive of silent zzso zzso diversifying evolution zzso also involving gene zzso The zzso family is a paradigm for alpha zzso coiled zzso structures, zzso variation and zzso zzso At the DNA level, the genes are a paradigm for diversifying evolutionary processes and for the role of zzso and zzso mechanisms in generation of diversity in zzso zzso To enable ready availability of zzso sequences for addressing these general questions, and zzso questions, we have created zzso a database of all known zzso 

zzso contains fully zzso zzso sequences from the zzso sequencing project, with which it shares all identifiers and zzso and other available zzso The database can be zzso in various zzso zzso zzso in zzso format, can deliver protein or zzso sequence filtered by zzso or zzso gene type zzso zzso zzso domain and domain sequence zzso zzso sequences can be stored as a temporary database for zzso zzso reports from which include zzso to the zzso project database zzso zzso Info and to individual zzso pages for each zzso containing zzso and sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso terms yield a list of relevant zzso displayed as identifiers leading again to individual zzso web zzso 

zzso zzso is a freely available, zzso platform enabling easy zzso via various zzso of sets of zzso that will enable detailed analysis of a number of general and zzso questions, regarding protein structure potential, zzso zzso sequence evolution and zzso zzso
