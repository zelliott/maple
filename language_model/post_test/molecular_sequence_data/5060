In the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso maintains embryonic stem cells in an zzso state; yet, the zzso protein has no similar effects on zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso gene and assigned it to zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to contain two zzso which zzso a deduced zzso of 200 zzso acids in length with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid similarity when compared to known sequences in the zzso zzso human and zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso acid changes were identified in the zzso protein when compared with other zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso indicated the presence of several zzso zzso binding zzso suggesting their importance for controlling the specific expression of these zzso In addition, zzso was localized to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso arm length ratios were calculated for 40 early zzso zzso and 32 zzso indicated that the pig zzso gene is located on zzso zzso This was confirmed by aligning zzso zzso zzso to the standard zzso zzso
