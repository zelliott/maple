The zzso zzso are a family of zzso acid zzso peptides that are structurally similar to the potent zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibits high selectivity for the zzso zzso zzso over the ETA zzso This selectivity may be a result of a modification at positions 9 or 13, which are zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso The truncated linear zzso zzso was also on zzso zzso zzso with zzso binding zzso zzso a series of truncated zzso zzso hybrid zzso were prepared, varying the zzso acid at zzso 9 and/or zzso These peptides were zzso for binding in zzso selectively expressing either the ETA or the zzso zzso zzso All linear zzso showed poor ETA zzso while zzso affinity was sequence zzso zzso 11-15 zzso zzso failed to bind to either ETA or zzso receptors at zzso of up to 10 zzso
