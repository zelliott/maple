zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso function zzso in many zzso cells to support zzso replication and antagonize zzso activities induced by type I zzso zzso While zzso is limited to zzso genes that are zzso to zzso are found in diverse zzso zzso In this study, we showed that the zzso zzso from zzso virus and zzso virus could rescue the replication zzso of a zzso zzso deleted of both zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso virus zzso zzso could rescue the replication of zzso in human zzso cells but not in zzso zzso and zzso cells, in contrast to all other zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and 135 of the zzso virus zzso zzso however, made it functional in the two zzso cell lines, suggesting that these two zzso are critical for zzso a putative host restriction factor which has some subtle sequence variation in human and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso family of host range genes from diverse zzso zzso were all capable of zzso type I zzso zzso activities against zzso zzso of a library of more than 350 zzso genes zzso identified zzso factor 1 zzso as an inhibitor of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso however, rendered zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our data show that zzso and zzso antagonize zzso zzso activities and that the host zzso function of zzso is zzso zzso in all zzso that can readily replicate in zzso zzso zzso
