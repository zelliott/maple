Plant heat shock zzso factors zzso are capable of zzso zzso zzso A zzso or both, zzso and repression zzso B zzso However, the details of mechanism still remain zzso It is zzso that the regulation occurs through interactions of zzso with general zzso factors zzso as has been described for numerous other zzso zzso Here, we show that class A zzso may activate zzso through direct contacts with zzso protein zzso Class A zzso can also interact zzso with zzso zzso class B zzso inhibit promoter activity through an active mechanism of repression that involves the zzso regulatory region zzso of class B zzso zzso analysis revealed two sites in the zzso of soybean zzso potentially involved in zzso interactions with zzso one is the zzso domain zzso located in the zzso half of the zzso and the other is a zzso binding domain zzso that shows affinity for zzso and is located zzso from the zzso A zzso DNA binding zzso fusion zzso activity of zzso while zzso proteins zzso activated strong and weak zzso zzso In zzso binding studies were consistent with this pattern of activity since the BD region alone zzso strongly with zzso and the presence of zzso had an zzso effect on zzso binding and zzso zzso
