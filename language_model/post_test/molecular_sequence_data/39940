zzso box genes are known to perform important functions in the development of various plant zzso Although the functions of many zzso box genes have previously been zzso the biological function of the type I zzso box genes remains poorly zzso In order to understand the function and regulation of the type I zzso box zzso we conducted molecular genetic analyses of zzso a member of the zzso class of type I zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but not within the zzso zzso This indicates that zzso plays a role in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused precocious flowering via the zzso of the expression of zzso and zzso zzso both floral promoters within the autonomous zzso However, the loss of zzso function did not result in any obvious flowering time zzso which suggests that zzso may perform a redundant zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso is a positive regulator of known floral promoters within the autonomous zzso in zzso
