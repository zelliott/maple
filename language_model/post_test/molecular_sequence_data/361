The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of protein zzso Three members of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprise the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso and other zzso We have determined the zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in complex with zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso structures suggests that zzso binding reverses the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the result that zzso is switched into a position in which its ammonium zzso is in direct contact with the zzso atom of the zzso where it is expected to stabilize both the ground and transition states of the zzso Analysis of all available zzso zzso zzso complex structures reveals that while their zzso are highly zzso their zzso bind in one of two zzso which appear to be either zzso or zzso The active site of zzso seems spacious enough to accommodate zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso A substantial fraction of the zzso active site is occupied by ordered water, which clusters near the charged regions of the zzso zzso a water zzso that interacts extensively with the zzso groups of both zzso was discovered at the active zzso
