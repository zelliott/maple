In zzso the composition and pattern of expression of the zzso heavy chain zzso gene family are mostly zzso To understand better the regulation of this complex family, we screened zzso libraries from swimming zzso and adult leg muscle zzso and have isolated and partially zzso clones for several zzso Two of these, zzso and zzso first appear in zzso at late zzso stage and are zzso with muscle zzso They increase in abundance in trunk and tail zzso until zzso when they begin to zzso zzso and zzso are also both expressed in hind leg muscle at the beginning of zzso but decline to low levels in adult leg zzso A new transcript, zzso first appears during early metamorphosis in both the tail and hind leg skeletal zzso A7 transcripts then decline in zzso tail but persist in hind leg through metamorphosis and in zzso Two other embryonic zzso zzso and zzso code for zzso closely related to zzso and may be zzso or zzso Although sequence comparisons with zzso from other zzso could not correlate the transcripts with specific protein zzso from the pattern of expression zzso and zzso apparently code for embryonic fast skeletal zzso zzso whereas A7 codes for an adult skeletal zzso
