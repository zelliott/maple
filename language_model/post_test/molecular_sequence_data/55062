The zzso zzso channel zzso plays an essential role in modulating membrane zzso in many cell zzso zzso is a heavily zzso membrane zzso Two successive zzso consensus sites, zzso and zzso are present on the zzso zzso of rat zzso Our data suggest that zzso contains only one zzso and it is predominantly attached to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Preventing zzso of zzso significantly decreased its surface protein level and surface zzso density level, which were zzso and zzso respectively of the level of wild zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid to the culture medium promoted zzso surface protein zzso whereas supplementation of zzso zzso or zzso did zzso Among the three effective zzso adding zzso appeared to reduce zzso acid content and increase the degree of branching in the zzso of zzso suggesting that the zzso structure and composition had zzso Furthermore, the cell surface zzso of the zzso surface protein was increased upon zzso zzso indicating that it had decreased zzso The zzso effect appears to apply mainly to membrane proteins containing complex type zzso Thus, zzso promotes zzso cell surface zzso supplementation of zzso increased zzso surface protein level and decreased its zzso presumably by a combined effect of decreased branch size and increased branching of the zzso
