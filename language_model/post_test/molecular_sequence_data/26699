With the advent of Next Generation zzso zzso technologies, the ability to generate large amounts of sequence data has revolutionized the zzso zzso Most zzso viruses have relatively small zzso in comparison to other organisms and as such, would appear to be an obvious success story for the use of zzso zzso However, due to the relatively low abundance of viral zzso in relation to host zzso zzso viruses have proved relatively difficult to sequence using zzso zzso Here we detail a simple, robust methodology, without the use of zzso zzso or viral enrichment zzso to prepare zzso from diagnostic clinical tissue samples, cell zzso and tissue culture zzso for subsequent sequencing on the Roche zzso zzso 

As representative zzso zzso full zzso sequence was successfully obtained from known zzso belonging to recognized species and a novel zzso species using these protocols and assembling the reads using de zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequences were generated from considerably less than 200 zzso zzso indicating that manufacturers' minimum template guidance is zzso In addition to obtaining zzso consensus zzso a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the majority of samples zzso 

The approaches reported clearly facilitate successful full zzso zzso sequencing and can be universally applied to discovering and obtaining consensus zzso sequences of zzso viruses from a variety of zzso
