One of the major sites zzso on the zzso zzso II heavy chain by the zzso zzso II zzso zzso A zzso zzso is zzso Two synthetic peptides based on the sequence of the zzso zzso II heavy chain around zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both peptides are zzso for zzso A and are zzso to a level of 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicate that the peptides are zzso on the zzso corresponding to zzso When zzso are initiated by the addition of zzso A, the rate of zzso incorporation into the peptides increases progressively for 4-6 zzso The increasing activity of zzso A over this time period is a result of zzso Although each zzso zzso of zzso A can incorporate up to 10 zzso zzso 3 molecules of zzso per zzso are sufficient to completely activate the zzso zzso zzso A displays zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso values of 100 and 1200 zzso with peptides zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A displays a zzso lower zzso with zzso but only a zzso greater zzso In the presence of zzso zzso II, the rate of zzso of zzso A is increased zzso If zzso are performed at 4 degrees C (to slow the rate of zzso A zzso zzso can be shown to increase the activity of zzso A with zzso zzso
