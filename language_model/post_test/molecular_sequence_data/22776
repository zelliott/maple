In a previous study, we showed that two alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were involved in the differential sensitivity of two zzso sodium channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso called zzso and zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Alternative zzso of an insect sodium channel gene generates zzso distinct sodium zzso zzso zzso 22, zzso Here, we report the identification of an zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso that contributes to the low zzso sensitivity of zzso Replacement of zzso in zzso with the corresponding zzso in zzso enhanced the sensitivity of the zzso channel to zzso by zzso zzso substitution of zzso with zzso in zzso produced a zzso zzso channel that was zzso more resistant to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso contributes to the low sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso substitution also shifted the zzso of zzso by 10 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso mechanisms by which this zzso acid change affects the action of zzso on the sodium channel are zzso
