zzso are small zzso proteins found in all species of animals and are zzso by heavy metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the blue sea zzso zzso zzso several apparent zzso of each zzso have been zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether the high number of zzso forms present in zzso zzso were specific to the zzso zzso and to understand how these proteins evolved, we cloned five zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments were amplified by zzso and used as zzso zzso to screen zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were zzso zzso long and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously identified primary structures of zzso zzso were confirmed and, in addition, a novel zzso was zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso shown by zzso representation and Northern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso message was more prevalent than the zzso zzso Only the zzso II transcript could be identified among the zzso zzso The high degree of untranslated region similarity between each zzso indicates that these additional forms are recent gene zzso events in the zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso zzso of cadmium to the zzso resulted in a marked increase in both zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso represents a primarily zzso zzso not highly expressed under zzso zzso
