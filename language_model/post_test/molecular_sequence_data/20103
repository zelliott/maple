zzso zzso oxide zzso is an zzso that zzso the production of the zzso nitrogen intermediate zzso oxide zzso NO is an important zzso zzso released by numerous cells, that acts in many zzso to regulate a diverse range of zzso and biological zzso including zzso immune zzso and the regulation of cell death zzso NO plays a major role in the killing of zzso pathogens as part of the innate immune zzso zzso is known to be induced by a number of stimuli including zzso as well as pathogens and their zzso As yet, a full-length bovine zzso sequence has only been predicted from the zzso although partial sequences from zzso are zzso Here, we have identified a zzso transcript for bovine zzso isolated from zzso from bovine zzso zzso zzso with the zzso pathogen zzso zzso When translated this gives a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a high degree of similarity to zzso from other species, and also shares a common protein domain zzso
