The zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of the known zzso zzso zzso genes have been divided into eight zzso which was in agreement with the zzso based on the deduced zzso protein zzso The DNA zzso between the eight clusters was obtained by sequence zzso and a total of 34 zzso positions were observed in the approximately 200 zzso regions, among which 18 zzso positions were candidate zzso Seven zzso primer sets were designed for seven out of eight clusters containing zzso zzso with which the zzso DNA of the zzso lines of group 1 zzso of a wheat variety zzso zzso was employed to carry out zzso zzso The subsequent cloning and DNA sequencing of zzso fragments validated the sequences specificity of the zzso zzso zzso sequences between zzso gene groups in different zzso These results suggested that the coding and zzso zzso regions of zzso genes are likely to have evolved in concerted zzso The seven primer sets developed in this study could be used to isolate the complete zzso of seven groups of zzso zzso respectively, and therefore possess great value for further research in the contributions of a single zzso gene to wheat quality in the complex genetic background and the efficient selections of zzso components in breeding zzso
