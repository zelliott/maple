Most zzso zzso are processed from larger zzso Several mechanisms have been proposed to mediate these processing events, including zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso A protein barrier mechanism was proposed based on analysis of the zzso repeat zzso protein zzso zzso binds two zzso regions and zzso zzso and zzso resulting in processed zzso with zzso bound at the zzso or zzso In this study, we provide evidence that protein barriers are the zzso means for defining processed zzso zzso in zzso First, we map additional zzso zzso whose arrangement suggests zzso via a zzso zzso Second, we show that the zzso protein zzso binds to the immediate zzso or zzso of transcripts that require zzso for their zzso providing evidence that zzso defines zzso zzso by blocking zzso Finally, we build on the observation that the zzso and zzso binding sites accumulate as small zzso zzso to zzso binding sites of other zzso zzso We show that most processed zzso zzso are represented by small zzso whose sequences are highly zzso We suggest that each such small zzso is the footprint of a zzso protein that protects the adjacent zzso from zzso
