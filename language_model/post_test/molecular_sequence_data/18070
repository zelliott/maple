This paper reports the cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the gene does not contain zzso and encodes a putative zzso protein remarkably zzso from any other known zzso zzso Southern analysis indicates that there is a single zzso gene per zzso zzso which is actively transcribed in zzso as revealed by zzso mapping of the zzso The transcripts are zzso in size because they have different 3' zzso none of which contains the conventional zzso zzso zzso
