zzso properties, zzso and zzso role of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso coli, and its zzso and zzso properties were zzso The molecular weight of the zzso chain is 45,000 as determined by zzso gel zzso in zzso zzso High performance size exclusion zzso gives an apparent molecular weight of zzso for the native zzso showing that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso by 6 M zzso zzso zzso transition zzso for the loss of activity and the changes in zzso suggest the existence of a partially folded inactive zzso The protein can be fully zzso after complete zzso and the regain of both native zzso and activity occurs rapidly within a few seconds at pH zzso and 20 degrees zzso Such a high rate of zzso is unusual for a protein of this zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso (or zzso as a zzso and zzso (or zzso as a zzso zzso is not required for the zzso The affinity of zzso zzso for the reduced or oxidized form of its zzso or zzso remains constant with zzso The affinity for zzso is zzso higher than for zzso The forward and reverse zzso rate zzso of the zzso zzso + zzso in equilibrium zzso + zzso have different pH zzso The zzso of zzso has an optimum pH of zzso while the reduction of zzso has its maximum rate at pH zzso At pH values around neutrality the maximum rate of reduction of zzso is much higher than that of zzso of zzso The zzso properties of isolated zzso zzso are discussed in relation to the role of this zzso in the zzso zzso
