The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are both zzso anchored zzso that are shed by an unidentified zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso both share the same stalk and membrane zzso the latter was reported to be shed zzso compared with zzso zzso and this was ascribed to zzso at an alternative site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These differences constitute a useful model system of the regulation and zzso preferences of the zzso zzso and hence we investigated this zzso In zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso zzso was indeed shed less efficiently than human zzso zzso and shedding of zzso zzso responded poorly to zzso zzso zzso However, using several zzso techniques, we found no evidence that the zzso zzso zzso site differed from that characterized in zzso zzso First, zzso zzso raised to specific sequences on either side of the reported zzso site zzso clearly recognized soluble zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso was zzso to zzso Second, a competitive zzso gave zzso zzso for zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting similar zzso zzso Third, zzso analyses of zzso of released soluble zzso or of zzso enabled precise assignments of the zzso in each case to zzso These data indicated that soluble human and zzso zzso zzso whether generated in zzso or in zzso have zzso consistent with zzso at a single site, the zzso bond, identical with the zzso site in zzso zzso In conclusion, the inefficient release of zzso zzso is not due to zzso at an alternative stalk site, but instead supports the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso contains a motif that activates zzso which is zzso by the additional domain found in zzso zzso
