The zzso region of the zzso zzso is comprised of an anterior population of zzso cells and a zzso population of zzso zzso They are distinguished by their ability to zzso different parts of the promoter of the zzso zzso We zzso by zzso analysis and DNA zzso zzso sequence elements within the zzso promoter that are essential for zzso expression and sufficient to direct zzso expression when zzso The zzso region was used in affinity zzso with nuclear extracts and bound proteins were identified by mass zzso The zzso elements purify zzso a protein with extensive sequence similarity to animal zzso Regulatory Factor zzso zzso The zzso proteins and zzso also display more zzso limited but significant sequence similarity with the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso elements show sequence similarity to the core consensus zzso binding site (the zzso and point zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso that in zzso make critical contacts with the zzso zzso binding of zzso to its sites within the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains are delayed in zzso development and highly defective in zzso gene zzso These results provide a first insight into the zzso signaling zzso that directs zzso differentiation and identify a zzso zzso of a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso
