zzso of the zzso open reading frame zzso of human zzso type 16 revealed an additional zzso a zzso zzso at position zzso compared with the original sequence zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The additional T had two zzso first, in reading frame 2, in which the original zzso zzso was predicted, the additional T changed the reading frame downstream of position zzso to create an ORF, which we designated zzso that terminated at position zzso and potentially zzso a zzso zzso zzso in reading frame 3, a new zzso was created zzso zzso to zzso which we propose is the authentic zzso type 16 zzso zzso It contained a zzso zzso and zzso an additional 82 zzso zzso Both zzso have been cloned into bacterial expression zzso zzso and the fusion proteins have been used to generate zzso zzso in zzso
