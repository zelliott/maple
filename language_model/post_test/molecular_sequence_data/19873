The synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso by the fungus zzso zzso depends on four zzso activities: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso by zzso and a zzso zzso zzso converting zzso zzso into zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso to zzso zzso we identified the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed a zzso affecting a highly zzso zzso acid, and introduction of a zzso zzso gene in this zzso restored the ability to produce zzso pointing to zzso as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso coli cells resulted in the formation of minor amounts of zzso but no zzso activity was observed in zzso cells, indicating a preference for zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso in zzso to produce zzso the zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and was also active on other zzso synthetic zzso In agreement with its role in zzso zzso the zzso transcript levels are induced by light and zzso in zzso zzso as already found for other car zzso
