A zzso family zzso zzso was isolated from a rice zzso zzso zzso young flower zzso library using zzso as a zzso With this zzso various zzso box genes that zzso for zzso interaction partners of the zzso protein were isolated by the zzso zzso screening zzso On the basis of sequence zzso zzso and the selected partners can be classified in the zzso zzso zzso One of the interaction partners, zzso was selected for further zzso Both genes began expression at early stages of flower development, and their expression was extended into the later zzso In mature flowers the zzso transcript was zzso in zzso and also zzso in sterile zzso and zzso whereas the zzso transcript was zzso in sterile zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we demonstrated that the region containing of the zzso to 137th zzso acid zzso of zzso is indispensable in the interaction with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the four zzso zzso zzso within the region are essential for this zzso Furthermore, it was shown that the 14 zzso acid zzso located immediately downstream of the K domain enhance the interaction, and that the two zzso zzso within this region play an important role in that zzso
