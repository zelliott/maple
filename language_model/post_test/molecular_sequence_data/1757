The human zzso zzso gene encodes at least three zzso which share zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso proteins traffic zzso into the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in relation to its zzso processing was zzso zzso is internally zzso in the zzso and its products traffic zzso Its zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso Unlike conventional zzso signal zzso its zzso zzso is stable and zzso to zzso zzso of zzso did not block zzso zzso and dramatically decreased the levels of but not of zzso zzso which differs from zzso by the lack of zzso zzso and hence the zzso consensus signal zzso zzso site, zzso into the zzso and zzso but is neither zzso nor zzso This finding of a relationship between zzso processing and zzso zzso of zzso proteins is unique for zzso zzso
