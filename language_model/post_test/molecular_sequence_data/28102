We have investigated zzso gene expression during the annual zzso cycle of zzso zzso by Northern zzso analyses of zzso zzso pooled from defined zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso gene products detect zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso sequence zzso detect a third, much larger zzso zzso transcript designated zzso zzso sequence analyses of two zzso representing portions of the FAT transcript show over zzso zzso to zzso Cy zzso at the zzso acid level but only zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns of these three zzso plus two zzso indicator transcripts zzso zzso and zzso were determined over the zzso The Cy transcript is seen at all stages but is zzso to zzso higher early in the cycle when zzso activity zzso The M transcript appears at the onset of zzso growth and is maintained at constant levels through zzso consistent with the expansion of the muscular sheath surrounding the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts reach their highest levels in ripe zzso when zzso activity is zzso The zzso of the FAT transcript to zzso and its pattern of zzso suggest the hypothesis that this transcript may zzso zzso zzso
