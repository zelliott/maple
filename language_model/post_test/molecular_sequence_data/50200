Recently we identified an additional zzso in the 3' end of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso To identify individual regulatory elements within the rat zzso 3' zzso deletion analysis was zzso zzso experiments using reporter zzso suggest that the zzso contains three functionally distinct zzso two of which are zzso specific and one domain is active in both zzso and in zzso zzso The three zzso together contribute to zzso function and act zzso Further analyses suggest that a putative zzso E1 site, zzso zzso zzso zzso site, and zzso zzso motif are important for the overall zzso activity of the zzso 3' zzso Moreover, we provide evidence that an additional zzso element, zzso A, is involved in the tissue specific regulation of zzso activity and that binding of a protein to this element zzso with the zzso activity of one of the zzso restricted zzso
