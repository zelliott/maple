The cell surface of African zzso is covered by a densely packed zzso of a single zzso the zzso surface zzso zzso The zzso protects the zzso cell surface from zzso molecules of the host immune system and is the zzso of zzso zzso The sequence divergence between zzso that is necessary for zzso variation can only occur within the constraints imposed by the structural features necessary to form the zzso zzso Here, the structures of the two zzso that together comprise the zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso The first domain has a structure similar to the single zzso domain of zzso zzso and provides proof of structural conservation in zzso zzso zzso zzso the conservation of structure present in the zzso zzso The second domain, although based on the same fold, is a minimized version missing several structural zzso The structure of the second domain contains the zzso zzso that in the native zzso is attached to a zzso zzso anchor that retains the zzso on the external face of the plasma zzso The solution structures of this domain and a zzso zzso zzso have been combined to produce the first zzso model of a zzso zzso The model suggests that the core zzso of the zzso anchor lies in a groove on the surface of the domain and that there is a close association between the zzso zzso and zzso More widely, the zzso zzso may be an integral part of the structure of other zzso zzso
