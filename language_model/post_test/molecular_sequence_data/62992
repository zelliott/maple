We applied a zzso display technique to a mouse zzso library to select single chain variable fragments zzso specific for the terminal protein zzso of zzso B virus zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso to obtain zzso that recognize specific zzso within the zzso domain, the zzso site of zzso DNA zzso The zzso DNA library was transcribed in zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso complexes were produced using a rabbit zzso zzso system, and were panned against zzso under appropriate zzso After each zzso putative zzso genes were recovered by zzso and the analysis showed that zzso complexes were specifically selected by the zzso We used a zzso to show that the zzso zzso pools were enriched through the selection zzso zzso zzso showed binding activity for both the zzso and the zzso DNA zzso protein in an zzso zzso analysis showed that each zzso zzso had a different zzso and that random zzso was zzso by zzso zzso
