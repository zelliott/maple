Basic research on the cellular mechanisms that control the expression of the gene zzso zzso has led to the discovery of zzso which is processed alternatively by zzso zzso to produce zzso in the pancreatic alpha cells and a zzso in the zzso zzso hormone is released into the circulation from zzso L cells in response to meals and is the most potent zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso appear to account for most, if not all, of the zzso zzso effect in the zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso of the mechanisms of action of zzso and of zzso on isolated cultured rat beta cells using zzso techniques to record zzso channel activities has led to the zzso competence concept in which the combined zzso and zzso pathways are required to affect zzso of beta cells and to thereby stimulate insulin zzso It is hypothesized that, among other possible target channels, the zzso channel is key first event in zzso zzso of the beta cell zzso zzso It is proposed that at least one factor contributing to the zzso of zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso on beta cells induced by the zzso of zzso Because of the discoveries that zzso stimulates both zzso and production of insulin, and that the actions of zzso are entirely zzso zzso may provide unique advantages over the zzso drugs in the treatment of zzso
