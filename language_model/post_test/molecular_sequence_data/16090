The zzso locus on zzso 11 represents one of the major clusters of zzso genes in the zzso We have identified two new members zzso and zzso which form part of this cluster of seven linked zzso and it appears that the zzso locus is related by zzso and divergence to at least one other mouse zzso box zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a predicted protein of 250 zzso zzso which displays extensive similarity in multiple regions to certain zzso human, zzso and zebra fish zzso domain zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene also shares these same regions of zzso and based on this sequence zzso we suggest that zzso forms part of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in fetal and adult zzso and is modulated during the differentiation of zzso zzso stem zzso In zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso shows that the zzso is expressed in zzso zzso spinal cord, zzso zzso root zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In the central nervous system, expression is observed in the most zzso parts of the spinal cord, with the anterior limit residing in a region of the zzso and no expression in the zzso or zzso In zzso structures, zzso is expressed in the zzso the zzso of the stomach and zzso and the zzso muscle layer of the zzso zzso has not been observed in derivatives of embryonic zzso The patterns of zzso expression in both zzso and zzso are zzso restricted and may reflect a role for the gene in the response to or establishment of zzso cues in the zzso
