The tight junction forms the zzso barrier separating tissue zzso The characteristics of this barrier are remarkably diverse among different zzso and zzso and are not explained by our limited knowledge of its molecular zzso Two zzso of the zzso tight junction protein zzso result from alternative zzso zzso and differ by an internal zzso acid domain, termed alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 262 zzso zzso 31): zzso zzso Using zzso specific for each zzso and zzso zzso zzso we observed that the zzso zzso zzso is restricted to junctions of zzso cells and highly specialized zzso cells of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in contrast, the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in cells of all other zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso protection analysis confirmed this pattern of zzso This distribution does not correlate with differences in zzso resistance or zzso zzso Instead, we observe a correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in structurally dynamic zzso whereas zzso zzso is expressed in those which are less zzso This is the first molecular distinction among tight junctions and reveals a fundamental zzso with implications for how the zzso barriers of zzso and zzso are zzso
