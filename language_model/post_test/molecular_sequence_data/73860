A zzso sequence from zzso 1 of the gene for zzso zzso was compared in 12 zzso species, representing as many zzso zzso This sequence encodes the zzso half of this zzso water channel zzso Most zzso acid zzso as well as an zzso have occurred in zzso zzso connecting the zzso zzso in agreement with a lower functional importance of these zzso zzso analyses were performed with zzso distance, and zzso zzso The zzso data set, alone as well as in combination with previously published alpha zzso protein zzso strongly supports a zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso and elephant zzso reaching zzso values of zzso This finding fully agrees with the only other presently available sequence data sets that include these zzso those of von zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso and suggests that this extended zzso zzso is one of the most conspicuous zzso groupings in zzso zzso Some support was obtained for an zzso zzso while the grouping of zzso with zzso was zzso
