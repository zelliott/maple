The aim of this study was to zzso about the modes and extent of zzso of zzso via tap zzso zzso isolated from tap water samples in different places of a hospital were zzso based on zzso genetic zzso and zzso resistance zzso These zzso were also compared with others isolated before from houses and dental chairs, served by the same municipal water supply zzso zzso from hospital tap water comprised members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In general, distinct zzso of zzso were detected in different hospital areas and in tap water outside the hospital, suggesting these bacteria are not persistent or widespread in the urban water distribution zzso zzso intrinsic zzso resistance, observed in most or all members of the family or of a zzso was observed for zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso acquired resistance zzso not common to all members of a given species, comprised zzso zzso and zzso Although the potential of zzso as opportunistic pathogens may be low, the capacity of these bacteria to thrive in water supply systems, combined with the intrinsic or acquired zzso resistance, may raise the risk associated with their occurrence in hospital tap zzso
