zzso a zzso DNA zzso zzso by the mobile zzso zzso of zzso zzso has specificity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and physical studies indicate that the zzso makes extensive contacts with its DNA zzso over at least three zzso turns and around the circumference of the zzso zzso no single zzso within a 48 zzso region encompassing this interaction domain is essential for zzso Although two zzso zzso and zzso contain preferred zzso a third domain zzso a primary region of contact with the zzso displays much lower sequence zzso While zzso and zzso suffice for recognition and binding of zzso all three zzso are important for formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and interference studies indicate zzso interactions of zzso across the minor groove and zzso backbone of the zzso Contacts appear not to be at the single zzso zzso rather, redundant interactions and/or structural recognition are zzso These unusual properties provide a basis for understanding how zzso recognizes zzso zzso DNA, which is heavily modified in the major zzso These recognition characteristics may increase the range of natural zzso available to the zzso thereby extending the invasive potential of the mobile zzso
