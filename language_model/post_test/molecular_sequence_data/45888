Recent studies have uncovered extensive presence and functions of small zzso zzso in gene regulation in zzso In particular, zzso interference zzso has been the subject of significant investigations for its unique role in zzso gene regulation and utility as a tool for artificial gene zzso Here, we describe a novel strategy for zzso gene regulation in zzso cells in which zzso is specifically modulated through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso for zzso in the loop region of a short hairpin zzso zzso designed to silence fluorescent reporter genes led to zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso of an zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso was also observed in zzso The results presented here provide the first evidence of specific zzso zzso interaction affecting zzso and a novel strategy to regulate zzso gene expression by small molecules without engineered zzso
