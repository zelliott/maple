The zzso zzso which encodes steroid 11 zzso which is responsible for the synthesis of cortisol and zzso the major zzso in zzso is expressed specifically in the zzso zzso of the adrenal zzso We have analyzed the promoter region of the rat zzso gene by using a zzso system with zzso zzso cells and have identified a positive regulatory zzso The region contained two adjacent sites for the binding of zzso nuclear zzso the binding site for an zzso zzso factor composed of zzso and a zzso zzso and the site for zzso protein zzso The binding of the zzso factor to the regulatory region had a zzso effect on that of zzso in the nuclear zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter in zzso cells was attributable to the zzso site but not to the zzso zzso zzso nuclear extracts of the zzso zzso cells from the rat adrenal zzso were found to contain both zzso factor and zzso whose binding properties to the regulatory region were almost identical to those of the two factors in the zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, zzso analyses of rat adrenal zzso showed that the zzso factor was present in the zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso of cells in the other zzso From these results, we propose that the zzso zzso factor found in this study plays an important role in the zzso expression of the zzso gene in rat adrenal zzso
