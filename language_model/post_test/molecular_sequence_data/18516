In higher zzso in response to stress, the zzso produces zzso hormone zzso which stimulates cells in the anterior zzso to produce zzso hormone zzso which in turn stimulates production of either cortisol zzso or zzso zzso by the adrenal zzso In zzso however, neither of these steroids is zzso Instead, it has been proposed that the stress steroid is actually zzso zzso zzso However, there have been no studies yet to determine its mechanism of regulation or site of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso injections of zzso increase plasma S in a dose dependent manner, zzso zzso injections of four zzso zzso peptides at zzso did not induce changes in plasma S zzso in either males or zzso zzso two zzso zzso hormones zzso I and zzso and zzso zzso all at single doses, zzso S production as well as, or to an even greater extent than zzso zzso sea zzso zzso zzso in zzso converted zzso zzso zzso into a steroid that had the same zzso properties (on zzso and zzso as zzso zzso kidney zzso released significantly more zzso S into the incubation medium than zzso liver or zzso zzso One interpretation of these results is that the zzso production of the sea zzso one of the oldest extant zzso is regulated through multiple pathways rather than the classical zzso However, the responsiveness of this steroid to the zzso peptides means that a zzso rather than a stress role for this steroid cannot yet be ruled zzso
