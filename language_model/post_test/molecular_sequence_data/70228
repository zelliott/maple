The zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso 61, is essential for zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso cluster in zzso coli strains and enables bacteria carrying the zzso gene cluster to elicit the hypersensitive response zzso associated with plant disease zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso delayed zzso was distinct from that of zzso zzso The locus was localized to a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso sequence was zzso A single open reading frame was identified that encodes for a zzso protein of unknown zzso zzso zzso of the deduced protein product was confirmed by using zzso zzso zzso expression of the locus and zzso sequence analysis of the isolated zzso The deduced protein product did not exhibit zzso with any of the characterized zzso genes or the zzso product of zzso zzso zzso was shown to initiate 37 zzso upstream of the zzso start from an apparent zzso 70 zzso Two zzso genes were shown to act as positive zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso race 4 did not exhibit the zzso properties of an zzso gene or zzso but suggested that this locus may serve a regulatory zzso A zzso to zzso was present in strains of only three of the 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso
