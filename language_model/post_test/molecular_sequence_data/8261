The ends of zzso zzso have special properties and roles in zzso zzso zzso for zzso function in zzso using a Chinese zzso hybrid cell line as the source DNA, generated a stable zzso artificial zzso clone containing 23 zzso of DNA adjacent to zzso the zzso zzso zzso The common repetitive element zzso appeared to be responsible for most of the other stable zzso zzso derivatives of the zzso clone that could be zzso in zzso coli were zzso These derivatives identify a single pair of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso repeat tract consists of zzso repeats with minor variations, some of which can be zzso with the restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso DNA under stringent conditions confirms that the zzso tracts are zzso into small fragments due to the presence of this restriction zzso site, in contrast to mouse zzso Additional blocks of zzso repeats are found approximately 4-5 zzso internally on the zzso The terminal region of the clone is dominated by a novel zzso rich 78 zzso zzso repeating zzso the repeat zzso can be subdivided into halves distinguished by more or less adherence to the consensus zzso The sequence in zzso DNA has the same tandem organization in probably a single primary locus of zzso zzso and is thus termed a zzso
