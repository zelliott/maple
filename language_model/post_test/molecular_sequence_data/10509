The zzso assignments of backbone zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso human zzso were completed via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange, zzso alpha zzso constants, and zzso analysis were used to identify the secondary structure for zzso The protein is comprised of four zzso zzso I, zzso zzso II, zzso zzso III, zzso zzso IV, zzso three zzso zzso I, zzso loop II, zzso loop III, zzso and two zzso zzso I, zzso strand II, zzso which form a short zzso zzso zzso IV is extended by approximately one turn when compared to the secondary structures of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso and bovine zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso In addition, several zzso outside the zzso zzso in zzso undergo significant backbone chemical shift changes upon binding calcium which are not observed in the related protein zzso zzso Together these observations support previous zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemical zzso experiments, suggesting that the zzso in zzso is important for interactions with other zzso
