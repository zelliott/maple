We developed a new molecular method of typing zzso zzso based on zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of a large zzso of zzso zzso including a part of the zzso and zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso region zzso followed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis with zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso of 5 zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and sequence zzso were observed between the zzso reference strain and the 4 zzso zzso The genetic relationships between 138 independent zzso zzso strains belonging to various zzso isolated from zzso or human cases, were zzso The zzso power of the method was zzso zzso the threshold value for interpreting typing results with confidence zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso plus zzso The in zzso zzso was zzso The strains isolated from humans were less genetically diverse than the strains isolated from zzso For the first time, 2 molecular patterns zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso This genetic tool could be valuable in distinguishing individual zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso
