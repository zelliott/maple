Of the zzso zzso species with developing comparative gene zzso the zzso gene map zzso zzso Order zzso zzso zzso zzso displays the highest level of zzso conservation with humans, with as few as 10 zzso exchanges discriminating the human and zzso zzso zzso To extend this model, a genetic linkage map of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso has been constructed including 246 zzso and 7 zzso zzso Two hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 zzso repeat zzso were identified and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pedigree between the domestic cat zzso zzso and the Asian zzso cat zzso zzso Two hundred zzso zzso were linked to at least one other marker with a zzso score zzso identifying 34 linkage zzso Representative markers from each linkage group were assigned to specific cat zzso by zzso cell hybrid analysis, resulting in zzso assignments to 16 of the 19 zzso zzso Genome coverage spans approximately 2900 zzso and we estimate a genetic length for the zzso map as 3300 zzso The map has an average zzso zzso spacing of 11 zzso and provides a valuable resource for mapping zzso variation in the species and relating it to gene maps of other zzso including zzso
