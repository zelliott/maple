It has previously been shown that the zzso promoter from zzso zzso can be used as a DNA probe to identify an zzso between zzso zzso zzso and the vaccine strain zzso zzso zzso To investigate the genetic basis of this phenomenon, DNA fragments from a New Zealand zzso zzso cattle strain and zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region, were isolated from gene libraries, zzso and zzso zzso analysis and comparison with database sequences showed that the zzso region in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis is identical and shares zzso similarity to the zzso sequence from zzso zzso The zzso sequence and the zzso and zzso promoter regions are zzso between the different zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences of the zzso region revealed that less than 1 zzso downstream of zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is present in zzso zzso zzso but absent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso zzso zzso in members of the zzso tuberculosis complex was investigated and found to be present in 70 out of 70 zzso tuberculosis zzso and 7 out of 7 zzso zzso zzso daughter zzso 2 out of 2 zzso zzso zzso 2 out of 2 zzso zzso strains and 7 out of 25 zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a genetic region of zzso zzso zzso that is not universally present in zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not appear to be present in any zzso species outside the zzso tuberculosis zzso It does not possess any characteristics of known zzso elements and the zzso sequences do not have any obvious features to suggest a deletion zzso The genetic location of this region is close to the 3' end of the zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso nature of this locus in zzso zzso will provide an additional genetic marker for strain zzso
