zzso zzso hormone responsiveness of the cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso gene has been demonstrated in zzso into fetal and zzso zzso and in transgenic zzso However, the correspondence between the regulation of zzso expression in zzso cells with that in the intact heart is zzso Given the cost and time involved in generating multiple transgenic lines for the characterization of gene regulatory zzso we used direct cardiac gene transfer to identify elements regulating both zzso and zzso hormone responsive cardiac zzso gene expression in the adult heart in zzso zzso upstream of the rat zzso gene linked to a zzso reporter gene were injected into the hearts of adult rats subjected to various zzso zzso The zzso sequence upstream of the zzso start site, which contains a zzso box, a zzso box, and a zzso hormone response element, was zzso active but not zzso hormone zzso The expression of a construct containing 388 zzso of upstream sequence was increased by zzso hormone administration, a response that required an intact zzso hormone response zzso However, expression of this construct failed to decrease to zzso levels in a zzso zzso To zzso complete zzso and zzso zzso hormone regulation, zzso zzso of upstream sequence was zzso These results demonstrate that, although necessary, the zzso hormone response element is not sufficient for complete zzso hormone regulation of this gene in zzso In addition, DNA sequences regulating the quantitative expression of cardiac zzso in the zzso state have been zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
