The zzso relationships among zzso zzso were investigated by comparing zzso zzso gene zzso In this analysis we used 14 strains of zzso zzso including seven zzso zzso two avian zzso two human zzso one bovine zzso one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso and nine strains of zzso zzso including six human zzso two zzso zzso and one mouse zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences of these organisms and seven previously published sequences revealed eight genetic groups which formed two zzso The first cluster was composed of zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso and included three genetic groups (one group containing zzso human, and zzso zzso one group containing zzso zzso and one group containing guinea pig zzso The second cluster was composed of zzso zzso and also included three genetic groups (one group containing human zzso one group containing zzso zzso and one group containing zzso zzso The strains in each genetic group exhibited similar genetic zzso The results of the zzso analysis agreed with the results of previous zzso DNA, zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso the genetic groups based on genetic distances may be considered a criterion for species zzso
