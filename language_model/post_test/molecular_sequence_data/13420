zzso and trans zzso of zzso zzso bonds can influence some aspects of the zzso of zzso zzso We previously used the zzso zzso zzso zzso to show that zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso the trans zzso of a synthetic zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso et zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as both zzso and trans zzso at all three zzso bonds, and although its zzso in the lung by pulmonary zzso zzso is extensive, commonly a small fraction of the zzso survives passage through the zzso To determine whether the presence of zzso zzso bonds might limit the extent of zzso metabolism in the zzso we studied zzso of zzso by the isolated zzso rat lung using the rabbit jugular vein zzso with the pulmonary zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso A large fraction zzso zzso of the zzso in a zzso injection was zzso in a single transit through the pulmonary zzso but a zzso fraction emerged in the zzso zzso The addition of zzso to the zzso in the zzso reduced the zzso emerging from the lungs to virtually zzso zzso When the zzso inhibitor zzso A was included with zzso and zzso in the zzso this effect of zzso was zzso These observations suggest that the fraction of zzso that normally survives passage through the lungs contains zzso that have at least one zzso bond that is zzso to zzso zzso and whose zzso time constant is significantly longer than the pulmonary zzso transit zzso
