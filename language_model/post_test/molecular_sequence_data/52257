zzso of zzso membrane zzso proceeds through the attachment of a zzso zzso onto a zzso zzso acid rapidly after zzso Here we describe the structural analysis of two very polar zzso which can be observed after zzso labeling of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso These lipids are not made by zzso cells deficient in the zzso of zzso zzso The lipids were isolated, and their zzso zzso was characterized using zzso acid zzso nitrous acid zzso zzso zzso treatments, and combinations zzso to produce labeled fragments which could be analyzed by paper zzso zzso are compatible with the structure zzso alpha zzso Man alpha zzso zzso X and Y being zzso zzso zzso (most likely zzso The anchor zzso of the zzso protein anchors of zzso cells was isolated, similarly zzso and found to contain the identical zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the very polar zzso have zzso which are much longer than the one of zzso The results suggest that these very polar zzso represent zzso precursor zzso which did not get transferred onto proteins or represent processed forms of such zzso
