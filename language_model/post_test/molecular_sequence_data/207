zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3) is an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso factor that plays a key role in cancer, by regulating as a zzso the expression of genes implicated in the main processes of the zzso zzso zzso and more particularly its zzso form has emerged as promising targets for cancer zzso zzso zzso occurs through zzso interaction between the zzso domain of one zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of a second zzso One strategy to design small zzso of zzso zzso consists in using zzso zzso targeted to the zzso zzso We have tested whether a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso issued from zzso chemistry, could inhibit zzso zzso and biological zzso This zzso was found to disrupt zzso with an zzso of 9 zzso Further biological evaluation using a zzso cell line demonstrated that its zzso form zzso zzso with zzso within the cell, resulting in a significant effect on cell proliferation and expression of cell cycle and zzso regulators controlled by zzso More importantly, these studies identified unexpectedly a zzso zzso zzso zzso as another potent inhibitor of zzso biological activity and thus give further insight for the development of novel zzso
