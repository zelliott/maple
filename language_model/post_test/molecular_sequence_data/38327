Group B zzso zzso cause human zzso while human zzso type 2 zzso is implicated as an agent of this zzso The zzso loop of the zzso zzso protein has been demonstrated to be zzso in zzso To evaluate the feasibility of a zzso vaccine strain against the zzso and zzso we cloned the sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso loop, flanked by dissimilar sequences zzso the zzso 2A zzso recognition sites, into the zzso of an attenuated strain of zzso type 3 zzso at the junction of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso virus zzso was obtained following zzso of the construct into zzso zzso zzso of zzso in diverse cell cultures demonstrated that the yield of the zzso virus was between zzso to 2 log units less than the parental zzso Western zzso analyses of the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso cells demonstrated production of the expected zzso zzso zzso proteins were detected earlier and in approximately fourfold greater amounts in zzso zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso was slowed, accompanied by an zzso of the fusion zzso loop zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was maintained in the zzso viral zzso through at least 10 passages in zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso demonstrated a brief zzso with no replication zzso in the heart but prolonged replication of virus in the zzso in the absence of zzso changes in either zzso zzso induced binding and zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso against zzso in zzso zzso was used to challenge mice previously zzso with zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and binding zzso were induced in these mice at higher levels than in mice without zzso zzso The data demonstrate that a zzso zzso can zzso express an zzso zzso of zzso from within the zzso open reading frame that results in the induction of protective immune responses against both zzso
