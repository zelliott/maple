Using a combination of Northern and Western zzso and zzso we demonstrate the existence of a high molecular mass zzso which is expressed during chicken zzso It is expressed in developing smooth muscle containing zzso and is detected at low zzso in adult zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso product from embryonic tissue zzso revealed that the zzso high molecular mass zzso is indeed the previously cloned zzso zzso zzso the high molecular mass zzso should be termed zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured embryonic gizzard and vascular smooth muscle cells express the lower molecular mass zzso zzso albeit at lower levels than in the in zzso zzso
