The zzso gene located on zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso a class III member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso gene cause zzso zzso syndrome zzso a rare zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso In this work, we report the characterization of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso and its expression pattern during embryonic development and in adult zzso The zzso gene consists of 5 zzso spanning 8 zzso and mapping to a region on zzso 11 that exhibits zzso zzso with human zzso zzso The gene encodes zzso a zzso zzso acid protein that maintains the 12 zzso domain structure typical of the zzso family, and shares the specific functional motifs involved in sugar transport with the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that two specific zzso zzso both including the zzso region, were expressed during zzso and in different adult zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso analyses demonstrated a maternal origin of the total zzso zzso and its ubiquitous distribution until the early zzso zzso In later embryonic zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and swim zzso Overall, these results suggest a wide role of zzso during zzso zzso
