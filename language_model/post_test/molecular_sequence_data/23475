zzso derived from a zzso digest of commercially available human zzso were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso which permitted the zzso profiles at zzso and zzso to be zzso Both are located in a well-known motif for zzso zzso The contents of the carbohydrates at each site were significantly different from each other, and consisted of a variety of minor types of zzso in addition to the major one, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso containing these two sites yielded predominantly zzso originating from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and reducing zzso resulting from zzso of the zzso bonds of the zzso zzso this permitted the structural zzso of a small minority of the zzso zzso In particular, the observation of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso is useful for probing outer zzso terminal zzso which represented zzso structures consisting of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, from which the Lewis X structure zzso was readily zzso Moreover, zzso at the zzso zzso zzso specifically occurred at zzso as demonstrated by treatment of the zzso with zzso
