zzso zzso of the pine bark zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated using transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso different zzso affiliated with the zzso were present in distinct zzso One of them zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to an zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that they originate from a lineage already present in ancient zzso before the hosts diversified into the two major zzso zzso and zzso The other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso lineage in members of the zzso Our findings lend further support for a complex evolutionary history of the association of zzso with a zzso diverse set of bacterial zzso
