Three zzso zzso recognized by zzso from patients with zzso zzso were extracted from zzso major zzso by zzso and then zzso by thin layer zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso analysis was carried out using chemical zzso fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso The major structures deduced can be summarized as zzso zzso see zzso where zzso zzso 0, 1, 2; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso backbone showed considerable zzso These three zzso belong to a relatively new class of compounds and may represent sequential steps in the zzso of zzso which anchor proteins or other zzso to zzso cell zzso
