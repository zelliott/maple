An open reading frame was found 214 zzso downstream of the cellulose zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was found to be similar to some zzso zzso We detected zzso activity in the culture medium and analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence showed that this gene encodes the zzso zzso it is possible that this region is a gene cluster for cellulose zzso
