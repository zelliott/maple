zzso zzso a zzso regulated chick zzso protein of zzso apparent molecular weight, was zzso from culture medium of zzso zzso The zzso method included a zzso cellulose zzso column, a CM cellulose zzso column and a zzso molecular sieve zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso terminal end of the protein was zzso Computer assisted analysis showed significant zzso between this sequence and the zzso terminal sequences of proteins that belong to the zzso of the low molecular weight binding proteins sharing a basic framework for the binding and transport of small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso terminal sequence of the chicken zzso binding protein excluded identity between this protein and the zzso
