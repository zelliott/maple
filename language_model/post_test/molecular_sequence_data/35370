zzso zzso zzso 2) is one of the zzso zzso zzso that protect against zzso oxygen zzso While explorations of zzso expression regulation are mainly focused on zzso and zzso zzso there are few reports about the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso small zzso zzso that have emerged as indispensable regulators of gene zzso Here we show that zzso a widely expressed zzso is zzso by zzso zzso By sequence analysis we found a binding site for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reporter zzso confirmed that zzso can interact with this zzso regulatory zzso Our results further show that zzso could zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso could reverse the decrease of both the zzso level and cell viability in zzso treated zzso zzso In conclusion, here we have identified a novel function of zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
