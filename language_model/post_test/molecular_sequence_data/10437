We have examined differences in the spatial and zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression following exposure of zzso zzso to heat shock or zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, we found that levels of zzso and zzso zzso were dramatically elevated during heat shock in zzso zzso In contrast, ethanol exposure resulted in strong zzso of the zzso gene whereas zzso zzso levels increased only slightly following the same zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in zzso cells, as well as several other zzso tissue cell populations within the zzso following exposure to either zzso zzso zzso displayed a very different zzso zzso For example, neither stress induced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, high levels of zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells of the developing zzso following exposure to heat zzso but not to zzso These cells did not express the zzso gene following exposure to either of these zzso The results suggest the presence of different zzso regulatory mechanisms for these genes which operate in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso
