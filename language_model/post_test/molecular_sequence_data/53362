zzso zzso is an zzso protein found in some marine zzso A zzso sequence motif in all zzso provides five zzso and two zzso zzso to an zzso zzso active site, as well as a zzso zzso binding zzso Database searches located a previously zzso zzso sequence motif at the 3' end of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso We have established by zzso that a full-length zzso including the zzso domain, is expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso when expressed separately in zzso form in zzso coli, was found to fold into a stable zzso zzso The zzso zzso and resonance zzso zzso of zzso and of its zzso zzso provide clear evidence for an zzso zzso site very similar to that found in zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso exposure of the reduced zzso presumably zzso zzso to air resulted in formation of an zzso zzso also very similar to that of zzso Unlike that of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso within a few minutes at room zzso The zzso binding pocket of zzso appears to be larger than that of zzso Given the zzso nature of zzso zzso and the putative zzso function of zzso one possible role for the zzso domain of zzso is zzso zzso is the first characterized example of a zzso protein from any zzso
