The zzso zzso is involved in the replication of zzso DNA as well as in the repair of DNA zzso zzso protein A zzso is also an integral part of the DNA replication and repair zzso We have investigated the zzso of zzso in the function of zzso zzso including its structure specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies, which employed a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso containing a short 14 zzso duplex region, showed the effect of zzso to be minimal or zzso As zzso zzso is zzso for a protein participating in the DNA replication process, we have further investigated the mechanism of such zzso zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso with a long duplex region zzso zzso were prepared using zzso zzso and synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso with these zzso in a zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso exerted a zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso onto the DNA zzso decreased from approximately 5 to 2 zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso following initiation of the zzso reaction, the initial rate of the reaction increased zzso in the presence of zzso Further analysis of the interaction of zzso with various zzso zzso indicated that zzso has a weak zzso zzso effect and could melt small, 14 zzso regions of duplex zzso zzso zzso zzso the DNA strand at the junction of zzso and zzso zzso consequently, the observed zzso with small duplex zzso was likely due to duplex zzso Our studies also demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso H activity of zzso zzso zzso In both instances zzso zzso and zzso zzso the stimulation may involve a specific interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso rather than a structural positioning of the DNA zzso by zzso
