The complete zzso gene sequences of 24 chicken zzso zzso collected in the zzso Germany, the Netherlands and South Africa from the 1980s to 2008, were determined and compared with that of a US zzso zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analysis demonstrated the existence of two major zzso groups, designated A and B, which shared 38 to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso from groups A and B shared zzso protein identities ranging from 26 to 38% with other avian zzso The group A zzso comprised three subgroups, which displayed zzso identities ranging from 77 to zzso while group B comprised two clearly separated subgroups, zzso and zzso which displayed zzso identities of 97 to zzso and 94 to zzso respectively, and shared zzso identities of 84 to zzso zzso analyses performed with zzso open reading frame zzso zzso and open reading frame 2 zzso zzso sequences showed that zzso from zzso zzso zzso had zzso genes that differed from those possessed by zzso belonging to group A and zzso zzso The zzso zzso regions zzso 1 to zzso were more zzso than the zzso regions, with the zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sharing 76 to zzso zzso acid identity, while the zzso regions of the A zzso displayed identities less than zzso zzso representative of both zzso groups and more than one zzso were detected within the same broiler zzso The high level of zzso sequence diversity observed in this study has important implications for both the control and diagnosis of zzso zzso
