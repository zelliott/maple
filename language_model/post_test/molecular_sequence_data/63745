The zzso zzso acid zzso 1 zzso represents a major route by which small neutral zzso acids are absorbed after zzso protein zzso The system also serves as a novel route for oral drug zzso Having shown that zzso affects affinity zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso we investigated which zzso zzso are obligatory for zzso zzso Three zzso zzso are zzso among the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to 4 from different animal zzso We individually zzso each of these zzso zzso and compared the zzso function of the zzso with that of the wild type zzso after expression in zzso zzso zzso was found to be essential for the zzso activity of zzso because the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and zzso are less important for transport function since zzso and zzso zzso did not impair transport zzso The loss of transport function of zzso zzso was not due to zzso in protein expression as shown both by cell surface zzso zzso analyses and by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso might be responsible for binding and zzso of zzso in the course of cellular zzso acid zzso by zzso
