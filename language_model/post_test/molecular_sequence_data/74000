zzso zzso zzso zzso are a highly evolved group of organisms that are uniquely able to survive in and exploit zzso zzso In this review, we examine the potential interplay between fluctuations in environmental zzso and the primary sequence and zzso structure of zzso zzso The proteins of zzso zzso are highly adapted and zzso engineered to function in an zzso milieu that is in zzso balance with an external environment containing between 2 and 5 M zzso zzso To understand the nature of zzso adaptation and to zzso this zzso the sequences of genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins of the large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins from three zzso of zzso zzso have been aligned and analyzed for the presence of synonymous and zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso these zzso genes exhibit an zzso high proportion of zzso zzso zzso that result in zzso acid replacement in the zzso zzso More than one-third of the replacements involve zzso zzso acid zzso We suggest that fluctuations in environmental zzso provide the driving force for fixation of the excessive number of zzso zzso Tinkering with the number, location, and arrangement of zzso and other zzso acid zzso influences the fitness zzso zzso surface zzso and structural zzso of the zzso zzso Tinkering is also evident at zzso protein positions zzso or zzso for zzso more than one-third of these positions use both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso indicating that there have been multiple zzso zzso at these zzso Our model suggests that fluctuating environmental zzso prevents zzso of fitness for many zzso proteins and helps to explain the unusual evolutionary divergence of their zzso zzso
