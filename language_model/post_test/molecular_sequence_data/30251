By using a promoter probe zzso we investigated expression of the linked zzso and zzso genes coding for the two different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso For this reason, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso obtained indicate that the zzso gene has a promoter from which it may be transcribed independently of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene may also be transcribed from the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene is about zzso higher from the zzso promoter than from its own zzso The induction of both zzso and zzso genes by zzso agents in the zzso strain as well as in several zzso zzso was also zzso zzso gene expression was increased by these treatments in zzso zzso and zzso zzso although in both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene expression was considerably lower than that in zzso zzso zzso gene expression was zzso by DNA damage only when its zzso was from the zzso promoter, but there was no effect when zzso was transcribed from its own zzso In addition, the zzso level of zzso and zzso zzso was reduced in strains containing either zzso and zzso zzso or a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso whereas the presence of a zzso zzso increased the zzso expression of both zzso On the contrary, the zzso level of the zzso fusion remained constant in all these zzso Together these results indicate that induction of the zzso response enhances expression of the zzso genes from the zzso zzso
