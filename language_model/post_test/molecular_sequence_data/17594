DNA zzso with the zzso crystal protein gene zzso (formerly zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown that subspecies zzso contains a zzso sequence in addition to the zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso sequence and have determined that the zzso which has been designated zzso is zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the cloned zzso gene produced very little zzso zzso A high level of production of the zzso protein was achieved by fusing the regulatory region of the zzso crystal protein gene to the zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to be highly toxic to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was not toxic to Aedes zzso
