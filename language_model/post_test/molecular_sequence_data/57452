zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the corresponding alcohols which are the direct zzso precursors of zzso Recently, we have zzso from zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso distinct in their zzso and functional zzso In this paper, we report the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso isolated by screening a zzso zzso library generated from cell suspension culture of zzso zzso using a tobacco zzso zzso as a zzso This full-length clone zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which zzso to the zzso molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is very well zzso among species zzso zzso with zzso from zzso a zzso zzso and zzso with the partial sequence from a zzso zzso zzso The identity of this clone was zzso demonstrated zzso by comparison with zzso sequence data from zzso zzso and zzso by functional expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the same properties as the natural zzso zzso in terms of zzso mobility, zzso structure, zzso specificity and zzso The zzso transcript is equally abundant in stems and leaves and at the limit of detection in zzso At the tissue level the zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso and virtually zzso in zzso
