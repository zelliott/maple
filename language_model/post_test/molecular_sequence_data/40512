Designed zzso with zzso folding properties are zzso as zzso templates for fabrication of ordered zzso molecular and zzso zzso of zzso The properties of the zzso as well as the three zzso zzso of the zzso determine how the zzso are arranged in the zzso zzso which highly affects the properties of the hybrid zzso The ability to control the zzso zzso and assembly into fibers provides a promising route for tuning the optical properties of zzso and for fabrication of complex functional zzso with well defined structural zzso
