The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso the agent of human typhoid zzso zzso of this zzso is controlled by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus is composed of 11 genes designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We constructed zzso zzso zzso strains carrying zzso zzso in ten genes located at the zzso locus and examined the individual contribution of each gene to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso experiments suggested that synthesis of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso might be zzso by the zzso zzso but required functional zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso directed transport of the zzso to the bacterial cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the bacterial cell surface was dependent of the zzso zzso The zzso protein was not essential for zzso zzso zzso However, disruption of the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly decreased expression of zzso zzso This zzso was fully zzso by providing zzso in trans on a zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso product positively regulated zzso of the zzso and zzso genes from a promoter located upstream of zzso Moreover, we showed that a zzso fusion was not expressed in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
