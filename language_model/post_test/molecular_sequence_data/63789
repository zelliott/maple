A current promising AIDS vaccine strategy is to elicit zzso zzso T zzso zzso responses that broadly recognize zzso zzso In our previous vaccine trial zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, a group of Burmese zzso zzso possessing a major zzso complex zzso zzso have shown zzso viral control against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses exerted strong selective pressure on the virus in this zzso Here, we have evaluated in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso responses in two zzso zzso against challenge with a zzso zzso that has the same zzso zzso sequence with zzso Despite efficient zzso zzso induction by zzso both zzso failed to control zzso replication and neither of them showed zzso within the zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso zzso failed to show responses against zzso infection due to a change from zzso to zzso at zzso zzso 205 immediately preceding the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that even zzso zzso efficacy can be zzso by a single zzso acid change in viral zzso zzso region, underlining the influence of viral zzso zzso sequences on zzso AIDS vaccine zzso
