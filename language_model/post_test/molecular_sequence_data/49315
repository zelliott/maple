The binding of advanced zzso zzso zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso is known to deteriorate various cell functions and is implicated in the zzso of diabetic vascular zzso In the present study, we show that the cellular constituents of small vessels, zzso cells zzso and zzso express novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso coding for the zzso that lack the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso or the zzso zzso domain zzso as well as the known full-length zzso The ratio of the expression of the three zzso was different between zzso and zzso the content of the zzso form was highest in zzso whereas the full-length form was the most abundant in zzso zzso experiments with zzso cells demonstrated that those zzso zzso were translated into proteins as zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso into the culture media, and zzso zzso was located mainly on the plasma zzso The three zzso were also detected in primary cultured human zzso and zzso Further, full-length and zzso forms of zzso bound to an zzso column, whereas zzso zzso did zzso The zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor in zzso and of the growth and zzso structure formation of zzso was abolished completely by zzso zzso indicating that this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso against zzso The results may contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis for the diversity of cellular responses to zzso and for individual variations in the zzso to diabetic vascular zzso
