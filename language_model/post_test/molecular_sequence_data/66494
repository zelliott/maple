An zzso zzso zzso zzso fragment, the zzso zzso was fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate a novel optical imaging zzso Native zzso or one of two stabilized zzso zzso zzso was used as the zzso zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso could simultaneously bind to zzso and emit zzso In zzso optical imaging of zzso mice demonstrated specific targeting of zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso at 6 h after intravenous injection, compared with zzso tumors at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and distribution was also evaluated by zzso imaging using zzso and confirmed that the optical signal was due to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso sequences such as engineered zzso can be administered zzso to provide a novel, sensitive method for optical imaging based on expression of cell surface receptors in living zzso
