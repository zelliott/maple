In the biology of a cell, the central role of zzso in controlling functions such as zzso transition (check zzso and DNA damage repair, and as a trigger of zzso is well zzso zzso zzso or other changes in zzso have been reported in numerous tumor types, and in some of these, they are associated with poor zzso In this study, we examined 237 zzso characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso changes in zzso by Southern zzso analysis, by zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso of zzso 5 through 9, and by direct sequencing of zzso zzso to determine the frequency and types of zzso and their clinical zzso In a portion of these (173 zzso we also studied zzso expression by zzso On Southern zzso no gross change was identified in zzso and no zzso was identified in zzso zzso In zzso 5 through 8, 27 different zzso were identified in 25 patients zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso zzso in zzso were identified in 25 of 237 tumors zzso which included 1 of 45 small zzso zzso zzso 2 of 38 zzso small zzso zzso zzso 2 of 35 zzso mixed small zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 of 14 diffuse small zzso zzso zzso 2 of 17 diffuse mixed small- and zzso zzso zzso and 16 of 84 diffuse zzso zzso zzso the difference between the zzso groups was significant zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso patients, 3 of 10 had zzso In 16 patients, the zzso was identified in specimens obtained at zzso zzso of transition type and zzso type occurred at a relative frequency of zzso Thirty percent occurred at zzso zzso sequences and the zzso for zzso was most frequently zzso zzso of 99 tumors with complex zzso zzso but none of 69 tumors with simple zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, 11 of 25 tumors with an zzso of zzso and 8 of 143 tumors with apparently normal zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive correlations were found between a zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso between zzso type zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and between zzso abnormalities and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Twenty-two of 49 patients without zzso and 14 of 17 patients with zzso died zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference in median zzso Similarly, 21 of 26 zzso positive patients died, whereas only 1 of 24 zzso patients died zzso zzso zzso zzso Among zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively associated with a fatal zzso These findings indicate that in zzso zzso changes in zzso were present in diagnostic specimens of all zzso types, but at a higher frequency in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or expression has a negative influence on survival, and therefore can serve as zzso zzso zzso for zzso is an effective way to screen for zzso changes in these zzso
