The zzso upstream and downstream regions of the human zzso The human zzso promoter region was not zzso rich zzso zzso and classical zzso elements were not zzso The ubiquitous zzso and zzso elements were zzso Several zzso elements as well as zzso sites zzso series) were zzso Despite the unique zzso specific expression of zzso classical zzso sites were not detected in the zzso zzso or 3' zzso The ability of the zzso promoter to direct zzso was zzso zzso agents capable of producing zzso stress, such as zzso could induce the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Analysis of three previously reported zzso sites revealed that they represented the most common zzso Surprisingly, the human zzso promoter could direct zzso and respond to zzso stress in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, which is devoid of the ability to bind to a variety of zzso specific zzso This finding suggests that the unique zzso specific expression of zzso may be due to elements in the zzso the zzso zzso region, or to elements existing even farther zzso The ability of zzso to respond zzso to zzso stress is likely to be more zzso relevant than zzso regulation which is dependent upon zzso zzso
