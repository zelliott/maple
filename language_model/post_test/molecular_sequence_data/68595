zzso zzso zzso when grown in batch culture in zzso zzso produces both zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso activity during and after the transition between exponential growth and the stationary zzso From a library of zzso zzso DNA in zzso coli, plasmids were isolated that enabled zzso coli to grow on media with zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso with model zzso classified the product of the cloned gene as an zzso Via deletion analysis, the zzso gene was mapped on a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso This zzso was zzso and found to contain one open reading frame, termed zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this protein shows zzso to a number of zzso zzso most notably to zzso zzso of zzso only partially abolished zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso indicating that zzso forms at least two zzso Both zzso show the same zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity was measured in strains in which a zzso zzso gene was inserted into zzso zzso of zzso expression in these strains also occurred at the end of exponential growth in batch cultures, indicating that production of the zzso is regulated at the genetic zzso
