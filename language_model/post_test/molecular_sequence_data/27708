The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso processing activity responsible for maturation of zzso sequences upon 5 S and 37 S zzso zzso zzso This study describes a difference in the processing of transcripts of an zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso III in zzso zzso extracts prepared from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso extract accumulated additional processing zzso containing zzso sequences as compared to the extract from zzso zzso The structure of these zzso revealed a zzso in removal of the 10 zzso left 3' to the zzso sequence by the zzso P zzso immediately zzso to zzso This is the first demonstration of a zzso zzso affecting maturation of 3' sequences upon a zzso zzso zzso
