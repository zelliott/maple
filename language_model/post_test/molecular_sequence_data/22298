zzso is a zzso zzso specifically by zzso that has been proposed to enhance insulin sensitivity and prevent zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso are recently found in mice which act as receptors for zzso and full-length zzso to mediate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in muscle and zzso The primary goal of this study was to examine zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors and the gene expression pattern in various zzso of pigs of the three zzso zzso hybrid mapping demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located to zzso zzso and zzso in the regions that were zzso to the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso tissue and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso expressed in many zzso except zzso zzso to zzso zzso which was highly expressed in liver, heart, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed at relatively high levels in zzso muscle, zzso and zzso Our data provide basic molecular information useful for the further investigation on the function of the three zzso
