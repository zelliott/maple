A new zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso functional group which can be placed at a position equivalent to the zzso region of zzso This new analog is zzso charged at neutral pH and is similar in size to zzso zzso has been shown to react with bovine liver zzso zzso with an incorporation of 2 zzso of zzso of zzso The modification reaction zzso the zzso to zzso by zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by high zzso of zzso but does not affect the zzso activity of the zzso The rate constant for reaction of zzso with the zzso exhibits a zzso dependence on zzso concentration with zzso zzso 75 zzso The addition to the reaction mixture of zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone results in little decrease in the rate constant, but the combined addition of 5 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or with 10 zzso zzso reduces the reaction rate approximately zzso zzso zzso peptides containing zzso and zzso of which zzso is not critical for the decreased sensitivity of the zzso toward zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso plus 5 zzso zzso protects the zzso against reaction at both zzso and zzso but yields zzso with 1 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso which is modified at an alternate site, zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso protection against modification of zzso but only partial protection against labeling of zzso is zzso In contrast, the presence of 10 zzso zzso + 5 zzso zzso protect only against reaction with zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso at the zzso zzso regulatory site zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine liver zzso zzso which markedly affects the sensitivity of the zzso to zzso zzso The reaction of zzso with zzso is primarily responsible for the altered zzso properties of the zzso
