A zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The structural gene for zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and its zzso sequence and deduced zzso acid sequence showed significant zzso to those of zzso from zzso coli zzso A short open reading frame consisting of 31 zzso acid zzso was found upstream of zzso and it showed some similarity to the zzso coli zzso gene known to be a zzso regulatory element for zzso A partial open reading frame zzso to the zzso end of zzso coli zzso was observed at the zzso region of zzso These genes may thus constitute an zzso as in zzso zzso
