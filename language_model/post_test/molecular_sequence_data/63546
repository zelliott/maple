zzso inactive copies of zzso elements of the zzso zzso have been described in zzso We reconstructed components of the zzso zzso in zzso including a zzso and a second, zzso protein that has a zzso zzso zzso The reconstructed zzso zzso shows efficient zzso zzso in human cells and zzso zzso into a zzso consensus target zzso The zzso protein is required for zzso and physically interacts with the zzso region of the zzso via its zzso zzso The zzso protein enables zzso in part by promoting nuclear import of the zzso by directly binding to zzso regions of the zzso and by recruiting the zzso to the zzso zzso We investigated the functions of two zzso human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contains a zzso motif similar to that described in the zzso zzso Physical interaction, zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso and zzso suggest strong functional zzso between the zzso system and their zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso will serve as a useful experimental system for zzso biology and for investigating the zzso functions of zzso zzso cellular zzso
