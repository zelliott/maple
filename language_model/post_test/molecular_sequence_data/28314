zzso factors zzso are small zzso zzso proteins that enhance the zzso activities of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from a human zzso zzso Based on deduced zzso acid sequences and patterns of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso brain zzso zzso human zzso is the zzso of bovine zzso Human zzso which differs from bovine zzso and bovine zzso appears to represent a newly identified third type of zzso zzso patterns of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso are consistent with the presence of at least two, and perhaps four, separate zzso messages in human zzso In zzso translation of zzso zzso and zzso produced proteins that zzso by zzso similar to a zzso soluble brain zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of human zzso and zzso contain regions, similar to those in other G zzso that are believed to be involved in zzso binding and zzso zzso also exhibit a modest degree of zzso with a bovine zzso zzso The observations reported here support the conclusion that the zzso are members of a zzso family of small zzso zzso zzso Definition of the regulation of zzso zzso and of zzso of zzso zzso proteins will aid in the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso
