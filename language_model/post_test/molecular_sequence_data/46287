The effects of zzso zzso resulting from increased carbon loads or decreased dissolved oxygen zzso on nitrogen cycling in zzso environments is poorly zzso The important role played by bacterial and zzso zzso zzso in the eventual removal of nitrogen from zzso environments is likely to be strongly affected by hypoxic zzso In this study, an analysis of the effects of different levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed in a microcosm zzso Changes in the zzso zzso related to zzso at zzso DO were observed after 4 zzso zzso of the key zzso gene ammonium zzso zzso in both DNA and zzso extracts suggests that bacterial zzso zzso was reduced at both of the lower DO zzso while changes in DO had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso There was no change in the diversity of expressed zzso zzso but significant change in bacterial zzso zzso diversity, indicative of low- and zzso zzso This study suggests that groups of zzso zzso demonstrate differential responses to changes in zzso zzso which may be a significant factor in niche zzso of different zzso zzso zzso
