zzso zzso are large respiratory proteins that are composed of up to 48 zzso (8 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso reconstruction of the 1 zzso zzso zzso from the European zzso lobster zzso zzso has been performed from zzso single particles using zzso zzso An zzso resolution of the zzso zzso reconstruction has been obtained from about 600 final class zzso zzso of structural elements such as zzso has been zzso An zzso acid sequence alignment shows the high sequence identity zzso of the zzso zzso from the European zzso lobster zzso and the American zzso lobster zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso electron zzso zzso density map with the known zzso X-ray structure shows a close structural zzso demonstrating the reliability of both methods for reconstructing zzso By molecular zzso we have found the putative locations for the zzso acid sequence zzso and the zzso end zzso which are absent in the available zzso X-ray zzso
