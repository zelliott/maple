Two calcium binding sites, separated by about zzso present in the zzso that connect the zzso of zzso domain contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to bind in regions, which are marginally different zzso to the disparity in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso analysis on the zzso of zzso implementing the zzso chain model, explains that the zzso zzso is well suited to accommodate calcium binding zzso The large buried side chain area of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and comparatively smaller fraction of side chain exposed to polar atoms corroborate the calcium induced higher affinity to zzso zzso However, zzso lying in close proximity of the calcium binding sites is expected to have considerable PC affinity but negligible calcium induced effect on PC zzso
