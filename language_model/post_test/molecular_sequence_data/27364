The zzso Toll zzso does not interact directly with microbial zzso but is instead activated by a zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso During the immune response, zzso is processed by complex zzso of zzso zzso which are activated by zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the essential role of zzso a modular zzso zzso in the zzso of the Toll zzso by zzso bacteria and zzso Our analysis shows that zzso zzso signals originating from the circulating recognition molecules zzso and zzso and connects them to the zzso zzso zzso upstream of the Toll zzso It also reveals the zzso role of modular zzso zzso in the zzso of insect immune zzso
