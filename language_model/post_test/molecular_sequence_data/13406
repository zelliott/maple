zzso zzso gene 13 zzso exhibits 57% identity with the predicted sequence of a T zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso factor zzso B activity and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso T cell zzso An zzso fusion protein was used to isolate a zzso zzso a novel zzso that also binds zzso This zzso is unrelated to previously identified zzso zzso zzso A zzso soluble zzso inhibited T cell proliferation and zzso production induced by zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso These results define zzso and zzso as novel zzso that bind to a novel zzso zzso We propose to call these molecules zzso zzso and zzso zzso
