The zzso of zzso coli strains zzso and zzso which express S zzso zzso by a zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso gene zzso respectively, were characterized with regard to the detailed structural requirements of their binding to zzso on zzso and zzso From binding and binding zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso with isolated S zzso several major conclusions can be zzso S zzso bind specifically to zzso acid on zzso The most active structural zzso of zzso acid on zzso zzso is zzso acid zzso In contrast to previous reports, high binding activities were measured also for zzso zzso expressing zzso alpha zzso In agreement with earlier studies, the site of zzso acid substitution to zzso zzso strongly influences the binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid is only poorly recognized by the zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups form essential structural elements of zzso acid in the binding zzso
