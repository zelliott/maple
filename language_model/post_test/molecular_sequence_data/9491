zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene was used to study bacterial diversity of a pristine forest soil and of two cultures of the same soil enriched with zzso zzso Our analysis revealed high bacterial diversity in the native soil sample, zzso at least 10 zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso accounted for more than zzso of all zzso In both enriched samples, members of zzso were the most frequently zzso The majority of bacterial zzso in both enriched samples were identified as zzso and zzso but members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso In addition, it was possible to identify zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which indicates that this zzso could be an attractive source for study of novel zzso for cellulose zzso
