The zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso This zzso possesses an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain displayed an activity profile typical of an zzso with high zzso activity on zzso cellulose and barley zzso zzso of zzso and the formerly characterized zzso 2 zzso from zzso zzso with zzso prepared against each of the zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso This data in conjunction with evidence that the proteins are the same size, share a zzso internal zzso acid zzso possess similar zzso properties, and both bind to cellulose allows the conclusion that zzso codes for zzso
