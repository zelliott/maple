The zzso zzso group genes are involved in zzso zzso and they are zzso from zzso to zzso We have cloned a novel human zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso and human zzso Human zzso zzso shares high zzso with human zzso zzso in the central region containing the zzso motifs characteristic of the zzso family of zzso but the zzso domain is less zzso In zzso another zzso zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso shares zzso with that of zzso suggesting that zzso may be the human counterpart of zzso We zzso the zzso and zzso proteins from zzso insect cells and examined their zzso zzso zzso like zzso is a zzso protein and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso DNA, though its rate of zzso zzso is lower than that of zzso Human zzso interacts with zzso and enhances its zzso zzso In contrast, neither human zzso nor zzso directly interacts with zzso Although zzso is the putative counterpart of zzso our findings suggest that zzso behaves differently from zzso
