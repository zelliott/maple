Members of the family zzso are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species zzso only a few zzso zzso have been identified from avian zzso This study reports the zzso detection and complete zzso characterization of a novel turkey zzso from zzso samples collected from eight turkey farms in zzso Using zzso both healthy zzso of three) and affected zzso of zzso commercial zzso with enteric and/or zzso syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven zzso of the eight zzso The viral zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a high degree of zzso acid sequence identity zzso to the partial zzso zzso region of a zzso reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same zzso In the zzso and zzso regions, zzso is related most closely to, but distinct from, the zzso and zzso zzso Complete zzso analysis revealed the presence of characteristic zzso zzso acid zzso a potential type zzso zzso zzso internal zzso entry site zzso identified among zzso zzso and a zzso 48 zzso long zzso structure found at the 3' zzso of zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The general presence of turkey zzso - a novel zzso species - in zzso samples from healthy and affected zzso in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey zzso Further studies are needed to investigate the zzso role and zzso potential of this zzso in food zzso
