In chicken, zzso zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso is one of the key zzso participating in the zzso of avian influenza virus zzso zzso about zzso III could increase our understanding of its function in the occurrence and development of avian zzso To date, no detailed data have been published about the expression pattern and zzso distribution of zzso III in zzso This paper presents data on the zzso zzso zzso expression pattern and zzso distribution of zzso III protein in yellow chicken for the first zzso The results show that the zzso zzso of zzso III among yellow chicken and zzso chicken, zzso humans, zzso zzso rat and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The relative expression level of zzso III in the heart, kidney and brain of yellow chicken was significantly higher than in other zzso examined for zzso level zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso III in the heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was determined by zzso zzso using rabbit zzso zzso III zzso prepared by zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso cells in the immune zzso proved to be positive, which may suggest that these cells are important immune cells playing a role in influenza virus zzso The results of this study provide basic data for further research on the functions of zzso III in zzso
