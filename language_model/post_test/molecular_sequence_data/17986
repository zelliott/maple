The promoter of the zzso zzso gene belonging to the class II zzso is highly zzso to other class II zzso genes except for a zzso zzso zzso in front of the putative zzso start zzso The zzso is characterized by structural features resembling a zzso element such as an 11 zzso zzso repeat at the zzso and an 8 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Despite the high zzso to active zzso zzso fusion of its promoter to the zzso reporter gene does not lead to zzso zzso zzso activity in transgenic potato or tobacco plants, suggesting that the zzso of this gene might be caused by the zzso of the zzso like zzso
