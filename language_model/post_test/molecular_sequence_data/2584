zzso is a zzso of zzso virus, which in contrast to zzso is able to replicate in Aedes zzso zzso cells deprived of zzso We have obtained evidence that the basis of this low zzso zzso zzso is the generation of an altered zzso zzso with an increased affinity for zzso zzso zzso We now report that following the substitution of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso for the corresponding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso can be transcribed from this zzso we were able to generate zzso zzso virus zzso with the zzso zzso zzso virus derived from zzso zzso like zzso lacks the zzso zzso As was the case with zzso zzso not only possessed the zzso zzso but also showed an increased sensitivity to zzso A, a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region from zzso revealed two zzso these zzso occurred in adjacent zzso and lead to two predicted zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso zzso at zzso 87, from zzso to zzso and at zzso 88 from zzso to zzso Since the zzso sequence zzso lies entirely within the gene for zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso activity generated by zzso is associated with zzso We suggest that zzso 87 and 88 in zzso where the zzso acid changes in zzso zzso have occurred, are at or near the binding site for ado zzso we also suggest that these changes in zzso are responsible for the increased affinity of the zzso zzso zzso for ado met and thereby for the zzso zzso zzso it is possible that the binding site for ado met is elsewhere on zzso or even on another zzso and that the changes at zzso 87 and 88 lead to an zzso of the binding zzso
