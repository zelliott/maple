zzso plasticity induced by cocaine and other drugs zzso zzso Here we zzso molecular events at zzso that cause this plasticity and the resulting behavioral response to cocaine in zzso In response to zzso signaling that is induced by drug administration, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso which we show zzso zzso zzso of zzso in instances where the product of an zzso zzso zzso is present to enable zzso zzso These zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso currents that zzso synaptic plasticity and zzso motor zzso as tested in mice with relevant zzso The findings zzso how a coincidence of signals from the nucleus and the zzso can render zzso accessible to zzso with consequences for drug-induced zzso responses and point to zzso at zzso zzso as a possible therapeutic target for treating zzso
