The complete sequence of the medium zzso segment of zzso Valley virus zzso a human zzso has been determined using a series of overlapping zzso zzso The viral zzso zzso is comprised of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso precursor of zzso zzso zzso starting at zzso at bases zzso to a zzso stop zzso at bases zzso This zzso sequence is arranged as zzso The base composition of the segment is zzso A, zzso C, zzso G and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence to the zzso zzso virus sequence shows an identity of zzso indicating several differences exist within the individual coding regions, most notably within the zzso and zzso coding zzso Based on two presumed zzso points within the zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids long, and has two sites of potential zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is 175 zzso zzso while the largest zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso and has five potential zzso sites, two of which appear to be unique to zzso The subsequent study of these zzso sites and potential differences between the sequence of this zzso zzso strain and other geographic zzso may suggest the means for improving detection of human infections as well as mapping differences in zzso zzso and other aspects of zzso
