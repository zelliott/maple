We have shown recently that zzso has tumor zzso activity and that it is zzso silenced in zzso of lung and breast zzso In this study, we have analyzed the zzso status of zzso in primary zzso zzso and matching normal zzso zzso zzso promoter region zzso was found in 23 zzso of 32 primary zzso zzso In contrast, normal zzso zzso from the same patients exhibited significantly lower levels of zzso promoter region zzso zzso zzso was reversed and expression restored by treating zzso tumor cell lines with the zzso agent zzso Loss of zzso at zzso marker, which maps within 100 zzso of the zzso zzso was observed in zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso was also independent of the presence of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso diminished the ability to form colonies in two zzso tumor cell zzso In addition, zzso medium from zzso zzso cells reduced cell growth and induced zzso in zzso zzso tumor cell zzso In conclusion, zzso is an excellent candidate tumor zzso gene for zzso zzso
