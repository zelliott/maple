zzso are specialized cellular structures in the zzso of aerial plant zzso that control gas exchange zzso release and zzso zzso between leaves and the atmosphere by modulating the zzso of a pore flanked by two guard zzso zzso are zzso distributed, and their density is controlled by zzso and environmental zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso distribution, zzso zzso zzso with altered zzso characteristics were isolated and zzso The zzso zzso exhibits a two- to fourfold increase of zzso density and formation of clustered zzso zzso zzso that are not separated by intervening pavement zzso whereas the internal leaf architecture is not zzso The zzso gene was identified by zzso zzso It encodes a zzso zzso zzso related to zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as a processing zzso involved in the mediation of a signal that controls the development of cell lineages that lead to guard cell zzso
