We isolated three zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso for zzso proteins of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso The insert in zzso included the entire zzso sequence of the insert in zzso that was separated into four parts by three zzso zzso and it might zzso to the zzso for a precursor to the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited about 70 to zzso zzso to plant zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by one or a few genes within the zzso zzso while zzso was zzso by several zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes was compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was detected in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso was most abundant in male zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was detected in zzso and roots of both male and female zzso The level of the zzso zzso in the leaves increased about zzso after 1 h of heat stress while the expression of zzso zzso reached a maximum level after 6 zzso However, the extent of induction of zzso zzso was quite zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso in the leaves increased about zzso and zzso respectively, after 24 h of treatment with 100 zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso genes showed differential expression patterns in a variety of zzso and in response to different environmental zzso
