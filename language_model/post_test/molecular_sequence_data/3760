To investigate the role of the zzso during repair of DNA damage in zzso we screened for zzso zzso zzso that were sensitive to zzso zzso We have isolated a new zzso zzso that shows preferential sensitivity to zzso There is no zzso difference in bulk zzso structure or in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest a specific effect of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso DNA repair processes rather than a global effect on zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso sensitivity of double zzso that contained the zzso zzso and zzso in genes from each of the three zzso groups of zzso zzso The zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell killing in zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso which are defective in zzso DNA repair zzso When combined with other zzso that affect zzso the zzso zzso increased the zzso sensitivity of strains with defects in either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso branches of zzso but did not enhance the zzso sensitivity of a strain with a zzso zzso When combined with a zzso zzso which is also zzso with zzso the zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso acts in a novel zzso branch of zzso
