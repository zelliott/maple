To investigate the genetic characteristics of the Korean zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso we determined the complete sequence of the zzso protein gene zzso from 105 zzso zzso from all nine Korean zzso during the years 2003 through zzso These sequences were then analyzed along with the published zzso sequences for two Korean zzso viruses zzso and zzso and 36 zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence identities among the 107 Korean zzso viruses ranged from zzso to zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso All of the Korean zzso examined belonged to the North American zzso The zzso gene sequence from the North American zzso virus zzso and its derived vaccine virus zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical to the various zzso sequences of the Korean zzso with corresponding zzso acid identities from zzso to zzso In the zzso tree obtained by zzso analysis, all of the Korean zzso were divided into four zzso Our zzso sequence data also revealed no correlations between the date or place of collection and the distribution of zzso in zzso North American zzso zzso may have been introduced into Korean zzso zzso some time ago; these viruses apparently radiated nationwide within a relatively short period of zzso Within the North American zzso zzso from around the world, the Korean zzso did not emerge as a single independent zzso overall, and their immediate relationships with the zzso from other countries could not be zzso
