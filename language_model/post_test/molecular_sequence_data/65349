Small interfering zzso zzso and zzso zzso guide zzso zzso zzso of fully or nearly fully complementary target zzso or control translation and/or stability of many zzso that share zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes are assembled from zzso zzso to zzso zzso III processing zzso that carry zzso zzso and zzso zzso with free 3' zzso zzso Despite the structural symmetry of a duplex zzso the zzso sequence asymmetry can generate a bias for preferred loading of one of the two zzso strands into the zzso zzso complex zzso Here we show that the zzso status of the zzso strands also acts as an important zzso for strand zzso zzso zzso duplexes zzso to zzso zzso were examined for their biases in zzso strand zzso zzso single zzso of zzso duplexes reduced the occupancy of the zzso complex by the zzso strand with zzso elimination of its zzso signature and enhanced zzso signature of the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso strands reduced but did not completely abolish zzso zzso without affecting strand selection relative to that of the unmodified zzso We conclude that zzso zzso modification of zzso duplexes can be useful for controlling targeting zzso
