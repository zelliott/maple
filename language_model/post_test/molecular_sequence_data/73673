The expression of fast zzso heavy chain zzso genes was examined in zzso during fast skeletal muscle development in the zzso White zzso chicken zzso zzso and in adult muscles from the genetically related zzso White zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and northern zzso was employed to monitor zzso transcript levels utilizing specific zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso gene expression in the zzso major zzso and the zzso muscles was similar during embryonic development with three embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso expression patterns in each muscle zzso The expression of zzso genes was also studied in muscle cell cultures derived from zzso embryonic zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso however, little if any zzso zzso gene expression could be zzso even though zzso was the zzso zzso gene expressed during late embryonic development in zzso In most adult muscles other than the PM and anterior zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene was the major adult zzso zzso In addition, two general patterns of expression were identified in fast zzso The fast muscles of the leg expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while other fast muscles expressed adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in adult zzso muscles was found to reflect the expression patterns found in corresponding normal muscles during the zzso or early zzso zzso period, providing additional evidence that avian muscular zzso zzso muscle zzso
