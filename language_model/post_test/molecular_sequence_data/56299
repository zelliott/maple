A zzso zzso the human zzso of mouse zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from an zzso 1 zzso human zzso zzso library by zzso zzso using the mouse zzso zzso as a zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso clone zzso human zzso predicts a zzso protein with a zzso domain that contains the consensus sequences zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso motif zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of other zzso zzso zzso is altered to zzso in human zzso In addition, a number of other changes were found in the zzso binding site zzso I and zzso and the motif zzso found in zzso zzso zzso of the human and mouse zzso sequences shows a zzso conservation at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso There was no significant zzso between the zzso domain of zzso and the other families of zzso zzso zzso described to zzso zzso therefore appears to define a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso whose structure has remained highly zzso across zzso
