The zzso sequence of Korean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been completed zzso The circular zzso DNA, which consists of zzso zzso contains a pair of zzso repeat regions zzso and zzso with zzso zzso each, which are separated by small and large single copy regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso repeat region is further extended into a large single copy region which includes the zzso parts of the zzso zzso Four short zzso associated with short zzso sequences that form zzso structures were also observed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared to that of zzso zzso The zzso content and the relative positions of 114 genes (75 zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and 5 zzso open reading frames zzso however, are identical with the zzso DNA of zzso zzso Sixteen genes contain one zzso while two genes have two zzso Of these zzso only one zzso belongs to the zzso group zzso all remaining zzso have the characteristics of six zzso belonging to group zzso zzso simple sequence repeats have been identified from the zzso zzso of Korean zzso Several of these zzso zzso show zzso zzso A detailed comparison of 17 known completed zzso zzso from the vascular plants allowed the identification of evolutionary modes of coding segments and zzso zzso as well as the evaluation of the zzso utilities of zzso zzso Furthermore, through the detailed comparisons of several zzso zzso evolutionary hotspots predominated by the inversion end points, zzso zzso events, and high zzso of base zzso were zzso zzso zzso were often associated with direct repeats at the end of the sequences zzso zzso zzso
