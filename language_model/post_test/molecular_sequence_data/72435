We have isolated and investigated an zzso A zzso zzso which is an intrinsic protein of the zzso brush border membrane of adult but not of zzso zzso This zzso had been referred to previously as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence shows four extensive, zzso repeats between the signal sequence and a zzso stretch in the zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso single zzso site and indicate that this zzso is likely to operate by way of a zzso zzso This zzso A is zzso as a single zzso chain of zzso zzso agreeing well with the size deduced from its zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it zzso (at least) zzso Once it has reached the brush border zzso it is subjected in zzso to two types of zzso processing, presumably by pancreatic zzso a split after zzso with loss of the first zzso zzso and two or more zzso much farther downstream but still located in the zzso bulk of the zzso these splits lead to multiple bands of approximately zzso zzso 100, and 90 zzso
