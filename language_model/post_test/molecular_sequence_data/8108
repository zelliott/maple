zzso V of zzso T4 possesses two zzso activities, a DNA zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and an associated zzso (AP) zzso zzso structural and functional studies of zzso V have revealed that specific zzso acids are associated with these two zzso zzso still exists regarding the role of the aromatic zzso acid stretch close to the zzso zzso in particular the zzso at position zzso We have expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso V in zzso coli from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V demonstrated substantially decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso activities in zzso compared to the zzso zzso when a zzso zzso zzso was zzso However, a much smaller difference in zzso zzso activity between the two forms was observed with a zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso activity was zzso but not zzso reflected in the survival of zzso bacteria, that is the zzso cells were slightly less zzso resistant than zzso zzso No difference was observed in the zzso of zzso repair using zzso zzso T4 zzso A more pronounced difference between the zzso and zzso proteins was observed in human zzso zzso group A cells by zzso zzso of a zzso reporter zzso The relatively large zzso between the in zzso and in zzso results observed with bacteria may be because saturated levels of DNA repair are obtained in zzso with relatively low levels of zzso zzso However, under limiting in zzso conditions and in human cells in zzso a considerable difference between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso V activities can be zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is important for zzso V zzso
