The zzso zzso region of the period gene zzso in zzso was compared in the eight species of the zzso zzso zzso This region can be divided into a zzso zzso segment which is flanked by more zzso zzso The number of zzso acids zzso in the zzso region ranges from 40 in zzso zzso to 69 in zzso zzso This is similar to the range found within natural populations of zzso zzso It was possible to derive a zzso zzso of one species from that of another by zzso hypothetical zzso zzso A zzso based on the more zzso zzso sequences was zzso The results highlighted some of the problems which are encountered when highly zzso genes are used to zzso zzso of closely related zzso
