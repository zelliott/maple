zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli is regulated by an unusual, complex system which consists of an zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in addition to the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso are predicted to possess 119 (Mr zzso zzso and zzso (Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as deduced from the zzso sequences of their structural zzso Both of the genes zzso the two regulators are located downstream from the other known gut structural zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that the zzso gene is a zzso constituent of the gut zzso The zzso gene has its own promoter, but expression of this gene is primarily due to zzso from the gut zzso zzso Thus, the gut zzso consists of at least five structural genes and has the following gene order: zzso Interestingly, synthesis of the zzso which zzso at the promoter specific to the zzso zzso occurs within the zzso zzso zzso control of the gut zzso appears to occur as a consequence of the zzso action of the products of the zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso An additional zzso of the gut zzso of unknown function, may follow the zzso zzso
