Previously, we identified two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene in patients with zzso These zzso are associated with a profound decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a patient with zzso who is zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso activities: it acts as a zzso and a zzso zzso and is responsible for adding repeated zzso units to growing zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso These zzso and cells expressing them were then zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso protein retained approximately 50% of each zzso activity relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso terminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso did not facilitate the zzso of zzso zzso chains when zzso zzso that consists of the zzso zzso zzso protein was used as the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso in a patient with zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso activity and the zzso protein was defective in regulating the number of zzso zzso chains via zzso zzso Thus, the progression of peripheral zzso may result from defects in these regulatory zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso chains may be tightly regulated by the cooperative expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in peripheral zzso and peripheral zzso may result from synthesis of zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso
