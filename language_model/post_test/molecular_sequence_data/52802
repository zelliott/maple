Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso response element zzso in its zzso promoter zzso We undertook the current studies to determine whether elements in the zzso promoter other than the ARE mediate zzso zzso We found that deletion of the ARE did not completely abolish the promoter responsiveness to zzso suggesting that additional zzso elements within the zzso core promoter may also be involved in zzso zzso The zzso core promoter is zzso and contains six binding sites for zzso factor zzso We determined whether one or more of these zzso sites mediate zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso To do so, we used a transient zzso zzso with zzso zzso reporter zzso The reporter activity of a construct lacking the ARE but containing all six zzso sites was induced approximately zzso by zzso zzso of zzso nearly eliminated zzso promoter activity as well as zzso zzso whereas deletion of zzso and zzso sites and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso sites had relatively little zzso We also used the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso interact with one zzso The current studies suggest a model in which zzso and zzso factor zzso not only bind to their respective consensus sites within the zzso promoter, but also complex with one another, thereby recruiting zzso and general zzso factors and inducing zzso zzso
