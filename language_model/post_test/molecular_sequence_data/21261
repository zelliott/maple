zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso making it an zzso key species and of particular importance in understanding zzso evolution, zzso and plasticity in the zzso zzso zzso is a commercially available, zzso host for the zzso production of several zzso including vitamin zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the analysis of the first complete zzso sequences of two important zzso zzso zzso the zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso which harbors seven indigenous zzso The zzso zzso carries approximately zzso zzso while zzso zzso plasmids represent a combined zzso zzso and 523 zzso one of the largest zzso zzso zzso in a single bacterial zzso We have documented extensive gene transfer between the plasmids and the zzso Each strain carries roughly 300 zzso zzso genes that account for differences in their zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso vitamin zzso through an zzso zzso pathway, which together with other key energetic and zzso pathways has now been fully zzso Other novel genes include a second zzso zzso which may be responsible for the large cell size of members of this species, as well as genes for gas zzso a second zzso zzso and most but not all of the genes needed for genetic zzso Comprehensive analyses of the global zzso gene pool showed that only an zzso region around the origin of replication was zzso across the zzso This appears to be a characteristic feature of the zzso zzso zzso architecture and may be key to their zzso zzso
