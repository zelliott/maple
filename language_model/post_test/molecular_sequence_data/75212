Four zzso zzso were isolated from the highly variegated zzso zzso in which the zzso element zzso is integrated in the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that in all four lines the zzso element was deleted together with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In one case the zzso box of the zzso gene was removed resulting in extremely low expression of the zzso and initiation of zzso occurring at a new zzso The other three deletions defined a sequence motif zzso which is apparently required for zzso gene zzso Thus zzso elements seem to be useful for probing gene structure, in this case the signal structure in the promoter region, by virtue of imprecise zzso
