In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso resistance level, although the degree of reduction varied from strain to zzso To study the responses of zzso strains to zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain that became more susceptible to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso back to the parent strain, other zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso All zzso of zzso strains had reduced levels of resistance to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso while those of zzso did zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also had reduced levels of resistance in the absence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of the zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso and testing of zzso cells for their zzso to several zzso zzso showed that there were no significant differences between the parents and the respective zzso zzso The zzso zzso site mapped at a location different from the previously identified zzso and zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing showed that zzso had inserted at the zzso region of a novel gene designated zzso The putative zzso protein showed a zzso pattern similar to that of zzso zzso zzso proteins and contained two of the three zzso motifs shared by zzso proteins and zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in cell wall zzso
