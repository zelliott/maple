The zzso sites of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso from zzso zzso were studied in zzso and in zzso by using zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The three zzso zzso the last zzso zzso located in a highly zzso zzso end of the zzso zzso This was established by two-dimensional analysis of zzso zzso from zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso and by kinetic studies of the protein zzso with synthetic peptides corresponding to the fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso In experiments with both zzso P proteins and synthetic peptides as zzso protein zzso zzso demonstrated unusual zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso predominantly two of the four P zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso with kinetic zzso dependent on the primary structure of the zzso region of the zzso containing the target zzso The neutral zzso acid, zzso at position 3 in the zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso beta and zzso zzso decreases the zzso value more than zzso by comparison with the basic zzso zzso at the same position in the zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso alpha and zzso zzso
