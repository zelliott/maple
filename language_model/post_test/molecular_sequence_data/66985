The rapid assessment of protein zzso is essential for evaluating expressed proteins and protein zzso for use as zzso for downstream zzso zzso screens based on zzso blots are complex and have limited screening zzso zzso zzso screens using split zzso in zzso and in zzso can zzso protein zzso zzso zzso used for monitoring protein interactions folds poorly, and to overcome this zzso we recently developed a zzso system based on zzso split zzso derived from an exceptionally well folded zzso of zzso termed zzso zzso Here we present the zzso procedure of the zzso zzso using split zzso A zzso zzso fragment, zzso 11, is fused to a test zzso The zzso zzso detector zzso is expressed zzso These fragments associate spontaneously to form fluorescent zzso The fragments are zzso and the zzso 11 tag has minimal effect on protein zzso and zzso We describe zzso protein zzso screens amenable both for in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso system is composed of two zzso used in the same zzso zzso zzso 11 and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso Note zzso The gene zzso the protein of interest is cloned into the zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso in an zzso zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso cells containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also describe how this system can be used for selecting soluble proteins from a library of zzso zzso zzso The large screening power of the in zzso zzso combined with the high accuracy of the in zzso zzso point to the efficiency of this zzso zzso tool for identifying soluble clones suitable for zzso and downstream zzso
