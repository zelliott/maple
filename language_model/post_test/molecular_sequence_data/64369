A zzso gene zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso strain zzso (which zzso organic zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The cloned sequence includes an zzso consisting of 945 zzso zzso a protein of 315 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso belongs to the class of zzso zzso the zzso zzso consists of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The gene cloned in the present study does not zzso the zzso zzso a previously isolated zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso because the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso differs from that of the zzso zzso Although the effects of pH on the activity and stability of the zzso zzso and the temperature optimum of the zzso were similar to those of the zzso zzso the relative activity of the zzso zzso at lower temperatures zzso degrees zzso was higher than that of the zzso zzso In the absence of organic zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso However, in the presence of most of the organic zzso tested in this study (the exceptions were zzso zzso and zzso the stability of the zzso zzso was lower than that of the zzso zzso
