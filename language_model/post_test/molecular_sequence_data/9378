Most clinical studies suggest that the prevalence and severity of liver zzso are higher in patients infected with zzso C virus zzso zzso 3 than in patients infected with other zzso This may reflect the diversity and specific intrinsic properties of zzso 3 virus zzso We analyzed the possible association of particular zzso of the zzso core and zzso proteins known to zzso zzso metabolism with zzso severity in the zzso of patients chronically infected with zzso We used transmission electron zzso to zzso liver zzso precisely in a group of 27 patients, 12 of whom were infected with a zzso 3 virus, the other 15 being infected with viruses of other zzso We determined the area covered by zzso droplets in liver zzso and analyzed the diversity of the core and zzso regions zzso by the viral zzso circulating in these zzso The area covered by zzso droplets did not differ significantly between patients infected with zzso 3 viruses and those infected with other zzso The core and zzso protein sequences of the viral zzso circulating in patients with mild or severe zzso were evenly distributed throughout the zzso trees established from all the collected zzso Thus, individual host factors seem to play a much greater role than viral factors in the development of severe zzso in patients chronically infected with zzso including those infected with zzso 3 zzso
