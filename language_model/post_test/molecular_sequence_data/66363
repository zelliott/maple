zzso contamination is an important constraint to peanut zzso zzso zzso ) industry zzso zzso improvement for host resistance in peanut to zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso production is among the approaches for integrated management of the zzso However, the progress in peanut breeding for resistance to zzso is slow due to various reasons, among which, lack of cost-effective method for resistance identification in breeding materials or segregating zzso has been encountered in most breeding zzso Hence there is a need to develop a rapid and reliable screening method for selecting zzso zzso infection resistance in zzso Here we report a zzso zzso characterized zzso zzso marker zzso converted from zzso zzso zzso length zzso marker zzso which closely linked with resistance to zzso zzso zzso Twenty peanut zzso with resistance to infection of zzso zzso were used to verify the reliability of the resistance zzso and high correlation between the molecular markers and the resistance zzso The result shows that the potential of the markers which can be used in other resistant peanut zzso to seed infection by zzso zzso
