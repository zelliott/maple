zzso zzso zzso DNA using a zzso zzso The zzso sites are zzso they recognize different families of zzso zzso A unique zzso site that is resistant to zzso resides in zzso zzso zzso zzso can be activated to cleave this site by small DNA fragments containing one or more zzso zzso These zzso are not practical for genetic engineering because zzso zzso that are consumed during the zzso of zzso give ends that may interfere with subsequent zzso We show that a DNA zzso containing zzso linkages at the zzso zzso bonds zzso is not zzso by zzso even though this zzso binds to the zzso zzso The zzso activates zzso to cleave zzso DNA under conditions that completely exhaust zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is not coupled to zzso of zzso that zzso reverts to its inactive state soon after zzso of the zzso complex, and that zzso makes for a zzso zzso during prolonged zzso
