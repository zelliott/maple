A 24 zzso zzso protein zzso was previously reported from the zzso of the Caribbean fruit fly, zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study was designed to sequence the open reading frame of zzso and to determine whether it is zzso by the zzso fruit fly host or by the zzso zzso which is normally injected into the host with the zzso zzso zzso an existing partial zzso acid sequence of zzso we obtained two zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction, from the host zzso 48 h post zzso The smaller zzso has an open reading frame zzso that encodes 85 zzso acids zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da and the larger encodes zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Both zzso share a common zzso with a signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso a characteristic that agrees with the observed nature of zzso The mature proteins have 39 and 157 zzso with deduced molecular masses of zzso Da and zzso zzso zzso Western blots of host zzso zzso with the zzso serum reveal proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the deduced and the observed molecular masses may be explained by their predicted zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences are not zzso with any protein in the available zzso Southern zzso zzso experiments revealed that the proteins are zzso by both the host and the zzso Furthermore, injection of zzso into healthy fruit fly zzso zzso the two zzso Thus, in surprising contrast to an earlier hypothesis that zzso encodes zzso these results clearly demonstrate that the zzso proteins are zzso by zzso and fruit fly but not zzso zzso However, their expression is zzso zzso
