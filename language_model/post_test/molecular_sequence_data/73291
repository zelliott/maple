The bovine zzso zzso factor was isolated from a zzso library and sequences for the zzso in addition to zzso zzso of zzso and 432 zzso of 3' zzso were obtained and compared with other zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Comparisons indicated zzso acid zzso ranging from zzso to zzso with the human and mouse zzso zzso Analysis of 500 zzso of zzso regulatory regions indicated zzso ranging from zzso to zzso with the corresponding human and sheep zzso zzso Additionally, bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared, and a panel of bovine zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso Data indicated zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor with zzso zzso 2 located on bovine zzso 17, and zzso of zzso with zzso basic protein situated on bovine zzso zzso Southern analysis of selected hybrids confirmed the zzso results, thus zzso assigning the bovine zzso zzso factor gene to zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed a zzso in zzso 2 of the bovine zzso zzso zzso Analysis of this region by zzso in 22 unrelated zzso zzso and 19 unrelated zzso zzso cattle detected nine different zzso zzso information content values were zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the same zzso zzso factor zzso successfully detected zzso zzso at this locus in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso
