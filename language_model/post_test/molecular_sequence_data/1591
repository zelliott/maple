zzso zzso liver zzso with zzso complications is an emerging infectious disease in zzso To identify genes associated with liver infection, we used a DNA zzso to compare the zzso profiles of three strains causing liver zzso and three strains not associated with liver zzso There were 13 clones that showed higher zzso expression levels in the three liver infection zzso and 3 of these 13 clones contained a region that was absent in zzso zzso zzso of the clones revealed the replacement of 149 zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso in a liver infection strain, zzso This zzso zzso contained 19 open reading zzso 14 of which were proven to be associated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed a significant decrease of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso mice, and the prevalence of this zzso region was significantly higher in strains associated with liver zzso than in those that were not (19 or 32 versus 2 of zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region may play a role in zzso zzso liver infection and serve as a marker for rapid zzso
