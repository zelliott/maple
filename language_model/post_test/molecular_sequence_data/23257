Earlier work demonstrated that a zzso zzso bundle protein designed with a cavity in its zzso core is capable of binding the volatile zzso zzso with zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso To create a more relevant, model membrane protein zzso for studying the zzso specificity of zzso zzso we have zzso a new protein that builds on the zzso zzso zzso bundle and incorporates a zzso domain capable of zzso activity, resulting in an zzso zzso bundle that forms stable zzso at the zzso zzso The affinity of the cavity within the core of the bundle for volatile zzso binding is decreased by a factor of zzso zzso zzso as compared to its zzso zzso Nevertheless, the absence of the cavity within the otherwise identical zzso zzso significantly decreases its affinity for zzso similar to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso at higher surface pressure with its long axis perpendicular to the zzso and that it possesses a length consistent with its zzso This provides a successful starting template for probing the nature of the zzso interaction, as well as a potential model system in zzso correlation for understanding the zzso binding zzso
