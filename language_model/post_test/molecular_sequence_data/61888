We report a discovery that, of the 226 zzso zzso zzso genes on human zzso 19, 12 genes each have two open reading frames zzso that are in different reading frames but that can be translated into the same type of zzso zzso We came to this observation after using standard tools in an original zzso First, we found that the both zzso of such a gene contained the same type of significant zzso domain with zzso of zzso or zzso Second, the both zzso had a promoter, a zzso start site, a start zzso a zzso pattern and a zzso zzso zzso each of them can be viewed as a gene in terms of a zzso primary zzso Third, both the zzso matched not only human zzso expressed sequence tags zzso but also human zzso proteins with zzso of zzso or zzso This indicates that the both zzso can be transcribed and translated into the same zzso zzso More importantly, we observed that the zzso DNA can be translated into the same type of proteins after a zzso occurred in a set of 160 human zzso zzso and in a set of nine zzso of human zzso zzso This observation based on the two sets of zzso data much strengthened our confidence on the zzso Our discovery is useful in the deeper understanding of a zzso regulatory mechanism to maintain its zzso
