The zzso response zzso protein zzso mediates zzso zzso of genes in response to the zzso signal zzso zzso There are two different zzso of zzso which are generated by alternative zzso zzso There is evidence that the two zzso may have different biological zzso As the longer zzso zzso contains a potential zzso site that is not present in the shorter zzso zzso we examined the possible differential zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared and used as zzso for zzso by the zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso mapping and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso contains two sites, zzso 133 and zzso 98, that can be zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso In contrast, zzso contains only a single zzso site at zzso 119 zzso position to zzso 133 in zzso A zzso zzso experiment demonstrated that zzso 98 of zzso was zzso only at relatively high zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso studies were used to test for any possible function of the zzso of zzso 98 of zzso These studies used zzso fusion zzso We found that zzso of zzso 98 to zzso (which would block zzso has little or no effect on the ability of the zzso fusion protein to activate zzso These findings suggest that differences in the biological activity of the two zzso zzso are probably not zzso by differential zzso by the zzso protein zzso
