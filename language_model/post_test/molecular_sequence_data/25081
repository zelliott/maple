zzso coils are formed by two or more zzso that align in a parallel or an zzso relative zzso The factors that determine a preference for a given relative zzso orientation are incompletely zzso The zzso orientation preference for the designed coiled zzso zzso was measured zzso This model system therefore provides a means for the experimental determination of the energetic contribution of a variety of interactions to zzso orientation zzso The zzso preference for zzso is imparted by a single buried polar zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso at the e and g positions have been proposed to influence zzso orientation zzso In the zzso zzso potentially attractive zzso interactions are expected in both zzso To determine the energetic consequences of zzso interactions for zzso orientation zzso we have positioned a single charged zzso in each zzso such that exclusively favorable zzso zzso interactions can occur only in the parallel zzso In contrast, two potentially repulsive interactions are expected in the zzso zzso Because the buried polar interaction can occur only in the zzso orientation, zzso zzso interactions favor the parallel orientation and the potential to form a buried polar interaction favors the zzso zzso We find no clear preference for an zzso orientation in the resulting zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso interactions and a buried polar interaction are of approximately equal importance for zzso orientation zzso zzso zzso indicate that maintenance of all favorable zzso interactions and/or avoidance of two potentially repulsive interactions contributes approximately zzso zzso to zzso orientation zzso
