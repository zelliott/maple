zzso tissue specimens from the urinary tract and prostate were analyzed for the presence and physical state of BK virus zzso zzso Large T zzso gene sequences were amplified by zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso ranging from 50 to zzso zzso analysis of zzso products from the high variable zzso regulatory region showed that these zzso contained a new zzso strain zzso zzso presents a zzso of part of the zzso and zzso elements of the viral zzso and a zzso deletion spanning part of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six zzso specimens zzso but none of the control zzso contained viral DNA in amounts zzso by Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumors positive by Southern zzso zzso zzso rearranged and/or integrated DNA sequences whose size was apparently incompatible with assembly into a viral zzso A zzso zzso intact zzso early region was amplified from these tumors by zzso The restriction pattern of the rearranged sequences was simple, suggesting that tumors were zzso and that DNA zzso occurred at an early stage of zzso initiation or zzso
