zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are commonly generated during zzso biomass conversion process for low-cost cellulosic ethanol production that interferes with subsequent microbial growth and zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is possible by the tolerant zzso zzso that involves multiple genes including numerous functional zzso In this study, we report a novel zzso zzso gene clone zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso which demonstrated zzso reduction activities toward at least 14 zzso zzso The identity of gene clone zzso is the same with zzso of zzso since a variation of only 35 zzso in zzso sequence and three zzso acid zzso were observed between the two that share the same length of 347 zzso in zzso As one among the highly induced zzso zzso of zzso showed significantly high levels of transcript abundance in response to zzso and zzso zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid sequence and the most zzso functional motif analyses including closely related zzso from five other zzso species to this date, zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the following typical zzso the most zzso zzso site to lie at zzso an indispensable reduction zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and an approved zzso motif at zzso near the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appeared to be the similar type of zzso falling into the same category of the intermediate zzso
