zzso zzso appears to play an important regulatory role in the systemic inflammatory zzso however, production of zzso within the human central nervous system has not been zzso Using cultures of human fetal zzso cells, the resident zzso of the brain, we investigated the production and regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso acute release of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso by 8 zzso and delayed production of zzso (over a zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso Treatment of zzso cell cultures with zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso release of zzso These zzso also induced expression of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cell cultures with zzso markedly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that during inflammation within the brain, acute release of zzso and zzso by activated zzso could promote subsequent release of zzso which functions to minimize the potential zzso effects of zzso zzso
