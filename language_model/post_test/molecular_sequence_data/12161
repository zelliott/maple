The zzso zzso of zzso coli contains two pairs of zzso charged zzso that interact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso replacement zzso at these positions have been constructed and characterized with respect to transport activity and zzso zzso The following results confirm the functional interactions between both sets of zzso zzso At pH zzso where the zzso is likely to be zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His and zzso zzso zzso zzso His exhibit significant transport activity while the zzso zzso zzso zzso His and zzso zzso His are zzso zzso At pH zzso where the zzso is likely to be zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His and zzso zzso zzso zzso His are zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso zzso His exhibits significant zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso His or zzso zzso His is inactive at all pH values zzso In addition, a pH zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso His zzso activity exhibits a zzso at about zzso Finally, the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso His and zzso zzso zzso zzso His were zzso for zzso binding by electron zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His zzso binds zzso with a zzso of unity at pH zzso but much less binding is observed at pH zzso demonstrating directly that zzso zzso zzso is in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
