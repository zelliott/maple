In this article, we describe a representation for the processes of multiple sequences alignment zzso and used it to solve the problem of zzso By this zzso we took every possible aligning result into account by defining the representation of gap zzso the value of zzso information in every optional path and scoring zzso On the basis of the proposed zzso zzso we used the zzso colony zzso to find the better path that denotes a better aligning zzso In our article, we proposed the instance of three-dimensional graph and zzso graph and advanced a special zzso representation to analyze zzso It is yet only an experimental software, and we gave an example for finding the best aligning result by three-dimensional graph and zzso colony zzso Experimental results show that our method can improve the solution quality on zzso zzso
