We have characterized a family of repetitive DNA elements with zzso to the zzso cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso that has the smallest known zzso of any zzso zzso One element, zzso zzso in length and flanked by DNA with no zzso to zzso was completely zzso At least four others were partially zzso The complete element is a composite of six zzso Five of these regions show sequence similarity with nonadjacent segments of genes of the zzso zzso The sixth region, located near the center of the element, is an zzso sequence that has only been found in this repeat zzso Open reading frames are present within the five individual regions showing sequence zzso to zzso and the adjacent open reading frame 3 zzso zzso However, termination zzso are found between adjacent regions of zzso to the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso Thus, these repetitive elements do not appear to be directly zzso protein coding zzso The sequence of one region from five different repetitive elements was compared with the zzso region of the zzso gene from the type strain zzso and four newly isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso between repetitive elements of strain zzso and the zzso zzso can explain the majority of zzso within our partial sequences of the zzso genes of the new zzso zzso we propose that the repetitive elements of zzso zzso provide a zzso of sequence that contributes to zzso variation in proteins of the zzso cellular zzso zzso
