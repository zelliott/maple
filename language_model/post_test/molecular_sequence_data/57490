zzso DNA clones zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a human kidney zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso insert of one of these clones indicates that human zzso is a protein of zzso zzso acids whose sequence shows zzso identity with that of the zzso rat zzso The human zzso gene zzso was isolated by zzso using a zzso of the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso was mapped to human zzso 20 using DNA from a panel of reduced zzso zzso cell zzso This assignment was confirmed using zzso in zzso zzso zzso which localized zzso to zzso 20, band zzso A simple tandem repeat DNA zzso in the zzso region of the zzso was characterized and used to zzso zzso relative to the gene responsible for a form of zzso zzso 2) diabetes zzso called zzso diabetes of the young zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is not tightly linked to zzso in one large pedigree and exclude this diabetes candidate gene as the cause of zzso in this zzso
