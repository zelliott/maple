A crystal structure analysis of the synthetic zzso zzso which contains two zzso zzso zzso has revealed that, in this zzso the zzso zzso adopt a zzso zzso The refinement zzso at R zzso zzso for 2004 reflections with F greater than or equal to 2 zzso in the range zzso for a model consisting of the DNA duplex and 71 water zzso A notable feature of the structure is the presence of an almost complete spine of zzso spanning the minor groove of the whole of the zzso core region of the zzso zzso ultraviolet melting studies have suggested that the zzso observed in the crystal structure is, in fact, a zzso zzso zzso species and that the zzso zzso in the sequence studied display the same zzso zzso as zzso zzso in the sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso below pH zzso and an zzso zzso is the major species present between pH zzso and zzso The zzso zzso are held together by two hydrogen bonds one between zzso and zzso and the other between zzso and zzso This second hydrogen bond is a direct result of the zzso of the zzso of zzso The ultraviolet melting studies indicate that the zzso zzso is more stable than the zzso zzso but that the zzso base pair is less stable than its zzso zzso zzso reasons for this observation are zzso
