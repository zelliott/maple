Most bacteria are entirely surrounded by a strong cell wall held together by zzso bonds of strength similar to those holding the atoms in a diamond zzso This zzso is a coat of armor or zzso and is usually called a zzso It protects the zzso from the stresses resulting from the higher zzso pressure of the zzso when compared with its zzso This strategy of constructing an external mechanical support has the weakness that the wall barrier has to be zzso and new wall material inserted outside of the cell proper in order for the zzso to grow and zzso Because of the unique chemistry and the necessity of selectively zzso old zzso wall for growth, the wall of the bacterial cell has been a key target for zzso treatment of bacterial zzso Currently, many infectious organisms are becoming resistant to overused zzso Still the wall is a good target, and there could possibly be several entirely new classes of antibiotics targeted toward other parts of wall metabolism and zzso The essential zzso may be a particularly relevant zzso To find zzso agents we must use and extend our present understanding of the structural mechanics of bacterial wall and their zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, if we use our knowledge of zzso and of the evolution of zzso resistance zzso that occurred millions of years ago, as well as our knowledge of ones that have arisen recently, quite novel antibiotics may be zzso
