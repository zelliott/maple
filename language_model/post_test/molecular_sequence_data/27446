We investigated two cases of alleged criminal transmission of zzso using zzso and zzso zzso approaches to determine whether the zzso method used influenced the outcome in these zzso In the first case, zzso methods were used to zzso gag and zzso sequences from an earlier investigation in which the zzso strains infecting one of several contacts could not be linked zzso to that of the accused despite strongly suggestive zzso zzso In the second case, zzso and zzso zzso methods were used to investigate the zzso of gag and zzso sequences from zzso strains infecting a man accused of intentionally zzso the virus to several zzso zzso analysis of zzso strains from the first case confirmed earlier results obtained by zzso zzso A zzso cluster linking viruses from the accused and three of his direct and indirect contacts was supported, but a linkage between these viruses and a fourth zzso linked contact could not be zzso In the second case, a strong zzso link between the accused and two of his zzso and the absence of links with four other zzso was confirmed by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is important that zzso programs applied in a legal setting are conservative in their zzso Although zzso methods offer zzso zzso for large data sets and complex evolutionary models, this study demonstrates they do not assist when clear linkages between viruses are demonstrated using zzso zzso
