During zzso zzso eye development, signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of a zzso activated protein zzso zzso called zzso Key nuclear targets of zzso are two zzso zzso factors: zzso a zzso and zzso zzso an zzso A critical regulator of this process, zzso can interact with both Yan and zzso through their SAM zzso Although earlier work showed that Mae zzso zzso zzso by zzso the Yan zzso the mechanism of zzso regulation by Mae remained zzso We find that efficient zzso and zzso zzso of zzso requires a three-dimensional zzso surface on its SAM domain for the zzso zzso zzso Mae binding to zzso zzso this zzso surface, thereby acting to zzso zzso zzso zzso site blocking provides a new mechanism zzso the cell can precisely zzso zzso signaling at specific targets, providing another layer of regulation beyond the more global changes zzso by zzso in the activity of the zzso zzso
