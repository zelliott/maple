The nuclear hormone receptors belonging to the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso These receptors zzso zzso of specific cellular zzso either positively or zzso by interacting with specific hormone response elements located near the target zzso Recent studies indicated that the zzso occupied, zzso zzso acts in concert with a cellular zzso factor, termed zzso and the zzso zzso machinery to mediate gene zzso zzso with this scenario, a number of nuclear proteins with potential zzso function have been zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that steroid zzso zzso zzso a recently isolated candidate zzso functions as a positive regulator of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, zzso of zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso of a zzso hormone response element zzso promoter by human zzso Our studies revealed that deletion of six zzso acids zzso in the extreme zzso region of zzso resulted in a zzso that retained the ability to bind zzso but failed to be zzso by zzso These six zzso acids are part of an zzso zzso that is highly zzso among nuclear hormone receptors and contains the core domain of the zzso zzso function, zzso In agreement with this zzso in zzso protein binding studies showed that zzso zzso with a zzso binding domain zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso manner, whereas it failed to interact with a zzso zzso binding domain lacking the zzso acids zzso We demonstrated that a synthetic zzso containing the zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso efficiently blocked the zzso binding of zzso to the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso that constitutes the zzso core domain of zzso is critical for interaction with zzso and thereby plays a central role in zzso zzso We further observed that a zzso of zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso either in solution or bound to a zzso zzso recruited zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was clearly involved in this process because a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso with impaired zzso failed to bind to zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso acid induced binding of zzso to the zzso component of the zzso zzso This novel finding suggests that zzso as a zzso partner of zzso has the potential to play an active role in zzso zzso Our results raise the interesting possibility that a zzso zzso may zzso zzso signaling by inducing additional interactions between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso
