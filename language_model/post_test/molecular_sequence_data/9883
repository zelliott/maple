One of the current limitations of using sequence alignments to identify proteins with similar structures is that some proteins with similar structures do not have significant sequence similarity by zzso One way to address this zzso problem is to match zzso acids based on their chemical and physical zzso However, the zzso acid properties zzso creating zzso dimensions of zzso the relative strengths of which are zzso It has been observed that the role an zzso acid plays (and hence the property that is zzso at a site in a protein depends on its secondary and zzso zzso To approximate and take advantage of this dependence on context for improving the sensitivity of alignments of proteins whose structures are unknown, we propose a surrogate definition of context based on the pattern of zzso in a small window of zzso neighbors surrounding each zzso zzso We present the results of an experiment in which a zzso program zzso tests and selects various properties in independent zzso and zzso increases the ability of sequence alignments to detect relationships among zzso zzso The method is shown to perform better than using the zzso substitution table for partial match zzso
