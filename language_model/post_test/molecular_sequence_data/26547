Recent sequencing efforts in melanoma have zzso many previously unknown molecular pathways and biological mechanisms involved in melanoma development and progression and have yielded a number of promising targets for molecular zzso As sequencing technologies have become more sophisticated and have revealed an ever-increasing complexity of the genetic landscape of melanoma, it has become clear that sequencing methods applied to clinical specimens have to reliably capture not only zzso zzso zzso like zzso and zzso or zzso zzso like zzso 11 and 13 zzso but also zzso zzso zzso dispersed across multiple functionally zzso regions of genes or entire zzso One such example in melanoma is the zzso zzso or zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, which has recently been shown to be a major zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling activates both zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso mediates sensitivity to zzso zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and has recently also been implied in zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso involving the zzso gene act as zzso zzso and predominantly involve the zzso zzso of the zzso Additional sequencing efforts have recently identified zzso zzso zzso or zzso clusters which affect the regulation of, zzso zzso zzso arrangement of zzso domain zzso or zzso zzso zzso this chapter, we describe the methods used to determine the zzso status of all zzso of the zzso gene in clinical specimens obtained from patients afflicted by zzso zzso Upon slight zzso this protocol can also be used for zzso analysis of other zzso affected by zzso zzso dispersed across multiple zzso This sequencing technique has successfully been applied within a clinical trial selecting patients with zzso melanoma for zzso zzso With the increasing emergence of zzso zzso affected by zzso zzso zzso located in different zzso and regions this method will provide a mean to translate the promise of recently obtained genetic knowledge into clinical zzso targeted therapy zzso
