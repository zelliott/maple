The consensus motifs of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by pool zzso Together with information obtained by sequencing of some prominent individual zzso the results indicate the zzso zzso all four zzso molecules are associated with zzso zzso These peptides adhere to zzso motifs that are similar to those of to zzso or zzso zzso they have a preferred length of nine zzso acids and an anchor zzso at the C zzso zzso All four zzso molecules analyzed exhibit related zzso zzso although each zzso product shows individual characteristics in fine zzso zzso zzso and origin of peptides appear not to be different from that of other class I zzso zzso No obvious difference at zzso position 9 was present in the peptides isolated from the two zzso zzso of zzso that determine dominant resistance to natural killer zzso cells zzso zzso or to zzso cells zzso zzso and that differ in two zzso in or near the pocket at position zzso
