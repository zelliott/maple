zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that selectively degrades the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are zzso by zzso to zzso zzso encountered by inhalation and zzso zzso is distinct from other zzso zzso as its activity is retained in strongly zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso expression is induced by zzso mouse models of allergic lung zzso This protein has also been implicated in the zzso of asthma although its precise role is poorly zzso We describe a novel way to express and purify active zzso zzso This material retains properties observed in mouse zzso zzso zzso fluid with regard to pH preference of activity and its zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso in zzso from both zzso and control animals have similar properties in this zzso This strongly supports the notion the same zzso zzso gives rise to zzso activity in both challenged and unchallenged zzso We also describe expression of active human zzso The methods described in this paper provide a reliable source of zzso zzso that can be zzso to expand understanding of zzso role in regulating allergic zzso
