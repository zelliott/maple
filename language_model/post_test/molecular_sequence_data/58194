We have previously observed that bovine zzso type 1 zzso zzso the appearance of five cellular proteins in zzso mouse zzso four of which appear to arise by altered processing of resident zzso zzso zzso Studies of various cell lines revealed that expression of the 3' end of the zzso early region was sufficient for induction of these zzso To identify the zzso gene responsible, we have zzso the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso virus zzso which expresses the 3' end of the zzso early region behind an zzso early zzso zzso cells infected with zzso for 48 h show the expected zzso zzso as do cells infected with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso However, a zzso in the start zzso of a previously ignored open reading frame extending from zzso zzso to zzso zzso eliminated the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso cells infected with the zzso zzso and zzso cells transformed by full-length zzso zzso Despite its influence on the processing of cellular zzso zzso zzso this zzso in zzso did not alter zzso efficiency or the ability of zzso to form colonies in soft zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso zzso that shares structural similarities with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on a role for zzso in the viral life cycle are zzso
