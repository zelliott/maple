Many novel zzso influenza viruses of the zzso zzso have emerged in aquatic birds in southern China since their initial isolation in this region in zzso However, the genesis and evolution of zzso viruses in poultry in eastern China have not been investigated zzso In the current study, zzso influenza viruses isolated from poultry in eastern China during the past 10 years were characterized genetically and zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso viruses have undergone extensive zzso to generate multiple novel zzso including four zzso zzso zzso K, and zzso that have never been recognized zzso The major zzso influenza viruses represented by zzso zzso viruses circulating in poultry in eastern China before 1998 have been gradually replaced by zzso zzso zzso which have a zzso different from that of viruses isolated in southern zzso The similarity of the internal genes of these zzso viruses to those of the H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from 2001 zzso suggests that the zzso virus may have been the donor of internal genes of human and poultry H5N1 influenza viruses circulating in zzso Experimental studies showed that some of these zzso viruses could be efficiently transmitted by the respiratory tract in chicken zzso Our study provides new insight into the genesis and evolution of zzso influenza viruses and supports the notion that some of these viruses may have been the donors of internal genes found in H5N1 zzso
