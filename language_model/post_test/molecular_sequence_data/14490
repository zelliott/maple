zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso peptides containing a specific zzso zzso Their contribution to the host defense against microbial invasion and the control of normal zzso have been previously zzso Some of the zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in the zzso and showed a zzso expression pattern in the zzso which thus suggested that these zzso may possess zzso functions in addition to zzso zzso A sequence zzso of the zzso 126 gene has been shown to be associated with reductions in the human zzso function, thus supporting this zzso Furthermore, zzso have the capacity to zzso immune cells and induce the zzso of inflammatory zzso Mice expressing human zzso zzso showed more severe lung injuries after the aspiration of zzso contents than did control zzso Recent investigations regarding copy number variations of human zzso genes also suggest the significance of zzso in the zzso or the worsening of chronic zzso pulmonary diseases, zzso and zzso
