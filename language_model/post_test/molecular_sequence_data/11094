The majority of human zzso zzso zzso elements in the human zzso have large deletions in pol and lack most of zzso zzso are more or less complete with a potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso cell lines and zzso from healthy blood donors by using zzso The transcripts all contained a zzso donor in the leader region downstream from the zzso site and a previously zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso absent in the zzso deletion zzso In zzso spliced transcripts the leader and zzso regions were joined directly whereas in multiply spliced transcripts they were joined with an alternative zzso from the zzso region located between the two zzso zzso transcripts from three different zzso elements were zzso one element similar to a zzso consensus sequence was primarily amplified from the zzso zzso cell lines and two other more defective elements were amplified from normal zzso One of these elements was shown to be a zzso spliced transcript where the zzso and zzso regions were joined, removing most of pol but leaving gag zzso Other spliced zzso joining the zzso region and the zzso were also zzso The fact that zzso elements with an intact zzso zzso zzso also use the zzso sites in the zzso region suggests that this unusual multiple zzso pattern could have a biological function in the intact zzso
