zzso is a regulatory gene of zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis and assembly of the spore coat and is required for the production of spores that are zzso and zzso We report the identification of the promoter for zzso and studies on the regulation of its zzso We show that zzso is switched on at the fourth hour of zzso zzso and that this expression is restricted to the zzso chamber of the zzso zzso studies in which the level of zzso expression was measured in 36 different zzso zzso indicate that efficient expression of zzso requires the products of almost all zzso genes tested as well as certain zzso zzso On the basis of its time of zzso zzso of expression and pattern of dependence on other zzso zzso zzso is zzso to be regulated zzso with the previously studied spore coat protein gene zzso zzso and zzso may be members of a zzso zzso of genes whose products are involved in the assembly of the spore zzso
