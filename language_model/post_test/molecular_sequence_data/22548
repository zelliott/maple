zzso zzso tests, which recognize a partly zzso zzso of the prion protein zzso are now widely used in Europe for the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Some of these tests can be used to distinguish natural zzso from experimental bovine zzso zzso zzso in zzso on the basis of migration pattern differences of zzso in Western zzso However, zzso from sheep zzso with zzso zzso gives an zzso profile similar to that of sheep zzso with zzso zzso field zzso strains similar to zzso might be zzso as zzso zzso in the rapid tests currently zzso This study confirmed that the Western zzso similarities zzso of the zzso band and distinct zzso with zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso remained consistent regardless of the zzso zzso of the zzso but the two infections resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso that could easily be distinguished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso This method, which reveals zzso differences of zzso by the use of a panel of zzso indicated that zzso from the zzso isolate was truncated further upstream in the N zzso than was zzso from other zzso zzso including experimental zzso In addition, the zzso zzso profile zzso which defines the zzso of zzso zzso in the brain of affected zzso showed that zzso infection leads to much more zzso and considerably less zzso zzso than does experimental zzso The overall results demonstrate that a combined Western zzso and zzso approach is required to discriminate between different zzso strains in zzso
