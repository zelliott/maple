zzso have been identified as the natural zzso of severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso and SARS zzso zzso and zzso However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat zzso is the descendant of the direct zzso of zzso based on their relatively distant zzso zzso In this study, evidence of the zzso origin of the zzso of a bat zzso is zzso We identified a potential zzso zzso immediately after the consensus zzso sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication zzso may participate in the zzso event, as previously speculated for other zzso zzso analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an zzso zzso lineage that is zzso closer to zzso than any of the currently sampled bat zzso Using various zzso zzso models, zzso transfer of this zzso lineage from bats to the amplifying host zzso zzso was estimated to have happened a median of zzso years before the SARS zzso Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this zzso zzso lineage may contain the direct zzso of zzso This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct zzso of zzso providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of zzso
