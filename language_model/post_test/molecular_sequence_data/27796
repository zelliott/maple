The previously cloned zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso sequence predicts a protein with zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso plots suggest that there are 12 zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows both sequence and structural zzso with a zzso of sugar zzso which includes the human zzso and fetal muscle zzso zzso the rat brain and liver zzso zzso the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and structural motifs at the zzso and zzso regions of the proteins support the view that the genes of this zzso arose by zzso of a common ancestral zzso In addition to the sequence zzso and the presence of the 12 zzso zzso the members of the zzso show characteristic lengths and zzso of the charged, zzso connecting zzso There is indirect evidence that the zzso is an zzso However, its only zzso site occurs in a charged, zzso zzso This could mean that this segment is part of a zzso channel in the zzso The zzso has a zzso site for the zzso zzso protein zzso which may be a target of zzso zzso The zzso lacks a strong sequence enriched for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and flanked by basic zzso acids zzso zzso even though it has a short zzso zzso for converting the poor zzso to a possible zzso sequence are zzso Like the other members of the zzso the zzso zzso lacks a signal zzso
