Development in zzso cells of a zzso expression system that mimics the zzso zzso assembly process would be advantageous for studying the structural requirements for particle zzso To this end, we investigated the ability of a zzso zzso virus system to produce zzso zzso zzso The genes coding for zzso and zzso proteins of the human zzso strain zzso were cloned and used to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells infected with these zzso viruses followed by zzso with a zzso zzso directed to zzso virus showed that zzso and zzso were efficiently zzso The zzso proteins were similar in size and zzso to authentic zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso analyses demonstrated that simultaneous expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells resulted in the formation of zzso zzso particles resembling zzso zzso zzso
