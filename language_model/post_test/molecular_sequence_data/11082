zzso is a zzso acid zzso that was initially discovered in the zzso zzso We have reported previously that this zzso regulates zzso zzso transport and have described zzso sites in the rat zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the anatomical distribution and the zzso of zzso production in the zzso zzso tract using zzso The use of zzso zzso which by zzso studies were shown to be specific for different regions of the zzso revealed a diversified zzso zzso predominated in zzso cells zzso localized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and pancreatic zzso in the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso with zzso or with substance P in a small fraction of zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with insulin in the zzso also considered as zzso cells in the zzso and with zzso cells in the zzso zzso An enteric zzso system containing zzso was also zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a component of the zzso cell type in the zzso gastrointestinal tract and zzso and suggest potential directions to investigate the functions of this new regulatory zzso
