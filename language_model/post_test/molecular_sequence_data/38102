zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from rat zzso despite its prior identification as a zzso zzso The zzso expression was remarkably intense in zzso zzso and brain and faint in the lung and eye among rat systemic zzso Although the brain contained four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcribed from a single zzso the zzso zzso and eye expressed only two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was intensely zzso in zzso zzso and zzso by using an zzso against synthetic zzso of the M region, but weak in zzso cells of the kidney and zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso and zzso zzso and iris zzso cells in the eye were also zzso zzso electron zzso revealed selective zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso apparatus in zzso In zzso culture, the zzso was also intense at a zzso region in zzso zzso cells of irregular shape zzso feature of zzso whereas it was weak in zzso ones of zzso appearance zzso feature of zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso Interestingly, Western zzso analysis identified an intense band corresponding to zzso zzso and another faint band corresponding to zzso zzso in the zzso whereas the intensity of these two bands were nearly equal in the lung and zzso In the brain, four bands corresponding to four zzso were observed zzso Computer sequence analysis predicted zzso structures in the secondary structure of the zzso similar to those in zzso zzso suggesting significant roles in the unique functions of the zzso apparatus in rat zzso and zzso
