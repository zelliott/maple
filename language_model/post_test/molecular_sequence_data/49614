To characterize the zzso of an zzso zzso isolate zzso in zzso 

A stool zzso was collected from zzso A patient from zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and viral zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso was amplified by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso followed by cloning into zzso zzso The positive colonies were selected and zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was analyzed and compared with other zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso was 7 zzso zzso zzso in size, containing zzso zzso region zzso 6 zzso open reading frame zzso which zzso a zzso of 2 227 zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso The base composition was zzso % A (2 zzso zzso % C (1 zzso zzso % zzso zzso and zzso U (2 zzso zzso comparisons with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso had the highest identity of zzso % for zzso zzso zzso with zzso the lowest identity of zzso % (1 zzso zzso with zzso The highest identity of zzso % for zzso acid (18 zzso appeared among zzso zzso and zzso and the lowest identity of zzso % zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Based upon comparisons of the zzso junction and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was classified as zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was closest to the zzso in zzso 

The sequence comparison and zzso analysis revealed that zzso is most similar to the zzso in Japan, suggesting the zzso link of zzso A happened in China and zzso
