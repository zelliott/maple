The zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso factors and regulate several processes of plant organ zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain 10 zzso members zzso zzso six of them were zzso located on the zzso reference map and the class 1 zzso was found to link to a quantitative trait locus zzso for the zzso length in the zzso zzso All the zzso genes were zzso transcribed in the zzso of growing zzso the zzso zzso abundance decreased progressively from primary zzso to secondary growth zzso zzso During primary growth, the zzso zzso was localized in the zzso and in the zzso zones, whereas it was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso background zzso zzso restored the zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso association, a role for zzso in zzso shoot zzso Several zzso zzso genes were zzso in the zzso zzso but zzso in the zzso lines similarly to the wild zzso Moreover, the zzso deposition pattern of the zzso and the zzso zzso were the zzso The zzso protein was found to recognize in zzso one of the typical zzso zzso sites that recurred in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso correlated with that of zzso genes and zzso deposition along the zzso shoot stems and was zzso in zzso vascular zzso These data strongly support that zzso prevents cell zzso by zzso zzso genes during zzso stem primary zzso
