zzso of zzso in muscle is a potential mechanism affecting zzso in beef carcasses and fat zzso in muscles of humans, which is a known risk factor for type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso switch gene 2 zzso and zzso by comparative gene zzso zzso In this study, bovine zzso and zzso were zzso and expressions of these genes were compared among various zzso and in muscles between bulls and zzso with different degrees of zzso The protein coding sequences of bovine zzso and zzso revealed zzso zzso causing two zzso acid variations for each zzso zzso zzso zzso showed two zzso from alternative zzso The zzso gene was zzso expressed in fat and, to a lesser degree, in the zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in the muscle and fat zzso suggesting their association with zzso metabolism in those zzso The zzso zzso muscle zzso of zzso showed higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression levels than the zzso of bulls, zzso the roles of those genes more in zzso of zzso than in that of zzso The zzso expression was markedly higher in the intramuscular fat zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression was significantly higher in the pure muscle portion of the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso and zzso are associated with fat content in bovine zzso
