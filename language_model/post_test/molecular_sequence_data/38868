The role of zzso light chain zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso current zzso was examined with the zzso recording technique in single rabbit portal vein smooth muscle zzso zzso dialysis with 5 zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso markedly reduced the zzso and rate of zzso of zzso zzso A similar result was obtained when the cells were zzso with 10 zzso zzso which also zzso zzso by an action at the zzso domain of zzso zzso of binding of zzso to zzso zzso and synthetic zzso derivatives zzso and zzso at zzso zzso also reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (both at 5 zzso reduced the zzso of zzso induced by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso current at a holding potential of 0 zzso In addition, zzso and zzso did not reduce the zzso zzso current induced by zzso in rabbit ear artery zzso zzso dialysis with 2 zzso zzso and 9 zzso zzso activated zzso which developed over a period of about 5 zzso zzso dialysis with the zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso and rate of zzso of zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso mediates zzso zzso in rabbit portal vein smooth muscle zzso
