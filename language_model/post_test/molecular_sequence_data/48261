To investigate the roles of human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso proteins zzso and zzso in the early steps of infection, the effects of the 23 synthetic peptides covering the entire zzso proteins on transmission of zzso zzso were examined by zzso and by the plaque zzso using a zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso bearing the zzso of zzso zzso The synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids 400 to zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited infection of zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed to be important zzso acids for zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso before or during zzso of zzso at 4 degrees C did not affect its zzso However, zzso infection was inhibited about zzso when the zzso zzso zzso was added even 30 zzso after zzso of zzso to cells, indicating that the zzso acid sequence 400 to zzso on the zzso zzso protein plays an important role at the zzso step of zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso reported to recognize the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the infection of zzso at the binding zzso
