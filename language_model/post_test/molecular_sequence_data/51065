Complete sequential zzso and zzso resonance assignments for the reduced zzso form of the blue copper protein zzso zzso zzso 128 zzso from zzso zzso have been obtained at pH zzso and 40 degrees C by using zzso and zzso two-dimensional zzso and three-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso Combined analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso spectrum and a zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spectrum proved especially zzso The latter spectrum was recorded without zzso of the water signal and provided for differential main chain zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso data were used to determine the secondary structure of zzso in zzso zzso with the secondary structure of zzso obtained from X-ray analysis shows a virtually complete zzso the two zzso and a zzso zzso are preserved at 40 degrees C, and most zzso contain zzso zzso Special findings are the unexpectedly slow exchange of the zzso and zzso zzso and the observation of zzso and zzso N zzso zzso zzso The implications of these observations for the assignment of zzso resonance zzso zzso the rigidity of the blue copper site, and the electron transfer mechanism of zzso are zzso
