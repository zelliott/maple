A previously zzso slowly growing, zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a patient with pulmonary infections during the zzso identification of Korean clinical zzso Its zzso zzso gene sequence was unique and the zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso placed the zzso into the zzso zzso group close to zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Growth characteristics and zzso also supported the placement of this species into the zzso zzso zzso this strain was generally similar to zzso zzso however, of particular interest, the optimal growth temperature of strain zzso was zzso zzso and it was not able to grow at 37 zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso analysis based on another two gene sequences zzso and zzso and a low zzso zzso zzso strongly supported the zzso status of this strain as a representative of a distinct species from zzso zzso It was concluded that the strain represents a novel species for which the name zzso zzso is proposed with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
