A survey of both zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso indicated that they contain zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso amounts zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso detection after treatment of the zzso with mild zzso zzso obtained from zzso after mild acid zzso and gel zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In all cases, molecular zzso corresponding to the major zzso were identified and were accompanied by zzso differing by 57 zzso thus indicating the presence of zzso The position of zzso in these zzso was determined by zzso zzso It was found that, depending on strain, zzso can substitute each of the zzso of the zzso element, zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso In some zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso having different substitution patterns were zzso
