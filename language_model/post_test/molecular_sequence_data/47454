The gene for human growth hormone zzso zzso consists of at least 10 zzso and the corresponding protein is zzso in zzso zzso which span at least 87 zzso of zzso zzso Failure to amplify zzso 3 and 8 of the zzso gene from Japanese subjects with the previously reported zzso prompted us to determine zzso sequences zzso zzso 3 and those zzso zzso 8 of the zzso zzso and novel zzso sequences zzso zzso 3 and 8 of the zzso gene were zzso We designed new zzso zzso based on these zzso and successfully amplified DNA fragments encompassing zzso 3 and those encompassing zzso 8 of the zzso zzso Since all of the 50 Japanese and the two Caucasians had the very same zzso sequences which were different from the previously reported ones, it is more likely that the previously reported sequences were simply wrong than that there exist zzso differences in the zzso sequences among different ethnic zzso
