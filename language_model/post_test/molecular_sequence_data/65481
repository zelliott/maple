zzso factor B zzso of zzso zzso binds to zzso 10 and to zzso In this study the binding site in human zzso was localized to a short region within the C zzso of the zzso zzso only bound to the zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso but with a deletion that lacked the zzso zzso from zzso of the zzso did not support adherence of zzso zzso Newman expressing zzso A series of truncated zzso of the zzso zzso were tested for their ability to support adherence of zzso zzso Newman zzso which allowed the binding site to be localized to a short segment of the unfolded flexible repeated sequence within the C zzso of the zzso This was confirmed by two zzso acid zzso within repeat 5 of the zzso zzso which did not support adherence of Newman zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso located in the putative zzso trench between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were defective in adherence to immobilized zzso and zzso 10, suggesting that both zzso bind to the same or overlapping zzso
