We have identified a novel regulatory zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to a family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates cell division, suggesting a similar function for zzso which is primarily localized in the zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso such as bone zzso and fetal liver, but the zzso is expressed at significant levels only in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Two novel forms of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso have been isolated that appear to be alternative zzso products and imply the presence of zzso with differing zzso zzso The ratio of zzso forms of zzso increases dramatically in zzso cells cultured with EPO, suggesting differing regulation and function for each zzso zzso is predominantly found in zzso rather than zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso is active in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promote zzso colony formation by human bone zzso cells, without affecting zzso unit zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso numbers of zzso and zzso zzso were increased, and zzso displayed increased sensitivity to zzso EPO zzso The data indicate that zzso acts as a brake to zzso zzso zzso zzso
