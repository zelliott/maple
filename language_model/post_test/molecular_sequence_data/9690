The zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso protein are two early markers of zzso zzso Both are essential for heart formation, but neither can initiate zzso zzso of zzso or zzso enhances cardiac development in committed zzso suggesting each interacts with a cardiac zzso We tested whether zzso and zzso are zzso for each other by using zzso and binding zzso with the cardiac zzso zzso factor zzso zzso only known target for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in synergistic zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The zzso involves physical zzso interaction, seen in zzso and in zzso which maps to the zzso zinc finger of zzso and a zzso zzso similarly, a zzso extended zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that binding of zzso to the zzso zzso domain of zzso may induce a zzso change that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot substitute for zzso for interaction with zzso This interaction may impart functional specificity to zzso factors and provide cooperative zzso between two pathways critical for early zzso Given the zzso of zzso proteins and zzso class members in other zzso the zzso partnership may represent a paradigm for zzso factor interaction during zzso
