zzso of strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso by using DNA fingerprints that were generated from zzso for zzso repetitive zzso consensus zzso elements led to the discovery of differential sequences for a zzso regulatory protein zzso gene in two zzso of strains with different host ranges on zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso that used different sets of zzso were designed to detect the core zzso as well as to obtain the entire sequence of the zzso gene for several zzso species and zzso Higher zzso was observed at the zzso level than at the zzso acid level among the different species and zzso revealing selection pressure on the zzso zzso which is presumably due to an essential role of the gene in bacterial zzso zzso zzso in the 3' and zzso zzso was used to study relationships among different species within the zzso zzso Species of this zzso that were isolated from zzso as well as other zzso of zzso zzso showed highly similar zzso gene zzso whereas other zzso species, especially zzso zzso had sequences that were more dissimilar to that of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene sequence is useful to distinguish zzso zzso zzso zzso groups and promising for zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Data from analysis of zzso gene sequences support the current concepts for zzso of zzso which are based on other zzso
