Three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed zzso Trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet zzso broiler zzso and bird zzso zzso microbial communities were investigated using microbial zzso Eight common zzso operational zzso units zzso were identified within both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso across zzso zzso zzso was associated with lower performance, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with improved zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of these eight zzso revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or zzso which clustered zzso into seven groups related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Where bacteria were identifiable to the zzso level, they belonged predominantly to the zzso with zzso and zzso also zzso Some of the potential zzso zzso showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative zzso to be developed which will enable zzso of which of these zzso are truly performance zzso This information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed zzso for optimal gut zzso
