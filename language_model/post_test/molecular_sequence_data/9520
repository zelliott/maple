zzso toxins targeting zzso sodium zzso channels are peptides that comprise zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by four zzso zzso These toxins can be divided in two groups zzso and zzso zzso according to their binding properties and mode of zzso The scorpion zzso zzso previously described as a zzso was zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso the most dangerous Brazilian zzso In this study, seven zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one insect zzso channel zzso zzso were used to investigate the zzso specificity and selectivity of zzso The zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but does not affect zzso zzso or zzso Interestingly, zzso significantly shifts the zzso dependence of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso structure of this toxin was modeled based on the high sequence identity zzso shared with zzso another zzso zzso zzso The overall fold of the zzso model consists of three zzso and one zzso and is arranged in a triangular shape forming a zzso zzso zzso zzso
