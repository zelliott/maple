Sixteen patients treated by zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso for chronic zzso leukemia zzso were evaluated by the zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso zzso transcripts at various time points after zzso In zzso experiments, one zzso cell per million normal zzso cells could be detected by direct zzso gel zzso of a zzso band following zzso zzso message was found in ten out of 16 patients zzso zzso zzso was present only zzso in three patients and correlated with zzso in zzso One patient died in clinical zzso while two patients remain in zzso despite persistence of zzso zzso cells at 180 zzso zzso follow-up of zzso patients in clinical zzso may provide insight into the fate or residual zzso cells after zzso This approach may aid in the identification of high-risk patients likely to zzso zzso
