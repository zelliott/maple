zzso are zzso elements acting in zzso controlling expression of their downstream genes through a zzso zzso of their secondary zzso Here, we demonstrate that two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can also function in trans and act as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso control expression of the zzso regulator zzso by binding to the zzso region of its zzso zzso of the SAM zzso zzso and zzso increases the level of zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Thus, the impact of the SAM zzso on zzso expression highlights a link between bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for zzso and a distinct class of regulatory zzso zzso in zzso
