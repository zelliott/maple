The zzso zzso zzso by by a zzso zzso zzso strain isolated in France, carries genes specifying zzso This zzso zzso numerous zzso One of these was zzso between the genes zzso and sin zzso zzso of a 16 zzso element which displayed the characteristic features of a zzso This putative zzso named zzso carried genes zzso proteins involved in its zzso as well as a resolution system, which were indistinguishable from those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These were: zzso zzso a probable zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and a resolution site, zzso In addition, zzso carried zzso genes zzso zzso and the zzso sequence zzso zzso contained at its zzso 116 zzso imperfect zzso repeats, similar to those of zzso and was flanked by 6 zzso direct zzso zzso of zzso close to zzso and to the structural and regulatory zzso genes zzso zzso zzso of zzso generated a zzso zzso zzso segment flanked by zzso repeated resolution sites zzso zzso This zzso segment, which carried zzso zzso and zzso generated in zzso or zzso depending on its zzso Thus, these two zzso share their zzso and resolution zzso
