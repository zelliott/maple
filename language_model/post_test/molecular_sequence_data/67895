The replication of human zzso virus type 1 zzso can be profoundly inhibited by the natural zzso of two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a natural zzso of zzso We have recently developed a synthetic biology approach of using zzso and zzso modified zzso to dissect various aspects of the zzso relationship of zzso and their zzso Here, we used this approach to design novel zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to investigate whether the zzso main chain zzso bonds in the zzso of zzso play a role in zzso signaling via zzso and/or zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso with a modified zzso main chain at position 2, 3, or 5 retain significant zzso binding and yet completely lose signaling zzso Furthermore, a representative zzso analogue has been shown to be incapable of causing zzso zzso These results suggest that the ability of zzso to activate zzso signaling and zzso is dependent upon the main chain zzso bonds in the zzso of zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility and value of applying a synthetic biology approach to chemically engineer natural proteins and zzso zzso as zzso of important biological functions that are not addressed by other biological zzso
