zzso zzso is a zzso of the human zzso but is also a major cause of zzso and zzso The zzso factor H binding protein zzso binds human factor H zzso enabling zzso of complement zzso on the bacterial zzso zzso is a component of two zzso B zzso vaccines currently in clinical zzso Here we characterize 12 zzso zzso for their level of surface exposure and ability to bind zzso to mediate serum resistance, and to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western analysis revealed that all strains examined expressed zzso on their surface to different zzso and bound zzso in an zzso zzso However, differences in zzso binding did not always correlate with the level of zzso zzso indicating that this is not the only factor affecting the amount of zzso zzso To overcome the issue of strain zzso in zzso zzso the zzso strain was genetically engineered to express different zzso from a zzso zzso zzso These zzso strains were characterized for zzso zzso and the data confirmed that each zzso binds different levels of zzso Surface zzso resonance revealed differences in the stability of the zzso complexes that ranged over 2 orders of zzso indicating that differences in zzso between and within zzso groups can influence zzso zzso Interestingly, the level of survival in human zzso of zzso zzso strains expressing diverse zzso did not correlate with the level of zzso zzso suggesting that the interaction of zzso with zzso is not the only function of zzso that influences serum zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity was seen within each zzso group, although the degree of activity zzso suggesting that zzso acid differences within each zzso group influence the zzso zzso zzso
