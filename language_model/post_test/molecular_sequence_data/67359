In this study, our goal was to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso that combines the zzso and efficient gene transfer of zzso with the zzso potential of zzso zzso To this end, the entire zzso zzso zzso was inserted into a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As we found that zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso zzso production, we engineered the zzso zzso early promoter, which zzso zzso zzso by inserting into its sequence zzso operator zzso As a result of these zzso zzso expression was blocked in the packaging zzso cells, which zzso express the zzso zzso allowing high-yield zzso zzso The zzso effectively delivered the zzso zzso into cancer cells, from which fully infectious zzso zzso particles were zzso zzso the zzso zzso exerted stronger zzso activities against various cancer cell lines, compared with the zzso and Ad parental zzso while being still innocuous to a panel of tested healthy primary human zzso This zzso zzso represents a novel versatile zzso agent which can be subjected to further genetic zzso in order to reinforce its enhanced zzso capacity through arming with zzso or zzso into tumor zzso
