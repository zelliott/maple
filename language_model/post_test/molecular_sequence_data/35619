A zzso zzso in the zzso family zzso 1 zzso gene is responsible for a new zzso zzso leading to eye and zzso zzso abnormalities as well as early retinal zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso remains poorly zzso and in the first approach to better understand the zzso function, we sought to identify the target zzso 

We developed a zzso promoter model zzso approach using a comparative zzso analysis in the zzso at zzso of a mouse model lacking functional zzso zzso zzso and its respective zzso This zzso was based on the hypothesis that zzso binding site zzso clusters should be more represented in promoters of zzso target zzso The most zzso expressed genes in the zzso experiment that contained zzso clusters were used to generate the zzso which was then statistically zzso Finally, we developed two zzso target prediction zzso one that focused on zzso zzso features in human and mouse and one that was based on the zzso of zzso pairs fitting the zzso in human or in zzso zzso 

The zzso construction revealed that zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc finger zzso 2 zzso and zzso carrier family 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso genes represented zzso targets in the mouse zzso at zzso Moreover, the zzso target prediction revealed that mouse genes belonging to the retinal zzso guidance zzso were targeted by zzso zzso of these three genes was zzso validated using a quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso on zzso as well as protein zzso zzso zzso type, O zzso and zzso two targets identified by the zzso were validated with zzso zzso 

Gene expression analysis between zzso and zzso mice allowed us to develop a zzso that identified the first target genes of zzso
