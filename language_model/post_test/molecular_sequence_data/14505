zzso and zzso zzso zzso are often caused by viral infections and occur more frequently in men than in women, but the reasons for the sex difference remain zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether gene changes in the heart during zzso B3 zzso zzso in male and female zzso mice predicted worse zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso were worse in zzso there was no difference in viral replication in the zzso zzso zzso zzso such as tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso were zzso in males during zzso rather than during zzso Using zzso and testosterone replacement, we showed that testosterone increased cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso increased zzso levels in the heart zzso zzso zzso a zzso known to regulate cardiovascular zzso and zzso in turn increased cardiac zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that 39 of 118 zzso genes identified in acute zzso patients were significantly altered in the heart during zzso zzso in mice, including zzso A zzso zzso change, P zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso treatment induced cardiac zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso Thus, zzso A zzso was identified as a gene associated with zzso cardiac zzso and progression to zzso in male zzso patients and zzso
