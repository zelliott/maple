zzso zzso symbiotic bacteria of insects and other organisms generally exhibit drastic zzso zzso Recently, it was shown that symbiotic gut bacteria of some zzso also have remarkably reduced zzso Here, we report the complete zzso sequence of such a gut zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene repertoire and evolutionary patterns, including AT richness and elevated evolutionary rate, of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso similar to those of zzso zzso zzso insect zzso like zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was suggested to supply essential zzso acids for the zzso zzso as zzso does for the host zzso Although zzso is zzso closer to zzso than to zzso in terms of gene repertoire zzso was similar to zzso rather than to zzso providing a possible case of zzso convergence of gene zzso Meanwhile, several notable differences were identified between the zzso of zzso and zzso including retention of zzso cycle genes and lack of zzso genes in zzso which may reflect their adaptation to distinct symbiotic zzso zzso zzso retained fewer genes related to cell wall synthesis and zzso metabolism than many zzso insect zzso The zzso of zzso zzso genes for zzso metabolism and zzso detoxification, suggesting the possibility of additional zzso roles similar to those of human gut zzso Our data highlight zzso similar evolutionary patterns that are shared between the zzso and zzso insect zzso zzso
