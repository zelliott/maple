We examined gene regulation in zzso lungs after zzso vessel zzso and zzso A rapid increase of transcript for the zzso zzso 3 gene zzso and its zzso activity zzso generating zzso zzso zzso were identified with transcripts located in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor decreased zzso levels and significantly enhanced zzso recruitment within lung tissue during zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso and selectively attenuated zzso rolling by zzso in zzso We prepared labeled zzso and demonstrated that zzso specifically binds to zzso zzso also zzso binding of zzso suggesting that zzso is a potent regulator of zzso Taken together, these results zzso a previously zzso mechanism that protects zzso from the potentially deleterious consequences of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they are relevant for new therapeutic approaches to regulate zzso responses in inflammation and vascular zzso
