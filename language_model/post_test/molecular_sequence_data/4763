The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso which is shorter by two carbon zzso This reaction is the last step of the zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been refined at zzso A zzso An unusual feature of this structure is the presence of two zzso completely buried in the zzso and sandwiched between two zzso The analysis of the structure shows that the sequences of these zzso are not zzso but generate two zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso domain exposes the polar zzso to a cavity at the zzso zzso filled with structured water zzso The central zzso in the zzso domain exposes its polar zzso to an interior polar zzso The refined structure has also been used to predict the mode of binding of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the reaction zzso From previous studies it is known that zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso zzso In the proposed model the zzso group fits near the two zzso zzso zzso such that the oxygen atoms point towards the protein zzso The distance between zzso and zzso is zzso zzso The zzso atom of the zzso zzso group makes a hydrogen bond to zzso which would zzso the formation of the zzso bond between zzso and zzso of the intermediate complex of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is proposed to bind in a groove on the surface of the protein zzso Most of the interactions of the zzso zzso are with atoms of the loop zzso The three zzso groups of the zzso zzso are predicted to interact with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in the zzso zzso
