During the preparation of zzso derivatives of the zzso clinical isolate of human zzso zzso consensus zzso sequencing of the recovered zzso zzso provided evidence of frequent sequence zzso at a number of zzso zzso This zzso was suggestive of sizable zzso containing zzso An analysis of zzso cloned zzso confirmed the presence of mixed zzso The biologically derived virus on which the zzso system is based also contained zzso zzso zzso whose presence was confirmed by biological cloning and zzso zzso Most of the zzso occurred in the zzso zzso For example, partial consensus sequencing of 40 independent preparations of zzso zzso zzso and various zzso showed that 31 of these preparations contained a total of 41 instances of small insertions in the zzso gene and a total of five small insertions zzso In each of these 31 zzso there was at least one insert in zzso that changed the reading frame and would yield a truncated zzso Nearly all of these insertions involved adding one or more A zzso to various tracks of four or more A zzso with the most frequent site being a tract of seven A zzso There were also two instances of zzso deletions and numerous instances of zzso substitution point zzso mostly in the zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso was greatly reduced by the replacement of the zzso gene with a synthetic version in which these zzso tracts were eliminated by silent zzso zzso We suggest that we frequently detected zzso in which the expression of full-length zzso protein was zzso because it provided a modest selective advantage to this clinical isolate in zzso zzso involving the functional loss of a gene is unusual for an zzso zzso
