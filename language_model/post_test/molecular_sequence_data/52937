Recently the zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso was zzso and it was shown that the gene products constitute a zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have now investigated the regulation and zzso role of this zzso zzso extension analysis identified the presence of a single promoter upstream of the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, a putative zzso element was identified in the promoter region, indicative of zzso zzso zzso with this was the observation that expression of the zzso gene cluster is zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso It is proposed that the conversion of the zzso zzso acids to the corresponding free acids results in the formation of zzso via zzso level zzso The zzso of the zzso acids resulted in a marked increase of zzso equivalent to a net production of zzso zzso of zzso per zzso of zzso acid zzso The zzso was active under zzso as well as zzso zzso However, under zzso conditions the presence of a suitable electron zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso produced by the zzso zzso acid zzso complex was required for complete conversion of zzso Interestingly, during the conversion of the zzso zzso acids an intermediate was always detected zzso With zzso acid as the zzso this intermediate was tentatively identified as 1, zzso This reduced form of zzso acid was found to serve as a temporary zzso zzso
