Here we present the first description of the zzso organization, zzso regulatory zzso and adult and embryonic gene expression for the mouse zzso AAA zzso zzso representing two distinct zzso genes were isolated in a zzso library screen, one of them likely representing a zzso processed zzso The coding region of the gene zzso the functional zzso is interrupted by 16 zzso and encompasses zzso zzso zzso Definition of the zzso initiation site and sequence analysis showed that the gene contains a zzso zzso promoter region with an zzso element spanning the zzso start zzso zzso elements necessary for zzso zzso activity reside within 410 base pairs of the zzso region as determined by transient zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was widely expressed in zzso and adults, but protein levels were tightly controlled in a cell zzso and cell zzso zzso A remarkable zzso in zzso zzso was found on a cellular level within a given zzso and protein amounts in the zzso and nucleus varied widely, suggesting a highly regulated and intermittent function for zzso This study provides the basis for a detailed analysis of the complex regulation of zzso and the zzso required for assessing its functional significance using targeted gene manipulation in the zzso
