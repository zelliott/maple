Classic zzso and modern zzso zzso methods were used to analyze zzso C virus zzso evolution in plasma and to assess viral zzso within peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in 6 children during zzso of zzso zzso structure analysis of cloned zzso encompassing zzso region 1 led to the distinction of two evolutionary patterns, one highly divergent and another one genetically zzso zzso zzso was reflected by zzso of viral communities switching rapidly from one to another in the context of divergence and stability associated with highly homogeneous communities which were replaced by new ones after long zzso Additionally, viral zzso of zzso in zzso was statistically demonstrated, suggesting their role as a pool of genetic zzso Our results support the idea of a community-based structure of zzso viral populations during chronic infection and highlight a role of the zzso compartment in the persistence of such zzso
