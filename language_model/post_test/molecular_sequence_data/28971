Human zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso complex and known as a precursor of zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is also zzso to induce zzso zzso Although zzso itself seems to be a zzso working at zzso conditions, most of the functional studies have been obtained with its zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain an insight into the working mechanism of zzso II, we used zzso II and searched for an interacting cell surface zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso tumor zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso The isolated protein was determined to be the alpha zzso of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso II and zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and in zzso pull down zzso and blocked with the zzso raised against zzso II and zzso zzso The binding of zzso II to the surface of zzso cells was inhibited in the presence of soluble zzso zzso zzso II inhibited the growth of zzso cells, and this effect was relieved by soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed an zzso effect on the proliferation of zzso cells mimicking the activity of zzso zzso These results suggest the potential interaction of zzso II with zzso zzso and its role in the proliferation of zzso zzso
