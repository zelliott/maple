Three types of zzso heavy chain zzso clone named 10 degrees C, intermediate and 30 degrees C types were isolated from fast skeletal muscles of zzso zzso grass carp zzso zzso Three clones encompassing parts of zzso and entire zzso regions showed high zzso in their zzso sequences in the zzso zzso The comparison in the deduced zzso acid sequence of the 10 degrees zzso clone with those of the zzso and 30 degrees zzso clones showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso clone shared much higher identity of zzso with its 30 degrees zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the 10 degrees zzso and 30 degrees zzso clones were predominantly expressed in grass carp zzso to 10 and 30 degrees C, zzso The intermediate type was expressed both in grass carp zzso to 20 and 30 degrees zzso Furthermore, expression patterns of the three zzso heavy chain genes were altered in accompaniment with seasonal temperature zzso In autumn and winter grass carp expressed the 10 degrees zzso gene almost exclusively, whereas it was completely replaced by the zzso and 30 degrees zzso genes in spring and zzso These results suggest that zzso grass carp also undergo an adaptation to fluctuating environmental temperatures by selectively expressing fast skeletal zzso heavy chain zzso as do zzso common carp previously zzso
