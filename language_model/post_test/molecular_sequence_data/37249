The zzso of zzso zzso harbors genes for at least six zzso proteins and also for zzso that contain a zzso zzso in the position of the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the synthesis and function of both the zzso and the S forms, a zzso with an zzso zzso gene was constructed and zzso The zzso was unable to zzso any of the zzso thus proving that the gene product is the zzso translation factor zzso specialized for zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of the S forms of zzso zzso the zzso alternative system, in zzso zzso but the zzso did zzso We concluded that free zzso is not involved in regulation but rather a zzso compound such as zzso or some zzso Apart from the S forms, several zzso from the general zzso route were affected by zzso supplementation of the wild type or by the zzso zzso Although the growth of zzso zzso on zzso is only marginally affected by the zzso zzso the gene is indispensable for growth on zzso because zzso zzso possesses only a zzso zzso zzso
