The antipsychotic drug zzso has been long considered a zzso inhibitor from in zzso studies but may function in zzso as a more general inhibitor by disturbing zzso zzso and altering the membrane zzso Resistance to zzso can arise in zzso zzso cells by zzso in at least three distinct genetic zzso One zzso defined by a spontaneous dominant zzso resistance zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The sequence of the zzso gene revealed a large open reading frame coding for a large protein of zzso zzso acids with predicted zzso zzso zzso A search of existing zzso acid sequences revealed a significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not grow efficiently in the presence of 50 zzso zzso whereas zzso cells zzso zzso cells became resistant to zzso in the presence of 50 zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso zzso cells showed a higher rate of calcium transport relative to zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene product codes for a zzso zzso zzso possibly involved in zzso transport or in generating a zzso zzso zzso between two cellular zzso
