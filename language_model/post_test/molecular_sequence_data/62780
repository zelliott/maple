The expression of genes for zzso zzso zzso which zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso a major zzso donor in cells, was studied in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains to determine the effect of bacterial zzso The zzso suppressed the expression of the gene in host zzso zzso but zzso still exhibited about half the zzso activity found in zzso D zzso The study was aimed at zzso mechanisms of the suppression of the zzso gene and determining the alternative source for the gene zzso zzso we found a second zzso zzso gene in zzso which zzso 390 zzso zzso zzso of experiments measuring zzso activities and amounts of zzso in D and zzso zzso showed that the half zzso activity found in zzso zzso came from the zzso zzso and not from their zzso The expression of zzso zzso genes was switched from zzso to zzso as a result of infection with zzso raising the possibility that the switch in the expression of zzso genes by bacteria plays a role in the development of zzso and the zzso zzso This is the first report showing such a switch in the expression of host zzso genes by infecting zzso
