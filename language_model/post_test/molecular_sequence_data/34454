Modern domestic horses display abundant genetic diversity within zzso zzso DNA, but practically no sequence diversity on the zzso Y zzso Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this zzso but can only be tested through knowledge of the diversity in both the ancestral zzso maternal and paternal zzso As wild horses are practically zzso ancient DNA studies offer the only means to assess this ancestral zzso Here we show considerable ancestral diversity in ancient male horses by sequencing 4 zzso of Y zzso DNA from eight ancient wild horses and one zzso zzso zzso Both ancient and modern domestic horses form a separate branch from the ancient wild horses, with the zzso horse at its zzso Our methodology establishes the feasibility of zzso long ancient nuclear DNA fragments and demonstrates the power of ancient Y zzso DNA sequence data to provide insights into the evolutionary history of zzso
