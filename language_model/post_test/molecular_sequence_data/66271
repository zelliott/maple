zzso proteins zzso are produced to prevent freezing in many fish species that are exposed to icy zzso There are a number of zzso types of zzso diverse in both sequence and structure, which share the function of binding to ice and zzso its zzso We recently discovered a zzso zzso in the winter zzso and related species that is zzso more active than other fish zzso Like the zzso type I zzso it is zzso and highly zzso but this zzso protein is considerably larger and forms a zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso this new zzso to gain insight into its structure and evolutionary relationship to the type I zzso zzso The gene is clearly zzso to the zzso zzso type I zzso zzso Thus we have designated this protein zzso type I zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso I zzso supports a structural model in which two extended zzso acid zzso form an zzso zzso with a series of linked zzso and zzso patches on the surface of the zzso each of which resembles zzso sites of type I zzso The superior activity of zzso I zzso may derive from the large combined surface area of the zzso sites, recognition of multiple planes of ice, and protection of the zzso plane from ice zzso
