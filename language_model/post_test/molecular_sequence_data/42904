A zzso zzso skeletal fast zzso I zzso has been isolated and characterized from an adult rabbit fast skeletal muscle zzso zzso This zzso contains the entire coding region of zzso base pairs zzso the 3' untranslated zzso segment of 78 zzso and the zzso zzso segment of 74 zzso The 3' zzso segment shows the predicted zzso structure characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is not identical to the zzso and the recently reported zzso zzso acid sequences for rabbit zzso and thus enables to make the necessary corrections in the sequence zzso The rabbit zzso is zzso by a single copy gene which is expressed in adult fast skeletal muscle in a zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso shows a high level of sequence conservation in the coding region among the zzso zzso zzso The sequence similarity is markedly decreased among the fast, slow and cardiac zzso and zzso zzso The zzso halves of zzso zzso including a segment believed to be involved in critical interactions with zzso and zzso C zzso show high sequence conservation whereas the zzso halves show considerable difference in sequence and zzso The significance of these results in relation to the biological function and evolution of members of the zzso zzso zzso family is zzso
