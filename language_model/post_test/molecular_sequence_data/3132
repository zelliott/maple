A novel zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso channels, named zzso 3 zzso has been zzso to zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso This scorpion toxin contains 37 zzso has a mass of zzso Da and displays zzso identity with zzso zzso also called zzso zzso is the tenth member (called zzso of zzso 1 of zzso zzso peptides known thus zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso channels zzso zzso zzso but has no zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso channels are, respectively, 79 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A synthetic gene zzso a zzso zzso was designed and expressed as a fusion protein with the zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso from the bacterial zzso compartment using an zzso affinity zzso column, followed by a gel zzso zzso step and zzso by factor zzso zzso to release the zzso toxin zzso zzso After final zzso and zzso zzso was shown to be identical to the native zzso with respect to zzso retention time, mass zzso analysis and functional zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso is proposed by zzso zzso to contain a zzso zzso beta sheet and a single zzso connected by three zzso zzso The scaffold of zzso is zzso to most other zzso scorpion zzso
