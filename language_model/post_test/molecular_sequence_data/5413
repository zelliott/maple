The sequence zzso has been reported as part of a de zzso design zzso zzso This zzso folds as a zzso structure with three zzso per strand and two zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in position zzso of the zzso appeared to be zzso exposed, interacting only within the turn but not with the rest of the zzso We have chosen this position as a good candidate to design zzso based on the protein database statistical zzso that should mainly affect the turn stability and possibly the pairing between zzso We have found that all zzso zzso in particular the zzso shift analysis of zzso and the zzso constants, zzso correlate very well and show similar zzso features in all the turn zzso zzso The population estimates are in reasonable agreement among the different methods zzso It appears that the zzso with zzso in position zzso is the most structured zzso followed by the one with zzso The next structured zzso is the one with zzso The least populated peptides were those with zzso and zzso We have found a strong correlation between the hairpin population, as determined from the zzso shift of zzso and the occurrence of the different zzso at position zzso of zzso with type zzso zzso in the protein zzso Our analysis demonstrates that this zzso system is sensitive enough to register small energy changes in the hairpin zzso therefore, it constitutes an appropriate model to zzso energy contributions, once the appropriate zzso transition zzso is zzso zzso with the other studies indicate that the design of a specific hairpin structure must involve a sequence at the turn region zzso the desired turn type, and a sequence at the strands that avoids alternative zzso zzso zzso
