A novel human gene referred to as the zzso zzso in the short arm of human zzso 8, was cloned by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso amplification zzso The gene consists of 7 zzso separated by 6 zzso and is at the zzso side of the zzso marker, zzso The full-length zzso gene contains zzso zzso and codes for a protein of 190 zzso acids with a calculated zzso zzso of zzso Southern zzso experiments showed that the zzso gene exists as a single copy in the human zzso A protein zzso by the zzso gene has an zzso zzso motif in the zzso region, which seems to zzso adhesive properties to zzso proteins like zzso Although zzso is a small gene with unknown biological function, its ubiquitous expression in various zzso and zzso suggests that the zzso protein is one of the essential components of all zzso and zzso
