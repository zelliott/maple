zzso is a member of the zzso zzso channel family that is broadly expressed in the zzso nervous system, but has no known zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso is targeted to the plasma membrane in zzso cells, where it associates with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect could also be observed on zzso zzso currents in zzso cells and zzso currents in zzso cells, suggesting a zzso role for zzso in regulating zzso currents involved in pain zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso interact with proteins involved in diverse functions, including zzso zzso zzso regulators of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the sole member of this zzso channel class to interact strongly with zzso The distinct functionally related sets of interacting proteins that bind individual zzso identified in the zzso zzso screen suggest potential roles for zzso in a variety of cellular zzso
