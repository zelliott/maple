zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are key regulators of basic functions such as cellular growth and zzso They provide an interface between multiple receptors and a complex network of zzso signaling zzso Two members of this family zzso and zzso have been identified zzso In this investigation, we analyzed a mouse expressed sequence tag clone that proved to be a new member of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this clone and comparison with the sequences deposited in zzso demonstrates this protein may be the zzso zzso of rat zzso recently zzso and cloned from rat zzso zzso we have named our protein mouse zzso The expressed sequence tag clone contains the complete coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment with the other members of the zzso family shows that this protein contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are highly zzso In addition, there is conservation of many zzso zzso motifs responsible for interactions with downstream signaling molecules containing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is expressed in many zzso with highest levels in liver and zzso Mouse zzso is highly expressed in the first part of the embryonic life, when zzso zzso zzso is barely zzso Unlike the genes zzso zzso and zzso the zzso gene contains an zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the region between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso localized the mouse zzso gene on the zzso region of zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso gene will make it possible to apply genetic approaches to zzso the zzso role of this new member of the zzso family of zzso
