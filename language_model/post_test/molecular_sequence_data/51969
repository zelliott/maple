Type zzso collagen is a member of the zzso zzso zzso with interrupted triple zzso group of zzso zzso zzso Like the other members of this group, collagen types IX and zzso type zzso has alternating zzso and zzso zzso Because of its structure, its association with collagen zzso and its distribution in dense zzso zzso type zzso is thought possibly to act as a zzso between zzso and resist zzso forces caused by zzso A portion of the zzso gene was isolated by screening a zzso library with a chicken alpha 1 zzso zzso probe, followed by zzso and sequence zzso zzso of zzso sequences with the sequence of a mouse zzso clone allowed the mouse gene to be identified as the alpha 1 zzso collagen zzso In the zzso zzso is located on zzso 9, as determined by linkage analysis using DNA from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of a human zzso library also allowed the isolation of a human alpha zzso gene zzso This gene was mapped to zzso 6 by zzso zzso to DNA from zzso hybrid cell zzso This information should prove useful in determining the role of type zzso collagen genes as candidate genes in zzso zzso tissue zzso
