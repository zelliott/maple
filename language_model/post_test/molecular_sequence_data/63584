We present a novel method of protein fold decoy discrimination using machine learning, more specifically using neural zzso Here, decoy discrimination is represented as a machine learning problem, where neural networks are used to learn the zzso features of protein structures using a set of positive and negative training zzso A set of native protein structures provides the positive training examples, while negative training examples are simulated decoy structures obtained by reversing the sequences of native zzso Various features are extracted from the training zzso of positive and negative examples and used as zzso to the neural zzso 

zzso have shown that the best performing neural network is the one that uses input information zzso of zzso 1 profiles of zzso pairs, zzso distance and the relative zzso zzso of the zzso This neural network is the best among all methods tested in discriminating the native structure from a set of zzso for all decoy zzso zzso 

This method is demonstrated to be viable, and zzso evolutionary information is successfully used in the neural networks to improve decoy zzso
