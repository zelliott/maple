zzso requires dynamic attachment of zzso to zzso zzso This interaction is zzso largely by zzso During zzso forces exerted at zzso in combination with polar ejection forces, drive zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso A major question has been whether zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso Using zzso from and zzso addition to zzso egg zzso we show that the zzso zzso motor protein zzso is essential for positioning zzso at the zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso powers movement toward zzso plus ends in zzso These findings support a model in which zzso functions in zzso to zzso zzso to dynamic zzso plus zzso
