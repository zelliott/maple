zzso of the human zzso gene is regulated by a complex array of zzso promoter elements that respond to conditions that include normal conditions of cell growth and induction following zzso zzso We have examined the requirements of the zzso and zzso promoter elements by using promoter zzso and a transient zzso zzso Multiple forms of zzso transcription, including heat shock and incubation with heavy metals or zzso acid zzso are zzso by a single heat shock element zzso between zzso and zzso consisting of three zzso zzso units, zzso that are zzso relative to adjacent zzso zzso zzso expression requires a fully functional zzso zzso zzso zzso which alter the relative zzso orientation of adjacent genetic elements have only minimal effects on zzso and zzso expression and show no effects of zzso In addition, placement of the zzso adjacent to the zzso promoter removes the requirements for a fully functional zzso promoter for zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that factors bound at the zzso and the zzso promoter can function through multiple zzso
