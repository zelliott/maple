zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso therapy zzso clinical zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso patients but early relapses and later emergence of zzso disease remain zzso We recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and zzso and mediates cellular resistance to zzso in zzso zzso zzso We now show that deletion of the zzso domain of zzso significantly enhances zzso response of zzso cells to zzso compared to cells expressing full-length zzso We have also discovered a novel interaction between zzso and zzso a zzso through the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain at zzso resolution reveals that it adopts zzso zzso zzso with the exception of an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to interact with the zzso zzso domain, was used to model the binding pattern between the zzso zzso domain and its zzso These studies showed that an zzso stack may form within the binding zzso providing a potential target site for designing specific zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain thus provides a valuable tool for identification of key interaction sites in regulation of drug resistance and for the development of small zzso zzso for zzso
