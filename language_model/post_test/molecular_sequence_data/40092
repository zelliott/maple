The protein product of gene zzso from zzso zzso possesses zzso sequence identity to a human zzso that has been implicated in the rare disorder zzso zzso The structure of the zzso protein has been solved to a nominal resolution of zzso zzso This structure reveals zzso structure differences between the zzso zzso and zzso II zzso that are likely to account for differences in reaction chemistry and zzso state between the two types of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso protein is used as a model to explain the significance of several zzso in the human zzso that have been observed in patients with zzso zzso
