We have developed a novel expression screening method for identifying protein zzso zzso In this method, a zzso zzso zzso expression library is screened by in zzso zzso zzso using zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso library with zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso of previously characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating the utility of this method for identifying zzso protein zzso zzso A novel clone isolated in this screen, designated zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is most similar to zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso was zzso and activated in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso Further, zzso was activated upon stimulation of zzso cells with zzso fetal calf serum, zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso by these stimuli was zzso inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is a novel class of protein zzso that is activated through both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
