The zzso zzso plasmids zzso and zzso have previously been shown to contain identical zzso sequences as well as zzso restriction zzso zzso patterns within their zzso zzso zzso analysis and sequence data presented here indicate that these two plasmids zzso essentially identical zzso zzso zzso This region contains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcribed in the same orientation from a promoter that probably lies within or near the zzso transfer origin zzso Three corresponding proteins were zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso analysis confirmed that this region contains three zzso zzso zzso All three proteins resemble proteins of the zzso zzso zzso and other plasmids thought to have roles in processing of zzso DNA during zzso The zzso profile of zzso suggests a zzso zzso similar to that of several zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were required for efficient zzso zzso zzso at zzso while zzso was not zzso The leading region of zzso contains three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which cause elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso instability was observed only in hosts that are zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso can potentially lead to zzso loss and that zzso proteins somehow overcome this, possibly via zzso zzso zzso
