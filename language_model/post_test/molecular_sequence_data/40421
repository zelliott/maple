To report an zzso dominant zzso disease zzso Chinese family with vocal zzso zzso and to identify the zzso of gap junction protein beta 1 gene zzso 

Part of the family members with zzso zzso and lethal respiratory failure were studied through flexible zzso clinical, brain zzso and zzso zzso After excluding large zzso tandem zzso containing peripheral zzso protein 22 gene zzso direct sequencing was performed to analyze the zzso of the zzso gene in 5 patients including the zzso 5 unaffected family members and 50 unrelated healthy zzso 

Eight members spanning 3 generations in this family were affected with zzso characterized by progressive zzso and weakness of the anterior zzso and zzso muscles, especially in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed through flexible zzso in total of 4 affected members with zzso and zzso 2 of them died of severe respiratory failure due to complete bilateral vocal zzso zzso zzso brain zzso was observed in the zzso The zzso data showed zzso zzso involving the motor and sensory nerves in the zzso DNA sequencing revealed a de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2 of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso with zzso 

Respiratory failure associated with vocal zzso involvement may be a rare and severe symptom in zzso The present report provides further evidence for clinical and genetic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
