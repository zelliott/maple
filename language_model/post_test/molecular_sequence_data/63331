zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes wildfire disease on host tobacco zzso To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a double zzso zzso were zzso These zzso produced smaller amounts of zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso had lost swarming zzso and had reduced expression of zzso zzso genes and the zzso gene required for zzso zzso The ability of the zzso to cause disease symptoms in their host tobacco plant was remarkably reduced, while they retained the ability to induce hypersensitive reaction zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is indispensable for zzso on the host plant, but not for zzso induction in the zzso zzso
