zzso is a cellular zzso for the zzso drug zzso A zzso zzso C zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso making it a potential zzso of the zzso effects of zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso has been solved and refined to an R factor of zzso at a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure with the zzso zzso A zzso revealed significant migration of three zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso The proximity of the loop zzso to zzso to the zzso binding site may account for the unique binding of a zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso to zzso The binding of zzso to zzso is similar to that of zzso to human zzso zzso A zzso However, the zzso of zzso when bound to zzso is significantly different from that when bound to zzso These differences may reflect zzso variation of zzso when bound to different zzso zzso the previous zzso structure at low resolution may not provide sufficient details for a comparison with the zzso zzso
