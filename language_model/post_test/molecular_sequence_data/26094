We have previously shown that in some patients with primary zzso type 1 zzso disease is associated with zzso of the normally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Cooper, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from a zzso patient with zzso zzso zzso This identified three point zzso that cause zzso acid zzso in the predicted zzso protein zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso a range of zzso patients and controls were screened for these zzso This revealed that all eight zzso patients with zzso carried at least one zzso with the same three zzso Two were zzso for this zzso and six were zzso In at least three of the zzso it appeared that only the zzso zzso was zzso All three zzso were absent from zzso patients lacking zzso One zzso zzso a zzso substitution at zzso 170 was not found in any of the control zzso However, the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso 11 and zzso respectively, zzso in the normal population at an zzso frequency of zzso In an individual zzso for this zzso zzso at zzso 11 and zzso only a small proportion of zzso appeared to be zzso to zzso It is suggested that the substitution at zzso 11 generates an zzso zzso with characteristics similar to recognized zzso targeting zzso the full functional expression of which is dependent upon zzso of the substitution at zzso zzso which may induce defective zzso zzso
