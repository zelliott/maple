zzso zzso factor zzso is one of the key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We investigated the prevalence of the zzso gene zzso in the population of zzso women that consisted of zzso and secondary zzso zzso 

We designed a zzso gene zzso screening method that is based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The population to screen consisted of 176 zzso women including group A of 147 zzso women and group B of 29 women with secondary zzso that had a history of either miscarriage or an zzso pregnancy but no live zzso The control population was comprised of 75 healthy fertile zzso The groups of fertile controls and zzso patients were compared for statistically significant differences using the zzso 

Six potentially functional zzso gene zzso the G to A transitions at the position zzso leading to the zzso to zzso exchange at zzso 64 zzso in the AB loop region of the zzso zzso were zzso All of the six positive women were zzso Four of them were zzso and two of them had history of spontaneous conception followed by early zzso No positive zzso samples were identified in the control group, which means that the frequency of functionally relevant zzso of the zzso gene in zzso women is significantly enhanced in comparison with controls zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the zzso gene zzso affect zzso Even though they occur zzso their impact on molecular events during early zzso of pregnancy should be further zzso
