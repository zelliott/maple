The objective of this work was to characterize the complete coding region of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene of three Italian sheep breeds: zzso zzso and zzso di zzso zzso was accomplished by direct sequencing of zzso zzso of the relevant DNA, including zzso and partial zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso We detected five novel zzso one zzso zzso is located in zzso 2, has similar zzso in the three breeds and showed a negative association with milk fat zzso More interesting is an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the occurrence of which is rare in the higher zzso breeds zzso and zzso di zzso it is located in the core sequence of zzso a putative binding site of zzso zzso This zzso showed a significant negative association with milk fat content in the zzso zzso Because zzso plays a fundamental role in zzso zzso the novel detected zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene might explain, at least zzso the variation of fat content in the milk of zzso zzso
