zzso zzso factor zzso levels are hallmarks of several human zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso is essential for studies of the zzso zzso of zzso as well as for a dissection of the mechanisms of zzso zzso B cell zzso We have expanded upon previous methods to develop a flow zzso method to efficiently clone zzso zzso zzso from humans with expansions of zzso zzso heavy chain variable region zzso zzso gene zzso B zzso The cloned variable regions are expressed as zzso and produced during culture at zzso between 5 and 20 zzso Using this system, we show that zzso zzso from patients with zzso mixed zzso when expressed as zzso have zzso zzso We anticipate that this system will be useful for the cloning and expression of zzso partially zzso by zzso and for determination of the zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso
