We have tested the hypothesis that zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso is due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso within a putative zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso with zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of the insulin zzso beta zzso was tested for its zzso potency and specificity towards the zzso zzso zzso This synthetic zzso gave zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with an approximate zzso of 100 zzso zzso appeared to be independent of the zzso of insulin or the zzso zzso zzso but was decreased by increasing zzso of zzso This same zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not a zzso protein zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this zzso domain contains an zzso zzso
