zzso h zzso zzso is closely related to zzso of cereal zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso s zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso and the zzso h zzso zzso gene from wheat are highly zzso and their expression products have similar biological zzso zzso wheat had been formed after the zzso zzso s was transferred into zzso and it had been certified that the expression of zzso h decreased in transgenic zzso and transgenic wheat has high resistance to zzso zzso 

Through analyzing the differential zzso of wheat seeds between transgenic wheat and wild type zzso the mechanism of transgenic wheat seeds having high resistance to zzso zzso was studied in the present zzso There were 36 differential proteins which had been identified by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso All these differential proteins are involved in regulation of zzso zzso zzso acid, proteins and energy zzso and biological zzso The quantitative real time zzso results of some differential zzso such as zzso zzso heat shock protein 70, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 6, represented good correlation between transcripts and zzso The biological functions of many differential proteins are consistent with the proposed role of zzso h in wheat zzso 

A possible model for the role of zzso h in wheat seeds zzso was proposed in this zzso These results will not only play an important role in clarifying the mechanism that transgenic wheat has high resistance to zzso zzso but also provide further evidence for the role of zzso h in zzso of wheat zzso
