In plants the hormone zzso is perceived by members of a small zzso zzso family, which are hybrid sensor zzso zzso While the immediate downstream signaling zzso is well zzso the domain of the zzso responsible for zzso binding and which zzso are involved in this process has not been determined zzso 

Using a live cell zzso zzso we show that zzso is bound by a zzso domain predicted to be zzso the so called zzso zzso zzso zzso associated sensory zzso zzso The zzso domain occurs not only in plant zzso receptors but also in numerous orphan receptors in lower zzso and zzso Taking advantage of this fact, we used an evolutionary zzso approach to identify zzso acids important for zzso binding by looking for zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in other zzso By comparing differences in evolutionary rates, we predicted five zzso acids within the plant zzso zzso to be crucial for zzso zzso zzso of the predicted sites and subsequent binding zzso confirmed the relevance of four of the selected zzso zzso showing the biological significance of zzso evolutionary rate zzso 

This work demonstrates the use of a zzso analysis to mine the huge set of zzso data from different zzso in order to generate a testable zzso We verified the hypothesis zzso and identified four zzso acids which are to a different degree required for zzso of a plant hormone zzso
