The aims of this study were to identify zzso genes among zzso zzso coli zzso from defined disease conditions of companion and farm animals obtained in the zzso study, and to gain insight into their zzso and the organization of the zzso gene zzso 

The zzso genes were detected by zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso were checked for zzso in DNA zzso and zzso IV genes by zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence typing zzso was performed for the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were transferred by zzso into zzso coli recipients, subjected to zzso zzso typing and zzso and one zzso zzso was zzso zzso 

Only 2 of zzso zzso coli zzso investigated carried zzso zzso Both zzso originated from horses and showed zzso type zzso They zzso zzso zzso zzso which proved to be indistinguishable by restriction analysis, belonged to zzso group zzso showed zzso type zzso and did not carry other resistance zzso The zzso gene was flanked by copies of the zzso sequence zzso One of these zzso zzso was zzso completely and had a size of zzso zzso Except for the resistance gene region, zzso zzso closely resembled the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

zzso genes were rarely detected among zzso coli from animals in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was detected on zzso zzso with zzso being likely involved in the mobility of zzso
