Two soluble zzso zzso and zzso catalyzing the reduction of a number of zzso complexes by zzso were zzso to near zzso from the zzso grown zzso culture of zzso zzso using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso with a molecular mass of 19 zzso whereas zzso exhibited a molecular mass of about 55 zzso and consists of probably two identical zzso zzso can be classified as an zzso zzso with a sequential reaction zzso It requires the addition of zzso or zzso for activity on zzso zzso In these zzso the apparent zzso specificity of zzso seems to stem exclusively from different chemical zzso of zzso compounds with the free reduced zzso produced by the zzso Observations on zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso support the view that zzso takes part in releasing iron from the zzso type zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso contains a zzso bound zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso in place of zzso does not reduce free zzso at an appreciable rate, and gives a zzso type kinetic pattern with zzso and zzso as zzso zzso is able to reduce zzso in agreement with the fact that its zzso bears a zzso to the previously described zzso zzso from zzso zzso Besides this, it also readily reduces zzso like zzso zzso or zzso zzso
