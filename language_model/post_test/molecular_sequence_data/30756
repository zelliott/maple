The zzso region located upstream of the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso gene zzso initiation sites was sensitive to zzso zzso when under zzso zzso The structural basis of this specific zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by the use of zzso zzso The patterns of modification suggested that the zzso proposed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which includes an zzso triplex and a zzso region, was the most plausible model for the sequence zzso The results of zzso zzso modification also supported this zzso
