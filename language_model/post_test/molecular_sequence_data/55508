Although calcium influx triggers zzso at many zzso and zzso zzso cells, the identity of the calcium channel is zzso The plasma membrane zzso calcium channel zzso is a candidate, and it was recently proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium channels at the plasma zzso thus triggering zzso and zzso it to zzso a mechanism suggested to be zzso from sea zzso to zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso when inserted into the plasma membrane upon zzso does not generate a calcium current or calcium increase at a zzso nerve zzso Instead, zzso at the plasma zzso including the zzso provide the calcium influx to trigger rapid and slow zzso and, thus, couple zzso to zzso These findings call for reconsideration of the zzso calcium channel zzso They are likely to apply to many zzso and zzso cells in which zzso control zzso and zzso is coupled to zzso
