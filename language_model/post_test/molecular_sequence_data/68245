A synthetic expression system, zzso was constructed for high-level expression and rapid zzso of zzso proteins in zzso coli, by introducing two synthetic zzso The first sequence permitted a high-level expression via a second zzso site plus an zzso zzso This zzso between the zzso untranslated region of the zzso and the zzso region minimized the formation of local secondary structures and favored zzso zzso The second region coded for six zzso which allowed for easy zzso of the zzso zzso was based on interaction of the protein with metal zzso immobilized metal affinity zzso The zzso and zzso structural genes of zzso were cloned into this modified expression zzso zzso of the structural proteins represented up to zzso of the total protein in zzso coli, zzso 40 zzso of highly zzso protein could be obtained per liter of zzso
