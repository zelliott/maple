In a previous article zzso zzso zzso zzso two different structures for the possible modular repeating unit of the zzso zzso zzso produced by the fungus zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso zzso which was the more likely one was considered essential before attempts were made to understand how zzso was assembled by this zzso Data from Smith degradation analyses of zzso were consistent with the repeating unit of structure I, where single zzso zzso are attached by zzso to two out of every three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed that chain zzso occurred from its zzso zzso Side chain zzso into the growing zzso was followed by analysis of real time incorporation of zzso into zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso All data obtained were consistent with the view that single zzso zzso side zzso are inserted simultaneously as the zzso backbone zzso
