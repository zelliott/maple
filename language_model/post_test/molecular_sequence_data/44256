A recently described protein module consisting of zzso zzso zzso termed the WW domain, has been identified in a number of diverse proteins including zzso and zzso protein zzso Two putative zzso of zzso termed zzso and zzso have been found previously to contain several short zzso regions consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediate binding to the WW domain of zzso Although the zzso of the WW domain remain to be zzso these observations strongly support a role for the WW domain in zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of three novel human zzso zzso a total of nine WW zzso using a newly developed approach termed zzso zzso of zzso zzso in which the rapid cloning of modular protein zzso is accomplished by screening zzso expression libraries with specific zzso zzso Two of the new genes identified appear to be members of a family of zzso including zzso and zzso which have zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that peptides corresponding to zzso and zzso motifs present in several known signaling or regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso sodium channel zzso can selectively bind to certain of these novel WW zzso
