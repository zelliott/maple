zzso mast cells are in the mouse predominantly found in the zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso They express the zzso zzso and zzso During zzso infections these zzso mast cells increase in numbers and high amounts of zzso appear in the zzso zzso and in the zzso A targeted deletion of this zzso leads to decreased ability to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso A suggested role for zzso is zzso of zzso zzso by direct or indirect degradation of zzso and zzso targets, however, no such zzso have yet been zzso To enable a screening for natural zzso we performed a detailed analysis of the extended zzso specificity of zzso using zzso zzso display zzso In positions zzso and zzso distinct preferences for zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso In position zzso a high selectivity for large zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and in position zzso zzso zzso acids zzso Val and Ala was zzso In positions zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso bond, zzso showed specificity for zzso zzso zzso The high selectivity in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso positions indicate that zzso has a relatively narrow set of in zzso zzso The consensus sequence was used to screen the mouse protein database for potential zzso A number of mouse zzso or membrane proteins were identified and cell zzso and zzso tissue components were a dominating zzso This information, including the exact position of potential zzso sites, can now be used in a more focused screening to identify which of these target molecules zzso responsible for the increased zzso zzso observed in zzso infected zzso
