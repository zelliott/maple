zzso zzso of the zzso zzso play important roles in the ecology of zzso and open ocean zzso Little is known of the cell and molecular biology of zzso but the zzso is intermediate on zzso trees between zzso and typical zzso zzso Here, we constructed four zzso libraries, from different stages after infecting the host, zzso zzso with zzso zzso These libraries were used to generate zzso expressed sequence tags zzso with sequences attributed to either the host or zzso based on AT bias, zzso zzso and occurrence during zzso Overall, 209 sequences were attributable to the zzso and 685 to the zzso The 50 putative zzso sequences with good protein matches in zzso were used to find the same protein from host zzso For 26 zzso both host and zzso sequences were identified, of which 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso for seven predicted zzso and two host genes were used to confirm zzso The most common host and zzso zzso were compared to see if multiple gene copies were zzso The host zzso gene had multiple sequence zzso but zzso zzso contained only one zzso likely due to an amplification zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of five zzso zzso genes suggested that the zzso has a single sequence for each zzso but three host genes were found to have multiple zzso The zzso of zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso appears to have an organization more similar to other zzso than to the tandem gene arrangements found in zzso
