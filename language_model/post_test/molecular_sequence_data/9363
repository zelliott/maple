zzso associated zzso disorders zzso develop during progressive zzso infection and affect up to 50% of infected zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical cell populations that are involved in the zzso of zzso which is specifically related to the production and release of various soluble zzso factors including zzso In the central nervous system zzso zzso is typically derived from zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our previous study has shown that zzso is zzso in zzso infected zzso zzso and zzso However, how zzso leads to zzso zzso or how zzso expression is regulated in general, remains zzso In this study, using a zzso reporter zzso system, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso specifically activated the zzso 1 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment increased signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso stimulation of zzso promoter activity correlated to zzso zzso and was reduced by zzso a chemical that zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to directly bind to the zzso promoter in zzso an effect that was dependent on zzso zzso and significantly enhanced by zzso zzso More importantly, zzso infection increased zzso zzso and zzso binding to the zzso promoter, which was associated with increased zzso zzso The clinical relevance of these findings was further zzso with investigation of zzso brain zzso The zzso C zzso one zzso of zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso individuals correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that both zzso infection and zzso treatment increase zzso expression through zzso zzso and by binding to the zzso zzso Since zzso is a potential component of elevated zzso production during the zzso of zzso our data will help to identify additional therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso
