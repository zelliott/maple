A number of studies have found increased levels of zzso to human zzso zzso zzso in zzso rheumatic zzso It is not clear whether this immune response is driven by the zzso itself or by zzso with an zzso virus or an zzso To address this question, we examined the zzso response to the zzso protein of two closely related members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso By zzso of zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso of 84 zzso from patients with zzso rheumatic disease, and zzso of 35 normal zzso zzso mapping with overlapping zzso identified multiple zzso peptides on both zzso with one zzso containing zzso zzso By zzso the median zzso of zzso to this zzso was significantly increased in 39 patients with zzso compared to 39 healthy controls and 86 patients with other rheumatic diseases zzso zzso zzso We have shown that there is a high frequency of zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequences in human zzso both in health and zzso rheumatic disease, and that the response is to multiple zzso This supports the hypothesis that the zzso response to zzso is zzso and may be an early stage in the chain of events that leads to tolerance breakdown to other zzso
