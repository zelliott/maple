A zzso method using zzso DNA for zzso zzso was zzso To achieve specific amplification for detecting a single base difference between zzso zzso and other zzso zzso a primer having one extra mismatch at the second position from its zzso was zzso The primer exhibited a high specificity with zzso temperatures from 64 degrees C to 68 degrees zzso zzso Japanese samples were screened using this zzso The majority of Japanese zzso zzso were coded by zzso zzso and zzso were observed at relatively high zzso zzso defined split zzso zzso and zzso which we have recently identified, corresponded to zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was strongly associated with zzso and zzso
