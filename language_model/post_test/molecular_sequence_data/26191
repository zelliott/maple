The zzso of a zzso zzso analogue of zzso A, zzso in zzso solutions with respect to temperature was studied with zzso The equilibrium constant of unfolding yielded a straight line in a zzso zzso zzso In 10 zzso zzso delta G zzso zzso 120 zzso delta H zzso zzso 700 zzso and delta S zzso zzso zzso zzso units all on per zzso zzso These values compared fairly well with the zzso parameters of the zzso zzso transition of zzso in zzso M zzso based on the theories of zzso and Bragg and zzso and zzso The zzso was not unfolded at 75 degrees C zzso Even in water without zzso it was not a zzso zzso
