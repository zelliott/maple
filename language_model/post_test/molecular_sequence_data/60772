T cells expressing two different zzso were generated by zzso zzso and AND zzso zzso transgenic mice specific for the zzso egg zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in the offspring express two zzso V zzso and respond to zzso and zzso We observed minimal or no additive effects upon simultaneous zzso stimulation with both zzso zzso however, an zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was able to inhibit the response of the dual zzso T cells to zzso the AND zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso did not affect AND single transgenic T cells, indicating that the antagonism observed in the dual zzso cells is dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso antagonism exerts a dominant zzso
