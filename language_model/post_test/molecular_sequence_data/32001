The application of zzso profiling and mass zzso technologies has recently revealed that the human zzso is larger than previously zzso Short open reading frames zzso which are difficult to identify using traditional zzso zzso constitute a significant fraction of unknown zzso zzso Thus, experimental approaches to identify zzso provide invaluable insight into the zzso potential of zzso Here, we report an zzso approach to enrich and identify zzso human zzso zzso zzso from zzso This approach revealed 16 novel zzso each derived from an zzso zzso demonstrating its potential for discovering new zzso We validated expression of a zzso from its zzso zzso and demonstrated the specificity of our labeling approach using synthetic zzso The discovery of additional human zzso and their conservation indicate the potential importance of these molecules in zzso
