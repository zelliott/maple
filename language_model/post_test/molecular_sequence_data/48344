The evolution of zzso regulatory networks zzso the expansion and diversification of zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso defined by a highly zzso winged zzso zzso domain zzso has zzso into dozens of zzso in animals, zzso and related zzso We have used a combination of zzso zzso zzso and independent, comprehensive functional zzso of zzso capacity to explore the evolution of zzso specificity within the zzso zzso We present zzso evidence that similar alternative sequence preferences have arisen repeatedly and independently in the course of zzso zzso The vast majority of zzso specificity changes we observed are not explained by zzso in the known zzso zzso acid zzso zzso specificity for zzso zzso binding zzso zzso we have found zzso zzso that retain the ability to bind very specifically to two completely distinct DNA sequence zzso We propose an alternate zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso of the zzso broaden the spectrum of sequence motifs that a zzso can zzso zzso zzso suggests a previously zzso source of zzso and flexibility in gene regulation and may play an important role in the evolution of zzso regulatory zzso
