We have zzso a chemically zzso zzso form of an zzso zzso zzso zzso that displays zzso increased affinity for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso elevated potency in zzso zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso zzso as a branch zzso A zzso zzso was coupled to the zzso zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso in order to provide a zzso scaffold where both the zzso and zzso were of approximately equal zzso Using an zzso protection system, independently zzso zzso zzso were zzso upon this zzso The proposed mechanism of increased potency of the zzso over the parental compound zzso is consistent with the structure of a zzso of zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso is seen spanning the zzso between two molecules of the zzso zzso zzso
