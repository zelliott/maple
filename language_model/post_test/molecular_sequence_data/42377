zzso The zzso relationships for zzso zzso induction by zzso zzso were examined in the male zzso zzso zzso administered for 14 days at zzso zzso in the diet, caused zzso induction of zzso zzso protein and zzso and of zzso zzso activities zzso and zzso zzso and testosterone 16 zzso zzso values for zzso induction were zzso or zzso 300 zzso dietary zzso The zzso zzso observed were zzso of those resulting from exposure of the rats to 500 zzso dietary zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso induction were zzso zzso (based on serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in rats exposed to zzso were zzso of those resulting from exposure of the rats to 500 zzso dietary zzso zzso The zzso value for induction of zzso zzso in cultured rat zzso by zzso was determined to be zzso zzso The zzso induction of this activity caused by zzso was zzso of the maximum increases caused by zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is a highly effective zzso zzso in the rat when administered in the diet for 2 weeks at 1000 zzso When extent of induction is related to serum total zzso level, zzso would appear to be at least as potent as, if not more potent than, zzso in the zzso
