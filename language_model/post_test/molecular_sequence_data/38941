The zzso gene zzso zzso interacts genetically with the master regulatory gene for sex determination, zzso Both genes are required for the zzso of zzso patterns of alternative zzso on zzso and zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify the zzso zzso The zzso zzso unit generates two alternatively spliced zzso that can zzso two protein zzso differing at their zzso zzso The larger zzso contains a domain rich in zzso and zzso but has no significant zzso to proteins in zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that this protein is responsible for zzso zzso First, the zzso zzso that zzso zzso interrupts this zzso Second, zzso acid changes within this zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and the nature of the changes zzso with the severity of the zzso Third, all of the zzso associated with zzso zzso can be rescued by expression of this zzso in transgenic zzso zzso protein can be detected in extracts from zzso cell lines, zzso larvae, and adult animals, without apparent differences between zzso as well as in adult zzso zzso with a possible function in zzso regulation, zzso protein has nuclear zzso and is enriched in nuclear zzso
