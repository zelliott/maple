A new member of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso maturation activity was zzso and its zzso was cloned and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence consisting of 380 zzso was unique and was 38% identical to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor type 2 zzso The zzso factor expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells showed zzso activity on the induction of zzso maturation in zzso When injected into mice, the factor indeed zzso an increase in the number of zzso in zzso The sequence alignment indicated that the factor possessed a zzso zzso at the zzso position, suggesting that it might function as an inhibitor of zzso zzso Although we could not show any zzso activities toward several known zzso zzso we detected the activity toward zzso activity present in the culture zzso of zzso 201 zzso These results suggested that the protein might influence the maturation of zzso via action as a zzso
