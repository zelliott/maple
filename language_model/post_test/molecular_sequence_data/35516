Long zzso syndrome zzso is the most common cardiac zzso with 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cases remain genetically zzso 

We combined zzso sequencing and zzso biology to identify the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso in a zzso pedigree, and we established the spectrum and prevalence of zzso in the zzso gene among a cohort of 102 unrelated patients with zzso zzso zzso sequencing was used on 3 members within a zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso tools and ranking zzso led to the identification of a zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso with the disease within the pedigree, was ranked by 3 zzso zzso as the most probable zzso gene and involves a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that zzso leads to a gain of function with increased zzso and increased surface membrane expression of the channel compared to wild zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 3 additional zzso within zzso in our cohort of 102 unrelated cases of zzso zzso Two of these zzso also involve zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso zzso sequencing and zzso biology is an effective strategy for the identification of potential zzso zzso The identification of a functional zzso zzso zzso with disease in a single pedigree suggests that zzso zzso may zzso zzso dominant zzso in the absence of Timothy zzso
