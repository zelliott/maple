The zzso tumor zzso protein zzso is a zinc finger zzso factor that appears to function differently according to the presence of a zzso modification that adds three zzso acids into one of the zzso regions between the zinc zzso We have investigated the structural consequences of the zzso of the zzso zzso sequence by preparing zzso protein zzso of the four zinc finger zzso domain of zzso corresponding to the two zzso with zzso and without zzso the zzso which is located in the zzso region between the third and fourth zinc zzso zzso resonance assignments were used to estimate the structural differences between the two zzso both free in solution and in complex with a 14 base pair DNA duplex corresponding to the zzso recognition zzso The zzso zzso indicate that the two zzso are nearly identical in structure in the absence of the zzso Only the immediate region of the zzso showed any change in chemical zzso Upon DNA zzso the zzso spectrum of each zzso changed to indicate greater structure formation in the zzso zzso zzso differences were observed between the zzso of the DNA complexes of the zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso construct forming a more stable complex, consistent with prior zzso zzso The majority of the differences between the zzso of the two complexes occur in the immediate region of the zzso which appears to be closer in structure to the free form of the protein in the case of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso sequence zzso important interactions of the zzso region with the adjacent zinc fingers, thus lowering the stability of the zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso appears to be involved in a zzso zzso interaction with the zzso of the preceding zinc finger, a stabilizing interaction which is zzso in the zzso zzso
