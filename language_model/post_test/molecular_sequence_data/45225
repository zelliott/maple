The presence of a zzso zzso with each copy containing two zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been an obstacle to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso To create a system for expressing homogeneous zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and a final strain was successfully obtained with all the zzso zzso zzso zzso but carrying a zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso zzso The lag time required for growth response on zzso shift of zzso strains with zzso zzso or zzso zzso was increased 50 % over that of the zzso zzso however, the presence of the zzso zzso zzso restored the lag zzso The doubling time of zzso strains carrying only a functional zzso zzso but not strains carrying only a functional zzso zzso was significantly longer than that of the zzso zzso A strain in which essentially all the cellular zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso was temperature sensitive at 16 degrees C and 45 degrees zzso zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso of the zzso zzso in domain V of zzso coli zzso zzso
