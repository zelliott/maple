Mouse zzso is a prominent zzso zzso C zzso zzso implicated in brain development, zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso and is zzso regulated in a zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso regulation of mouse zzso promoter in the zzso derived immortalized zzso cells zzso was examined for a portion of zzso zzso sequence from zzso to zzso relative to the translation start zzso zzso experiments carried out in this neural cell line identified, for the first time, that the zzso promoter segment from zzso to zzso plays a crucial role as an zzso element in the zzso of the zzso zzso activity driven by zzso core promoter zzso zzso analyses revealed at least 12 overlapping potential zzso factor binding sites in this region, among which a prominent zzso sequence centered at zzso has been shown to be functionally important in the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso segment significantly reduced the zzso promoter zzso Further, competitive zzso indicated two additional sites within the zzso that may also interact with zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso function of zzso is under control of multiple zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso promoter zzso the zzso core promoter sequence zzso contains a zzso box and a zzso segment and is critical to zzso zzso The deletion of zzso segment has been shown to drastically impair the promoter activity even in the presence of zzso suggesting that its presence is also important to the function of zzso These data emphasize that the synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso promoter sequences is indispensable for the optimal zzso promoter function in the immortalized zzso zzso The discovery of the zzso function of the zzso zzso promoter region, and its potential interaction with multiple zzso proteins may provide a new clue to the understanding of Macs zzso regulation in zzso
