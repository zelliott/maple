Human zzso zzso replicate in zzso but not zzso zzso Several factors, including zzso zzso contribute to the zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso The binding of zzso upstream of the zzso type 18 early gene E6 is essential for zzso of the early zzso Here we show that zzso levels are low in early passage human zzso zzso In contrast, human zzso extracts contain high levels of zzso In agreement with this, in zzso an zzso promoter is more active in zzso than in zzso Pulse chase experiments indicated that zzso and zzso are relatively stable in human zzso cells after serum zzso whereas in early passage human zzso they are rapidly broken zzso Nuclear extracts of these zzso contain a zzso zzso which can degrade zzso Furthermore, the activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is elevated in these human zzso extracts relative to other cell zzso Interestingly, after several passages in culture the zzso lose this zzso activity and the amount of zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the quantitative difference in zzso proteins between human zzso and zzso is due to a difference in protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a candidate for a role in the unusually rapid breakdown of zzso in early passage human zzso zzso Low levels of zzso in the zzso correlate with the low activity of zzso zzso like that of zzso in these zzso
