About 8 zzso after the initiation of development in zzso zzso a few randomly scattered cells express zzso specific genes and subsequently sort out to the top of the zzso where they form a zzso The tip zzso and forms the anterior of the zzso zzso before zzso into a stalk which supports the ball of spores in a mature zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we isolated a zzso strain, zzso in which the initial zzso subdivides to give a highly zzso zzso This zzso fails to form zzso and appears to have a zzso in sorting of zzso zzso The disrupted zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso protein and is zzso expressed in zzso cells after the cell types have sorted zzso zzso strains that lack zzso express the zzso gene zzso at reduced levels and form very few zzso These defects cannot be overcome by developing the zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts in a zzso manner at an early stage in zzso Using strains carrying reporter zzso we found that zzso cells expressing a zzso marker remain dispersed in the zzso zzso cells appear to sort such that the base is free of cells expressing zzso zzso Even after 20 zzso of development, when zzso cells are undergoing terminal zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso form very small zzso most of which fail to sort to the periphery or the tops of zzso The zzso gene appears to play an essential role in the sorting of the initial cell zzso
