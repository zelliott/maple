Bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso of growth factors, a crucial group of regulators of induction and patterning of embryonic germ layers in zzso In early zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso can zzso zzso repress neural fate, and induce blood zzso These characteristic responses rely on zzso signaling zzso encompassing zzso zzso receptors and signal zzso belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to specifically zzso zzso zzso In a search for zzso of a zzso specificity code, we have identified two small regions within the zzso zzso that are necessary and sufficient for specific zzso zzso zzso both zzso clusters zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso completely switches zzso effects in zzso Thus, zzso with swapped zzso clusters responds specifically to zzso but elicits an zzso response, while a zzso protein containing the zzso clusters is activated by zzso and elicits a zzso zzso Furthermore, association between zzso and zzso a zzso of zzso induction by zzso is dependent upon the presence of the zzso C1 zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso can inhibit a zzso zzso harboring zzso C1 and C2 zzso Thus, the C1 and C2 regions of zzso specify the association between zzso and zzso partners, such as zzso and zzso and account for zzso and zzso specific responses in zzso zzso
