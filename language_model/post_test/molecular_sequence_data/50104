The zzso role of the zzso zzso fusion gene in the chronic phase of chronic zzso leukemia zzso has been well zzso contrast, the genetic mechanisms underlying the disease progression into the accelerated phase (AP) and the final blast crisis zzso remain poorly zzso We have previously identified zzso zzso et zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso 2002) two cryptic balanced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we show that a novel gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso is rearranged in both cases and that a zzso fusion gene is formed in the case with the zzso zzso The identified zzso zzso fusion transcript retains both of the zzso recognition motif zzso of zzso which is fused to the zzso domain of zzso and is likely to play an important role in the disease progression of zzso
