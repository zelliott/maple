zzso reverse zzso zzso has been successfully expressed as a biologically active zzso protein in zzso coli and zzso to zzso After partial zzso zzso was obtained primarily in a zzso form represented by two zzso of 66 and 51 zzso but the preparation also included several forms distinguishable in size and charge by zzso on zzso and zzso zzso We have developed a zzso method that yields a single zzso form of zzso Our strategy involves the selection of zzso molecules exhibiting uniformity in zzso from zzso zzso zzso columns and zzso 12 zzso zzso In the former, zzso is resolved into multiple zzso on the basis of zzso activity, one of which represents highly active and pure zzso zzso zzso This highly active zzso zzso after zzso zzso yields a zzso pure protein product free of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso under a variety of zzso Furthermore, the zzso H zzso activity associated with zzso zzso has been demonstrated to zzso with the zzso zzso activity during gel zzso at a size zzso zzso consistent with its location on the zzso protein zzso
