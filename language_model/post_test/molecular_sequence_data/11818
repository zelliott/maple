zzso cell zzso to the zzso domain of basement membrane zzso zzso collagen occurs at several different zzso Cellular recognition of the sequence spanning alpha zzso has been proposed to be independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Fields, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso interactions with a zzso analog of the alpha zzso sequence have been zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso to the alpha zzso chemically zzso zzso was inhibited by a zzso zzso against the alpha 3 zzso zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso zzso against the beta 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso An zzso 5 zzso zzso and normal mouse zzso were ineffective as zzso of tumor cell zzso to the zzso Two cell surface proteins of 120 and 150 zzso bound to an alpha zzso zzso affinity column and were zzso with 20 zzso zzso When the zzso proteins were incubated with zzso zzso against either the alpha 3 or beta 1 zzso zzso proteins corresponding in molecular weight to alpha 3 and beta 1 zzso zzso were zzso No proteins were zzso with zzso zzso against the alpha 2 or alpha 5 zzso zzso Thus, the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso from two tumor cell types has been shown to bind directly to the alpha 1 zzso zzso The alpha zzso zzso is the first zzso sequence that has been shown to bind the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso
