DNA zzso III, the main zzso zzso of zzso coli, contains a small zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso and appears to enhance the zzso zzso zzso under extreme zzso It was recently discovered that zzso coli zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso named zzso The zzso zzso spectrum of HOT exhibits more uniform zzso and less evidence of zzso exchange than that of zzso this uniformity zzso a determination of the HOT solution structure by zzso The structure contains three alpha zzso as reported previously for zzso however, the folding zzso of the two proteins is very zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on labeled zzso support the conclusion that it is structurally zzso with zzso As judged by CD zzso the melting temperature of HOT was 62 degrees C, compared to 56 degrees C for zzso consistent with other data suggesting greater zzso stability of the HOT zzso
