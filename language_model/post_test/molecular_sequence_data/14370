zzso of zzso zzso transfer protein zzso expression mainly occurs at the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso gene expression was zzso in zzso zzso cells by nuclear zzso 2 family 1 zzso However, mechanisms involved in the repression of zzso by zzso were not zzso Here, we show that zzso expression requires zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso Different zzso proteins zzso enhance zzso promoter activity along with zzso by binding to different zzso zzso zzso does not alter individual effects of zzso and zzso proteins on the zzso gene zzso However, zzso suppresses synergistic zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso by binding to a direct repeat 1 zzso zzso This suppression is further enhanced in the presence of nuclear zzso zzso zzso In short, these studies identified a novel mechanism of zzso repression that involves binding of zzso to the zzso element and recruitment of zzso In this zzso zzso does not affect activities of individual zzso zzso instead, it abrogates synergistic zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
