A procedure is described for the efficient preparation of zzso enriched zzso of defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from zzso grown on zzso and/or zzso zzso enriched zzso These procedures routinely yield 180 zzso of zzso zzso per gram of zzso enriched zzso The zzso zzso were then used to zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso Several zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso have been zzso for the sequence zzso Under conditions of high salt or low salt, this zzso forms either a symmetrical duplex with two zzso base pairs or a hairpin containing a zzso loop zzso These procedures were used to zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso only on the G and C zzso The ability to generate zzso quantities of zzso zzso zzso allows application of zzso zzso magnetic resonance experiments that enormously simplify the resonance assignment and solution structure determination of zzso Examples of several such zzso zzso experiments are zzso
