The zzso protein zzso is a zzso unfolded protein in solution, yet it is able to zzso into the ordered paired zzso filaments zzso of Alzheimer's zzso In the zzso zzso lacking zzso 10, this process is facilitated by the formation of zzso around the zzso motif zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso We have investigated the structural requirements for zzso zzso in the context of adult zzso zzso containing four repeats (including zzso zzso In addition to the zzso motif there exists a related zzso motif zzso in the repeat zzso by the alternatively spliced zzso zzso We show that this zzso motif also promotes zzso by the formation of zzso and that there is a zzso between the two zzso motifs during zzso zzso We also show that two of the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a much stronger tendency for zzso zzso which zzso with their high propensity for zzso around the zzso zzso
