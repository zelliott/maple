zzso inhibitor zzso is a complex protein made up of a light chain so-called zzso and two heavy chains zzso Mr values zzso and zzso in zzso in zzso zzso By sequence analysis, we clearly identified those two components as zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that alkaline treatment zzso zzso during 5 zzso at room zzso as well as zzso zzso both lead to the zzso of zzso The conditions used for alkaline treatment were previously reported for zzso of the zzso linkage between zzso and zzso inside zzso inhibitor zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the two heavy chains isolated by zzso zzso suggests the presence of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and that of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso from zzso zzso by zzso in agreement with the existence of at least one zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso remains strongly bound to this support when submitted to the same zzso Therefore this binding does not depend on zzso The capacity of zzso to develop such interactions is discussed with regard to the unusual zzso likely to exist between the different zzso chains zzso zzso
