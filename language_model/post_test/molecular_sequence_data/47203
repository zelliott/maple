The zzso zzso zzso cycle is characterized by the contraction of three distinct sets of muscles every 50 zzso Our data indicate that this cycle is regulated by periodic calcium release zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso slow down or eliminate the cycle, while zzso speeds up the zzso The zzso zzso controls these periodic muscle zzso zzso from the zzso In the zzso cells, calcium levels zzso with the same period as the zzso cycle and peak calcium levels immediately zzso the first muscle zzso zzso in the zzso zzso slow or eliminate these calcium zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso for this cycle and represents a novel mechanism for the control of behavioral zzso
