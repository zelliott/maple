zzso zzso proteins zzso are proposed to capture and transport zzso chemicals across the zzso zzso to zzso receptors zzso but this has not been clarified in zzso In this study, we built on our previously reported segment sequence work and cloned the full length zzso gene zzso from the antennae of zzso zzso by using rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso real zzso zzso zzso indicated that the gene was expressed in a unique profile, zzso zzso in antennae and significantly higher in male than in zzso To explore the function, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli cells and zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso affinities of the zzso zzso with 39 plant zzso 3 sex zzso components and 10 zzso zzso were measured using fluorescent competitive binding zzso The results showed that 6 plant zzso displayed high binding affinities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more interesting, the 3 sex zzso components and zzso showed even higher binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Those results suggest that zzso plays a role in reception of female sex zzso of zzso zzso and host plant zzso
