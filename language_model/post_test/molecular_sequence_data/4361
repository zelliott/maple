A gene similar to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was localized on the zzso map between zzso and 29 map units and is flanked by a zzso gene and zzso zzso This gene arrangement differs from that of similar genes in the zzso zzso where the zzso gene is located about 62 zzso from the zzso gene and about 7 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso gene revealed an zzso of zzso zzso predicted to zzso a protein with Mr zzso The putative protein is zzso identical to the zzso zzso and contains an identical sequence of a zzso motif of zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso gene contain two sequence repeats which resemble a repeated motif of the zzso zzso element and other repetitive sequences from the viral zzso
