zzso zzso zzso from the small zzso of control rats and rats infected with the zzso zzso zzso were released and analyzed by gas zzso zzso zzso animals expressed seven blood group zzso structures that were all absent in the control zzso The blood group A nature of these zzso was confirmed by blood group A zzso of the prepared zzso of which zzso was zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso on small zzso from infected animals showed that an zzso similar to the human blood group A zzso had been zzso The expression was a transient event, with a maximum at day 6 of the zzso zzso The rat blood group A zzso was zzso revealing two forms with an zzso acid similarity of zzso Both types had blood group A zzso activity and were probably zzso because none of 12 analyzed zzso strains carried both zzso The second type was found in zzso rats and in one zzso zzso First generation offspring of zzso rats of each type were zzso further supporting the zzso zzso The transient induction and the large zzso variation could suggest that zzso are part of a dynamic system altering zzso and other zzso as a protecting mechanism against microbial zzso
