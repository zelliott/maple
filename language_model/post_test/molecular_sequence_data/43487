Members of the zzso family of peptides exert zzso effects and induce zzso in zzso cell zzso In the zzso zzso these peptides not only regulate normal cell growth, but zzso in these pathways have been associated with zzso zzso zzso the identification of molecules that regulate zzso pancreatic cell proliferation and zzso cell death in response to zzso peptides is necessary for a better understanding of normal zzso as well as zzso of the zzso In this study, we have characterized the expression and function in zzso pancreatic zzso cells of the zzso early gene zzso a zzso zinc finger zzso factor zzso gene previously isolated from zzso derived zzso zzso We demonstrate that this gene is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso cell populations from the zzso zzso In addition, we show that the expression of zzso is regulated by zzso as an early response gene in pancreatic zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso is sufficient to induce zzso Together, these results support a role for zzso in linking zzso signaling zzso to the regulation of pancreatic zzso cell zzso
