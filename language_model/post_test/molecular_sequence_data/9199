zzso zzso zzso from severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus is one of the two zzso involved in the zzso processing of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso shows significant in zzso zzso and zzso zzso All these findings demonstrated the zzso nature of the zzso Here we report the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso An increase in zzso concentration induced a zzso zzso unfolding of the zzso zzso the unfolding of the zzso zzso region located within the palm and thumb zzso followed a zzso unfolding zzso Further observations suggest that the zzso domain may start to unfold during the first zzso An zzso lost of its zzso activity at a zzso concentration lower than zzso showed a close correlation with unfolding of the zzso zzso The zzso was also characterized in terms of zzso and zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso displayed differential domain structure stability and molten zzso state in its zzso These studies will not only assist in our understanding of the folding of this viral zzso but also that of other zzso zzso with a similar zzso
