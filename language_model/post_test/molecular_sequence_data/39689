It has been shown that a repetitive motif with the sequence zzso within the zzso zzso zzso serves as an zzso for the zzso zzso and equivalent zzso However, no direct correlation between zzso towards zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso tissue could be zzso In this study our aim was the isolation and characterization of new zzso zzso equivalent zzso in an in zzso zzso To select zzso zzso zzso zzso we used a large zzso zzso library (Human zzso zzso zzso zzso We implemented a panning strategy against two different overlapping zzso both containing the zzso zzso zzso screening of randomly picked zzso zzso clones after the third selection round yielded six highly zzso clones against the zzso zzso of which five were found to be zzso in zzso zzso showing a zzso equivalent zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis on zzso zzso of the new zzso zzso zzso and of the established zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso were carried out to compare their fine zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso is critical for recognition of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
