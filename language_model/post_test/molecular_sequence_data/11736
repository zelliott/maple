General equations are derived for the limit yield zzso zzso of the zzso reaction between zzso zzso zzso X bearing zzso zzso and zzso target P encompassing the sequence complementary to X in the presence of one or two zzso zzso E1 and zzso The zzso form the complementary tandem sequence zzso at the zzso It is shown that association zzso characterizing the affinity of the zzso X to the zzso containing complexes zzso zzso and zzso may be calculated from the zzso of zzso zzso on the initial concentration zzso 0 of X providing the sufficient excess of zzso is zzso The approach was applied to reaction of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso where zzso is zzso zzso and L is zzso zzso The association zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the affinity of X to P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The experiments on zzso of target zzso zzso zzso both in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso as well as the zzso Mechanics calculations of its zzso states showed target to form the hairpin secondary zzso Under reasonable suggestions taking into account the internal structure of the target zzso parameters describing the contribution of interactions of the terminal zzso of X with adjacent zzso of zzso were calculated and found to be alpha 1 zzso 16, alpha 2 zzso 10 and alpha 12 zzso 139 for the duplexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso
