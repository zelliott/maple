The zzso C virus zzso zzso protein is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso To identify the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and subjected to zzso acid analysis and zzso zzso These data identified the major zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso protein as zzso a result verified by two zzso independent zzso zzso substitution of Ala for zzso and the zzso disappearance of the major in zzso zzso peptides and corresponding in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso products of a synthetic zzso zzso on zzso with the major in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggested that zzso of zzso is zzso for previously described interactions with zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso that does not appear to catalyze zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that a zzso zzso is responsible for the majority of zzso zzso zzso consistent with previous zzso inhibitor zzso
