We have cloned and characterized multiple messages for zzso B that differ in their zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso from human kidney and the zzso cell line zzso A comparison of these messages with the cloned human zzso B gene reveals that they arise by alternative zzso of a single zzso zzso at a cryptic zzso donor site in zzso 11 and zzso to zzso 12 produces a zzso message with an alternate 3' zzso in addition to the zzso message described previously by Chan et zzso zzso zzso removal of zzso 2 produces zzso B zzso which differ by 88 zzso in their zzso The ratio of the zzso to zzso transcript is about zzso in most of the zzso zzso but the ratio of zzso with zzso zzso zzso differs zzso zzso B zzso lacking zzso 2 are zzso in human zzso In addition, human breast and colon zzso and a human melanoma contain a zzso B transcript that is also missing zzso 3 zzso the signal zzso and 7 zzso of the zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso was used to demonstrate that this message could be translated from an internal zzso zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso product lacking the signal zzso and more than half the zzso The zzso zzso also demonstrated that the zzso messages differ in their rates of zzso The relative rates are about zzso for zzso lacking zzso 2 and 3 compared to zzso lacking zzso 2 and zzso containing the full-length zzso end, zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso B in human zzso may be regulated in part at the level of zzso zzso
