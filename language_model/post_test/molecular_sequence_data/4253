zzso of the pea zzso gene zzso is regulated by light in both pea and transgenic tobacco zzso However, the zzso promoter with the zzso untranslated leader region does not direct zzso expression of the zzso reporter gene in transgenic zzso This suggested that sequences downstream of the translation start of the zzso gene are required for zzso zzso To investigate this possibility the expression of a series of zzso gene zzso in transgenic tobacco plants was examined to assess the contributions of the promoter, the zzso untranslated leader region, the coding region and the 3' region of the zzso gene to zzso zzso Both the coding region and the zzso untranslated leader region of the zzso gene were found to be required for full light zzso Full light regulation of zzso gene zzso containing the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso promoter required the deletion of zzso zzso leader and zzso sequences from the zzso The presence of zzso and zzso sequences at the zzso end of the zzso leader masked the light regulation directed by the transcribed region of the pea zzso zzso
