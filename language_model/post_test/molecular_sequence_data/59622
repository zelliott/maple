Genes of the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the earliest steps of zzso patterning in zzso In zzso the zzso gene is a candidate for the zzso of axis zzso its zzso and protein are broadly but appropriately localized at the start of development, and processed zzso protein is a powerful zzso of organized zzso tissue in zzso animal caps in zzso and when locally produced in zzso after injection of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso processing occurs zzso for most zzso beta members, producing the active zzso zzso but is tightly zzso by unknown mechanisms, for zzso zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso This restriction may be involved in the spatial zzso of activity required for an organizing zzso 

We have characterized an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and examined its zzso zzso The early expression of zzso includes a phase broadly related to the known time and site of axis zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso of zzso is zzso in the zzso marginal zone zzso a region of the zzso known to contain the zzso organizing activity at this zzso We also observed later neural and zzso zzso expression of zzso which has not been described previously for zzso zzso in other zzso We have grafted zzso zzso cells, producing processed zzso zzso to peripheral positions around the chick early zzso Such zzso initiate formation of zzso complete primitive streaks, simulating the properties of zzso from the zzso 

In zzso development, zzso genes may be required for an zzso zzso early step in positioning or induction of the zzso
