zzso is a major structural component of thick filaments isolated from many zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was identified by screening with specific zzso an zzso library containing zzso gene zzso Short zzso recovered from the library were used to identify zzso zzso and zzso clones that zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso From these zzso numerous zzso containing zzso reacting with zzso zzso were zzso providing strong evidence that the initial cloned zzso was, in fact, derived from the structural gene for zzso The complete zzso sequence of a 12 zzso zzso zzso region spanning the gene was zzso The gene is composed of ten short zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is highly similar to zzso 267 to zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso For most of its zzso zzso appears to form an zzso zzso and shows the expected zzso repeat of zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso repeat of charged zzso acids characteristic of zzso heavy chain zzso However, zzso differs from zzso in having zzso extensions at both the N and C zzso and an additional zzso zzso that interrupts the zzso zzso The distribution of charges along the length of the zzso rod is also significantly different from that of zzso heavy chain zzso Potential zzso interactions between zzso rods and between zzso and zzso rods were calculated using a model successfully applied previously to the analysis of the zzso rod zzso zzso rods aligned in parallel show optimal zzso interactions at multiples of 98 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso of multiples of 143 zzso zzso zzso in contrast, appear to interact zzso at parallel zzso of 493 zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso zzso but show only weak interaction zzso at 98 or 296 zzso Similar calculations suggest optimal interactions between zzso molecules and zzso rods and in their zzso zzso The implications of these results for the structure of the bare zone and the assembly of zzso thick filaments are zzso
