zzso Regulatory Factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor, involved in cell growth regulation, pathogen response and immune zzso To identify novel gene targets that may contribute to zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso was performed using zzso cells that zzso express a hybrid form of zzso under zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso - a regulator of inflammation and an inhibitor of the zzso response - was identified as a gene zzso after zzso induced zzso zzso zzso analysis of the human zzso promoter identified an zzso site located within the zzso to zzso region to which zzso binds and a second, putative zzso binding site upstream of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies demonstrated that zzso expression was inhibited by zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a target of zzso regulation reveals a unique involvement of zzso in repression of gene zzso and assigns a novel role for zzso in zzso
