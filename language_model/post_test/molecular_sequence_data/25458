A new zzso for zzso metabolism of zzso which proceeds via zzso has recently been revealed in a zzso strain zzso This bacterial strain was found to contain a small zzso zzso zzso which appears to zzso the genes zzso for two key zzso catalyzing the initial reactions of the pathway, zzso zzso A zzso and zzso A zzso The evidence is as zzso The zzso content of the culture varied by a factor of ten depending on the growth zzso it was highest when cells were grown zzso on zzso The zzso zzso could be introduced into zzso coli strain zzso by zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso coli zzso are unable to metabolize zzso whereas the transformed zzso coli zzso cells could grow with this aromatic compound as sole organic zzso and zzso it completely to zzso The zzso recovered from zzso coli had the same restriction map as the original zzso but was zzso The two key zzso activities were demonstrated in the transformed zzso coli in sufficiently high amounts to explain zzso They appear to be regulated on the zzso level by zzso they were formed only during zzso growth in the presence of zzso as in the parent zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was similar to the consensus sequence of the zzso binding site of different zzso The data also prove that the zzso with two zzso functions is a alpha 2 zzso Southern zzso of zzso zzso and zzso DNA and zzso against a zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso revealed that the gene for this zzso is coded on the zzso rather than on the zzso The gene was localized on a zzso restriction zzso The formation of zzso zzso protein in transformed zzso coli was demonstrated by Western zzso of proteins of cell extracts separated by zzso The zzso protein band, which was stained by a procedure based on zzso against zzso zzso was demonstrated in transformed zzso zzso
