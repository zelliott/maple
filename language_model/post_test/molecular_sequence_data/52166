zzso acid zzso was shown to be the zzso of zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso ring during the zzso of zzso B12 in zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be a complex zzso composed of two different components of zzso 140,000 and zzso which were zzso to zzso The zzso component was shown to be coded by zzso whereas the zzso component was composed of two zzso specified by zzso and zzso Each component was inactive by itself, but zzso activity was zzso upon mixing zzso and zzso The reaction was zzso dependent, and the zzso values for zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 220 zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso data revealed that the reaction product was zzso acid zzso and experiments with a zzso incubation system containing both zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992) confirmed this zzso This report not only provides the first evidence that zzso acid and its zzso zzso are indeed precursors of zzso but also demonstrates that zzso zzso and zzso three established precursors of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cameron, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also on the zzso to zzso
