zzso is one of the major proteins found within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Previous work has shown that it binds zzso and with high affinity to zzso groups on zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby leading to the hypothesis that at zzso it functions as a secondary zzso zzso to retain zzso zzso on the surface of the zzso In the present work we have investigated the nature and extent of the zzso binding domain on zzso zzso zzso using a combination of zzso zzso zzso fragmentation analysis, zzso synthesis and expression of deletion zzso in zzso coli zzso Taken overall, our results show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso located between zzso 93 and Ala zzso together with the participation of His 47 and zzso 50, are necessary for maximum zzso binding zzso The secondary and zzso structure of this central zzso domain is also important to ensure correct alignment of basic zzso with complementary zzso groups on zzso zzso therefore, has many properties in common with other zzso binding zzso such as zzso III and sea zzso zzso zzso in having a zzso domain containing basic zzso acids that mediates specific zzso zzso These observations strengthen the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso protein with a major role as a zzso zzso at zzso
