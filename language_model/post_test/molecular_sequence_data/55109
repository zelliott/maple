zzso are vital for life and regulate an array of zzso functions by binding to the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso Previous studies demonstrate striking breed differences in plasma cortisol levels in zzso However, investigation into the zzso zzso zzso regulation is hampered by lacking zzso zzso promoter zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso upstream of the translation start zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and identified seven alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among all these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the total zzso were expressed significantly zzso higher in the liver of newborn zzso of Large White zzso compared with zzso a Chinese indigenous zzso zzso level of zzso zzso in the region zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show breed zzso However, nuclear content of zzso zzso and zzso in the liver was significantly zzso higher in LW zzso associated with enhanced binding of zzso and higher level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binding to promoters of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly diminished in LW zzso implicating the presence of negative zzso These results indicate that the difference in the zzso expression of zzso transcript zzso between two breeds of pigs is determined, at least partly, by the disparity in the binding of zzso factors and the enrichment of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso
