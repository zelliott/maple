The zzso open reading frame zzso the zzso protein zzso represents the largest open reading frame in the zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein are present in all zzso of zzso We zzso the zzso gene of the zzso zzso virus zzso and prepared a zzso zzso rabbit zzso against a bacterial zzso zzso zzso fusion protein for identification of the zzso The zzso detected a zzso protein in zzso cells and in zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso the zzso serum zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso directed against the zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso This physical interaction could be verified using zzso zzso analysis which demonstrated that the zzso protein interacts with a defined region within the zzso part of the zzso zzso By use of zzso zzso zzso which accumulate in the zzso in the absence of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001) as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decorated by the zzso zzso whereas zzso primary enveloped zzso were zzso We zzso that the physical interaction of the zzso zzso which presumably constitutes the zzso layer of the zzso zzso Zhou, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein is an important early step in zzso during zzso zzso in the zzso
