The protein zzso zzso zzso are now recognized as critical regulators of signal zzso under normal and zzso zzso In this analysis we have explored the sequence of the human zzso to define the composition of the zzso zzso Using public and proprietary sequence databases, we discovered one novel human zzso gene and defined zzso zzso and zzso structure of the additional 37 genes zzso known zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in the mouse zzso for all 38 human zzso zzso In addition, we identified 12 zzso zzso unique to humans that have probably contaminated previous zzso analysis of this gene zzso zzso amplification and transcript sequencing indicate that some zzso zzso are zzso but their function (if zzso is zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the enhanced diversity generated by alternative zzso and provide predicted zzso acid sequences for four human zzso that are currently defined by fragments zzso Finally, we correlated each zzso locus with genetic disease markers and identified 4 zzso that map to known zzso zzso for type 2 diabetes and 19 zzso that map to regions frequently deleted in human zzso We have made our analysis available at zzso or zzso and we hope this resource will facilitate the functional characterization of these key zzso
