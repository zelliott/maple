zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the reduction of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Each has an zzso zzso structure with each zzso playing a critical role in zzso zzso of the zzso results in loss of zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that peptides corresponding to the zzso of zzso disrupt zzso association by zzso with zzso and have potential usefulness as zzso zzso zzso studies have been carried out on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in an effort to develop zzso agents based on the observation that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is quite different from the corresponding zzso zzso In this work we report a detailed zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso and, to a more limited extent, zzso zzso zzso Our results for zzso zzso support the following conclusions with regard to the effect of substitution on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the minimal core zzso length zzso deletion of the zzso or of middle positions zzso in zzso and zzso results in large losses in zzso zzso zzso a free zzso is required on the zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly preferred to zzso in positions 1 and 7 and a bulky zzso group is preferred in position zzso zzso neither negative charge in positions 2 or 4 nor a polar side chain in position 6 are required for zzso zzso contrary to what evolutionary patterns in the zzso zzso of zzso would zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a similar length dependence on the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso has a zzso higher zzso potency toward zzso zzso zzso than toward zzso zzso Such selectivity raises the possibility that zzso zzso related to zzso zzso can be developed as therapeutic agents even against organisms having zzso zzso sequences similar to that of zzso zzso
