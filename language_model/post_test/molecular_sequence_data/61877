zzso zzso mediate retrograde transport from the zzso back to the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso precursor of the zzso coat, the zzso zzso complex, can be thought of as composed of two zzso The first consists of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The second consists of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present the structure of the zzso domain of zzso and show that it has a similar overall fold as the zzso of zzso Again, like the zzso the zzso zzso possesses a single zzso interaction site on its platform zzso We show that in zzso this site binds to the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso this site binds to a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a second binding site is proposed to exist on the zzso zzso that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso
