zzso diabetes of the young zzso is a genetically and clinically zzso type of diabetes zzso characterized by early onset zzso before 25 years of zzso and absence of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso functions as a zzso zzso and is involved in the differentiation of zzso zzso Here we identified a novel zzso zzso in a Japanese patient with zzso A 15-year-old, non-obese boy was admitted to our hospital because of zzso and zzso Laboratory evaluation showed an elevated zzso zzso zzso however, zzso cell zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso were not detected in the patient's zzso The zzso father had been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes at age of 30 zzso We therefore analyzed several candidate genes of zzso and identified a novel zzso of a zzso zzso deletion in zzso 3 zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and his zzso This zzso may cause zzso 3 skipping that results in a zzso thereby producing a premature stop zzso in zzso zzso As this zzso zzso lacks a part of the zzso that is critical for binding to the target zzso this zzso was thought to lose the zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso could not repress the activities of insulin and zzso gene zzso unlike the zzso zzso that zzso the promoter zzso The present study demonstrates that a novel zzso of zzso is likely to be associated with diabetes in this Japanese zzso
