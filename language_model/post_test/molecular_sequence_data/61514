To disclose mechanisms of zzso zzso and to identify novel diagnostic markers and/or drug targets for treatment of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed expression profiles of clinical zzso using a zzso zzso zzso From among the transcripts that were commonly zzso in these tumors we identified a novel human gene at zzso band zzso termed zzso zzso and differentiation enhancing zzso 1), zzso a product that shared structural features with zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso zzso to zzso zzso and differentiation enhancing zzso and contained an zzso zzso protein zzso domain and two zzso zzso Gene transfer of zzso promoted proliferation of cells that lacked zzso expression of this zzso Furthermore, reduction of zzso expression by zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cancer cells, in which zzso expression was highly zzso Our results provide novel insight into zzso and may contribute to development of new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of zzso
