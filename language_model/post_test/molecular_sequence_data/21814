zzso to zzso zzso a major pathogen of epidemic zzso is associated with zzso group zzso zzso which are also cell attachment factors for this zzso zzso zzso strains are predominantly associated with worldwide zzso zzso with a periodic emergence of new zzso The sequence variations in the zzso P domain of the zzso protein resulting in differential zzso binding patterns and zzso are suggested to drive zzso zzso zzso To understand how zzso sequence variations affect the P domain structure and contribute to zzso evolution, we determined the P domain structure of a 2004 zzso with zzso and zzso Lewis zzso and compared it with the previously determined structure of a 1996 zzso We show that zzso sequence variations do not affect the binding of zzso zzso zzso but that they can zzso the binding strength of zzso Lewis zzso and thus could contribute to zzso evolution by the zzso targeting of new zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso variations also result in significant differences in the zzso zzso likely reflecting zzso zzso The proximity of some of these changes to the zzso binding sites suggests the possibility of a coordinated interplay between zzso and zzso binding in zzso zzso From the observation that the regions involved in the formation of the zzso binding sites can be zzso flexible, we suggest a plausible mechanism for how zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso before zzso with zzso linked to zzso zzso cells during its passage through the gastrointestinal zzso
