zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has been implicated in the transition from zzso to S phase in the cell cycle of budding zzso A zzso zzso mass zzso technique was used to map zzso zzso zzso sites in zzso both in zzso and in zzso A zzso zzso lacking three zzso zzso sites did not serve as a zzso for zzso zzso in zzso was stable in zzso and blocked DNA zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicating that a primary function of zzso zzso is to tag zzso for zzso These data suggest a molecular model of how zzso and zzso cooperate to bring about the zzso transition in budding zzso
