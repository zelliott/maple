The line of human colon zzso cells known as zzso contains an amplified and abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and most of zzso 1 of zzso have been displaced from zzso by a zzso of zzso The zzso transcribed from zzso is a zzso that begins with an zzso sequence of 176 zzso and then continues with zzso 2 and 3 of zzso The template for the zzso sequence represents zzso 1 of a gene known as zzso which lies 50 zzso pairs downstream of zzso We encountered three abnormal zzso of zzso and zzso in the cell lines analyzed here: zzso amplification of the zzso accompanied by zzso of zzso 1 and an zzso additional portion of zzso within zzso 1 of zzso to create zzso zzso selective deletion of zzso 1 of zzso from amplified DNA that contains downstream portions of zzso and an intact zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 1 of zzso but not of downstream portions of zzso We conclude that part or all of zzso is frequently amplified with zzso and that zzso 1 of zzso represents a preferred boundary for amplification affecting zzso
