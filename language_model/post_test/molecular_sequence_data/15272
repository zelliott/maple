zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is a part of the zzso zzso Complex zzso which connects the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso end of zzso contains a number of putative zzso zzso and WW domain binding zzso The most zzso zzso motif has been established as a binding site for zzso zzso zzso However, our previous studies indicate that both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can bind zzso protein in zzso 

We now find that both WW binding sites are important for maintaining full zzso function in the establishment of zzso polarity in zzso If either WW binding site is zzso the zzso protein can still be zzso However, simultaneous zzso in both WW binding sites abolish the zzso activities in both zzso and zzso zzso polarity zzso in zzso Additionally, sequence comparisons of WW binding sites in 12 species of zzso as well as in humans, reveal a high level of zzso This preservation throughout evolution supports the idea that both WW binding sites are functionally zzso 

Based on the obtained results we propose that the presence of the two WW binding sites in zzso zzso the essential interaction between zzso and zzso and might further provide additional regulation for the zzso interactions of this zzso
