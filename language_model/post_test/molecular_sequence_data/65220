zzso zzso is the major surface zzso of zzso bacteria and consists of three distinct structural zzso zzso core, and zzso zzso The zzso A zzso domain of zzso is a unique, zzso zzso that serves as the zzso anchor of zzso and is the zzso component of the zzso that is associated with zzso septic zzso The structural genes zzso the zzso required for the zzso of zzso coli zzso A have been identified and zzso zzso A is often viewed as a zzso zzso structural zzso However, determination of the exact chemical structures of zzso A from diverse zzso bacteria shows that the zzso can be further modified in response to environmental zzso These modifications have been implicated in zzso of zzso zzso bacteria and represent one of the molecular mechanisms of microbial surface zzso used by bacteria to help evade the innate immune zzso The intent of this review is to discuss the zzso machinery involved in the zzso of zzso A, transport of the zzso and finally, those zzso involved in the modification of its structure in response to environmental zzso
