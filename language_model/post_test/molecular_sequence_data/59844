zzso clones zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso VIII of the complex from zzso zzso by zzso were identified on the basis of functional zzso of a zzso zzso deletion zzso The clones contain an open reading frame zzso a protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso eight zzso of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso clones are absent from the mature zzso as revealed by direct sequencing of the isolated zzso To investigate the potential role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were made zzso the precursor and the mature form of zzso zzso from zzso zzso of isolated zzso with the two proteins revealed that the zzso extension of the precursor is removed on zzso However, the zzso does not zzso information for zzso as the proteins zzso by both zzso can be imported into isolated zzso with equal zzso In contrast, the zzso seems to have functional zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso on transformation with the construct zzso mature zzso zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We therefore speculate that the zzso extension plays a role in zzso sorting of zzso zzso zzso zzso This is supported by the fact that the zzso zzso precursor is processed by a zzso other than the general zzso processing zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso acid composition similar to the zzso zzso off by the zzso intermediate zzso
