We have compared selected zzso properties of three zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of them belong to a recently identified family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folding stability, protein fluorescence, zzso behavior, and the effects of zzso were conducted, revealing differences between the plant and the zzso zzso According to CD zzso the latter protein exhibits an zzso + zzso fold rather than an zzso fold as found with zzso zzso zzso The zzso structural reorganization recently found for the plant protein by X-ray zzso could not be detected by CD zzso due to its only marginal effect on the total percentage of zzso zzso However, in the present study a zzso effect was also observed for the zzso zzso The zzso activity of wild type zzso zzso zzso as well as of four zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso and the results prove the requirement of all four zzso of the previously identified tandem signature motif for the zzso zzso Within the comparison of the three proteins in this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares more similarities with the plant than with the zzso zzso
