A zzso zzso zzso tentatively named zzso was amplified by a mixed zzso amplification of zzso from zzso mouse zzso zzso cells, designated zzso that had been treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso A set of zzso zzso zzso that were targeted to two zzso regions of known zzso zzso zzso were zzso One primer was coded for the zzso and zzso zzso region of zzso zzso and the second was designed based upon other considerations of zzso among zzso zzso One of the four zzso zzso products zzso to two major zzso bands, zzso and zzso zzso that were induced by zzso or zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso deduced from the zzso data indicate that the amplified zzso has a zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso preceded the induction of zzso hydrocarbon zzso activity after zzso or BA treatment, suggesting that the product of zzso is involved in the metabolism of these zzso aromatic zzso in zzso zzso From the partial sequence of the zzso identified by this zzso we propose that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso possibly in a zzso of family 1, that is induced in zzso cells by zzso and zzso This method should be useful in identifying additional zzso genes and genes in other gene zzso
