A cellular zzso factor, zzso binds to a repeated element in the zzso early region 4 zzso zzso zzso also binds to other viral early promoter regions and to the zzso zzso zzso response elements of cellular zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a single zzso site located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso box, between zzso and zzso mediates induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso toxin in the human zzso cell line zzso and rat zzso cell line zzso Different zzso sites in the zzso control region independently zzso zzso zzso on the zzso virus 40 early promoter in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso was also observed in zzso zzso zzso Other viral early promoter regions that contain zzso sites zzso and zzso were also induced by zzso in infected zzso zzso expression was activated by the zzso zzso zzso products in zzso zzso zzso trans zzso appears to be distinct from the zzso zzso
