This study reveals zzso zzso in long zzso repeats zzso in several zzso of epidemic human respiratory zzso The length of one of these zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is measured in 68 zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso were collected during a series of sudden and sometimes fatal outbreaks among both military recruits and civilians as the virus emerged for the first time in the United States in 2006 and zzso The results demonstrate the usefulness of zzso zzso as high-resolution molecular strain zzso The described zzso is zzso in zzso varying from 12 to 17 zzso in the analyzed sample zzso All intermediate lengths were identified in at least one zzso Furthermore, the specific length of the marker is stable for significant periods of time (up to 7 zzso at individual sites where the virus is in consistent zzso The zzso also can maintain specific length identity through zzso transmission events, as determined by the analysis of zzso from three advanced training sites that appeared to be subject to pathogen transfer from one of the affected recruit training zzso Public database searches revealed that the zzso nature of the zzso extends to other species B zzso and that other zzso zzso can be identified readily in a variety of epidemic respiratory zzso zzso This study shows that zzso are a ubiquitous source of zzso markers for human zzso and demonstrates their use through an zzso analysis of zzso from a recent North American zzso
