zzso zzso is the most destructive pathogen of potato and a model zzso for the zzso a distinct lineage of zzso zzso that are related to organisms such as brown algae and zzso As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the zzso century, zzso zzso has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population zzso To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of zzso the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's zzso Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at zzso zzso Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant zzso Here we report the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso which at approximately 240 zzso zzso is by far the largest and most complex zzso zzso so far in the zzso Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for approximately zzso of the zzso zzso with two other zzso zzso showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of zzso disease zzso zzso including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host zzso These zzso zzso genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the zzso zzso zzso This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid zzso of the pathogen to host plants and zzso its evolutionary zzso
