The human zzso type 5 zzso is composed of a number of distinct zzso It has been shown previously that one of these, zzso IX zzso is not absolutely required for the production of viable zzso However, viruses lacking this zzso have a significantly reduced packaging limit and, in the one case zzso also show a zzso zzso zzso This report describes the use of zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso virus zzso to generate cells which zzso express zzso These cells provide zzso that is efficiently incorporated into zzso that are genetically zzso such enhanced zzso These cells have also been used to isolate a genetically zzso virus having a zzso of length some zzso zzso in excess of the previously defined packaging limit for zzso zzso the resulting zzso have zzso zzso These cells expand the theoretical capacity of zzso zzso for foreign DNA to around zzso zzso and may therefore be useful in gene therapy applications in which zzso capacity is zzso
