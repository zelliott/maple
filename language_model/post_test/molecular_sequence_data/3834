zzso zzso zzso viruses in some zzso are associated with zzso and have been used or proposed as biological control zzso We isolated zzso zzso from 13 of zzso field strains of zzso zzso isolated from zzso in zzso One of these zzso zzso was examined in more zzso This strain had pronounced zzso changes, including reduction in zzso growth, increased zzso reduced zzso towards zzso and decreased zzso production of zzso zzso The presence or absence of the zzso zzso was correlated with the changes in zzso and zzso The zzso could be transferred to zzso strains by zzso fusion, and the recipient strain acquired the zzso zzso of the donor zzso The zzso was transmitted to approximately 50% of the zzso and only colonies resulting from zzso carrying the zzso had the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso identify an zzso zzso zzso sequence and an zzso zzso that are closely related to those of zzso zzso and zzso yellow mosaic zzso zzso these results suggest that this zzso isolated from zzso zzso encodes traits for zzso
