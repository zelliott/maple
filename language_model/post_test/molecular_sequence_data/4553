We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of zzso peptides from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which immune response has not been zzso zzso The three molecules display zzso activity against zzso and bacteria with a zzso activity against zzso zzso The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of zzso zzso zzso degradation, mass zzso and zzso cloning using a zzso zzso zzso The mature molecules zzso and 62 zzso are characterized by an zzso domain rich in zzso zzso and a zzso domain containing three zzso zzso zzso One of these molecules is zzso modified by a zzso acid at the first zzso zzso of the data obtained from the zzso clones and mass zzso showed that two of these peptides are probably zzso zzso by elimination of a zzso zzso These molecules with no evident zzso to other zzso described zzso peptides were named zzso
