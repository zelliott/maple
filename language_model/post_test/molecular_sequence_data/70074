The zzso protein zzso a slowly zzso zzso zzso current when expressed in zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso currents to determine the open channel zzso relationship for the channel, and have found that the zzso current is inwardly zzso The channel passes inward current at least zzso more readily than outward zzso Both rat and human zzso exhibit this zzso The zzso of zzso is similar to that reported for a slow component of the cardiac delayed zzso strengthening the hypothesis that zzso is responsible for that zzso
