The zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso 32 zzso shock zzso zzso were isolated and zzso from five gram negative zzso zzso or alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these and three known genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed marked similarities that should reflect zzso function and regulation of zzso 32 in the heat shock zzso Both the sequence complementary to part of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and a predicted zzso secondary structure similar to those involved in zzso control of zzso 32 in zzso were found for the zzso genes from the zzso but not the zzso zzso despite considerable divergence in zzso zzso Moreover, a stretch of nine zzso acid zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso was absolutely zzso among all zzso 32 zzso but absent in other zzso zzso this sequence overlapped with the segment of zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso negative control of synthesis and stability of zzso zzso In addition, a putative zzso E zzso zzso promoter was found in front of all zzso genes from the zzso but not zzso zzso These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in zzso are very well zzso among the gamma zzso and partially zzso among the alpha zzso
