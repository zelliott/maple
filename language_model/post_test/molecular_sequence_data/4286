Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are fused and form a single zzso unit zzso in zzso species, members of the order zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso gene fusion in zzso and the first case of a zzso fusion in any zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso has a typical zzso zzso start point consensus sequence and, in common with most zzso zzso has no zzso Furthermore, Southern and zzso analyses suggest that the same organization exists in other closely related zzso such as zzso from the same order zzso as well as more zzso related zzso zzso and zzso in the order zzso Evidence is provided that in zzso zzso there is at least one other discrete copy of a zzso gene but not of a zzso zzso Finally, a zzso analysis of zzso does not place zzso within the zzso of crown zzso and suggests zzso may not be particularly useful for resolving relationships among major zzso zzso
