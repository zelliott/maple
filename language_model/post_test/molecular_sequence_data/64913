We showed that unloading markedly diminished the effects of zzso to activate its signaling zzso and the zzso zzso showed a similar block in zzso zzso Furthermore, unloading decreased zzso zzso zzso These results show that skeletal unloading zzso resistance to zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathways at least in part through zzso of zzso zzso 

We have previously reported that skeletal unloading zzso resistance to zzso growth zzso zzso with respect to bone zzso However, the underlying mechanism remains zzso The aim of this study was to clarify how skeletal unloading zzso resistance to the effects of zzso administration in zzso and in zzso with respect to bone zzso 

We first determined the response of bone to zzso administration in zzso during skeletal zzso We then evaluated the response of zzso cells isolated from unloaded bones to zzso treatment in zzso with respect to zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Finally we examined the potential role of zzso in zzso the responsiveness of zzso cells to zzso 

zzso administration in zzso significantly increased proliferation of zzso zzso markedly decreased proliferation and blocked the ability of zzso to increase zzso On a cellular level, zzso treatment in zzso zzso the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cultured zzso cells from normally loaded bones, but these effects were markedly diminished in cells from unloaded zzso These results were not caused by altered zzso activity or changes in zzso binding to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was more impacted by unloading than that of zzso The zzso zzso (an zzso of the zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso to stimulate its zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar to that seen in cells from unloaded zzso Furthermore, unloading significantly decreased the zzso levels both of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These results indicate that skeletal unloading zzso resistance to zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso signaling zzso at least in part, through zzso of zzso zzso resulting in decreased proliferation of zzso and their zzso
