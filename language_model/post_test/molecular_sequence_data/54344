Malaysia is a medium endemic country for zzso B virus zzso infection but little is known about zzso strains circulating in Malaysian blood zzso zzso load, zzso zzso and zzso zzso products from 84 zzso surface zzso zzso positive samples were zzso in zzso Median viral load was zzso zzso and median zzso zzso zzso zzso full zzso 20 zzso 1 S gene and six basic core zzso sequences were zzso zzso B and C were present at a ratio of zzso and two zzso D samples were zzso both from donors of Indian zzso zzso zzso B was more diverse with zzso zzso B7 and B8 present, while most zzso C strains were from zzso zzso zzso B and C were equally frequent in ethnic zzso but zzso of strains from Chinese were zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in zzso C than in zzso B, in Chinese than zzso and in donors under the age of zzso zzso vaccine escape zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in six zzso In the large surface zzso zzso regions were more zzso than zzso zzso and the major zzso zzso zzso of zzso B or from ethnic zzso had higher genetic diversity than strains of zzso C or from Chinese zzso Hence zzso strains circulating in Malaysia are zzso diverse reflecting the ethnic mix of its zzso zzso zzso carry lower zzso levels and higher genetic diversity of the surface zzso possibly resulting in more effective immune control of the zzso
