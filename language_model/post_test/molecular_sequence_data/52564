zzso zzso zzso is a common molecular consequence of familial Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso We report here the molecular interaction of the large zzso loop region of zzso 2 zzso with zzso a zzso zzso protein that serves as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso zzso and zzso was demonstrated in cultured cells and human brain zzso zzso zzso and a subset of the functional zzso complexes were zzso to a novel zzso fraction that is zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso was found to interact with zzso zzso fragments but not full-length zzso and the zzso interaction was greatly enhanced by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal a molecular link between zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso and substantiate normal and/or pathological roles of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
