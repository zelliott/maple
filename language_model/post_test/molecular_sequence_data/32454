The zzso trafficking of zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso is controlled in part by the binding of zzso to the zzso In the absence of zzso zzso is sorted directly from the zzso to zzso zzso binding triggers the zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso whereas zzso transport is associated with the cycling of zzso between the plasma membrane and zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso are required for trafficking of zzso zzso was required for zzso trafficking of zzso which was sorted from zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso into the zzso zzso was dependent on zzso by zzso but zzso was not required for plasma membrane zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso trafficking via the zzso complex or zzso was also not required for plasma membrane zzso High zzso of zzso led to higher levels of zzso of zzso but they did not induce zzso Without this zzso zzso remained on the plasma zzso where it was active for zzso zzso was zzso modified with zzso chains on a cluster of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso
