zzso are useful as zzso switches of gene expression responsive to several types of zzso One of the most important properties of the switching ability is the zzso zzso ratio, zzso the ratio of gene expression in the presence of zzso to that in the absence of zzso The present study was performed to gain a quantitative understanding of how the zzso zzso ratio is determined by factors involved in gene zzso such as transcription, zzso zzso zzso degradation, protein translation, and their zzso zzso We performed switching of gene expression using two zzso zzso with different properties in a zzso translation system, and constructed a kinetic model that zzso describes the dynamics of zzso and protein species involved in zzso Both theoretical and experimental analyses consistently demonstrated that factors determining both the absolute value and the dynamics of the zzso ratio are highly dependent on the routes of translation in the absence of zzso translation from the zzso zzso zzso or leaky translation from the zzso zzso The model obtained here is useful to assess the factors that restrict the zzso ratio and to improve zzso more zzso
