zzso has two zzso zzso (called 1 and zzso either of which zzso for zzso We cloned DNA zzso the zzso 1 protein coding and promoter regions flanked by zzso zzso using the zzso The DNA, which contained no zzso base changes altering the protein zzso was cloned into the zzso shuttle zzso zzso and transformed into a zzso strain with a deletion in its zzso 1 zzso The resulting zzso strain makes zzso 1 in quantities which depend on cell zzso A zzso zzso mechanism of action of zzso based on X-ray zzso evidence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso involves zzso accepting a zzso from a water zzso that in turn accepts a zzso from zzso of the zzso We prepared the zzso zzso of zzso 1 by zzso zzso zzso Its identity was confirmed by zzso sequence analysis, zzso on zzso 12, zzso zzso and the sequence of the zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso zzso has approximately zzso of the activity of native zzso It binds zzso zzso zzso the zzso analogue of the product zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso analogue of the zzso zzso the latter two at least with affinities similar to those of the native zzso The zzso zzso also produces zzso changes in the zzso The reaction with zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso zzso the reaction with zzso which presumably requires zzso removal from zzso is complex but shows a very slow phase consistent with zzso
