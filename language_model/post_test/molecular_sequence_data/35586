The identification of zzso zzso as a second zzso species of dog opened new questions and challenges in the understanding on the zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the development of a conventional zzso technique based on published zzso sequences of zzso zzso from zzso that specifically detects DNA from zzso zzso This technique zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to a region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was positive in DNA samples obtained from zzso identified zzso as zzso zzso which served as positive controls, as well as in samples from three cases of zzso associated with proliferation of zzso identified as zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso was positive in 2 out of 19 healthy zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were consistently zzso zzso samples from seven dogs with generalized zzso caused by zzso zzso were all negative in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that in generalized canine zzso zzso proliferation is zzso This technique can be a useful tool in the diagnosis and in zzso and zzso zzso
