zzso is a zzso gene expressed in the late stages of zzso zzso The promoter region contains no similarities in DNA sequence to those of other zzso zzso except for a tobacco sequence zzso which occurs four times in this alfalfa gene and much further upstream than in zzso Four distinct zzso boxes were detected in the promoter with the zzso and zzso zzso boxes being separated by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso loop structures were found in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso The coding region of zzso is interrupted by two zzso and encodes a putative zzso of 450 zzso acids with zzso to zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso The coding region also contains sequences characteristic of both a signal zzso and a nuclear zzso zzso
