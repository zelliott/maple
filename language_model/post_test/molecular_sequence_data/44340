We show that zzso is zzso by cellular zzso in zzso and in zzso and map the major sites of zzso to be on zzso towards the zzso downstream of position 370 in both zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain had no effect on zzso refining the sites to between position 370 and zzso Within zzso the zzso boundary for complex formation with zzso and zzso lies at position zzso and between 370 and 388 lies one zzso at position zzso This is a consensus zzso zzso II zzso site and, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that it is the main zzso site in the body of the zzso zzso zzso This site is also zzso in nuclear zzso Although other sites, mainly zzso are also zzso by nuclear zzso the single substitution of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and virtually eliminates complex zzso This zzso lies in a zzso region of zzso and, although complex formation is zzso other activities of the zzso are zzso zzso is also required in zzso where substitution to zzso zzso zzso while replacement with zzso restores normal levels of zzso
