zzso are small zzso zzso of muscle and zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium channels zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displaced zzso from native rat brain zzso zzso values 10 and 5 zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso values 60 and 3 zzso zzso zzso and both inhibited current through zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso scan of zzso a zzso analogue with enhanced zzso activity, revealed zzso important for affinity and zzso zzso replacement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in large reductions in zzso zzso with zzso replacement affecting zzso In contrast, zzso had significantly enhanced zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso while the double zzso zzso showed greatest zzso versus zzso selectivity zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso adopted a single zzso in solution zzso a series of turns and an zzso motif across zzso zzso that is not found in larger zzso The structure of zzso provides a new structural template for the development of zzso selective zzso of zzso zzso based on the smaller zzso zzso
