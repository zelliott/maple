Five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso All five strains were isolated from the small zzso of a female child with zzso zzso zzso of the five strains were short rods or zzso cells with longer zzso forms seen zzso The organisms produced zzso acid and zzso acid as major zzso end zzso zzso analysis based on comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed close relationships between zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were clearly different from all recognized species within the zzso zzso and related most closely to but distinct from zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene sequencing, and zzso chemical and zzso properties, strains zzso zzso and zzso are considered to represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of the proposed novel zzso All five strains were able to form zzso zzso in which zzso structures were connecting individual bacteria zzso The five strains were able to bind to human zzso zzso cell lines at 37 zzso
