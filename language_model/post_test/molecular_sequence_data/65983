We have amplified two zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso from the skeletal muscle of zzso whale zzso zzso by zzso and cloned these zzso into zzso zzso These are the first zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences from zzso to be zzso One of the two zzso acid sequences is a zzso zzso zzso zzso while the other was identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso that included a zzso targeting zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso whale zzso and zzso showed zzso sequence identity with corresponding zzso of zzso zzso and all of the key zzso necessary for zzso function were zzso The zzso analyses of zzso zzso with three independent methods zzso zzso and zzso supported the zzso of zzso whale zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in agreement with the contemporary view that these groups are closely zzso zzso whale zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso zzso and the kinetic zzso (K zzso K zzso and k zzso were determined for the forward zzso zzso of kinetic zzso with those of human and mouse zzso indicated that zzso whale zzso has a comparable affinity for zzso (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to that of human zzso and the zzso has two times higher affinity for zzso than the human zzso Both the zzso and zzso of zzso whale display a synergistic zzso binding (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like those of other zzso zzso
