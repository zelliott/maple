During our work on the mechanism of hormone resistance of zzso zzso a novel gene that we called zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso resistant zzso zzso using a modified zzso difference zzso The complete sequence of the gene zzso has zzso zzso with a continuous reading frame of zzso bases zzso for 146 zzso zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence has motifs for zzso and zzso by protein zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in all zzso zzso cell lines studied zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to the normal zzso zzso Furthermore, its expression was higher in zzso resistant prostate cancer lines zzso zzso and zzso in comparison to zzso sensitive zzso zzso The expression of this gene was down regulated by zzso in zzso sensitive prostate cells, but not in the hormone resistant cell zzso The zzso zzso was detected in all 29 normal human zzso studied and zzso in most zzso of their zzso zzso The zzso expression was higher in zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines, as well as in all primary breast tumors studied compared to their normal tissue zzso The biological function of this gene is still unknown, but its ubiquitous expression in normal zzso and its zzso in some zzso suggest the zzso involvement in certain basic cellular processes and zzso in zzso zzso
