The recent identification of the zzso of zzso zzso complex in rat liver zzso suggests another functional role for this protein in both zzso in addition to its involvement in zzso zzso zzso We report here that a very rapid response (15 zzso in the induction of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex is observed in 37 degrees C zzso larvae of zzso zzso Under the same zzso treatment, a zzso induction for the zzso protein zzso was less rapid zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequence identities between the zzso and the zzso protein families are very low (less than zzso two zzso acid zzso of 12 and 13 zzso each, are found in the zzso of the zzso complex from various zzso which show a highly zzso identity (over zzso with zzso acid sequences found in molecular zzso We suggest that the nuclear coded zzso belongs to the family of stress proteins zzso and thus, that it could perform similar functional zzso to those recently described for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso Pollock, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) Nature zzso zzso in both the zzso and the zzso Furthermore, we suggest that the two zzso elements among the zzso and the zzso could zzso be involved in the zzso function of these zzso
