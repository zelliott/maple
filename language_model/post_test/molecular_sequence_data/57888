After differential screening of a complementary DNA library constructed from quail zzso cells zzso infected with the zzso avian zzso zzso we have isolated a complementary DNA clone which identifies a zzso essentially expressed in the zzso layer of the zzso This complementary DNA encodes a protein containing paired box and zzso zzso This zzso called zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso and human AN zzso which are zzso in the zzso dominant zzso small eye zzso of the mouse and zzso in zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso organization, as well as the existence of alternative zzso events taking place at both the zzso end and the middle part of the zzso A zzso clone translated in zzso zzso directed the synthesis of a 46 zzso protein able to bind specifically to the zzso sequence present upstream of the zzso zzso gene and target of the zzso paired zzso The zzso paired and zzso zzso individually expressed in bacteria are both able to recognize the zzso zzso
