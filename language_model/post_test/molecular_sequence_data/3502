The zzso gene zzso initially identified by the zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso The zzso gene product zzso premature cell zzso during growth and zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso Analysis of the promoter indicates that cap zzso sequence directs zzso expression during both growth and early zzso zzso following tip formation is controlled by more zzso zzso which contains zzso repeats known to regulate zzso cell gene expression in other zzso zzso of reporter gene expression and zzso zzso zzso indicates that during growth the zzso gene is expressed in an increasing number of cells as a function of zzso The number of cells expressing the zzso gene drops as development zzso but the cells that continue to express the gene do so at high zzso These cells are initially scattered throughout the entire zzso By the tip formation stage, however, the majority of zzso cells are localized to the mound zzso with only a few cells remaining scattered in the upper portion of the zzso In the final zzso zzso is expressed only in the upper cup, lower cup, and zzso zzso Although reporter expression is observed in cells that migrate zzso to a banded region just zzso to the tip, expression is rarely observed in the extreme zzso zzso protein however, is localized to the tip as well as to zzso during late zzso The results presented here suggest that zzso gene expression is shut off in zzso that continue along the zzso differentiation zzso before they are added to the primordial zzso
