zzso sequences were identified in the zzso region of the human zzso gene in zzso 4, 5, 10, and zzso Another repeated cluster was located in the zzso zzso zzso approximately 6 zzso upstream from the first zzso The zzso sequence analysis indicated that these repeated sequences are members of the zzso zzso The zzso between the sequences of the zzso 4 and the zzso consensus was zzso The zzso member studied was oriented in the direction of zzso of the zzso
