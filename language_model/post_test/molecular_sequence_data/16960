zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and classical zzso such as zzso are actively transported into zzso cells by the reduced folate carrier zzso zzso is characterized by 12 stretches of mostly zzso zzso zzso zzso internally oriented N and C zzso and a large central zzso connecting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies showed that deletion of the majority of the central loop domain between zzso 6 and 7 abolished zzso but this segment could be replaced with mostly zzso sequence from the zzso zzso zzso to restore transport zzso In this report, we expressed zzso from separate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso each with a unique zzso tag, in zzso zzso cells to restore transport zzso Restored transport exhibited characteristic transport zzso for methotrexate, a capacity for zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso by zzso methotrexate, a documented affinity inhibitor of zzso The zzso zzso migrated on zzso gels as a zzso zzso zzso species and was converted to 27 zzso by zzso F or zzso zzso The 40 zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by these zzso Using zzso cells expressing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso as separate zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso No zzso was incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso decreased the size of the zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso to approximately 20 zzso Our results demonstrate that a functional zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso and zzso a critical zzso binding domain to within zzso zzso
