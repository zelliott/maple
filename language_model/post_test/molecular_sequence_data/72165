zzso protein of zzso coli zzso a global response against zzso agents (such as zzso or zzso oxide, and provides broad zzso zzso A zzso signal activates zzso zzso to trigger zzso of a second regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind the zzso promoter with the same high zzso but only the activated protein stimulates zzso zzso zzso acts by an unusual mechanism of positive zzso the protein binds the zzso promoter between zzso zzso and zzso elements that are separated by an unusually long 19 zzso zzso the optimal 17 zzso We have constructed and analyzed zzso deletions that alter the promoter element zzso zzso the zzso length to zzso zzso dramatically elevated zzso expression of zzso in zzso and in zzso and nearly eliminated additional zzso by zzso in response to zzso More zzso zzso the zzso converted zzso from an zzso into a zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that repression by zzso of the promoters with 17 and 16 zzso zzso is due to interference with binding by zzso zzso Thus, activated zzso zzso the unusual zzso of the zzso zzso promoter into a highly active form, probably by zzso for the zzso distance between the zzso and the zzso zzso
