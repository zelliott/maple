An zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from soil underlying the zzso leaf litter of a slash pine forest located in south east Queensland, zzso The strictly zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso spores which distended the zzso zzso zzso grew zzso in 1 % zzso soy broth zzso at 30 degrees C zzso range for growth, zzso degrees zzso and a pH of zzso zzso growth range, pH zzso zzso microscopic examination of zzso stained cells revealed the presence of zzso zzso and thin sections showed the presence of a typical zzso type zzso zzso The strain was zzso and zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso The zzso content of DNA was zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso was placed zzso as a member of the class zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 93 zzso In addition to its significant zzso separation from its nearest relatives, strain zzso possessed zzso traits that also suggested that it represented a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
