zzso prediction programs zzso are important for in zzso gene discovery without support from expressed sequence tag zzso zzso in the analysis of gene regulation and in zzso zzso zzso to previous expectations, a comprehensive analysis of zzso reveals that no program simultaneously achieves sensitivity and a positive zzso value zzso zzso performances deduced from a limited number of zzso or smaller data sets do not hold when evaluated at the level of the whole zzso with serious inaccuracy of predictions for zzso zzso Some zzso even perform worse than, or close to, pure random zzso
