The regulatory mechanisms of zzso might differ in the liver from other zzso because zzso are resident in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells are unique in shape and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and tissue factor activity in isolated zzso were studied in the liver and lung of zzso In normal rats, the zzso expression was minimal in zzso zzso but prominent in pulmonary zzso while the tissue factor activity in the presence of zzso was higher in pulmonary zzso than in zzso cells, although the levels in the absence of zzso were comparable in both zzso The tissue factor activity in zzso zzso was increased after zzso of the cells with zzso zzso or after induction of liver necrosis or zzso with carbon zzso In the zzso or zzso liver, increased zzso expression was seen along zzso extending in zzso areas and zzso zzso but this increase was minimal in the zzso zzso rat zzso Blood zzso equilibrium in zzso regulated by zzso cells and zzso may differ between the liver and zzso Such equilibrium in the liver may vary depending on pathological zzso
