The biologically active zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso state, characterized by an exposed zzso center loop zzso that acts as bait for the target zzso The protein can also adopt an inactive zzso zzso that has the zzso inserted as a central strand in zzso zzso This zzso form is zzso more stable than the active zzso Nonetheless, folding of zzso consistently yields the active zzso The reasons that the zzso form is zzso preferred remain zzso The current work demonstrates that a carefully orchestrated folding mechanism prevents zzso zzso into sheet zzso zzso changes in zzso accessibility during folding are monitored using zzso zzso labeling and mass zzso The data obtained in this way complement recent zzso exchange zzso Those zzso exchange zzso revealed that securing of the zzso by hydrogen bonding of the first zzso in sheet C is one factor that favors formation of the active zzso The zzso labeling data presented here reveal that this zzso is preceded by the formation of zzso contacts in a confined region of the zzso This partial collapse sequesters the zzso zzso site early on and is therefore instrumental in steering zzso towards its active zzso zzso zzso by hydrogen bonding starts to contribute at a later zzso Together, these two factors ensure that formation of the active zzso is zzso zzso This work demonstrates how the use of complementary labeling techniques can provide insights into the mechanisms of protracted folding zzso
