Although zzso zzso zzso and its analogue zzso decrease the zzso pressure in a variety of animals, their zzso metabolism has not yet been zzso Here, we isolated the zzso for the monkey zzso of zzso and zzso types of zzso PG zzso zzso from lung and eye, respectively, and investigated the distribution of their zzso in the monkey zzso The zzso for the zzso and zzso types of zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 277 zzso acid zzso with calculated molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the monkey zzso and zzso zzso showed less than zzso identity to each other, and the former zzso shows zzso and zzso identity, and the latter zzso and zzso identity, to the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso for zzso zzso but not that for zzso zzso was highly expressed in monkey zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso for zzso zzso was localized in the zzso cells of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso group of zzso and the acid form of zzso in the presence of zzso as examined by zzso These results indicate that zzso and the acid form of zzso are zzso to their zzso zzso by zzso zzso localized in the monkey zzso
