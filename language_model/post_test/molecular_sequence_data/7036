zzso zzso with molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso are recognized by zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to understand the zzso of both types of zzso we studied the expression patterns of zzso and zzso during zzso of cultured zzso zzso of cultured normal human zzso demonstrated uniform zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso pattern was distinct from the focal zzso with zzso zzso observed only in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins and their zzso were expressed by the zzso whereas no production of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The relative ratio of zzso to the total zzso as determined by density on zzso decreased as the cultured zzso zzso In the completely zzso zzso cultured on collagen zzso zzso became zzso with subsequent reduction of zzso zzso zzso The relative decrease of zzso zzso during zzso differentiation might be responsible for the induction of zzso zzso in zzso
