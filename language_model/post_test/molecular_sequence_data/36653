Fluorescence energy transfer is potentially a useful technique for obtaining structural and dynamic information on duplex and zzso DNA molecules suitably labeled with donor and zzso zzso We have assessed the accuracy and limitations of zzso zzso in zzso acids with respect to the zzso of the zzso and the flexibility of the zzso zzso A nine zzso duplex zzso was zzso with donor and zzso zzso linked at the opposing zzso zzso by zzso zzso A careful analysis of the zzso zzso of the donor revealed that the zzso distance in this zzso was not well zzso but was described by a rather broad zzso The mean zzso distance and the distribution of distances have been recovered from the donor zzso zzso effects on energy transfer have been included in the zzso The implications of these findings for zzso zzso in zzso acids are zzso
