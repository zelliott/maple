Using zzso as a host, we have examined the effect that the presence of an zzso has on the zzso of a processed zzso zzso To provide a model system that was free from major position effects, two fish zzso protein zzso zzso were arranged in divergent zzso orientation from a central zzso zzso protein zzso region and introduced into the flies by zzso transformation and/or zzso In this way the organization of both the structural genes and the promoter elements zzso their natural zzso When one member of the fish zzso zzso pair had its single 180 zzso zzso deleted, there was a zzso to zzso zzso zzso decrease in its zzso level compared to that generated from the control gene containing the fish zzso intervening zzso When the deleted zzso was replaced by a 70 zzso intervening sequence originating from the zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso was restored to its original zzso Even for the streamlined zzso of zzso where the zzso number and size are generally reduced compared to zzso the presence of an intervening sequence appears to facilitate zzso zzso
