The general aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso coli is responsible for the active transport of zzso zzso and zzso A proposed zzso model for the zzso zzso consisting of 12 zzso zzso spans connected by zzso zzso is very similar to that of the closely related zzso zzso The zzso of this model and its similarity to that of the zzso zzso were investigated by studying fusion proteins of zzso zzso and alkaline zzso Based on the results obtained from the zzso zzso sandwich zzso we have significantly revised the proposed zzso model for zzso in two zzso In this modified zzso zzso model, the three charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso within the membrane in span zzso These three zzso are zzso in a large family of zzso acid transport zzso and zzso zzso identifies them as being essential for transport zzso It is zzso that these zzso together with zzso in zzso span 3 may be involved in a zzso relay zzso
