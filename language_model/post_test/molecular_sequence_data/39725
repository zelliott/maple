The toxicity induced by several environmental pollutants is zzso by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso which controls the expression of many zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have indicated that fish populations can evolve tolerance to persistent zzso pollutants by zzso the zzso zzso Here, we measure to what extent tissue loads of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to zzso capacity in wild, zzso Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso from the Baltic zzso In muscle, the sum of the 21 most common zzso zzso zzso was correlated with three extracted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso zzso as well as zzso were correlated with zzso zzso The zzso controlled for the effects of sex and zzso content in muscle zzso did not predict zzso transcript levels of the measured zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso in zzso However, all zzso zzso transcript levels were positively correlated with zzso zzso In turn, the zzso level was zzso correlated with concentration of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is depleted when zzso processes zzso are zzso No correlation was found between zzso activity and zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso regions of the zzso zzso we identified multiple zzso zzso that were used for zzso The zzso transcript level of zzso was significantly associated with the zzso zzso region zzso and with the interaction of the zzso and individual zzso zzso These results suggest that in wild Atlantic salmon from the Baltic Sea, active production of zzso zzso by means of zzso exposure may be affected by genetic zzso at the zzso zzso
