A zzso zzso gene was cloned in zzso coli from a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The gene zzso an zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 68 zzso which was expressed by the expression zzso zzso The optimal temperature of zzso was 60 degrees C, which was higher than those of other zzso zzso reported so zzso zzso zzso kinetic analysis of zzso indicated that it was stabilized in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso It zzso zzso and starch mainly to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso not only zzso zzso an zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso but also transferred zzso to 17 sugar zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso transfer products by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that zzso was transferred primarily to the zzso of the zzso and at lower degrees to the zzso and/or zzso The zzso of sugar to zzso by forming an zzso linkage was demonstrated for the first time by using zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso transfer products showed that the zzso transfer product formed most rapidly but readily zzso while the zzso transfer product was stable and accumulated in the reaction mixture as the main zzso
