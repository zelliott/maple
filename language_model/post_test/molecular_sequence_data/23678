The triggering zzso expressed on zzso cells zzso is a recently discovered zzso expressed on the surface of zzso and a subset of zzso zzso of zzso has been reported to trigger the synthesis of zzso zzso in the presence of microbial zzso Previously, we have identified a soluble form of zzso zzso and observed significant levels in serum samples from septic shock patients but not zzso Here, we investigated its putative role in the zzso of inflammation during zzso We observed that zzso was zzso by zzso activated in zzso by zzso and in the serum of animals involved in an experimental model of septic zzso Both in zzso and in zzso a synthetic zzso mimicking a short highly zzso domain of zzso appeared to zzso zzso production by human zzso and protect septic animals from zzso and zzso This zzso seemed to be efficient not only in preventing but also in zzso the deleterious effects of zzso zzso These data suggest that in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso might be a suitable therapeutic tool for the treatment of zzso
