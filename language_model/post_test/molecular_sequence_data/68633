The crystal structures of zzso canine and bovine zzso colony stimulating factor zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso using molecular replacement with zzso human zzso as a zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso that stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of blood zzso zzso bovine and canine zzso all have a molecular mass of about 19 zzso and share an zzso acid sequence identity of about zzso Two crystal forms of canine zzso have been zzso Form I zzso canine zzso zzso space group zzso contains one zzso in the zzso unit while form II canine zzso zzso space group zzso has two molecules in the zzso unit and bovine zzso zzso space group zzso contains one zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has been refined to an R factor of zzso with data to zzso A resolution and zzso has been refined to an R factor of zzso with data to zzso A zzso zzso has been refined to an R factor of zzso with data to zzso A zzso The structure of human, canine and bovine zzso is an zzso zzso bundle with zzso zzso With the exception of one highly exposed loop zzso 66 to zzso the human, canine and bovine structures are very similar to each zzso Using our series of zzso crystal structures we developed a function that describes the probability that a particular zzso position zzso contributes to a zzso zzso binding site based on two principles, zzso high sequence conservation in the primary sequence of human, zzso canine and zzso zzso and zzso conservation of high zzso accessibility in the human, bovine and canine crystal zzso On the basis of this probability function as well as a comparison of zzso to the crystal structure of human growth hormone zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the human growth hormone zzso zzso zzso that contribute to potential zzso zzso binding sites are zzso
