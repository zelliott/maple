Comparisons between zzso and zzso suggest limited conservation of the molecular mechanisms that control zzso zzso in zzso We have studied the evolution of the imprinted zzso locus in zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso were easily identified, the use of zzso zzso regions and zzso zzso comparisons was required to delineate a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso show zzso and zzso structure zzso suggesting functional selection on both zzso zzso start site sequences and zzso signals are also zzso As in zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and paternal zzso upstream of the gene originates in the male zzso encompasses a zzso zzso and spreads zzso into the zzso zzso The conservation in all zzso of the mechanism controlling zzso of the zzso locus suggests a sequential model of zzso zzso
