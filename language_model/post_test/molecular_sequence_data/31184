Although the human U2 and zzso zzso genes are transcribed by zzso zzso II and III respectively, their promoters are remarkably similar in zzso Both promoters contain a zzso element and an zzso region with an zzso zzso The zzso promoter contains in addition an zzso rich region that defines it as an zzso zzso III zzso We have examined in further detail the contributions of sequences in the human U2 and zzso promoter regions to zzso by zzso zzso II and zzso We find that although the sequences surrounding the U2 cap site favor zzso zzso II transcription, their presence cannot suppress a shift to zzso zzso III specificity upon zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso promoter, the 3' part of the zzso element zzso is essential for efficient zzso and is also involved in zzso the start site of zzso A region downstream of the zzso element zzso is required for zzso zzso II (but not for zzso zzso zzso transcription, both in the U2 promoter and in the zzso zzso This element may be recognized by an zzso zzso II zzso factor or by zzso zzso II zzso The presence of this element in the zzso promoter raises the possibility that the human zzso gene is, under certain circumstances, transcribed by zzso zzso zzso
