zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the membrane domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to release a soluble growth zzso Several zzso zzso proteins have been identified, although their zzso and functions remain zzso The human zzso zzso zzso the membrane domain of zzso zzso when the proteins are zzso in zzso zzso However, the membrane zzso of several zzso zzso proteins were not zzso by zzso suggesting that the zzso targets of the human zzso are not zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso acid sequence at the zzso face of the membrane domain of a zzso protein determines whether it is zzso by zzso Based on this finding, we predicted zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso We found that one of these, zzso was zzso so efficiently by the zzso that little zzso was detected on the surface of cells zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso zzso processing may regulate zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso
