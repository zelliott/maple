zzso evolution of zzso zzso at the major zzso complex zzso has been demonstrated in a number of zzso zzso the substitution rates and the age of zzso evolving zzso requires detailed information about the zzso in related zzso We provide such information for the zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments encompassing zzso 2 were amplified in zzso from zzso DNA of ten zzso The zzso sequences were determined and their relationship to the human zzso zzso was zzso The zzso were classified according to their position in zzso and the presence of zzso zzso Twenty zzso were found at the expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso zzso of these, 13 are new zzso Two other zzso sequences were classified as members of a new lineage tentatively designated zzso zzso counterparts of zzso and zzso were not zzso The number of zzso found at individual zzso indicates zzso distribution of zzso between humans and zzso zzso of zzso divergence times suggest that the lineages are more than 30 million years zzso zzso of major zzso zzso zzso are zzso
