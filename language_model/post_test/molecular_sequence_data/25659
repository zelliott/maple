Analysis of zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso prion protein revealed that the majority of the molecules are zzso zzso linked through zzso attached at zzso However, approximately zzso of zzso had a zzso zzso that ends at zzso It is intriguing that this zzso is part of the zzso sequence zzso which is an established target sequence for the zzso and release of zzso peptides from larger zzso The mechanism of formation, as well as the role of the truncated zzso zzso in the dissemination and zzso of zzso remains to be zzso
