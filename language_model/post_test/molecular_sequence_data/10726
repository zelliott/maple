Modular zzso zzso zzso are very large zzso zzso complexes that zzso a number of zzso important natural zzso The modular arrangement of active sites has made these zzso systems amenable to zzso manipulation for the zzso of novel zzso Here, we investigate the involvement of zzso interactions in hybrid and artificially linked zzso with several series of zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Several zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso were constructed by fusing module 6 to either module 2 or module 3 at varying zzso zzso production by these zzso zzso indicated that the core set of active sites remained functional in these hybrid zzso although the zzso domain of module 6 was unable to recognize zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also engineered by zzso linking zzso 2 and 3 of zzso thereby demonstrating the feasibility of constructing zzso zzso Finally, a series of zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso in module 2 of an engineered zzso zzso revealed the structural and functional tolerance for hybrid zzso created from distinct zzso gene zzso 

The general success of the zzso and zzso zzso described here demonstrates significant structural tolerance among zzso zzso and zzso and suggests that zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso is the primary zzso of molecular recognition features of zzso Furthermore, the ability to artificially link zzso may considerably simplify the zzso expression of modular zzso in higher zzso zzso
