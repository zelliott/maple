The zzso zzso gene zzso is involved in the zzso of terminal versus trunk structures during early zzso zzso Later in development zzso activity zzso in specific processes during zzso and zzso zzso disc zzso The multiple functions of zzso are reflected in distinct zzso expression patterns throughout zzso Here we show that zzso zzso sequences for zzso and zzso expression are zzso Their organization may provide the structural basis for the diversification of expression pattern within the zzso zzso adjacent gene zzso We also examined the zzso factor requirement for the zzso zzso expression zzso They are under the genetic control of maternal and gap gene products and we show that these products are able to bind to corresponding zzso zzso sequences in zzso The results suggest that the zzso factors, as defined by genetic studies, functionally interact with the zzso regulatory zzso In addition, we provide evidence that a zzso gene product of the terminal system, zzso zzso with the maternal gene product zzso and thereby activates gene expression in the terminal region of the zzso
