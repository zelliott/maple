zzso is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle zzso Although several zzso clones have been characterized in different zzso the zzso organization and zzso of zzso zzso have zzso The zzso organization and promoter zzso analysis of two rainbow trout myostatin zzso zzso and zzso (formerly 1 and 2 respectively), as well as a quantitative assessment of their zzso zzso and adult tissue expression profiles are reported zzso Each gene was similarly organized into three zzso of zzso zzso and 1600 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Comparative mapping of coding regions from several zzso myostatin genes revealed a common organization between species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso the first among the zzso and the second across all zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of the promoter regions identified zzso and other putative zzso response zzso However, the number and diversity of elements were considerably less than those found in zzso promoters or in the recently characterized zzso zzso zzso A quantitative analysis of the embryonic expression profile for both genes indicates that zzso expression is consistently greater than that of zzso and neither gene is significantly expressed throughout zzso zzso of both steadily increases fourfold during zzso and subsides as this period zzso After zzso however, zzso zzso levels ultimately rise zzso by day 49 and peak before zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rise similarly, but do not peak before zzso An analysis of adult zzso zzso tissue expression indicates that both transcripts are present in most zzso although levels are highest in brain, zzso eyes, muscle, and surprisingly zzso These studies suggest that strong selective pressures have preserved the zzso organization of myostatin genes throughout zzso However, the different expression profiles and putative promoter elements in zzso versus zzso suggests that limitations in myostatin function may have evolved zzso
