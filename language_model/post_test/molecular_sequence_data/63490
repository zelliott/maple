Two zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso and tested for the detection of zzso or single mismatched zzso Fluorescent zzso carried out in solution showed only partial discrimination of the mismatched zzso while using zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso allowed DNA analysis to be performed with high sensitivity and extremely high sequence zzso Up to zzso : 1 signal discrimination in the presence of one single mismatched base was zzso The analysis was tested on both short and long DNA zzso zzso of DNA obtained from zzso amplification was also performed allowing the selective detection of the target sequence in complex zzso zzso free detection of the DNA with high sequence selectivity is therefore possible using the present zzso
