The zzso family of genes codes for proteins that have zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso have been detected by zzso gel zzso and a novel human member, designated as zzso has been identified and cloned from human cancer zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain but lacks zzso acids 159 to zzso compared to zzso zzso expression analysis by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso protection zzso have revealed that zzso is expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and normal zzso To investigate the potential role of zzso in zzso first its effects were compared to those of zzso by transient expression in human B zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso promoted zzso as detected by DNA fragmentation and zzso analysis by electron zzso The zzso induced by zzso and zzso was correlated with their zzso zzso c release, and zzso zzso In a zzso zzso system, zzso zzso with several zzso family members but had no affinity for the human zzso zzso zzso and Bad and the zzso zzso zzso In human cells, zzso function was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicated that zzso was associated with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased cell death induced by various zzso of zzso agents with the most pronounced effect occurring at low zzso and zzso dose zzso Our results suggest that zzso a novel zzso of zzso encodes a protein with a zzso effect and mode of action similar to those of zzso
