zzso zzso is emerging as an important zzso modification used to control zzso and protein activity in different biological zzso This modification regulates zzso activity in several zzso bacterial zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and is reversed by zzso The structure of the zzso that acts on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved at a resolution of zzso zzso This bacterial member of the zzso family acts specifically towards a zzso zzso The protein shows an zzso structure with two zzso zzso located in the active zzso zzso of the zzso structure with zzso deposited in the zzso Data Bank from zzso and zzso indicates that the zzso fold is zzso in all zzso of zzso Modeling of the binding of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso is in excellent agreement with zzso zzso
