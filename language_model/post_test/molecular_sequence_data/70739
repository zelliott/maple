We recently reported the molecular cloning of a novel transforming rat brain zzso zzso that encodes a Ras zzso zzso et zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso We proposed that this zzso is a zzso and 3' truncated version of a larger normal transcript that encodes a predicted zzso protein which we called zzso zzso zzso zzso releasing zzso We have now studied the structure of the mouse and human sequences and confirmed our conclusions about the nature of the zzso zzso The human gene has been localized to zzso by an in zzso zzso technique, while the mouse gene has been positioned on zzso 2 near zzso by linkage zzso The zzso of zzso to another human sequence and a hypothetical zzso protein are also zzso
