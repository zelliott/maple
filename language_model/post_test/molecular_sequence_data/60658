The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso member of the zzso repeat zzso protein zzso and zzso in zzso complexes with the zzso growth factors zzso and their binding proteins zzso These complexes are thought to regulate the serum zzso by restricting zzso movement out of the zzso However, little is known about how ALS binds to zzso or zzso which link the zzso to zzso To investigate potential sites of interaction, the ALS structure has been modeled with the crystal structure of the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor as a zzso ALS is predicted to be a zzso zzso with an internal diameter of zzso zzso an external diameter of zzso zzso and a thickness of zzso zzso These dimensions are supported by rotary zzso electron zzso of zzso The internal face is lined with a substantial region of zzso surface potential that could interact with the positively charged region on zzso known to be involved in ALS zzso The model also predicts that three potential zzso zzso sites within the zzso domain are clustered together, which may be important in light of recent studies showing ALS zzso involvement in complex formation with zzso
