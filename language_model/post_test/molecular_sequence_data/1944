Previously we have shown that avian zzso virus zzso J zzso might be present in chicken flocks from Malaysia based on zzso study and also on detection of tissue samples with zzso zzso In this study, the zzso chain reaction was used to detect zzso sequences from zzso frozen zzso Out of 21 tissue samples zzso 16 samples were positive for zzso DNA and four samples for zzso zzso However, only nine samples were found positive for zzso zzso A total of 465 base pairs equivalent to positions zzso to zzso of zzso from each of the viral zzso positive samples were zzso zzso analysis indicated that the samples showed high identity zzso to zzso and were close to zzso with identities between zzso and zzso This study indicates that zzso sequences can be detected by zzso chain reaction from frozen tissue samples with and without zzso zzso
