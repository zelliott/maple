zzso cells zzso efficiently take up zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso complexes takes place via small coated zzso while zzso zzso were mainly present in larger zzso Shortly after zzso the zzso zzso and its zzso appeared in the larger zzso Within 10 zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with typical markers for major zzso complex class zzso compartments and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso appeared not to reach these zzso suggesting that it releases its zzso in an earlier zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso of protein zzso and peptides resulted in a zzso enhanced potency to stimulate zzso class zzso zzso T cell clones compared to zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso leads to selective targeting and subsequent superior presentation by DC which may be zzso in vaccine zzso
