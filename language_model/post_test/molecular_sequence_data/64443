Separate genes zzso the human type 1 zzso breast tumors, other peripheral zzso and type 2 zzso zzso zzso of 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso 3 zzso zzso of 3 zzso produced the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the probable zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the 3 zzso created a zzso of the 3 zzso motif zzso in 3 zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are in the potential zzso site of the 3 zzso zzso zzso modeling with zzso predicted that zzso in the zzso domain is responsible for the zzso specificity of human 3 zzso and our zzso zzso tested that zzso The zzso zzso of the 3 zzso zzso shifted the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso higher zzso value measured for the 3 zzso zzso From Dixon analysis, zzso inhibited the 3 zzso activity with zzso greater affinity compared to 3 zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso exhibited no zzso activity and appear to be zzso 3 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso eliminated zzso activity, suggesting that zzso or zzso may be zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso shifted the zzso preference of both 3 zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso In addition to characterizing zzso zzso these studies have identified the structural basis zzso for an zzso difference in the zzso and zzso zzso of 3 zzso and 3 zzso zzso it may be possible to selectively inhibit human 3 zzso to slow the growth of zzso breast tumor cells and control zzso zzso near term to prevent premature zzso
