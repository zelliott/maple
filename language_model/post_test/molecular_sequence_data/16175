zzso zzso contains at least 24 distinct small nuclear zzso zzso several of which are known to be essential for viability and to participate in the zzso of zzso the zzso in this subset contain binding sites for the zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso In contrast, we showed previously that the zzso genes for three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not required for zzso although cells lacking zzso are growth impaired at low zzso None of these zzso associates with the zzso zzso To assess this apparent zzso we cloned and zzso the genes zzso three additional zzso zzso zzso of these genes with nine additional zzso zzso genes revealed a highly zzso zzso box located 92 zzso 8 zzso zzso of the zzso start zzso By using the technique of gene replacement with zzso zzso each of these three single copy genes was shown to be completely zzso We constructed multiple zzso to test the hypothesis that, individually, each of these zzso is zzso because the zzso play functionally overlapping zzso A zzso lacking five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was indistinguishable from the wild type, and growth of the zzso zzso was no more impaired than that in strains lacking only zzso This widespread zzso of zzso was completely unexpected and forces us to reconsider the possible roles of these ubiquitous zzso
