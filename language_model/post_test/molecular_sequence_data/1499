zzso A zzso radiation received from the sun and from the widespread use of zzso beds by populations residing in areas of northern latitude represents a potential risk factor for human zzso The zzso and zzso effects of UVA have remained zzso A zzso role for UVA based on DNA damage formation by zzso oxygen species as well as by generation of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Here, we investigated the zzso of UVA in relation to its DNA damaging effects in transgenic Big Blue mouse embryonic zzso We determined the formation of a typical zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and of zzso as well as zzso the induction of zzso in the zzso zzso in cells zzso with a 2000 W UVA zzso UVA zzso at a dose of 18 zzso produced significant levels of zzso in DNA zzso zzso zzso but did not yield zzso zzso UVA zzso also increased the zzso zzso frequency almost zzso over background zzso zzso zzso while showing moderate zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were characterized by statistically significant increases in zzso zzso and small tandem base deletions zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso relative to spontaneously derived zzso This zzso spectrum differs from those previously reported for UVA in other test zzso however, it zzso well with the known spectrum of zzso established for zzso base zzso such as zzso We conclude that UVA has the potential to trigger zzso zzso to its zzso effects zzso through zzso DNA zzso
