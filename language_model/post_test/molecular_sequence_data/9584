Progressive zzso with mental zzso zzso is an zzso zzso central nervous system disorder characterized by childhood onset zzso and subsequent mental zzso The locus for zzso has been mapped to human zzso zzso We recently reported the construction of a zzso zzso across the 4 zzso minimum genetic region that harbors the disease zzso We now report further zzso of the critical region to zzso zzso Our mapping strategy relied on the identification of nine novel zzso markers and the construction of a complete zzso zzso across the critical zzso Several partial gene sequences have been identified from the region and are being analyzed as candidate genes for zzso
