A synthetic zzso with the sequence of the zzso delta segment of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso forms pores in human zzso zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso This zzso forms a zzso zzso with an apparent zzso diameter of 7-9 zzso The zzso delta pore is zzso and a zzso is the species that accounts for the properties of the zzso zzso zzso that mimic other identifiable segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso do not form channels in zzso under the same zzso
