Four zzso zzso zzso zzso that were obtained from donkey oral cavities formed two distinct zzso groups when characterized by zzso and zzso zzso From the results of zzso tests, the organisms were tentatively identified as a zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing studies confirmed the organisms to be members of the zzso zzso Two of the zzso were related most closely to zzso zzso with zzso % similarity based on the zzso zzso gene and to zzso zzso with zzso % similarity based on the 60 zzso zzso protein gene zzso The other two zzso however, were related to zzso zzso with zzso and zzso % similarities based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso From both zzso and zzso evidence, the four zzso formed two distinct zzso groups and are suggested to represent novel species of the zzso zzso The names proposed for these organisms are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
