zzso zzso and zzso form a membrane part of the protein zzso zzso A zzso zzso was constructed by placing the zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso From the extent of zzso zzso the number of zzso molecules in one normal cell was estimated to be about 1,000, which is similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso stabilized the overproduction of zzso an unstable truncated zzso of zzso as effectively as zzso zzso zzso overproduction also stabilized the overproduction of zzso However, the zzso stabilization of zzso was less potent than the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso interacts with zzso which associates with zzso the zzso complex thus being formed in the zzso zzso
