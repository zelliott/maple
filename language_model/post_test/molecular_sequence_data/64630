zzso sites were zzso with DNA screening software by using about 148 zzso zzso of the human zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso number zzso zzso which includes the genes zzso zzso and zzso Regarding zzso zzso with at least four repeats and base replacements within the repetitive zzso zzso sites were zzso Sixteen of the sites were zzso and nine of them proved to be zzso with up to nine zzso per zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were observed for all zzso sites, and zzso for four zzso Some zzso DNA sequences were not only different in zzso repeats but also in zzso zzso zzso between zzso sites were in average of zzso zzso and allow the identification of a number of further zzso markers in the prion protein gene zzso The large number of zzso sites within a narrow zzso zzso can be applied to study the origin of zzso as well as the association to the zzso of zzso
