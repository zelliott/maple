zzso du chat syndrome zzso results from loss of the zzso portion of zzso zzso where the zzso reverse zzso zzso gene is localized zzso zzso is the zzso component for zzso activity that is essential for zzso maintenance and sustained cell zzso Here, we show that a zzso deletion of the zzso zzso occurs in all 10 patients with zzso whom we zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso derived from five of seven patients was lower than that in unaffected control individuals zzso The patient zzso exhibited shorter zzso than zzso unaffected individuals zzso A reduction in zzso life span and a high rate of zzso zzso were observed in cultured patient zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso expression of zzso extended the zzso zzso increased the population zzso and prevented the zzso fusion of zzso We conclude that zzso is limiting and zzso for zzso maintenance in humans in zzso zzso the zzso deletion may be one genetic element contributing to the zzso changes in zzso
