zzso cellular responsiveness to transforming growth zzso zzso is frequently correlated with decreased zzso of the type II zzso for zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized the human zzso zzso promoter and, using zzso zzso mapping and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso chain reaction, have identified five alternative zzso start sites within the region zzso to zzso DNA zzso experiments and zzso mobility shift zzso have revealed the existence of five distinct regulatory regions including two positive regulatory elements and two negative regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter zzso The first positive regulatory element zzso to zzso interacts with two distinct nuclear protein complexes, at least one of which appears to be a previously unidentified zzso zzso The second positive regulatory element zzso to zzso also interacts with two separate protein complexes, both of which appear to be novel zzso zzso zzso of either positive regulatory element markedly decreased expression of the target zzso suggesting that both positive regulatory elements are necessary for zzso expression levels of zzso zzso
