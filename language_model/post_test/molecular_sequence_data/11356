The zzso basement membrane zzso is damaged in diabetes through complex mechanisms that are not fully zzso zzso among them is zzso protein zzso leading to the formation of so-called advanced zzso end products zzso We examined the effects of in zzso zzso of intact collagen type IV in bovine lens capsule zzso and kidney zzso zzso basement zzso on their zzso to zzso zzso using zzso 1 zzso and zzso B zzso Sites of zzso of unmodified zzso collagen were located in the triple zzso zzso In zzso zzso by zzso severely inhibited the release of soluble collagen zzso peptides by zzso and zzso The distribution of zzso within the three zzso of collagen IV zzso triple zzso and zzso zzso were compared for zzso zzso using zzso fluorescence, zzso zzso and zzso towards zzso zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso zzso asymmetry was observed, with the flexible triple zzso domain having the most zzso and fluorescent zzso but the least zzso The in zzso relevance of these findings is supported by preliminary studies of zzso distribution in zzso basement membrane zzso collagen IV zzso from human zzso of two zzso diabetics and one normal zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso of diabetic zzso were similar to zzso but the zzso zzso in diabetic kidney was less in the triple zzso domain than in zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso of collagen IV contributes to the zzso of basement zzso a hallmark of diabetic zzso
