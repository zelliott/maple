Human zzso zzso zzso zzso follow a different pattern of zzso generation from those of the zzso classical I zzso These zzso have been defined as a result of random permitted point zzso in zzso However, this zzso maintenance could have an evolutionary specific pathways based on zzso regions as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or promoter zzso Therefore a systematic sequencing study of zzso zzso was done obtaining the complete zzso sequence of 16 different zzso zzso nine zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso four were zzso zzso and new zzso described zzso and three were new zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in these zzso These zzso together with those previously published, were zzso and zzso and molecular evolutionary analyses were zzso zzso showed the presence of three major specific evolutionary patterns, tentatively named zzso and the other four as minor lineages zzso one zzso The relative age of the major lineages could also be established based on the number of zzso positions and the number of zzso of each zzso Two main mechanisms are clearly defined in the generation of the lineages zzso gene conversion, and/or zzso evolution following specific zzso
