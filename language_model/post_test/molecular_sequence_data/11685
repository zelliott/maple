zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso are both zzso in zzso diabetes zzso zzso but no molecular mechanism has been proposed for their zzso We have identified a 13 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso that bears marked similarity to a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso Rudy, zzso In order to test the hypothesis that this region of similarity is implicated in the zzso of zzso we zzso T cell zzso to these two peptides in subjects at risk for zzso 

zzso at risk for zzso were zzso cell zzso zzso first degree relatives of people with zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells from 10 pairs of zzso and zzso matched control subjects were tested in an in zzso proliferation zzso 

zzso to both zzso and zzso peptides was significantly greater among zzso subjects than controls zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast to zzso to the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was almost entirely confined to the zzso zzso 

This is the first demonstration of T cell zzso to a zzso zzso In addition, it is the first example of zzso to a minimal zzso region shared between two human zzso zzso self zzso zzso between these similar peptides may provide a molecular basis for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso
