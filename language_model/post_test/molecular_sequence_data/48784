zzso droplets in plants (also known as oil bodies, zzso bodies, or zzso are well characterized in seeds, and zzso the major proteins associated with their surface, were shown to be important for stabilizing zzso droplets during seed zzso and zzso However, zzso droplets occur in essentially all plant cell types, many of which may not require zzso zzso The proteins associated with the surface of zzso zzso zzso which are likely to influence the formation, stability, and turnover of this zzso remain to be zzso Here, we have combined zzso zzso and zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify two new zzso zzso zzso which we named zzso and zzso These proteins are highly similar to each other and also to the small rubber particle proteins that accumulate in zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso was localized to the surface of zzso droplets after transient expression in tobacco zzso zzso cells that were induced to accumulate zzso We propose that small rubber particle zzso proteins are involved in the general process of binding and perhaps the stabilization of zzso particles in the zzso of plant cells and that the zzso and zzso protein members reveal a new aspect of the cellular machinery that is involved in the packaging of zzso in plant zzso
