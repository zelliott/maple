zzso zzso zzso against cultured human zzso zzso cells were zzso We obtained 7 zzso which reacted zzso with zzso of the zzso but only zzso with vessels and the surface zzso layer of normal zzso zzso characterization of these zzso indicated that 3 out of 7 were specific for the alpha 3 chain of the zzso zzso a zzso for zzso collagen and zzso Using one of these zzso we have zzso by zzso methods, the distribution of alpha 3 beta 1 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and in their normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results show that alpha 3 beta 1 is present in zzso contact areas and more abundantly at the junction between zzso cells and basement membrane in zzso zzso zzso in zzso lining the cavity of the zzso and in surface zzso of the zzso However, zzso zzso showed only weak and fragmented zzso at the zzso pole of the zzso 26 out of 31 zzso zzso zzso expressed the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso However, zzso zzso typical of normal zzso is not prominent or disappears in tumors and is replaced by a more diffuse reaction with variable zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the expression of alpha 3 beta 1 and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen IV zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso polarization of zzso was always correlated with the presence of zzso and Coll IV, intrinsic components of the basement zzso
