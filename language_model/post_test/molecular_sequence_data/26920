zzso constitute a major family of natural zzso peptides that protect the host against microbial zzso Here, we report on the zzso properties and cellular interaction of Human zzso 5 as a function of its positive charge and zzso We find that selective replacement of zzso zzso in zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso killing as well as host cell zzso We identify zzso at positions 9 and 28 in the zzso sequence as particularly important for its zzso Replacement of zzso at position 13 to zzso as observed in a Crohn's disease patient, reduced bacterial killing zzso Finally, we find that zzso interacts with host cells via zzso zzso
