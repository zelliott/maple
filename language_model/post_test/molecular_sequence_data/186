zzso airway diseases such as asthma and chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso exhibit stereotyped traits that are zzso expressed in each zzso In experimental mouse models of chronic lung disease, these individual disease traits can be genetically zzso and thereby linked to distinct zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that at least one of these traits, zzso cell zzso depends on members of the zzso zzso channel zzso gene zzso Here we review advances in the zzso of the zzso family and the evidence of a role for zzso family members in the development of zzso cell zzso and possibly airway zzso in experimental models and in zzso On the basis of this information, we develop the model that zzso proteins are not integral membrane proteins with zzso channel function but instead are zzso signaling molecules that specifically regulate airway target cells in healthy and disease zzso
