The zzso is a key zzso zzso that regulates zzso such as signal zzso and protein quality control, through the selective degradation of specific zzso zzso that target a protein for degradation, collectively known as zzso have been defined for many proteins involved in cell zzso However, the molecular signals involved in recognition and degradation of proteins damaged by zzso have not been completely zzso The current study used zzso and zzso zzso to define the properties in zzso that initiate degradation by the zzso zzso Our experimental approach involved the generation of multiple zzso zzso with specific Met replaced by zzso This strategy of zzso zzso permitted zzso zzso of Met to Met zzso We found that the zzso loss of secondary structure, as measured by circular zzso correlated with the rate of degradation for zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso in the zzso However, no degradation was observed for zzso with Met to zzso substitution in the zzso suggesting that zzso structural unfolding in the zzso region is essential for degradation by the zzso zzso zzso comparing the zzso stability of zzso zzso helped to further zzso the critical site of zzso focal disruption between zzso 51 and 72 in the zzso zzso This work brings new zzso and structural clarity to the concept of the zzso the portion of a protein that determines its zzso to degradation by the zzso
