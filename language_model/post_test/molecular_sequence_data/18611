We report the zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso characterization of the zzso proteins of the juvenile zzso zzso zzso during their zzso and zzso zzso In order to assess the structural zzso protein differences between the zzso and zzso zzso the obtained peptides were zzso by zzso low-energy zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso 

The zzso protein was isolated by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso using the zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso mixture was analyzed by zzso and the data obtained were used for the zzso mass zzso zzso identification by means of the zzso zzso 

It was demonstrated using zzso that the actual molecular weights of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso these were, respectively, zzso and zzso Using low-energy zzso we have zzso the zzso peptides to monitor the differences and similarities between the zzso molecular structures during the zzso and zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated for the first time that the actual molecular masses of the zzso protein during the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso analyses allowed the sequencing of the zzso after zzso zzso during the zzso and zzso zzso and showed some similarities and staggering differences between the identified zzso zzso
