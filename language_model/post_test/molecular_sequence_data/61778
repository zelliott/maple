The aim of this study was to zzso zzso zzso coli zzso from pigs for the genetic basis of zzso resistance, and to compare these data with those previously determined for zzso coli zzso from cattle and zzso 

Fourteen zzso zzso coli zzso were included in this study and subjected to zzso zzso profiling and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were determined by broth zzso The presence of the gene zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Transformation experiments were conducted to isolate zzso resistance zzso The zzso region of a zzso resistance zzso was cloned and zzso 

All zzso zzso coli zzso exhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso and carried the zzso zzso A single isolate had a zzso zzso of approximately 35 zzso designated zzso zzso analysis identified the zzso gene flanked by truncated zzso zzso Moreover, a truncated copy of zzso with complete zzso resistance genes zzso and zzso was found upstream of the zzso gene of zzso zzso resistant zzso coli zzso which shared the same zzso zzso pattern, differed in their zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is the smallest zzso zzso reported to zzso Its zzso region differed from those previously found in zzso coli zzso from zzso Variations in the zzso of zzso zzso fragments carrying zzso in zzso that had the same zzso pattern might suggest variable zzso integration zzso
