We investigated the effects of combined treatment with zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso regulation of heat shock genes in human colon zzso zzso zzso The drug zzso zzso which inhibited protein synthesis by zzso protected cells from killing at 43 degrees zzso For example, treatment with zzso 2 zzso before and during heating produced a zzso increase in survival from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso after 10 zzso at 43 degrees zzso Little or no protection was observed if the drug was added only during zzso Interestingly, adding the drug zzso zzso 2 zzso before and during heat facilitated the zzso of heat shock zzso zzso shock element zzso complex during continuous heating at 43 degrees zzso These findings related to the literature suggest that the free pool of zzso is increased by zzso protein zzso An increase in the level of free zzso may more effectively protect or repair zzso targets and consequently affect regulation of heat shock zzso
