zzso assessment of selected zzso sequences on zzso cells of human oral zzso was made by combined use of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso against specific zzso zzso In both frozen sections and zzso sheets without the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, identified by positive zzso with zzso and zzso zzso did not express any zzso zzso on their zzso In contrast, following zzso zzso of both types of material, the zzso type 2 chain zzso became zzso on zzso cells, indicating that zzso acid is the terminal zzso of this zzso Other zzso were ineffective in this apparent zzso and the zzso patterns of the other related zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso remained unaffected by zzso with any of the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso cells possess a unique zzso chain, the zzso zzso type 2 sequence zzso zzso zzso
