To investigate the genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso carriage zzso from animals and humans on zzso zzso zzso beef and broiler zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso using spa typing and zzso sequence typing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The presence of zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso DNA was characterized by zzso and sequencing among zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso 

Overall, 41 zzso zzso in humans and 141 in animals were found, originating from all farm zzso These zzso were mainly assigned to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed resistance to zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso showed considerably less zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remnant DNA of a composite zzso zzso element that lacked the zzso gene zzso This resulted from an zzso conversion due to zzso between the zzso genes zzso the zzso gene zzso The SCC remnant still contained an intact zzso region zzso zzso and zzso zzso zinc and zzso resistance, respectively, thereby illustrating the capacity of zzso zzso zzso to adapt to different zzso selection pressures in the farming zzso zzso such as zzso gene complex deletion probably contribute to the enormous diversity of zzso elements observed in zzso 

zzso zzso precursors from which zzso zzso might zzso were present on zzso veal and broiler farms, all of which are livestock sectors commonly known to be affected by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears to be independent of zzso zzso
