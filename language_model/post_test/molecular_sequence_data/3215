We show here that the zzso gene is essential to the growth of zzso coli K-12 and can be deleted only in the presence of a rescue zzso carrying a functional zzso zzso When zzso expression was zzso zzso DNA zzso decreased and cell division was zzso Through primer extension, the zzso start site of zzso was located at 140 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso The frequently used zzso zzso has been shown to carry an zzso transition in the zzso region of the zzso zzso This accounts for its low level of zzso zzso zzso and SAM zzso
