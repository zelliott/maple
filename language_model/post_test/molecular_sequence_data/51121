zzso factor was produced at levels of 1-2 zzso per 1 zzso zzso per zzso zzso by growth of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso The zzso IF showed a binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso and for the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly identical with native zzso zzso of the zzso intrinsic factor could be accomplished by affinity zzso but final zzso by gel zzso zzso was necessary to separate intrinsic factor from a 62 zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso This protein binds selectively to the zzso column, but demonstrates no zzso binding activity after zzso zzso quantities of zzso protein could be produced for zzso and zzso zzso The stability of intrinsic factor to pancreatic zzso was nearly identical with human gastric intrinsic factor, both native and zzso as produced in zzso zzso zzso of the intrinsic factor was demonstrated by zzso binding to the zzso protein separated on zzso and by a shift in apparent molecular mass from 47 zzso to 43 zzso following treatment of zzso cells with zzso Most of the zzso IF was produced by zzso cells in the first 48 h post zzso
