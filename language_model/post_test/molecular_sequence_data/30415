A zzso investigation of the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of the known participation of the zzso zzso zzso in this process zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso the model reactions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso protein zzso were zzso The results allowed us to propose a zzso that is in perfect agreement with the zzso zzso zzso zzso arose from Michael addition of zzso binding site zzso on the zzso double bond at the zzso of the zzso zzso Upon zzso under slightly alkaline conditions, this zzso underwent zzso to a transient zzso zzso which rearranged into the stable zzso zzso involving participation of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso peptides zzso from zzso zzso and resistant to zzso degradation zzso with the products resulting from the model reaction between the synthetic zzso and the zzso
