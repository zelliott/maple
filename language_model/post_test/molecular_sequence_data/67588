zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are powerful new research tools that enable targeted gene disruption in a wide variety of model zzso Recent work has shown that zzso can induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso but to date only four genes have been altered, and zzso tests of the success rate, zzso efficiencies and zzso transmission rates have not been zzso Here, we constructed zzso zzso to 10 different targets in various zzso zzso genes and found that 7 zzso pairs induced targeted zzso zzso with high efficiencies ranging from 2 to zzso We also tested zzso zzso zzso and found that these zzso induce zzso with comparable or higher zzso and have better toxicity profiles than their zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by both zzso and zzso zzso are passed efficiently through the zzso in some cases reaching zzso zzso For one target gene zzso we observed substantially reduced zzso efficiency for a zzso site bearing two mismatched zzso raising the possibility that zzso might be used to perform zzso gene zzso Our results suggest that construction of one to two zzso zzso pairs for any given gene will, in most cases, enable researchers to rapidly generate knockout zzso
