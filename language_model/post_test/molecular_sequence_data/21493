zzso of zzso M zzso beta zzso has been reported in human zzso however its role in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso remains zzso Using differential display, earlier we reported the identification of an alternatively spliced zzso of zzso in zzso Here in we characterized this novel zzso zzso a soluble form of this zzso zzso and determined its clinical significance and correlation with the expression of zzso zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso beta zzso zzso in zzso 

In zzso analysis was carried out to characterize the zzso expressed transcript of zzso and its expression was determined in zzso and matched normal zzso zzso using zzso zzso The expressions of both truncated and full length zzso proteins were analyzed in zzso zzso and patients' zzso using western zzso and zzso By zzso we have also shown direct interaction between zzso and zzso We also explored the relationship between expression of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso in primary human zzso and normal zzso using zzso 

zzso of alternatively spliced zzso zzso transcript was detected by zzso in 9 of 11 zzso Analysis of the soluble zzso revealed absence of zzso protein in zzso zzso however, zzso and western zzso analysis showed its presence in zzso of zzso patients further confirming expression of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis in tissue zzso zzso format showed expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong correlation was observed between zzso expression of zzso and zzso in tumor cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50, zzso zzso zzso and nuclear expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso serves as the major zzso in zzso 

An alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso a soluble form of this zzso has been characterized in zzso We speculate that the truncated zzso characterized here in may act as a zzso zzso for zzso Our zzso study showed that zzso and its zzso is not activated in zzso
