Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is a life-threatening disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus zzso zzso The spike zzso zzso of zzso is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus zzso by zzso zzso knowledge of zzso zzso on the S protein is helpful for designing protective zzso To analyze the zzso structure of the zzso zzso domain, the zzso half of the S zzso we first used zzso from zzso SARS patients to test the zzso of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire zzso and identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso to Ala 828 and Pro 1061 to zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso can be zzso by these two zzso we zzso animals and found that both of them could induce the zzso zzso In some animals, however, only one zzso zzso zzso to Ala zzso was able to induce the zzso with the binding ability to the native S protein and the zzso activity to the zzso zzso This zzso is highly zzso across different zzso zzso Identification of a zzso zzso zzso on the zzso domain of the zzso S zzso which has the potential for inducing zzso zzso has implications in the development of effective vaccines against zzso
