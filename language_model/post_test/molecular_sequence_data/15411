zzso delta virus zzso is a defected zzso virus and requires its zzso large zzso zzso to interact with helper viral proteins zzso during zzso Recently, a study demonstrated a direct binding of the zzso zzso from zzso I zzso to the zzso heavy chain zzso which suggests that this interaction might facilitate zzso zzso If zzso binding to zzso is essential to zzso life cycle, a zzso box sequence at the zzso of zzso should be zzso across all zzso However, the zzso sequence of zzso is variable among 43 zzso zzso 

Based on the presence and location of zzso box at the zzso of zzso from 43 zzso of zzso we classified them into three zzso Group 1 (13 zzso and 2 zzso zzso contain a zzso box located at zzso acids zzso and zzso respectively, as found in zzso I and zzso zzso Group 3 (4 zzso contains no zzso box as found in zzso zzso zzso binding by three different zzso zzso I to zzso was then tested by in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of plasmids which zzso fusion proteins of zzso and full-length of zzso from three zzso into zzso cells, a human zzso cell line, was zzso zzso down zzso showed that a full-length of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso Further in zzso studies showed a full-length or zzso zzso acids 1 to zzso of zzso can be pull-down by zzso peptides of zzso from three zzso of zzso 

Both in zzso and in zzso studies showed that zzso can bind to various sequences of zzso from the three major zzso of zzso We therefore suggest that the zzso interaction is essential to the zzso zzso and that sequences binding to zzso are zzso selected, but nonetheless show the diversity across different zzso zzso
