zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are valuable tools to probe the zzso relationship of zzso zzso In this investigation, a new toxin gene zzso the zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso by constructing zzso library method, and the zzso zzso zzso was characterized zzso The mature zzso of zzso has 39 zzso acid zzso including six zzso zzso The zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso zzso had a pharmacological profile where it inhibited zzso channel currents with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas 10 zzso zzso zzso inhibited about zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso zzso In addition, 10 zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso and zzso channel zzso Multiple sequence alignments showed that zzso had no zzso toxin zzso but it was similar with zzso channel toxins from scorpion and zzso in the arrangement of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a new zzso channel blocker with a unique primary zzso Our results indicate the diversity of zzso channel toxins from scorpion zzso and also provide a new molecular template targeting zzso zzso
