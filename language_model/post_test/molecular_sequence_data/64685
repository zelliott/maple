Two small zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to contribute to the zzso zzso and to shape the firing behavior in zzso for example in the zzso formation, the zzso zzso nucleus, the zzso nucleus, and the zzso In zzso expression systems, zzso and zzso currents are blocked by the bee zzso toxin zzso just as well as the corresponding zzso zzso zzso However, the functional role and pharmacological profile of zzso channels from rat brain zzso is still largely unknown, as so far zzso zzso channels could not be functionally zzso We have performed a domain analysis to zzso the pharmacological profile and the molecular zzso of zzso channel expression by using channel zzso in combination with zzso zzso analysis, and zzso Our results reveal that the zzso zzso is zzso in cells but does not form functional zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso for that of zzso or zzso is sufficient to rescue the functional expression of zzso zzso Additionally, transplantation of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso onto zzso zzso normally forming functional zzso channel, zzso their functional zzso while zzso channels containing only the zzso zzso zzso are zzso These results suggest that the lack of functional expression of zzso channels is probably due to problems in their assembly and zzso but not in their zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso channels containing the core domain zzso of zzso unlike zzso are zzso
