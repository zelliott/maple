zzso zzso zzso was first identified as a zzso zzso whose levels increase in response to zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso via zzso of zzso We have identified zzso a novel zzso protein that regulates zzso synthesis by modulating zzso activity in both the absence and presence of zzso zzso We find that zzso levels are also elevated in response to zzso stress, yet, only the zzso of zzso levels are regulated by zzso Under zzso conditions the levels of zzso are zzso lower than the levels of zzso zzso and zzso After a 10 zzso exposure to zzso stress the levels of zzso rise zzso bringing it to a cellular concentration that is similar to the other zzso This suggests that zzso plays a major role in zzso stress, perhaps via regulation of zzso zzso In fact, during zzso stress the zzso zzso of zzso cells changes dramatically, to smaller, more highly fragmented zzso whereas zzso unable to zzso zzso continue to maintain a single large zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso regulates the levels of zzso and provide insight into why zzso levels rise in response to zzso zzso
