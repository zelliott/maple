Plants contain both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso and is represented by two zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso identical in zzso acid zzso In the present study we show that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity strictly dependent on zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso of the protein and its zzso is relatively zzso zzso This property makes zzso sensitive to zzso by zzso which appears to inhibit zzso activity by converting the zzso of zzso zzso into irreversible oxidized forms zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents this irreversible process by reacting with zzso zzso to give rise to a mixed zzso zzso as demonstrated by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be fully zzso either by zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso or, less zzso by zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso zzso The potential relevance of these findings is discussed in the light of the multiple functions of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso control of gene expression and zzso that appear to be influenced by the zzso state of the zzso zzso
