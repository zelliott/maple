The zzso zzso 2 of tobacco necrosis virus A zzso zzso encodes the viral coat zzso is zzso and presumably zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is translated cap zzso This zzso translation requires the leader and a 140 zzso element of the trailer both in wheat germ extract and in tobacco zzso Similar to barley yellow dwarf virus zzso the zzso zzso and 3' elements stimulate translation zzso zzso zzso analysis of the secondary structure of the zzso trailer revealed that the 3' translation element is part of a major zzso zzso that contains similarities to structures in the zzso 3' translation zzso These data suggest that the translation mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso To further characterize this relationship, we tested whether zzso exists between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 3' zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso element stimulates translation zzso with the zzso 3' element in zzso This finding is the first evidence for conservation of structures that enable a zzso interaction stimulating zzso zzso
