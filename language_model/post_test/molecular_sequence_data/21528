The zzso response element binding protein zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso factor, plays a critical role in the control of zzso in the zzso To identify the direct targets of zzso on a zzso scale and provide more insight into the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso gene zzso we performed zzso zzso and gene expression zzso We identified zzso zzso binding sites and zzso target genes using the zzso from zzso a human zzso zzso cell zzso A motif search revealed a refined consensus sequence zzso to better represent critical elements of a functional zzso binding zzso Gene zzso analysis shows that zzso target genes are particularly associated with zzso fatty acid and steroid zzso In addition, other functional gene clusters related to zzso development and cell zzso are significantly zzso Gene set enrichment analysis reveals that zzso target genes are highly correlated with genes regulated by high zzso providing a functional relevance to the zzso binding zzso Furthermore, we have demonstrated that zzso may function as a zzso zzso as well as an zzso
