We have adapted and extended the decoy zzso technique for use in zzso To identify zzso regulatory elements within a promoter, we developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso technique and applied it to zzso from zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso for production of the zzso zzso Our in zzso mapping data allowed us to create decoy zzso incorporating the identified regulatory elements and to test whether their introduction into zzso zzso affected zzso zzso We mapped the promoter region when in a zzso inactive state before the onset of zzso production with the aim of designing decoy zzso capable of interfering with potential zzso binding and so stimulate zzso zzso zzso identified five candidates for decoy zzso and these were tested in a zzso zzso to rapidly validate their zzso A zzso protocol was developed for liquid cultures that enabled efficient zzso of zzso and quantitative real-time zzso demonstrated decoy persistence for zzso zzso zzso of the effects on growth, expression of zzso and zzso production demonstrated that one of the zzso in zzso with the plate zzso was more zzso than the others in increasing zzso zzso Two of the identified regulatory elements occurred upstream of gene zzso deletion of which reduced zzso production, confirming that experimental analysis of regulatory motifs can provide new insights into factors influencing zzso production in zzso
