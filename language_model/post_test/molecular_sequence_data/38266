DNA sequences with very high similarity zzso to the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso gene have been amplified by zzso in zzso of human breast tumors and in zzso of normal breast tissue zzso et zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by these findings, which suggested an zzso viral zzso for a certain percentage of human breast tumors, we have screened a panel of human breast tumors and normal breast tissue for the presence of zzso DNA zzso Using similar zzso procedures and stringent zzso techniques, we have detected the presence of zzso zzso gene sequences in 37% of the human breast tumors that we have zzso DNA sequencing has shown these sequences to be zzso zzso to the zzso strain of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso strains of zzso We have not detected these zzso sequences in normal breast zzso However, we have detected these sequences by zzso and stringent zzso in a zzso zzso of a breast cancer patient who was simultaneously diagnosed with both zzso Our results support the possibility of an zzso zzso zzso for a certain percentage of human breast zzso Our results also suggest that a similar zzso zzso zzso may exist for certain human zzso zzso In many zzso strains of mice, both breast cancer and zzso zzso are caused by zzso zzso in a certain percentage of humans, one or both of these diseases may be caused by an zzso zzso zzso
