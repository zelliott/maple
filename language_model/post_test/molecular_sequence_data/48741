Much tremendous break through have been obtained in recent years for zzso sequencing to achieve the goal of zzso zzso As a method of single zzso sequencing, zzso sequencing can discriminate the individual molecules of the target DNA strand rapidly due to the current zzso by zzso the zzso through a zzso zzso Both the zzso and solid-state zzso channels which called single zzso sequencing have been studied widely for the application of zzso sequencing zzso This review will give a detail representation to protein zzso and solid-state zzso zzso For protein zzso sequencing technology, we will introduce different zzso types, device assembly and some challenges still exist at zzso We will focus on more research fields for solid-state zzso sequencing in terms of materials, device zzso zzso methods, zzso process and some specific zzso The review also covers some of the technical advances in the union zzso sequencing, which include zzso sequencing combine with zzso zzso synthesis and design zzso
