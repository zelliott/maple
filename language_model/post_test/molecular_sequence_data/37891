A novel zzso oxidized low density zzso zzso zzso was recently identified in bovine zzso zzso zzso It is strongly suggested to have a potential role in the initiation and development of zzso In this study, we have isolated zzso clones zzso the rabbit zzso of zzso by screening a rabbit zzso zzso zzso In zzso acid sequence and domain structure organization, the rabbit zzso is highly zzso with the human zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso to zzso cells zzso on them the activity to bind and zzso oxidized low density zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso protein by Western zzso analysis with a specific zzso zzso zzso analyses by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso revealed that zzso was accumulated in zzso Watanabe zzso zzso rabbit zzso compared with normal rabbit zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso expression of zzso was primarily localized within the zzso at the earliest stages of zzso The most prominent zzso was in the zzso cells of zzso Furthermore, the distinctive zzso of zzso was identified in the zzso of zzso areas of Watanabe zzso zzso rabbit zzso Taken together, these findings support the possibility that zzso might be involved in the initiation of zzso
