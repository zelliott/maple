At northern latitudes the sea zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso contain unidentified green zzso zzso in addition to zzso belonging to the zzso zzso This dual zzso zzso involving members of distinct zzso zzso in one host, has been extensively studied from the perspective of the ecological and energetic consequences of hosting one symbiotic type over the zzso However, the identity of the green zzso zzso has remained zzso We determined the zzso position of the marine zzso inhabiting zzso zzso by comparing sequence data from two cellular zzso the nuclear zzso zzso zzso gene region and the zzso zzso zzso The results support the inclusion of these zzso in a zzso of green algae that form zzso with animal zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso and seed plant zzso zzso This zzso is distinct from the Chlorella zzso of zzso The zzso diversity of zzso hosts observed in this zzso indicates a predisposition for this group of algae to participate in zzso An zzso approach to the study of these algae, both within the host and in culture, should yield important clues about how algae become zzso in other zzso
