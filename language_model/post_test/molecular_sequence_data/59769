This study analyzes the three-dimensional structure of the zzso binding protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso was solved at zzso A by X-ray zzso and as expected from sequence zzso zzso to zzso identical to zzso zzso its overall structure is very similar to zzso zzso The zzso unfolding transition temperature of this protein was measured by differential scanning zzso to be 101 degrees C, which is more than 40 degrees C higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data show that the affinity of zzso for its DNA target, unlike its zzso counterparts, is enhanced by increasing the temperature and salt zzso The structure reveals possible explanations for this zzso and these unusual DNA binding zzso The crystal structure of this zzso protein was compared to its zzso zzso and analyzed for differences in the native structure that may contribute to zzso zzso found were: zzso a zzso bond not found in zzso zzso zzso an increased number of surface zzso zzso zzso more compact protein zzso The presumed DNA binding surface of zzso like its zzso counterparts, is zzso but the zzso profile surrounding the protein is relatively neutral compared to the zzso positive potential that surrounds zzso zzso The total reliance on a zzso interface with DNA may explain the enhanced affinity of zzso for its DNA promoter at higher temperatures and increased salt zzso
