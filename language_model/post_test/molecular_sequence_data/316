zzso of bacterial zzso proteins has been known for zzso however, there is still very limited information available on specific locations of the zzso sites in zzso proteins and the role they might play in protein zzso In this study, we have mapped the specific zzso sites in 24 zzso coli zzso proteins by tandem mass zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by either zzso specific zzso techniques, zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso or by mass zzso equipped with a capability to detect addition and loss of the zzso zzso zzso by immobilized metal affinity and/or strong zzso exchange zzso was used to improve the success of detection of the low abundance zzso We found the small zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the large zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be zzso at one or more zzso Potential roles for each specific site in zzso function were deduced through careful evaluation of the given zzso sites in zzso structure models of zzso and the previous zzso studies of zzso coli zzso zzso
