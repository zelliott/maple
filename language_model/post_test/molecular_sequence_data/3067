We describe here the identification and characterization of avian zzso a zzso protein of a recently identified family of zzso factor zzso proteins zzso including zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as avian zzso The zzso is zzso from zzso but not from zzso zzso As other members of the family, zzso has binding regions for the focal zzso protein zzso and for the zzso exchanging factor zzso zzso comparison indicates that zzso is the avian zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies showed a largely diffuse distribution of the full length zzso without evident effects on cell zzso We observed a dramatic difference between the zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso including the zzso domain and the three zzso repeats, and the zzso portion including the zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of truncated zzso zzso including both the zzso and zzso regions leads to a marked zzso of the protein together with zzso at large zzso zzso of the expression of corresponding zzso zzso from zzso and zzso shows their distribution at distinct zzso zzso Altogether, these data support a role of distinct members of this family of zzso in the regulation of different steps of membrane traffic during cell zzso and suggest that zzso may shuttle between an zzso compartment and the cell zzso although, further work will be needed to address this zzso
