zzso is a hybrid containing zzso and zzso cores, which contribute to binding and zzso of DNA, zzso DNA strand zzso by the zzso zzso is significantly enhanced by the addition of zzso or zzso zzso The preferential cutting site of zzso is on the 3' side of zzso bases zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is clearly different from the cutting sites of zzso and zzso The zzso and the stem regions of zzso zzso are zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso may be a useful zzso for probing secondary structures of zzso zzso of DNA with zzso and zzso D alters the cutting mode of zzso zzso DNA breakage is strongly inhibited by zzso of the DNA with zzso A and zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with the minor groove of the DNA zzso zzso of the zzso core into the DNA followed by the attack of the zzso zzso formed from the zzso core is considered as a possible mechanism of action of zzso
