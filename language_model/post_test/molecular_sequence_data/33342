The zzso development of lateral roots and zzso is a highly regulated zzso Recent studies suggest the existence of cross talk and zzso in the growth of these two zzso Although plant hormones, including zzso and zzso appear to be key players in zzso this cross talk, very few genes that zzso root and zzso development have been uncovered so zzso This study reports that a zzso of zzso DIVISION zzso zzso a core component of the zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso in controlling the overall number of lateral roots and zzso A partial suppression of this gene in zzso zzso leads to a decrease in number of lateral roots and a zzso increase in number of zzso The roots showing lowered expression of zzso also show reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso thus providing a potential function of zzso in zzso zzso
