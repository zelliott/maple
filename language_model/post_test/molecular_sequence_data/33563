zzso zzso is a marine zzso with zzso zzso activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city zzso in the zzso province of zzso Analysis of its zzso zzso and zzso characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso strain showed a strong similarity zzso with the 16 zzso gene of zzso zzso Application to zzso substance of strain zzso zzso zzso by various separation steps led to isolation of one active zzso having a retention time of zzso zzso zzso zzso which possessed zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso Through analysis by liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the peak, the molecular weight of the zzso substance zzso zzso zzso was zzso Da and it was determined to be zzso according to the analysis of zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the zzso substance was zzso This study is the first to introduce the finding of zzso produced from marine zzso zzso This work provides a preference for the production of zzso in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the zzso of marine zzso
