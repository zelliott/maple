zzso zzso 3 domain zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that upon zzso in zzso cells activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso activity is regulated are not well zzso The small zzso family zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to bind and zzso the activities of signaling zzso including zzso which contain zzso interactive binding zzso zzso of zzso and activated zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso interactive zzso motif contains six of the eight consensus zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, we show that zzso contains a functional zzso interactive binding motif that is required for zzso association with and zzso by zzso However, experiments using a zzso zzso that lacks the zzso zzso zzso stretch suggest that this region may also contribute to zzso zzso Unlike the zzso family of protein zzso we find that the zzso of zzso by zzso cannot be zzso in an in zzso system using zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso mapping demonstrates that zzso of activated zzso with zzso alters the in zzso zzso zzso pattern of zzso suggesting that the mechanism by which zzso increases zzso zzso activity involves a change in the in zzso zzso of zzso This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstrated example of a zzso change in the in zzso zzso of a protein zzso These studies suggest an additional component or cellular environment is required for zzso zzso by zzso
