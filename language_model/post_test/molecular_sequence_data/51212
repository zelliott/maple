The structures of the zzso zzso region and the zzso IV region of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been examined by means of energy zzso and molecular dynamics zzso zzso distances between neighboring zzso zzso zzso in zzso II, III, and IV were between zzso and zzso zzso The overall axis for the zzso zzso region is warped rather than zzso zzso of additional zzso base pairs in loop B and loop C was not evident from the atomic positions calculated by molecular zzso Bases in loop C are well zzso showing no significant change during zzso Bulge migration in zzso III does not seem to be zzso the zzso zzso region prefers one zzso zzso II is more stable than zzso zzso Five base pairs in zzso IV were sufficiently stable to establish that zzso IV is terminated by a hairpin loop of three zzso zzso zzso from loop zzso zzso of the zzso zzso segment and the zzso IV segment of zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by molecular dynamics were generally consistent with the solution structure zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso
