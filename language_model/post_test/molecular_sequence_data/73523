In previous studies we have described a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream of muscle zzso 1 that exhibits properties consistent with a zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study has been to identify the sequence elements responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that this zzso is active in zzso and zzso zzso zzso but functions poorly in zzso and zzso zzso The core zzso region was zzso to a 195 zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and sequence analysis identified three zzso box and two zzso motifs as potential zzso regulatory zzso zzso competition and zzso zzso indicated that sequences within a 30 zzso region containing single adjoining zzso box and zzso motifs are target binding sites for trans zzso factors expressed in zzso zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso within these motifs resulted in a significant reduction in zzso activity in zzso zzso These results suggest that the mechanisms governing zzso gene expression in muscle are similar to those identified in other zzso zzso However, the zzso profile of zzso activity and trans zzso factor binding suggests a more specialized role for this zzso that is consistent with its potential involvement in zzso gene regulation in cardiac zzso
