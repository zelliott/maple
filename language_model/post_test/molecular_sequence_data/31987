The zzso locus is located in the major zzso complex zzso class II region and involved in immune zzso We identified 20 zzso sites in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2, one of the most critical regions of the zzso zzso zzso in 60 Nigerian zzso Four sites are located in the zzso binding region, and 10 zzso acid zzso are peculiar to Nigerian zzso compared with published zzso A significantly higher ratio of zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso sequence evolution is driven by balancing selection zzso zzso zzso In zzso functional analysis using zzso predicted that substitution zzso with a zzso score of zzso zzso zzso zzso is harmful to protein zzso The zzso tree from consensus sequences placed the two northern breeds closer to each other than either was to the southern zzso This first report of sequence diversity at the zzso locus for any African goat breed may be useful in the search for zzso zzso
