A major problem associated with zzso treatment is rapid emergence of drug-resistant zzso zzso a compelling need is to discover zzso drugs against alternative viral targets in addition to zzso zzso zzso IN and zzso One such target is the interaction between zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso An zzso motif zzso of zzso recognizing both the base sequence and the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso region as well as newly zzso zzso zzso inactive zzso are important for the specific zzso zzso According to the possible binding zzso the zzso have been mainly divided into two zzso zzso zzso binding directly to zzso zzso either to the zzso zzso zzso zzso region alone or to the zzso zzso together with the lower and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding directly to zzso protein with high zzso thus zzso zzso zzso They both block zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso complex to exert zzso activity in primary human zzso Recent researches also focus on the drugs targeting specificity of zzso and zzso by such new zzso as zzso zzso and zzso crystal zzso zzso reporter systems are established for zzso screening of novel compounds that interfere with zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso also finds wide application in this zzso The zzso interaction is an important target in efforts to develop zzso gene therapy or potential therapeutic zzso agents for the treatment of zzso zzso
