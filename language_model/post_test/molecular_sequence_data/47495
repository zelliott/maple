The zzso zzso sequence and zzso position of the zzso 5 zzso gene has been described for the model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A 272 base pair zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso product spanning zzso 3, zzso 3, and zzso 4 was generated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso product was used to isolate a zzso zzso clone containing the complete zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso gene consists of four zzso separated by three zzso zzso of the zzso coding sequence with coding sequences from zzso species revealed 61 to zzso identity at the zzso level and 48 to zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso complex compound zzso was identified within zzso 2 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was also found in other zzso including the swamp zzso tree zzso zzso zzso South American zzso zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso using DNA from the zzso clone on zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso gene is located on zzso zzso
