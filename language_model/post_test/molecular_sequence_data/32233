zzso surface protein C zzso of zzso zzso is a key zzso factor that mediates zzso to host cells and immune evasion of the host zzso zzso binds the host immune and complement regulator factor zzso which is composed of 20 short consensus repeats zzso This interaction contributes to zzso zzso In this study, we identified within the factor H protein two separate zzso binding regions, which were localized to zzso and zzso by using zzso factor H deletion zzso for Western zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso A detailed analysis of binding zzso in these zzso by zzso spot zzso identified several linear binding regions within the sequences of zzso and zzso In addition, the factor H binding site was mapped within the zzso zzso protein to a zzso stretch positioned in the N zzso zzso zzso Factor H attached to the surface of zzso via zzso significantly enhanced zzso adherence to host zzso and zzso zzso This zzso was specific and was blocked with a truncated zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, the acquisition of factor H by zzso via zzso occurs via two contact sites located in zzso and zzso and factor H attached to the surface of the zzso promotes zzso to both host zzso and zzso zzso
