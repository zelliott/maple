In bacteria, functionally related gene products are often zzso by a common zzso Such zzso transcripts are rare in zzso Here we isolated several clones from human zzso libraries, which rescued the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were derived from the zzso transcript previously described to zzso the zzso zzso of the human zzso P zzso P) zzso We identified a second, 3' open reading frame zzso on the zzso transcript zzso a protein showing similarity to known zzso and zzso 2 zzso The protein was localized in zzso and the zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso 2 zzso Based on our results, we named the protein human zzso zzso 2 zzso which is involved in zzso fatty acid zzso The zzso arrangement of zzso and zzso as well as the general zzso structure of the zzso is zzso in zzso from fish to humans, indicating a genetic link zzso for 400 million years between zzso processing and zzso fatty acid zzso
