The present review deals with the use of zzso zzso libraries, composed by zzso in the capture and concentration of the zzso zzso This method, first reported in 2005, is compared with other current zzso aimed at exploring the zzso zzso such zzso depletion of zzso proteins (especially in zzso and zzso zzso by individual or combined zzso (up to 20 against the most abundant zzso narrow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso library are also zzso namely in assessing the proper length of the zzso and the behavior of shorter zzso down to capture zzso by single zzso zzso A number of examples on the use of this library is given, such as the analysis of biological zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of cell zzso zzso red blood zzso In all cases, it was possible to detected from three to five times as many proteins as compared to control, zzso zzso Perhaps the most spectacular results were obtained with the zzso zzso where zzso proteins could be identified in the zzso zzso representing only zzso of the total cell zzso Another interesting area of application regards the concentration and detection of trace zzso zzso zzso proteins meant for human zzso several host zzso never reported before, could be revealed for the first zzso Other nonhuman samples are currently under investigation, such as zzso (where no less than 148 unique gene products could be zzso egg zzso (with 255 unique zzso and latex from zzso zzso It is anticipated that the zzso library could be a most useful tool for detecting zzso for different zzso and for drug zzso As a future zzso one could envision the synthesis of specialized libraries able to capture given classes of proteins zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, the library could be used in association with other techniques currently in zzso such as zzso gels, zzso and the zzso
