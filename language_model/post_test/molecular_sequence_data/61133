The zzso zzso zzso apparatus of zzso zzso consists of the core zzso for zzso zzso zzso and the specificity zzso The core zzso is zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the specificity factor shows similarities with bacterial zzso zzso Recently it was shown that the zzso core zzso is widespread among the zzso lineage and a common picture for the zzso zzso apparatus in zzso cells is now zzso In contrast to the situation for the core zzso the gene for the specificity factor has only been identified from zzso zzso and more recently from two other zzso zzso As the specificity factor is the key component for initiation of zzso at the zzso promoter we wanted to study in more detail gene zzso regulation, and the function of the promoter of the nuclear zzso zzso For this purpose the zzso zzso level for zzso was investigated under a large number of different growth conditions and thereby exhibited a very low, but regulated and carbon zzso zzso zzso experiments identify the minimal promoter for functional zzso in zzso To evaluate the functional conservation of the promoter elements the zzso zzso gene from the closely related zzso zzso zzso was isolated and tested in zzso zzso zzso In spite of a highly zzso protein sequence these studies demonstrate that at zzso number zzso is not able to substitute for zzso in zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that differences in gene expression are responsible for the failure in zzso zzso This finding prompted us to compare the promoter regions of zzso from four different zzso zzso For this purpose the sequences of the zzso regions from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso A comparison of these sequences identifies significant differences and rapid changes in the zzso regions, even between closely related zzso zzso
