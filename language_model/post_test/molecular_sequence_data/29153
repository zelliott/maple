We here report sequence analyses of a newly described family of putative zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso zzso were identified in select bacteria, zzso and zzso but only in the zzso kingdom of zzso These proteins can exist either as single zzso chains or as pairs of zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that these proteins exhibit 10 zzso zzso segments zzso having arisen from a five zzso precursor by an early zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree of the zzso family reveals that most proteins cluster according to zzso zzso with only a few exceptions, suggesting that the former proteins are zzso All family members exhibit zzso zzso (and occasional zzso extensions that show limited sequence similarity with a domain of unknown function found in many zzso and zzso The significance of these observations is zzso
