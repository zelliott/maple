Recent studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier family 41, members 1 and 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso can zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso potential zzso channel, zzso M, member 7 zzso with a capacity to grow and zzso zzso and zzso display distant zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso first characterized in zzso zzso These sequence similarities prompted us to investigate whether zzso could potentially compensate for the lack of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso is able to rescue the growth of zzso zzso zzso However, contrary to a previous report that describes regulation of zzso channel gating by zzso in a bacterial zzso model system, whole cell patch clamp analysis revealed no zzso current development in zzso cells expressing zzso In addition, we observed that zzso expression is strongly zzso at high zzso zzso similar to what has been described for its zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is required for normal zzso channel function, functionally confirming the predicted importance of this domain in regulation of zzso zzso zzso Overall, our findings show that consistent with its proposed function, zzso zzso zzso by zzso is able to restore cell growth and proliferation of zzso cells and supports the concept of functional zzso between zzso and its zzso zzso
