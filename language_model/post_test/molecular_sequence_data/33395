In light of the complexity of wound zzso zzso analysis may not clearly reveal the nature of the wound or the processes involved in zzso However, zzso associated with wounds may provide a zzso on cellular events leading to the development of the wound and/or its zzso In this investigation we performed zzso analysis on wound zzso from muscular wounds in mice caused by two very different types of snake zzso zzso zzso a snake zzso zzso and zzso a snake zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso associated with these wounds clearly differentiated them and offered new perspectives on functional mechanisms by which these toxins cause tissue zzso In the case of wounds caused by the zzso there was evidence of degradation of zzso zzso whereas the zzso wound zzso was noted by the presence of zzso collagen type I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso caused by snake zzso zzso may be associated with the degradation of specific zzso zzso proteins which play a role in zzso stabilization and that release of zzso from their complexes may be involved with the dysfunctional zzso observed following snake zzso
