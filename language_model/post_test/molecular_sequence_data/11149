The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene is highly zzso within zzso zzso Its pattern of expression in zzso seems to be tightly regulated both zzso and in a zzso manner, but shows differences with zzso To identify zzso regulatory elements in the zzso promoter region, we have used a combined approach based both on the analysis of the zzso structure in zzso in rat zzso and on evolutionary clues zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso sites were identified within a 36 zzso region encompassing zzso zzso Eleven of them are clustered in a zzso zzso region that exhibits zzso zzso zzso observed when comparing sequences from eight zzso species representing four orders zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the two sets of data allows the identification of two types of regulatory zzso Some are zzso between species, such as a zzso zzso response element zzso and a zzso element zzso located respectively at positions zzso and zzso zzso relative to zzso Some are zzso elements such as a 300 zzso zzso zzso stretch that is present only in zzso Analysis of zzso interactions in zzso with rat tissue protein extracts on the zzso elements revealed that the zzso site binds a specific zzso complex composed of zzso zzso D and a protein zzso related to zzso protein in the zzso whereas the zzso site binds zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso cells showed that the zzso site supports a high zzso zzso activity but is not able by itself to induce a response to zzso whereas the zzso site acts as a weak zzso zzso by zzso Lastly, we found that the zzso zzso stretch zzso zzso zzso hypersensitivity under conditions of zzso pH and zzso This indicates a non-B DNA zzso and thus reinforces the biological significance of zzso zzso strand asymmetry in the regulation of zzso Thus the tight zzso regulation of zzso expression involves the combination of multiple regulatory elements that act in the zzso environment in zzso Some of them are zzso throughout evolution, such as the zzso element, which is clearly involved in the zzso level of zzso others are zzso
