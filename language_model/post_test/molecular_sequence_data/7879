zzso sodium channels are involved in the initiation and propagation of action zzso in many excitable zzso Here we report that zzso a gene defined by a zzso zzso zzso in zzso encodes a novel integral membrane protein that dramatically stimulates functional expression in zzso zzso of the zzso sodium channel alpha zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Using a heat shock promoter to control zzso gene expression in transgenic flies, we demonstrate that zzso gene expression is required during zzso development to rescue adult zzso In addition, we demonstrate a role for the zzso gene product in zzso
