zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso All so far characterized zzso from zzso plants, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso and an zzso and are thus considered to be involved in a terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso their zzso zzso differently from zzso zzso producing zzso or zzso respectively, in addition to zzso and an zzso and are therefore involved in a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso five zzso zzso are present with zzso or zzso zzso and three of them (the zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a distinct zzso zzso Here, a comparative study of the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso which shows that all four zzso strongly resemble their zzso counterparts, being able to zzso the common zzso zzso and/or zzso through a zzso zzso zzso The existence of this zzso in zzso plants is also evidenced in zzso These zzso are also able to zzso the naturally occurring uncommon zzso zzso and zzso the latter being involved in important plant zzso zzso Furthermore, data zzso reveal some important differences in zzso specificity among the various zzso which suggest functional diversity inside the zzso gene zzso These results represent a new starting point for further understanding of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathways in zzso
