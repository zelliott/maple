zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a member of a large family of zzso filament zzso Here, we zzso how zzso of zzso on zzso of the zzso domain regulates its zzso distribution and its interaction with zzso in zzso cells and in in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution reduced the capacity of zzso to zzso with peripheral zzso membrane zzso zzso a zzso zzso mimicking a zzso zzso state, accumulated in zzso regions and promoted the formation of zzso zzso in two cell zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso this zzso remained associated with cellular zzso in zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso was almost completely zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso bound zzso more efficiently in an in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso collagen invasion in zzso cells, in a manner dependent on zzso zzso Based on our findings, we propose that zzso to other zzso zzso zzso family members, zzso of zzso switches the protein from a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso might act as an zzso of signals controlling the assembly of the zzso zzso and cell zzso in a zzso
