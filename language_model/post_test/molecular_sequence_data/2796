zzso analyses of the zzso gene promoter from the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso were performed by progressively deleting the 230 zzso upstream from the zzso coding sequences towards the zzso zzso zzso promoter sequences retaining the full zzso zzso leader of zzso were inserted in front of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter activity in zzso zzso cells was measured using the transient zzso expression zzso The removal of sequences to a position 101 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso did not affect the level of zzso zzso zzso of a further 13 zzso reduced zzso expression by three- to zzso but the removal of three more zzso which deleted most of the zzso very late gene zzso consensus zzso almost completely abolished zzso The removal of the zzso motif had no effect on the level of transient zzso We conclude that a sequence of about 101 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient for high level promoter activity in this transient zzso
