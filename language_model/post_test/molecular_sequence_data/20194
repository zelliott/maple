The zzso long-range correlations detected in DNA sequences contrast with characteristic lengths of zzso zzso being particularly incompatible with the zzso zzso homogeneous DNA zzso By computing the local behavior of the zzso zzso alpha of zzso fluctuation analysis zzso we discriminate between sequences with and without true zzso and we find that no single zzso exists in the human zzso Instead, human zzso show a common compositional structure with two characteristic zzso the large one corresponding to the zzso and the other to small and medium scale zzso zzso
