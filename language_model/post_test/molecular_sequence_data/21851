The discovery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso regulators in zzso zzso led to broader searches for novel zzso and their biological zzso Unlike zzso genes and some long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not known to contain zzso within their zzso precursor zzso Because the short length of zzso zzso a statistically definitive assignment of split genes in zzso sequencing data sets, we took an experimental approach toward testing the zzso of zzso and functional zzso zzso To definitively evaluate the possibility that zzso could derive from interrupted zzso we constructed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for their zzso capability and biological activity in the developing zzso Our studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently spliced and processed to produce zzso with normal zzso and zzso these zzso can be functional in full rescue of zzso zzso in zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence to support the ability of zzso zzso precursors to produce functional regulators and identifies an additional zzso available for zzso zzso zzso
