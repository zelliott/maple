We have cloned a mouse zzso that encodes zzso a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso domain or zzso factor and is associated both with a zzso form of zzso and with a free zzso zzso zzso promotes the assembly of zzso and zzso H in zzso stabilizing the transient zzso H zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso is independent of the zzso state of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Assembly of active zzso H zzso can also occur through an alternative zzso zzso that requires zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso H complex formation can be achieved by multiple zzso
