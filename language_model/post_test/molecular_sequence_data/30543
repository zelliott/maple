Most zzso hormones and zzso are zzso as larger precursor zzso which are zzso processed to mature zzso zzso An early event in zzso maturation is zzso zzso occurring usually at pairs of basic zzso acids zzso zzso Since many of the characteristics of a zzso zzso are unknown, distinguishing these zzso from other cellular zzso in zzso has been zzso In this report, the zzso specificity of a model zzso processing system, the zzso cell line zzso zzso was characterized in zzso to establish a set of criteria by which putative zzso zzso may be zzso To determine the role of composition of the paired basic zzso acid site in directing zzso a series of zzso zzso containing altered zzso sites was constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso since this zzso was previously shown to be processed by these zzso To control for zzso effects, all four permutations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were introduced at both the efficiently processed zzso site separating the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and at the zzso processed site in the zzso sequence near the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso sites were also introduced at the zzso junction to assess the requirement for paired zzso and zzso Identification of zzso peptides demonstrated efficient processing of zzso and inefficient processing of zzso and zzso sites at both positions in the zzso The zzso zzso however, was processed in a zzso manner, being efficiently zzso between zzso and zzso but only about 50% processed within zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso zzso cells, although surprisingly zzso was partially zzso These results indicate a strict preference of the zzso zzso zzso for paired basic zzso acids ending in zzso but that processing efficiency of some sequences may be modulated by location within the precursor zzso
