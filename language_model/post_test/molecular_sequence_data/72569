The presence of a zzso mechanism in zzso is suggested by the ability of specific zzso to stimulate zzso proliferation in culture and to induce de zzso bone formation in some experimental zzso Our study examines whether zzso zzso stimulate zzso through the recently identified G zzso calcium zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso aluminum zzso and zzso zzso DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso cadmium zzso and zinc zzso had no zzso With the exception of zzso the zzso zzso and apparent affinities were similar to that reported for zzso zzso zzso also zzso DNA synthesis in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, or zzso transformed zzso and zzso zzso In addition, similar to other growth factors, zzso zzso activated zzso of a serum response element zzso reporter construct zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso We were unable to detect zzso expression by Northern analysis using a mouse zzso probe or to amplify zzso zzso by reverse transcribed zzso chain reaction in zzso zzso These findings suggest that an zzso zzso mechanism is present in zzso zzso that is functionally similar to but zzso distinct from zzso
