zzso bovine zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso is among the most serious threats for livestock producers in zzso zzso zzso zzso production seems to play a crucial role in zzso of this zzso A wide number of attenuated strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso SC are currently used in Africa as live zzso zzso metabolism is not affected in these vaccine strains and therefore it does not seem to be the zzso of their zzso A zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso has been described zzso The zzso zzso virulent African strains isolated from outbreaks with severe zzso which express the zzso zzso zzso from strains to be considered less virulent isolated from zzso outbreaks with low mortality and vaccine zzso which express the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso SC considered virulent and possessing the zzso zzso zzso but not strains with the zzso zzso zzso do trigger elevated levels of damage to embryonic bovine lung zzso cells upon incubation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, strains expressing the zzso zzso zzso show a lower zzso activity on the zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to strains that possess the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso SC does not lead to zzso zzso Rather, the viability during addition of zzso in zzso buffers is higher for strains zzso the zzso zzso zzso than for those with the zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that the studied zzso in the zzso gene is one possible cause of the difference in bacterial zzso among strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not act as a direct zzso factor, but strains possessing the zzso zzso zzso with low zzso activity are more prone to survive in environments that contain high levels of zzso thus contributing in some extent to zzso
