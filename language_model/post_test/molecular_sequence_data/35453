zzso zzso zzso is associated with at least nine diseases in Australia and New zzso The impact of this zzso is zzso both economically and zzso The zzso of a zzso isolate was zzso in an effort to understand its zzso and zzso zzso with a closely related Australian isolate enabled us to examine mechanisms of zzso zzso 

The complete zzso sequence of a zzso lethal zzso zzso isolate of zzso zzso zzso was zzso It is a circular zzso of zzso base pairs with zzso predicted open reading zzso Despite being 80 zzso larger than another zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso the variation between zzso genes was generally less than zzso at a zzso zzso The difference in size between the two zzso was largely due to the number and size of potential mobile units zzso which contributed to some changes in gene zzso zzso of the zzso of the two zzso revealed that the highly zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso seems to be associated with zzso and zzso zzso Two types of zzso have been identified on the basis of the order of three to four zzso zzso with both zzso appearing to have been present in the last common zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso showed that modification zzso were, in general, zzso A putative zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso appeared to have no analogue in any other zzso and we believe has been introduced by way of lateral gene zzso A putative zzso zzso analogous to that found in zzso was present in both zzso although all examples in zzso appear to be zzso Comparative analysis identified highly zzso zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso which may indicate how the gene is excised and zzso 

zzso of two assembled zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown they possess a high level of zzso This comparative analysis has yielded clues as to how zzso occur, and the identification of sets of genes that appear to be associated with these zzso
