zzso the remarkably high species diversity and levels of zzso found among zzso zzso and zzso has been the focus of many zzso One hypothesis that has received much attention proposes that zzso climate fluctuations spurred zzso While spatial patterns of distribution and zzso relationships can provide support for zzso predictions, zzso estimates of divergence are required to determine the fit of these zzso patterns to zzso or zzso zzso We use zzso DNA sequence data to test whether divergence times among zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are compatible with a hypotheses of zzso zzso We estimate the zzso species tree and associated divergence times under a zzso zzso In addition, we examine the zzso structure and population divergence times within two sister species of zzso primarily distributed in the zzso and zzso of Madagascar zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We find that divergence events among zzso lineages occurred in the zzso and zzso and are thus far older and incompatible with the hypothesis that recent climate fluctuations are related to current species zzso However, the timing of zzso zzso and spatial patterns of population genetic structure within zzso and zzso suggest a role for both intrinsic barriers and recent climate fluctuations at zzso zzso zzso information across spatial and zzso scales allows us to identify and better understand the mechanisms generating patterns zzso
