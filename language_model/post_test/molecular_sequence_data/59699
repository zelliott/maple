zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of a partial zzso of the sex determining region Y zzso gene was used for zzso a young zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a species in which gender determination from the external zzso is zzso DNA was extracted from hairs of a zzso zzso as well as the dam and zzso as external zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso both from the offspring and the zzso but not amplified from the zzso The DNA sequence (166 bases without zzso of the zzso zzso product was determined and compared with zzso sequences of other zzso previously zzso High zzso of their zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso sequences indicates that the zzso product of the zzso was amplified from a region of the zzso zzso and that zzso sequences are zzso throughout zzso zzso From the result the sex of the young zzso was determined as a zzso The zzso method using hairs for zzso the zzso provides an advantageous tool for captive propagation plan in zzso To the zzso knowledge, no report regarding zzso sequences in the order zzso zzso has been zzso
