zzso often zzso their hosts from environmental sources, but little is known about how environmental and zzso populations are zzso Here, zzso zzso and diversity were investigated in a natural community of zzso bacteria from the zzso zzso These bacteria live in the soil and also form beneficial root zzso zzso with zzso including those in the zzso zzso Two hundred zzso pure cultures of zzso bacteria were isolated and zzso from wild zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were cultured directly from symbiotic zzso and from two zzso on the zzso zzso root tips and mature zzso root zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were reconstructed using the internal transcribed zzso zzso and the structure of zzso zzso among bacteria was examined by host species and zzso zzso zzso were performed to confirm the zzso status of a subset of zzso Most recovered zzso zzso were unique and found only in root surface communities, where little bacterial population genetic structure was detected among zzso zzso most zzso zzso could be classified into several zzso zzso zzso that were zzso clustered within host zzso This pattern suggests that host infection provides ample rewards to symbiotic bacteria but that host specificity can strongly structure only a small subset of the zzso zzso
