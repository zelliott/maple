The zzso zzso the closest human zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a large number of different partner genes in both acute zzso and acute zzso zzso We have identified a new partner zzso zzso fused to zzso in a case of acute zzso zzso The gene is located on zzso zzso where two other zzso partner zzso zzso and zzso have also been zzso The deduced protein of 368 zzso contains a central zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso domain most similar to the zzso zzso domain found in the zzso family of zzso zzso analysis of the fusion zzso transcript in our patient reveals that zzso 6 of zzso is fused to the zzso end of zzso a fusion that would create a zzso protein that includes the major functional domain of zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of tissue types and encodes a protein of approximately 46 zzso The zzso protein is the human zzso of a member of a recently described zzso zzso zzso protein zzso It is also highly related to a putative gene identified in zzso zzso and a number of similar sequences are present in the zzso databases of several zzso
