zzso zzso receptors zzso are thought to be zzso zzso complexes consisting of zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso assemble functional zzso channels even without zzso zzso zzso and with a different zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso To explain this phenomenon, we screened zzso for zzso zzso zzso and found all four zzso zzso zzso to be present zzso with those zzso the zzso zzso being particularly zzso We cloned the full-length zzso zzso and zzso it with zzso in zzso A detailed zzso characterization revealed that the pharmacology of zzso was identical with that of the presumed zzso zzso expressed from zzso zzso By contrast, zzso receptors containing the rat zzso zzso showed significant pharmacological differences compared with zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso interact with an zzso expressed zzso zzso and form hybrid zzso zzso These findings confirm the current views that zzso are obligatory zzso complexes and that functional zzso zzso do not zzso
