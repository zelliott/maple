zzso structures of two zzso zzso zzso sibling species, one with a zzso zzso the other with a zzso zzso distribution, were studied from zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene zzso zzso zzso showed high overall diversity and little zzso structure across the Arctic, indicating zzso zzso among coastal and lake populations from Alaska, zzso and the north of zzso A strongly divergent zzso lineage was however identified in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn displayed clear structuring among zzso isolated zzso lake zzso The zzso pattern of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso suggested relatively small population sizes and a remarkably fast zzso zzso divergence rate zzso per 10 zzso zzso Nevertheless, the broader zzso pattern did not support distinct eastern and western glacial zzso in Northern Europe, unlike in some other aquatic zzso In all, the two species comprised three zzso zzso lineages zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso to the bulk of zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso of the two species in respect to their zzso zzso could indicate zzso zzso zzso also exemplified by an evidently more recent capture of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso population of zzso zzso Overall, the data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a relatively recent ancestry in arctic coastal waters, whereas two other zzso zzso zzso sibling species in Europe zzso zzso and North America zzso zzso have zzso inland waters much earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso
