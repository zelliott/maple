Type 1 diabetes is a zzso disease in which presentation of zzso to zzso zzso is thought to play a crucial zzso zzso of zzso class II genes accounts for 50% of the genetic risk of contracting type 1 zzso zzso and zzso molecules zzso to or protecting from type 1 diabetes have been identified, but the molecular basis controlling these associations is as yet zzso Apart from distinct zzso selection of zzso zzso by susceptible and protective zzso zzso exclusive presentation of zzso peptides by type 1 zzso zzso molecules or, zzso induction of regulatory zzso by protective zzso are potential mechanisms for modification of type 1 diabetes risk by zzso zzso As a first step in exploring the role of zzso molecules in zzso cellular responses in type 1 diabetes, we have screened peptides covering the sequence of two major zzso targeted by zzso and cellular immune responses, zzso and zzso zzso zzso for binding to class II zzso We developed a sensitive novel competition binding zzso allowing us to measure zzso binding on intact cells to 10 zzso and 4 zzso zzso For all tested zzso multiple peptides binding with high affinity were zzso We report zzso of binding peptides in the zzso regions of zzso and zzso as well as highly zzso binding patterns of some zzso Our results demonstrate that most peptides derived from the zzso and zzso zzso can bind to both type 1 zzso and type 1 zzso zzso zzso although some exceptions were zzso The binding inventory presented here for zzso and zzso peptides can be useful for mapping natural zzso and predicting zzso responses induced by preventive zzso
