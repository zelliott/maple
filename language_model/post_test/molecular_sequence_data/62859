We identified a novel zzso which encodes a zzso sequence with a zzso zzso type 1 zzso Unlike the other zzso proteins of the zzso family, this gene encodes no apparent zzso zzso site, but has a putative nuclear zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed transient expression in the central nervous system zzso during zzso In zzso zzso showed its expression in the zzso part of the neural tube on 10 and 12 zzso especially in the boundary region between roof plate and zzso This expression was enhanced in the zzso zzso The signals were observed in other zzso such as zzso region neighboring forelimbs and zzso zzso around the zzso zzso We named this gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells showed its zzso in zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may become zzso or nuclear protein by some processing, while most of other proteins with zzso type 1 domain are zzso zzso The expression of zzso was reduced in zzso double knockout zzso zzso might be a novel marker of the boundary between the roof plate and zzso and may contribute to the development of zzso neural tube under the regulation of zzso
