Previously, we isolated a zzso clone for the zzso zzso B1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of a zzso that encodes the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso expression of the two zzso zzso during zzso and zzso At zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso in most zzso zzso including three zzso zzso zzso zzso and fat zzso and the wing zzso zzso The anterior silk zzso was the only tissue where zzso was zzso These expression patterns were different from observations demonstrated in zzso In the anterior silk zzso both zzso zzso were expressed zzso during the fifth zzso zzso while expression of the A zzso preceded that of the B1 zzso by two days in the fourth zzso zzso of zzso during the fourth zzso and synchronization of both zzso during the fifth zzso were also observed in the middle and zzso silk zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso in the silk zzso is regulated differently in these two zzso In the cultured anterior silk zzso of day 0 of the fifth zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was induced dose zzso by more than 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were induced within 2 h and 1 zzso respectively, of the addition of zzso These results suggest that the increase of zzso zzso during the fifth zzso is induced in zzso by a small increase in zzso
