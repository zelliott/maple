A gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso predicted a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with a potential zzso signal zzso When the zzso gene was expressed in zzso one major band of zzso 37 zzso was identified, while zzso activity zzso experiments identified a zzso band of zzso 29 zzso determined by zzso analysis of the zzso The deduced zzso zzso region zzso to zzso showed sequence zzso to partial zzso sequences of other zinc zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly with respect to zzso zzso
