Evolution comprises cycles of amplification, zzso and zzso To study evolutionary phenomena, zzso strand displacement amplification zzso of zzso DNA as an in zzso model for zzso replication of viruses has been coupled to a positive selection zzso First, two subsequent amplification reactions utilizing zzso zzso zzso were performed under direct observation using the fluorescent dye zzso zzso Under the chosen conditions, the zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for base zzso and zzso zzso Then, a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso coupled to its zzso end was used to select for double strands that retained their ability to form a zzso with the zzso zzso for zzso formation were chosen such that only 10 to zzso of the SDA products were allowed to bind the third zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to separate zzso from unmodified double zzso and only triplex strands were used to initiate a new round of zzso amplification and zzso Nine such rounds with about zzso molecular generations were zzso The final zzso spectrum was characterized and compared with those of amplification reactions without additional selection zzso While without selection pressure base zzso and deletions throughout the initial zzso rapidly produce a diverse zzso distribution, the consensus after nine selection rounds clearly shows two zzso hotspot zzso Using gel shift zzso and a newly developed zzso zzso I zzso technique, it could be shown that both the initial zzso and the final consensus do not differ significantly in their triplex formation zzso As opposed to this, they do show different amplification zzso The final consensus sequence is amplified with the highest rate in the exponential reaction phase, while the most abundant zzso which is characterized by two additional point zzso is the sequence with the highest amplification rate in the linear growth zzso
