Despite evidence that DNA zzso I is required to relieve zzso stress during DNA replication and transcription, zzso strains with a zzso zzso zzso are viable and display no gross defects in DNA or zzso zzso possibly because other proteins provide overlapping zzso We isolated zzso whose zzso or growth zzso is relieved when zzso is expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes define at least four zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso is zzso to zzso previously shown to be zzso to zzso over two short zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso acid protein with zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso have elevated zzso zzso and fail to shut off zzso zzso II zzso in stationary zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso for zzso display reduced expression of zzso and Cell zzso Box zzso zzso and are zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso indicating that both proteins may share a common function with DNA zzso zzso The existence of multiple zzso zzso groups suggests that not all biological functions of zzso I can be carried out by zzso zzso
