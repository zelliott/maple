zzso zzso virus zzso is a large zzso DNA virus and a prospective member of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso marine green zzso zzso zzso the smallest known zzso zzso Here we present the 191 zzso base pair zzso sequence of zzso which has 232 putative zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the viral gene products exhibit a similarity to proteins of known functions in public zzso These include a variety of unexpected zzso for example, a zzso zzso a zzso a zzso zzso a number of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a total of 8 zzso zzso A total of 11 predicted genes share zzso with genes found in the zzso host zzso In addition, an zzso was identified in the DNA zzso gene of zzso This is the first report of an zzso in the zzso of a virus that zzso zzso zzso Fifteen core genes common to zzso large zzso virus zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso This new sequence data may help to redefine the zzso of the core genes of these viruses and shed new light on their evolutionary zzso
