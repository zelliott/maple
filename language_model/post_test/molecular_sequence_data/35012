Two novel members of the zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were cloned by Race zzso The two precursors we identified exhibit the classical organization of zzso zzso zzso a signal zzso followed by a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso domain is entirely zzso for the zzso zzso but the zzso and the signal peptides zzso The first zzso called zzso is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso The second zzso called zzso shows sequence zzso with a zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso and with a novel form of zzso described in New World zzso The expression of zzso is restricted to the zzso and zzso masses of the brain whereas zzso is expressed in the entire central nervous zzso zzso as described for zzso zzso the zzso activity of several muscles such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this suggests its involvement in reproduction and blood zzso zzso is released in the zzso it is a zzso able to target numerous peripheral zzso
