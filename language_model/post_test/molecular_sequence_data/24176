It has been suggested that there are at least 15 Mal d zzso zzso genes in one zzso of apple zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso and identified 12 members of the Mal d 1 family, including the previously reported Mal d zzso and Mal d zzso an zzso zzso of the previously reported Mal d zzso Eight Mal d 1 gene products were expressed in zzso fruit, in either the zzso or the skin, and most of these were also expressed in leaves in response to challenge with zzso zzso zzso zzso disease of zzso Mal d 1 gene products were identified from a large number of different zzso Degree of ripeness as measured by standard parameters was shown not to predict either the amount of protein able to bind to a specific zzso zzso zzso previously shown to bind to an zzso zzso in Mal d zzso and zzso or the amount of Mal d 1 zzso zzso Mal d zzso and Mal d zzso were the most highly expressed zzso in zzso zzso particularly in the skin of fruit, and these zzso were also zzso in other zzso and species of zzso zzso however, differed in relative predominance of Mal d zzso and Mal d zzso The predominantly expressed Mal d 1 genes in ripe apple fruit were translated in zzso into proteins and proteins binding to the zzso were found in all zzso and species zzso New Mal d 1 proteins were identified that bound to the zzso zzso At least two new zzso have been identified, and while some structural differences are predicted between groups of zzso the zzso motif is identical in all except two zzso A role in zzso zzso in plants is suggested and in zzso expression of the zzso should help in assessing their relative roles in disease, allergic responses, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso
