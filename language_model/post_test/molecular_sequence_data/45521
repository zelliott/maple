The interaction of zzso coli zzso regulator with operator DNA is disrupted by the zzso zzso zzso This is a general, yet zzso regulatory mechanism for the large zzso family of zzso regulators to which zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain of zzso regulator and its complex with zzso were determined at zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso involved in zzso binding were explored in zzso and in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso repression by zzso zzso analysis revealed low conservation of zzso acid zzso participating in zzso binding among zzso regulators, which reflects potential chemical diversity of zzso zzso recognized by members of this zzso Comparing the zzso structure to that of zzso zzso zzso the other representative of the zzso family that has been structurally zzso indicates that both proteins assume similar zzso structures as a zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso region, which in zzso involve the zzso region, resulted in zzso of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and were functionally inactive in zzso zzso does not appear to function through the zzso of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso change the zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso resulting in altered outline of zzso zzso
