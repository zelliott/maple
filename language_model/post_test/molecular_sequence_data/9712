zzso is a low molecular weight zzso and zzso zzso which is zzso by protein zzso C during zzso learning, and reproduces many of the cellular effects of learning, such as the reduction of zzso currents in zzso Here, the secondary structure of cloned zzso zzso was determined by circular zzso in zzso solution and by zzso transform infrared zzso both in solution and on dried zzso The results obtained with the two techniques are in agreement with each other and coincide with the secondary structure zzso from the zzso acid zzso In solution, zzso is one-third in zzso and one-fifth in zzso The zzso of the protein in solid state depends on the concentration of the starting solution, suggesting the occurrence of surface zzso The secondary structure also depends on the binding of zzso which causes an increase in zzso and a decrease in zzso as estimated by circular zzso The zzso of zzso is independent of zzso strength, and the zzso structural transition is slightly inhibited by zzso and low zzso while favored by high zzso The switch of zzso secondary structure upon calcium zzso which was confirmed by intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso is zzso and occurs in a zzso meaningful range of zzso zzso The zzso form is more zzso than the zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso overall zzso is not affected by calcium zzso as assessed by zzso liquid zzso zzso results from zzso experiments indicated that calcium is necessary for zzso to inhibit zzso channels and thus to increase membrane zzso Therefore the zzso zzso equilibrium of zzso could serve as a molecular switch for the short term zzso of zzso activity following zzso zzso
