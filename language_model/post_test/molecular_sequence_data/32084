The functional effect of zzso near the zzso mouth of the short viral zzso zzso channel was studied by molecular dynamics zzso As a model system we used the zzso zzso and truncated zzso a channel with known crystal structure that shares genuine local sequence motifs with zzso By a novel simulated zzso methodology for structural zzso information about the structure and dynamics of the zzso mouth was extracted and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso interaction site zzso integral equation theory for the determination of the zzso free energy zzso Besides the zzso analogue of zzso with its experimental reference activity zzso zzso two zzso were zzso a deletion zzso where the zzso is further truncated by eight zzso zzso showing zzso in the zzso reference system, and a point zzso where the zzso zzso at position 13 is zzso by zzso resulting in zzso The zzso reveal that the change of activity is closely related to a zzso zzso zzso formed by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the point zzso is correlated with both zzso and zzso factors, while zzso of the deletion zzso is related to a loss of specific salt bridge patterns between the zzso and zzso at the zzso and to the consequences for zzso passage zzso as revealed by integral equation zzso The zzso gate, however, is probably formed by the zzso segment up to the zzso zzso and not by the zzso The results are compared with design principles found for other zzso
