The zzso region of the zzso protein zzso contains a pair of tandem zzso zzso zzso repeats that are essential for the zzso zzso function of the zzso Similar repeat sequences have been identified in many proteins that seem to mediate cellular mechanisms for dealing with DNA zzso The zzso domain in zzso has been recently shown to constitute a module for recognizing zzso zzso zzso with a recognition groove that spans both zzso zzso The fact that many other zzso proteins have zzso binding activity suggests that zzso repeats might mediate zzso zzso interactions in processes that are central to zzso checkpoint and DNA repair zzso
