zzso zzso including zzso and maturation of zzso zzso and zzso is a fundamental process that is critical for cell growth, division and zzso Previous studies showed that zzso in components involved in zzso zzso resulted in abnormalities in zzso and leaf development in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are important zzso that are responsible for processing of zzso and zzso of small zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso 1 zzso a gene zzso a predicted protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso plays a role in female zzso development and male zzso zzso zzso were arrested at stages ranging from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that the progression of the zzso division during female zzso was impaired in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso development was not affected in zzso However, the fitness of the zzso zzso tube was weaker than that of the zzso leading to reduced transmission through the male zzso zzso is featured as a typical zzso domain protein and interacts physically with zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Together, our data suggest that components of the zzso zzso family, such as zzso play important roles in zzso development and function in zzso
