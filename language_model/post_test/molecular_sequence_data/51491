We have used zzso zzso in embryonic stem cells to generate mice carrying a zzso in the gene zzso zzso an zzso recognition zzso and the major protein of peripheral nervous system zzso These mice are deficient in normal motor coordination and exhibit zzso and occasional zzso zzso in their peripheral nerves are severely zzso and a subset of zzso figures and zzso zzso The zzso leads to an abnormal regulation of some, but not all, molecules involved in zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is essential for the normal zzso zzso and maintenance of the peripheral zzso sheath and the continued integrity of associated zzso They further suggest that this protein conveys a signal that regulates zzso cell gene zzso
