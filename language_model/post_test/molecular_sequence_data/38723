We have cloned a novel zzso zzso that is expressed in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso showing up to zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso which have the function of connecting cell surface zzso proteins to zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso 4 and was expressed in the liver, zzso zzso and zzso and in 7- to zzso zzso The highest level of zzso was observed with zzso which is a new zzso protein of the zzso zzso A human zzso of the mouse zzso zzso showing significant zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso DNA and zzso zzso Furthermore, seven rat zzso clones and one pig zzso clone in the zzso zzso database were identified as having zzso sequence zzso with the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a highly zzso gene that encodes a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso
