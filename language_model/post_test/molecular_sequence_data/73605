This paper describes the identification of a new family of zzso genes that zzso zzso proteins containing zzso to the zzso zzso domain found in the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso are approximately 30 zzso in size, and each contains a putative signal zzso a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso are not the products of differential zzso of the known zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso produced in zzso human embryonic kidney cells zzso zzso binding by the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may function in zzso to zzso zzso zzso or, zzso as novel zzso for as yet unidentified zzso
