Previous studies indicated that weak zzso to zzso class I by mouse T cells is due to the inefficient interaction of mouse zzso with the alpha 3 domain of zzso class zzso The present study using zzso zzso molecules with zzso alpha 3 domain between zzso and zzso as well as single zzso acid zzso of zzso demonstrated that each substitution at zzso 224 and zzso affects recognition of zzso mouse zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso with mouse zzso alpha was zzso by substitution at zzso 224 but not by that at zzso zzso This indicates that the substitution at zzso zzso affects recognition of zzso zzso but does not critically affect binding of zzso to zzso class I zzso although zzso 224 abrogates binding of zzso The model structure of the alpha 3 domain of zzso suggests that the substitution at zzso 224 zzso zzso change of zzso binding loop, whereas minimum structure change by the substitution at zzso zzso is zzso It is therefore speculated that minimum structure change of zzso binding loop by substitution at zzso zzso may influence binding affinity of zzso which abrogates recognition of zzso zzso but not zzso production of the zzso T cell zzso
