zzso the simplest and most ancient zzso of zzso zzso in their zzso complex and highly sophisticated proteins that evolved together with zzso and are found only in zzso zzso We report here the finding of a Bruton zzso zzso zzso protein in the marine sponge zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of one sponge zzso predicts a zzso zzso which contains all of the characteristic zzso for the zzso family of protein zzso zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso identity, zzso overall zzso was found with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was therefore named zzso Human zzso is involved in the maturation of B cells and zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso zzso zzso from the zzso family are not present in zzso zzso and, until now, they were found only in insects and higher animal zzso Our finding implies that the zzso genes are of a very ancient zzso
