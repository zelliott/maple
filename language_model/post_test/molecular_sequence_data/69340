We have cloned the promoter of the avian beta 3 zzso zzso Using a probe zzso the zzso region of an avian zzso beta 3 zzso characterized by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends, several clones were isolated from an avian zzso zzso One major and one minor zzso start site were identified at zzso and zzso base pairs, respectively, with the latter coinciding with a consensus sequence of an zzso DNA sequence analysis of 800 base pairs zzso of the zzso start site fails to reveal either a zzso or zzso zzso In addition to an zzso the first 200 base pairs contain consensus sequences for the binding of zzso and zzso A zzso zzso located immediately upstream of the zzso start site exhibits functional promoter activity, and deletion analysis reveals both zzso and zzso zzso In light of our observation that zzso D3 zzso zzso beta 3 transcription, we determined whether the avian beta 3 promoter contains a vitamin D response element zzso zzso reporter zzso containing the first zzso zzso upstream of the major beta 3 zzso start site respond to D3 with enhanced zzso zzso Analysis of this region reveals a classical zzso consensus zzso located at zzso to zzso The following observations support the hypothesis that this sequence represents a functional zzso 1) a zzso pair zzso zzso or a zzso pair zzso each containing the putative zzso respond to D3 when zzso into zzso zzso 2) a zzso pair DNA zzso derived from zzso DNA and containing the candidate beta 3 zzso specifically binds the vitamin D zzso X zzso beta complex; and 3) avian zzso zzso nuclear extracts bind to a synthetic zzso containing the beta 3 zzso sequence and, in turn, are specifically displaced by zzso beta 3 zzso and zzso D zzso zzso
