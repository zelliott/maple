zzso C4 zzso zzso zzso an integral membrane zzso zzso the zzso of zzso A4 with reduced zzso to form zzso the zzso parent of the additional zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso of a zzso clone from a 129 mouse zzso library contained the full-length gene of zzso zzso for mouse zzso The mouse zzso gene is comprised of 5 zzso of zzso 100, 71, 82 and zzso zzso with zzso sizes that range from 76 zzso to 937 zzso The zzso boundaries are identical to those of the human genes for zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso extension demonstrated a single zzso site 64 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region revealed multiple putative sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso mapped the mouse zzso gene to mouse zzso 11, in a region containing the genes for zzso 13 and zzso factor, and zzso to the zzso location of zzso for the human zzso zzso Thus, the mouse zzso gene is similar in size, zzso organization and zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso Recent zzso analysis of the zzso function of human zzso has identified zzso and zzso as critical for acid and base zzso of zzso and reduced zzso zzso A comparison across species for proteins that possess zzso activity reveals conservation of both of these zzso whereas zzso is absent in the zzso zzso Thus, within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alignment of specific zzso allows the separation of zzso family members from their most structurally similar counterparts, the zzso zzso
