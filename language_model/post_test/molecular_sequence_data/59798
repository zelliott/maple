zzso zzso have specialized transport functions for the exchange of carbon and nitrogen compounds between zzso and root zzso Plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary active zzso in plant cells and it could drive exchanges across zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso is a functional zzso pump because after removal of its zzso domain and can complement a zzso zzso unable to zzso a zzso zzso is not zzso since it is also expressed in roots of zzso zzso It belongs to the zzso of plasma membrane zzso defined by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and the tobacco zzso and corn zzso zzso In zzso zzso in zzso sections indicates high expression of zzso limited to zzso zzso These results were confirmed by zzso The relatively low expression of plasma zzso zzso in zzso cells put a note of caution on the origin of the zzso zzso described in preparations of zzso zzso Also, our results indicate that active transport in symbiotic zzso is most intense at the plasma membrane of zzso cells and support a specialized role of zzso tissue for nitrogen zzso
