zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso high zzso zzso from a zzso donor to consensus zzso zzso sites in newly zzso proteins in the zzso of the rough zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso complex composed of six zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso of the zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the functional characterization of the zzso gene that encodes the zzso of the zzso zzso disruption of the zzso locus was lethal in zzso zzso showing that expression of the zzso protein is essential for zzso zzso of the zzso protein suppresses the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and increases in zzso and in zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso An analysis of a series of conditional zzso zzso demonstrated that defects in the zzso protein cause zzso zzso of soluble and zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso show marked reductions in the in zzso transfer of high zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to a zzso site zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso protein was found to be zzso identical to the zzso protein zzso against zzso cell zzso a highly zzso protein initially identified in zzso zzso The protein sequence of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso at highly zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso
