Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso These zzso containing a zzso zzso and an zzso on opposite sides of the zzso were designed for zzso labeling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso active site cavity differing in distance from the zzso zzso zzso studies proved that zzso I and II coordinated with the zzso iron via their zzso in the zzso active center, whereas probe III did zzso This result in conjunction with data from kinetic studies suggests zzso I and II are appropriate for zzso labeling of the zzso zzso active zzso Thus, probe II was used to identify zzso acid zzso within a distance of the probe length (about zzso zzso from the zzso Analysis of a zzso digest of the probe zzso zzso zzso revealed a single labeled zzso corresponding to position zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight, zzso was identified as a probe II zzso The location of the labeled site in three-dimensional structures of bacterial zzso and in zzso zzso zzso models is zzso
