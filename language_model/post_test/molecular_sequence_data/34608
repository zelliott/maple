zzso zzso zzso is known from South Africa, Malaysia and zzso The fungus causing this disease, zzso zzso forms dry chains of zzso on surfaces of zzso zzso which develop in zzso on zzso Similar zzso are characteristic of zzso zzso the type species of zzso zzso therefore, is the appropriate zzso zzso for zzso zzso while zzso is a zzso zzso (based on zzso zzso For zzso zzso the combination zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso the palm pathogen zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso species from palm, two species of zzso and the zzso pathogen zzso zzso are zzso and belong to the zzso zzso based on partial nuclear large zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, is the zzso of zzso in which the zzso are classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the only other zzso species, has affinities with the zzso and is excluded from this zzso zzso species form zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso arise in zzso liquid heads on zzso zzso zzso zzso with somewhat truncated ends arise in long, persistent, dry chains on zzso zzso No zzso but zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that are held in chains are shorter than those of zzso zzso of which no living material is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso specifically to their zzso They form pale yellow to pale orange or zzso orange zzso respectively, and more or less white zzso zzso Most strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso originate from palm zzso form mostly zzso or zzso colonies and zzso zzso zzso They form a zzso zzso to which zzso zzso and zzso zzso are related based on analyses of the internal transcribed zzso regions and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso Few zzso sites in the ITS zzso and zzso gene indicate that zzso zzso comprises two zzso one of which has been detected only in South zzso
