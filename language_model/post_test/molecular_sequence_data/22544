Although the zzso gene is prevalent among zzso of the zzso zzso zzso only a small number of them usually express the respective zzso zzso protein zzso However, under culture conditions below pH zzso many of the zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso begin to produce zzso while some others remain zzso Four zzso classes of zzso zzso were identified under defined standard culture conditions: class 1 comprises strains with a zzso synthesis of zzso class 2 comprises strains with an acid induction of zzso class 3 comprises strains with silent zzso zzso and the fourth class comprises strains which do not contain the zzso gene zzso 0 zzso The expression of zzso was found to be controlled by a zzso mechanism because cloned zzso genes from classes 1, 2, and 3 strains remain silent in zzso coli zzso while easily expressed in zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in classes 1, 2, and 3 strains does not coincide with the zzso sequences of the respective promoter or structural regions of the zzso zzso but depends directly on this zzso regulatory system which appears to be differently modulated in the distinct zzso zzso
