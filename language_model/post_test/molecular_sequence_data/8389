The molecular cloning and sequence analysis of four structurally zzso linked genes zzso that zzso the major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso strain zzso are zzso The isolation of rearranged copies of zzso and zzso and the identification in the zzso regions of all four genes of short zzso sequences that were similar to the zzso family of zzso zzso suggested that zzso DNA inversion was involved in zzso zzso Evidence for zzso inversion of the 497 zzso DNA fragment, which was located between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and which contained the promoter and zzso coding sequence of zzso was obtained by zzso chain zzso amplification of zzso forms of these zzso However, to account for all of the zzso gene copies cloned in this study, a more widespread inversion phenomenon must be involved in the zzso of these genes and a model for multiple zzso DNA zzso at the zzso locus is zzso In this model the four structurally zzso zzso genes can be assembled from one of four structurally zzso zzso coding regions and a zzso zzso coding region and can be expressed from a single zzso It is zzso that this genetic capability zzso zzso zzso with the ability to switch the zzso specificity of one of its major surface zzso
