zzso are essential components of the zzso machinery in both zzso and zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso This zzso was used to determine the zzso role of zzso Our data are consistent with an important function of zzso for zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso acts genetically downstream of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein 1 zzso However, although cell death is significantly reduced in zzso zzso in all zzso it is not completely zzso A zzso analysis between zzso and death zzso zzso another zzso zzso reveals that some cells zzso I) strictly require zzso for zzso whereas other cells zzso zzso require either zzso or zzso Thus, these data demonstrate a barely appreciated complexity in the zzso pathway, and are consistent with current models about zzso zzso regulation in both zzso and zzso
