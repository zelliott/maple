zzso is a zzso binding protein in zzso coli essential for zzso of the cell wall zzso zzso zzso We have found zzso that zzso coli K-12 strains carrying a zzso zzso in zzso exhibit increased resistance to a wide spectrum of antibiotics and to zzso zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso to these agents is restored by zzso expressed from a zzso As is observed in the multiple zzso resistance zzso in zzso coli cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso resulting in expression of the zzso zzso proteins that function as a drug zzso zzso zzso production of zzso similar to that observed in the multiple zzso resistance zzso is also seen in the zzso zzso These and other data reported zzso indicate that zzso functions upstream of zzso in a signal zzso zzso to zzso regulate the expression of zzso and hence of the zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and of several unidentified zzso membrane proteins as well as reduction in the amount of the outer membrane zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso regulates a number of genes in addition to those already known to be controlled by zzso
