The zzso zzso zzso acts in zzso zzso by reducing levels of zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure was determined at zzso resolution using MAD and zzso phasing methods after zzso zzso during the pursuit of the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a cluster of surface zzso zzso likely responsible for its zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso Researchers expressing zzso proteins in zzso should be aware of the propensity of zzso to zzso even when overwhelmed in concentration by the protein of zzso The protein assembles into extended zzso zzso interwoven to form an unusually zzso yet porous zzso zzso of the zzso structure with those of three zzso bacterial proteins reveals a common core fold punctuated by zzso acid insertions unique to each zzso These insertions mediate the zzso that define the distinct higher order zzso states attained by these zzso zzso also acts on zzso a zzso analog converted by the zzso from zzso tuberculosis into a product toxic to that zzso However, we find no evidence for zzso effects of the drug on zzso cell zzso
