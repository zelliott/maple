A zzso activity zzso zzso was released from the cell walls of barley by 3 M zzso zzso It was zzso by sequential zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was 66 zzso as determined by zzso gel zzso zzso determination of the first thirty zzso acids of the zzso revealed a high zzso of this zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a pH optimum at zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso The zzso showed maximum zzso activity toward zzso the rate being about two times that of zzso and about four times that of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso (from zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso from zzso and exhibited characteristics of an zzso zzso zzso The activity and zzso characteristics of this zzso suggest that it is an zzso involved in the rapid turnover of zzso in barley cell walls during zzso zzso
