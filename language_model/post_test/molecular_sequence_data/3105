The major cluster of resistance genes in lettuce zzso Diana contains approximately 32 zzso binding zzso repeat zzso zzso Previous molecular dissection of this complex region had identified a large zzso zzso as a candidate for zzso the zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso This article describes genetic and transgenic zzso data that demonstrated zzso is necessary and sufficient to zzso resistance with zzso zzso zzso was used to induce zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso Diana zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso families were identified with a complete loss of resistance in one of the four resistance zzso zzso revealed a variety of point zzso in zzso in the six zzso zzso zzso of resistance were due to single changes in zzso acid sequence or a change in an zzso zzso zzso These zzso did not cluster in any particular region of zzso A full-length zzso copy of zzso was isolated from a zzso library and introduced into two zzso of zzso zzso expressing zzso exhibited resistance to all zzso expressing zzso from a wide range of geographical zzso In a zzso zzso zzso many of the zzso family members are expressed at low levels throughout the zzso
