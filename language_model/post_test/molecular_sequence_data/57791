Previous studies on infectious zzso virus zzso zzso have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso strain zzso and a Japanese strain zzso that was not present in an zzso closely related zzso strain, Massachusetts zzso 41 zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the zzso sequences of the 3' zzso regions of three additional strains of zzso Gray, Arkansas zzso 99 and Holland zzso 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Not only was this zzso sequence absent from the 3' zzso region of the zzso strain, it was also highly zzso especially in comparison to the highly zzso 3' non coding region downstream of this zzso Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this zzso region zzso showed that the 3' end of the zzso zzso was highly zzso downstream of this region, with zzso to zzso zzso However, the similarities for the zzso ranged from zzso between zzso and zzso to zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso sequences were not only zzso but these sequences upstream and downstream of the zzso also formed mirrored zzso
