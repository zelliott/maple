zzso a zzso protein modifier, is known to zzso to other proteins and zzso their functions in various important zzso Similar to the zzso zzso system, zzso is transferred to zzso zzso zzso through the zzso cascade of E1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In our previous report zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2001) Gene zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso of budding zzso a member of the human zzso family containing a zzso domain, is a strong candidate for zzso zzso because the zzso modification of zzso components was abolished in the zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we have developed an in zzso zzso zzso system for a zzso component zzso using zzso zzso zzso In this system, zzso is additionally required as well as E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso domain was essential for the zzso both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, a region containing the zzso domain directly zzso with zzso and zzso Thus, this zzso zzso functions as an zzso between zzso and the target zzso
