Treatment with zzso drugs can induce zzso and zzso of zzso silenced tumor zzso genes in cancer cells, but it can also induce potentially deleterious loss of zzso of repetitive zzso To enable the observation of unwanted drug effects related to loss of zzso of repetitive DNA, we have developed a novel zzso capable of reporting changes in DNA accessibility via zzso in living zzso The zzso design comprises two independent zzso each with a zzso zinc finger domain fused to a half zzso and to a zzso domain that can be joined by conditional protein zzso after binding to adjacent DNA zzso We show that an artificial zinc finger design specifically targeting DNA sequences near the promoter region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is able to generate zzso signals, reporting loss of zzso zzso and increased DNA accessibility of zzso in human cells treated with the zzso drugs zzso or zzso
