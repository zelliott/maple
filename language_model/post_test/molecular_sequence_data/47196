In the chick zzso zzso zzso patterns of gene expression in the lateral plate zzso are initiated by signals located in and around zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso by a member of the zzso gene family, mediates the Sonic zzso zzso induction of zzso genes in the lateral plate zzso Car is induced by zzso and zzso by zzso growth zzso zzso Car activates the expression of zzso by zzso a repressive activity of bone zzso proteins zzso Our results define a complex network of zzso molecular interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Car that cooperate to control zzso asymmetry in the chick zzso
