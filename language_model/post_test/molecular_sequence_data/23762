The zzso zzso zzso are distinguished from their plant and zzso counterparts by the fact that the zzso group is zzso bound to the protein through zzso links from zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso groups and, in the case of zzso through an additional zzso link from the zzso of the zzso group to a zzso zzso To duplicate the zzso link in zzso and to obtain information on its mechanism of formation, we have engineered a zzso zzso close to the zzso group in zzso pea zzso zzso zzso zzso by replacement of zzso by Met zzso zzso The zzso zzso is isolated from zzso coli as zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso gives a red protein zzso which has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso kinetic zzso zzso 156 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso 102 zzso 15 zzso properties that are analogous to those of zzso The reaction of zzso with zzso gives a green protein zzso Electronic zzso mass zzso and zzso analyses are consistent with the formation of a zzso linkage between the zzso zzso and the zzso vinyl group in zzso zzso and zzso array zzso kinetic analyses identify a transient zzso I species as a reaction zzso The results provide the first direct evidence that zzso zzso linkage formation occurs as an zzso process that involves zzso I zzso A mechanism that is consistent with the data is zzso
