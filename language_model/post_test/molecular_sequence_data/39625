An zzso is a factor released by the gut in response to nutrients that zzso zzso of zzso by peripheral zzso The zzso concept predates the discovery of insulin but it is now clear that zzso act by stimulating zzso of this zzso As zzso has zzso activity, it was speculated that zzso zzso zzso zzso was involved in the zzso effect but it was an achievement in the field of comparative zzso that led to the demonstration that the zzso gene encodes the most potent zzso in the zzso zzso of cloned zzso zzso two zzso from the zzso body of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso sequence is flanked by a 34 zzso sequence with appreciable structural similarity to zzso that was termed zzso zzso zzso A 36 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was subsequently identified in human zzso but this zzso had only weak zzso zzso However, alignment of zzso sequences from human and zzso fish showed that the human zzso is extended from its zzso by a zzso zzso of this extension by an zzso zzso generates zzso the potent and effective form of the zzso More recently, comparative zzso has contributed to the exploitation of zzso as zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso first isolated from the zzso of the Gila monster zzso zzso is a clinically valuable, zzso zzso and the skins of several species of frogs zzso potent zzso peptides with therapeutic zzso
