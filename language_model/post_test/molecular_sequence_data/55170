zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of uncertain significance zzso is a challenging task that zzso health care providers and has profound implications for patients and their family zzso Numerous zzso have been described to date, which await assessment of their functional, hence clinical, zzso As a result of a routine zzso zzso zzso we identified a previously zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso in a patient diagnosed with early onset triple negative breast zzso The sequence zzso falls in the zzso zzso motif of the zzso zzso To investigate its significance, we applied an integrated approach that, in addition to genetic and zzso data, included in zzso zzso comparative structural modeling and zzso of zzso zzso In line with zzso zzso that predicted the benign nature of zzso zzso the three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso zzso domain did not reveal any major structural changes relative to its zzso counterpart, thus suggesting that zzso zzso has a negligible impact on both the local architecture and the overall stability of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein was properly expressed and localized to the nucleus, and it was still capable of binding three zzso DNA damage response, and repair partner zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso Our collected evidence suggests that, although occurring in a highly zzso region, the zzso zzso zzso is likely a benign sequence zzso
