We report the zzso zzso zzso primary structure and zzso expression pattern of the novel mouse zzso zzso This gene is located within the zzso complex, at a position which zzso it as a member of the zzso and zzso zzso the DNA and predicted protein sequences further confirmed this zzso zzso has a primary structure characteristic of a zzso gene but, in addition, contains several zzso stretches of zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso As expected from its presence and position within the zzso zzso is zzso expressed in structures of either zzso or zzso origin located or derived from below a precise zzso zzso However, a very important offset between zzso boundaries within zzso versus zzso derivatives is zzso Like other genes of the zzso complex, zzso is expressed in developing limbs and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could be a feature of the zzso zzso
