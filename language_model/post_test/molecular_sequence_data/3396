zzso modification of zzso has emerged as a key regulatory signal in zzso gene zzso Recent genetic and zzso studies link zzso 9 zzso zzso to zzso zzso formation and gene zzso However, the mechanisms that target and coordinate these activities to specific genes is poorly zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso binds to zzso a novel zzso domain protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso tail profoundly affect the efficiency of zzso zzso by zzso we found that zzso of zzso does not affect zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso tail of zzso zzso by zzso is sufficient to enhance the binding of zzso zzso which requires both an intact zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso localized zzso predominantly in zzso regions that overlap with zzso zzso in zzso regions of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso are enriched at promoter sequences of a zzso gene silenced by the zzso repression zzso Thus, zzso is a molecular scaffold that is targeted by zzso to specific zzso and coordinates both zzso zzso and the deposition of zzso proteins to silence gene zzso
