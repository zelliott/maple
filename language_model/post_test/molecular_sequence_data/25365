zzso of zzso acid zzso to specific zzso receptors alpha and beta zzso alpha and zzso zzso was zzso zzso were obtained in two ways: zzso full-length receptors were produced by transient expression of the respective human zzso in zzso 1 zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta were produced in zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso and truncated forms of the zzso was identical for both zzso alpha and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso have retained the binding characteristics of the intact zzso Furthermore, zzso bound with the same affinity to both zzso alpha and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso with an zzso zzso were able to actively bind to both zzso On measuring the binding of various zzso we have found that the properties of the zzso sites of zzso alpha and zzso beta were rather zzso Two zzso zzso were capable of binding zzso to either zzso alpha or zzso zzso suggesting that it may be possible to zzso specific zzso for zzso alpha and zzso zzso
