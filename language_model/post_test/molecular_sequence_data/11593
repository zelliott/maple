zzso synthetic peptides derived from zzso were prepared in order to examine their effects on the zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso bound to cells expressing zzso with high zzso On the other hand, zzso peptides zzso and zzso and one with a sequence from the zzso of zzso zzso did not bind to the zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and release of zzso by zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso binds to the zzso via its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a zzso zzso that has additional zzso acids at the zzso compared with the zzso zzso can bind to zzso and can be considered an zzso of zzso which may prove useful as an agent for controlling the allergic response caused by complement zzso
