The zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso is highly expressed in pancreatic zzso and associated with insulin zzso zzso The suppression of zzso II zzso insulin zzso and insulin gene zzso There are four zzso of zzso II, alpha to zzso that are expressed from different genes in zzso Our aim was to identify the zzso of zzso II expressed in human beta cells by molecular cloning from a human zzso zzso library and to assess its distribution in zzso 

The previously unknown complete coding sequences of human zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso were cloned from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso determination of zzso II zzso zzso was carried out in several zzso and beta cells zzso by zzso activated cell sorting and compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found zzso zzso occurred in three zzso zzso and was highly expressed in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and beta zzso Liver showed moderate expression but zzso tissue or zzso had very low levels of zzso zzso In human beta cells zzso zzso and delta were expressed equally with zzso zzso whereas tenfold lower expression of zzso zzso and no expression of zzso zzso were zzso 

Although zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso shows preferential expression in neuroendocrine zzso In comparison with the expression of a key regulatory zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso two of the four zzso zzso investigated are expressed at equally high levels, which supports an important role in zzso zzso These results provide the basis for exploring the zzso relevance of zzso zzso in human zzso
