zzso skeletal muscle contains zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso We have shown previously that muscle zzso is zzso by a gene different from that coding for the liver zzso Starting with zzso zzso libraries and based on the zzso sequences of human and mouse muscle zzso together with the known gene structures of two zzso liver zzso we have zzso and zzso all functional parts of the human and mouse muscle zzso genes and determined their zzso zzso The human gene zzso localized at zzso zzso spans about 30 zzso while the mouse gene zzso at zzso zzso is more compact (about 21 zzso zzso lengths are only poorly zzso between the two zzso while zzso number and positions are identical in all zzso analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso start sites were found to be located 97 and zzso before the start zzso in the human gene and 35 zzso before the start zzso in the mouse zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of the two genes revealed a zzso zzso up to human zzso zzso before the first zzso start point, while upstream of this region we found no zzso The data presented in this paper provide a basis for further studies of the mechanism of expression regulation and the zzso of the zzso role of the zzso
