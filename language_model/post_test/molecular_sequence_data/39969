The membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso was determined by the analysis of zzso zzso with reporter zzso alkaline zzso and zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso located in the zzso and the zzso in the zzso space, was consistent with the zzso activities determined in both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso of the two halves of zzso showed significant sequence zzso with zzso I, II, III, IV, V and VI displaying similarity to zzso VIII, IX, X, zzso zzso and zzso respectively, although with opposite membrane zzso This suggests that zzso arose from the zzso of a gene zzso a zzso ancestral zzso followed by the zzso of extra zzso zzso These data also suggest that the two halves of zzso may carry out distinct functions for the transport of zzso
