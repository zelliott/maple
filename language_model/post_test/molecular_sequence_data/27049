Because of its high zzso potential, zzso analysis of zzso has been frequently used for zzso of zzso zzso at the strain zzso In order to evaluate a zzso system based on the zzso analysis of zzso combined with zzso targeting zzso zzso and zzso 456 independent strains of zzso zzso were subjected to zzso analysis using 4 zzso markers zzso zzso CA I and CA zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis using CA I showed the highest zzso potential zzso followed by zzso zzso Using combined zzso zzso 456 zzso zzso strains were divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and zzso were performed to differentiate the strains that showed identical zzso in the zzso analysis, resulting in 434 zzso zzso The combined zzso system showed high zzso power at the strain level, and therefore is useful for rapid zzso in molecular zzso studies of zzso
