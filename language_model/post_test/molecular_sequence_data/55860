A DNA sequence that zzso a response to a class of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso has been identified zzso upstream of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso Two members of the steroid hormone zzso family, termed the zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and the zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso to bind specifically to this zzso zzso this response element zzso is similar to that identified upstream of other zzso zzso responsive genes such as those zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data therefore provide further evidence that zzso alpha plays an important role in zzso the action of zzso zzso
