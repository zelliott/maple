The two zzso zzso protein and zzso which are zzso by alternative transcripts from the zzso protein ( zzso ) zzso are major components of central nervous system zzso In man, zzso of these proteins cause zzso disease zzso an zzso zzso zzso The zzso found are very zzso ranging from zzso zzso and zzso zzso to additional copies of the zzso This same range of known genetic defects has been observed in animal models with spontaneous and engineered zzso gene zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso is remarkably close in the animal models and the zzso cases, making them useful models for studying the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso As a result, it has become clear that the zzso gene plays a wider role in neural development in addition to its function as a structural component of zzso It has also emerged that zzso of the zzso gene are the zzso zzso in zzso zzso disorders arising from a dosage effect may be more common than previously zzso The study of the zzso gene in this rare disorder is, therefore, contributing both to our understanding of neural development and maintenance and to the mechanisms of human genetic zzso
