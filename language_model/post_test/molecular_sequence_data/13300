Nerve injury alters the function of zzso cells from zzso zzso forming cells to zzso cells that facilitate nerve zzso The zzso factor, zzso may be involved in zzso zzso signals since its expression is rapidly induced by nerve zzso in zzso and without intervening protein synthesis by zzso signals in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso by zzso cells after nerve injury closely correlated with the zzso expression profile, and zzso zzso the zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was not expressed when zzso protein was depleted by stable zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, nuclear proteins corresponding to zzso bound to the zzso promoter by zzso zzso indicating that a direct interaction of zzso with the zzso gene is required for its expression in zzso zzso
