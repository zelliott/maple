Some zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso which facilitate zzso zzso at zzso sites in zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso in contrast to their zzso counterparts, are present in single copies per cell, which zzso zzso zzso within one zzso However, given the highly zzso nature of the sequences zzso the zzso zzso may occur in zzso zzso genes of other zzso zzso To test whether this occurs, the zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso carried on zzso bacterial zzso was zzso into an zzso culture of zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso underwent zzso and spread through the zzso By using a double drug-resistant zzso of zzso zzso it was shown that spreading resulted partly from a selective advantage of zzso cells and partly from zzso mobility of the zzso and zzso
