The zzso of zzso zzso is estimated to zzso zzso theoretical zzso In this study, we have zzso approximately zzso of the theoretical zzso zzso using a zzso strategy that combines three different methods, shotgun zzso plus zzso liquid zzso zzso with zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso one-dimensional sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso plus zzso with zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional gel zzso plus zzso laser zzso of zzso zzso zzso Of the 1200 proteins identified, as few as 76 proteins were globally found by all three approaches, and notably, most of these proteins were in the soluble zzso However, there were a number of unique proteins detected by one method only, suggesting that our strategy provides a means toward obtaining a comprehensive view of protein expression zzso zzso from the major zzso pathways are strongly represented on the map, and a number of these zzso were identified by more than one zzso zzso Based upon the proteins identified in the present study, we are able to broaden the understanding of how zzso zzso survives under high temperature environment, whereas several of its properties can not be fully explained by zzso zzso
