The zzso role of zzso in patients with idiopathic zzso zzso has been determined through a molecular zzso zzso zzso in the detection of viral zzso in zzso varied between conventional zzso acid zzso and zzso chain gene zzso To improve diagnosis, we developed a strategy for reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to detect viral zzso We zzso two zzso zzso primer 1 zzso and primer 2 zzso complementary to the zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified by double zzso with these two zzso and zzso with a zzso labeled zzso probe zzso Using this strategy, we detected as little as zzso zzso of zzso B3 zzso after amplification with zzso but detected none in the plasma of eight healthy zzso Among 15 patients with idiopathic zzso zzso viral zzso could be detected in one out of 12 zzso zzso and three out of four zzso heart zzso zzso In contrast, no viral zzso could be detected in six samples of zzso tissue from patients with other heart zzso The only patient who had viral zzso in his plasma also had viral zzso in his zzso Thus, the high zzso of viral zzso in these patients suggests a possible zzso link between zzso zzso selection of specific zzso zzso and the application of double zzso can improve chances of diagnosing zzso zzso
