A previously identified zzso restricted zzso of influenza A virus zzso zzso was zzso resulting in recognition by zzso restricted zzso T cells at significantly lower zzso than the natural zzso zzso This was achieved by first refining the zzso to the minimum zzso zzso zzso of zzso 156 resulted in a zzso that was shown to be greatly superior in both dose response zzso and in its rate of association with cells to form zzso zzso peptides were tested to determine the important zzso acid zzso These data suggest that T cell zzso can be modified to result in improved zzso zzso
