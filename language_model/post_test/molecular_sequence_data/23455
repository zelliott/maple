zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso of diverse zzso zzso In some versions of zzso theory they are suggested to be zzso of zzso but alternative views suggest they arose from an zzso zzso that was distinct from the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso module in complex I, the first step in the zzso respiratory chain, are active in zzso of zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso can reduce a variety of electron carriers including zzso but unlike the zzso zzso it can also reduce zzso the electron carrier used for hydrogen zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso the long-standing conundrum of how zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso analyses show that the zzso zzso zzso shares common ancestry with the zzso zzso zzso of complex I zzso into a zzso zzso provides evidence that zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso of the same zzso derived zzso
