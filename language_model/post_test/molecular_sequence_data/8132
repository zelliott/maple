The inhibitor of zzso zzso 4, zzso (also known as zzso or zzso multiple tumor zzso gene 1), has been mapped to zzso The gene has been shown to be deleted or zzso in high frequency in human melanoma cell lines and familial melanoma patients, suggesting that it could be a melanoma zzso zzso How these observations are related to zzso and zzso of human melanoma is not clear zzso To test the role of zzso in human melanoma zzso 14 human melanoma cell lines with different zzso abilities in nude mice were zzso for possible abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso deletions that resulted in a lack of gene expression were found in six of 14 cell lines zzso zzso sequencing revealed point zzso in three other cell zzso One cell line displayed zzso to zzso transitions which constitute a hallmark of zzso DNA zzso Overall, abnormalities in the zzso gene were found in nine of 14 zzso cell lines zzso zzso deletion and lack of gene expression were found in several low zzso and zzso melanoma lines, whereas other zzso cells did not exhibit abnormalities in the zzso zzso These data suggest that the absence of normal zzso does not zzso growth advantage to melanoma cells in zzso and that the production of zzso by human melanoma cells can occur in the absence of zzso gene zzso
