In zzso cells, protein synthesis is regulated in response to various environmental stresses by zzso the alpha zzso of the zzso initiation factor 2 zzso Three different zzso zzso have been identified in zzso cells, the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso termed zzso was previously characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning of a mouse zzso zzso zzso which represents the first zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and a large insert of 139 zzso acids located between zzso IV and V that are characteristic of the known zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso contains a class II zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso segment, downstream and upstream of the zzso zzso domain, respectively, and both are singular features of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a single message of approximately zzso zzso in a wide range of different zzso with the highest levels in the liver and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso activity and recognized a 190 zzso zzso in Western blots from either mouse liver or zzso zzso cell zzso Interestingly, serum zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso This finding provides evidence that zzso is the unique zzso zzso present in all zzso from zzso to zzso and underscores the role of zzso zzso in zzso control and its potential zzso zzso
