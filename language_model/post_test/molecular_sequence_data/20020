zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is essential for the initiation of viral zzso zzso It has been well established that zzso replication is initiated when a zzso of UMP is zzso linked to the zzso group of a zzso zzso in zzso by the viral zzso zzso zzso but it is not yet known whether the zzso for zzso in zzso is the free zzso itself or one of its zzso The aim of this study was to use zzso analyses to obtain information about the true in zzso zzso for zzso by zzso Previously, it was shown that a zzso zzso in which zzso 3 and zzso 4 were replaced by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, was zzso We have now tested whether zzso forms of proteins 3B, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso provided either in trans or in zzso could rescue the replication zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our results showed that proteins 3B, zzso zzso and zzso were unable to complement the zzso replication zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, zzso of the zzso precursor protein allowed rescue of zzso replication of the zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso replication system, but only poor zzso was observed when zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins were zzso in the same zzso Interestingly, only protein zzso but not zzso and zzso when provided in zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso coding sequence between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso supported the replication of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso between 3A and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso however, led to a complete lack of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso has to be delivered to the replication complex in the form of a large protein precursor zzso to be fully functional in zzso zzso the replication complex formed during zzso replication in zzso is essentially zzso to proteins provided in zzso even if the zzso protein is translated from a different zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most likely precursor of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso has an essential function in zzso replication in the context of both zzso and zzso
