zzso proteins of the human pathogen zzso zzso might be involved in important zzso cell zzso Here, we present the first systematic reference map of the zzso and cell surface zzso zzso of the type strain zzso zzso zzso The analysis window of zzso covered the zzso range from 3 to 10 along with a zzso range from 8 to 150 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gels detected almost 150 protein spots in the zzso zzso fraction and about 80 protein spots of the cell surface zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso identified 107 zzso protein spots and 53 protein spots of the cell surface, representing in total 85 different proteins of zzso zzso zzso Several of the identified proteins are zzso by zzso islands and might represent zzso factors of zzso zzso Additionally, four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso of different iron ABC zzso were identified, with the zzso zzso zzso protein being the most abundant one of the cell surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso
