The requirements for zzso particle assembly and envelope incorporation were investigated using a zzso expression zzso The zzso precursor protein expressed under control of the zzso promoter zzso produced high levels of immature zzso particles zzso upon expression in zzso insect zzso To determine the optimal conditions for envelope protein zzso incorporation into zzso two zzso zzso expressing the zzso envelope protein under control of a very late zzso or a hybrid zzso late zzso zzso promoter and a zzso expressing a truncated form of the zzso envelope protein zzso under the hybrid zzso promoter were zzso We have observed that zzso of the earlier hybrid promoter resulted in higher levels of zzso expression on the cell surface and its incorporation into budding virus zzso We have also found that the zzso protein is transported to the cell surface of insect cells and incorporated into zzso more efficiently than full-length zzso In addition, we examined the effect of zzso of the zzso zzso which has been implicated in the zzso zzso of the zzso precursor zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in insect cells resulted in more efficient zzso zzso into zzso and zzso and the zzso proteins were incorporated into zzso
