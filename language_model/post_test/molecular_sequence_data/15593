zzso are important zzso zzso peptides of the innate immune system, which provides protection against bacterial infections in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the most commonly isolated zzso in zzso but disease outcome is dependent on the zzso zzso These infections are a serious problem for the zzso industry and are also posing a major threat to public health because of zzso food-borne illnesses in zzso To understand the innate immune response of pigs upon zzso infections, we studied the effect of these zzso zzso on zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso With the use of scanning electron zzso we first zzso the surface characteristics of this cell line, and captured the invasion of zzso into the zzso zzso Gene expression levels of zzso zzso 1 and 2 were both induced upon zzso zzso infection but zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso were similar, which could not explain the observed difference in host response to these zzso In addition, induction of zzso was dependent on viability of zzso zzso since zzso zzso or zzso components had no effect on zzso gene zzso These results provide further insight into the zzso innate immune response towards zzso infections, and could partially explain the different epidemiology of zzso infections in zzso
