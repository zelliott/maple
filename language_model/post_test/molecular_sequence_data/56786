We present the full-length zzso sequence of human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Overlapping zzso clones were isolated by screening human liver zzso libraries with bovine zzso zzso The zzso base pair open reading frame encodes zzso zzso acid precursor zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso shows 90 and zzso zzso to that of bovine and chicken counterpart, zzso zzso zzso analysis of human liver transcripts and Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA confirm that human zzso is zzso by a single zzso
