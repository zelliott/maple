Recent studies indicate that the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso is involved in a novel zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso coli catalyze the zzso of zzso to yield zzso zzso and then catalyze the zzso of PA to yield zzso We demonstrated that the zzso form of PA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat liver zzso the zzso of zzso This reaction was zzso insensitive to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso zzso exhibited a high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity constant zzso for zzso was zzso zzso higher than that of zzso zzso inhibited the ability of zzso to zzso zzso and PA inhibited the zzso of zzso Like rat liver zzso the zzso PA zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mouse zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso coli, especially in localized regions that constitute a novel zzso sequence zzso zzso our work indicated that rat liver zzso is a member of a zzso family that includes zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose a model in which the zzso activities of rat liver zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulate the cellular levels of zzso zzso and zzso
