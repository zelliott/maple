zzso is a zzso cell surface zzso and has been proposed to be a target zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on a partial zzso gene obtained from zzso zzso transcripts of the fifth zzso zzso zzso zzso a full open reading frame of zzso gene zzso was zzso Its predicted zzso acid sequence encodes zzso 9 zzso repeats, a zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in all zzso stages specifically in gut tissue by zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene was suppressed by both injection and feeding of its specific zzso zzso zzso in the fifth zzso The suppression of zzso expression did not significantly influence on zzso and adult developments of zzso zzso However, the larvae treated with zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso larvae did not show any change in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a specific target zzso to zzso toxin from zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso
