We have isolated a clone from a zzso zzso infected zzso zzso library which has the potential to zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso This protein is particularly rich in zzso and zzso and has some short repeated zzso acid motifs based on the sequences zzso and zzso We have called it the zzso zzso Southern zzso suggests that the zzso protein gene is present as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed that the gene is transcribed in both zzso and zzso We have expressed part of the zzso protein as a fusion with zzso zzso in zzso coli and used this product to raise an zzso protein zzso Western blots of zzso zzso zzso using this serum showed a major zzso of approximately 100 zzso and two further zzso of approximately 67 and 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso protein serum on infected cells showed that the protein is associated with the zzso The pattern of zzso in the indirect zzso zzso and the structure of the protein suggest that it is a component of the zzso zzso
