zzso multiple zzso is an zzso dominant disorder that is characterized by short stature and zzso benign bone zzso In a majority of families, the genetic zzso zzso is linked to the zzso syndrome zzso region in zzso From this region we have cloned and characterized a zzso which spans zzso zzso previously identified in two multiple zzso zzso Furthermore, the gene zzso zzso zzso in affected members of two zzso zzso The zzso has a coding region of zzso zzso with no apparent zzso to other known gene sequences and thus its function remains zzso However, recent studies in sporadic and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso gene may have zzso zzso zzso
