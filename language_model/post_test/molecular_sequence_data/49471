zzso structure and diversity of zzso zzso zzso populations were investigated using zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified among 208 zzso from the Elizabeth and York Rivers in Virginia, zzso No evidence of decreased gene or zzso diversity for zzso from zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso sites was zzso However, based on zzso data from 17 sites, a significant correlation zzso analysis, p zzso zzso was noted between genetic distance zzso and zzso concentration but not between genetic distance and geographic zzso zzso from the most heavily zzso site, Atlantic Wood zzso were genetically distinct from those of other Elizabeth River zzso At zzso high zzso of several divergent zzso were observed that were more closely allied to the northern zzso than to the more abundant southern form in the zzso zzso These data suggested that a locally stable population existed at the zzso zzso This conclusion is consistent with the observation that zzso from the zzso site display enhanced tolerance to zzso contamination relative to zzso from zzso zzso zzso about gene diversity and the correlation between genetic distance with site differences in zzso zzso were also consistent with those from tandem genetic analyses based on zzso
