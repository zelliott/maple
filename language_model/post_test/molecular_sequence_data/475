In general, the strict preservation of zzso structure is thought to be critical for maintaining the precisely tuned functionality of zzso zzso although nearly all zzso species undergo a small number of programmed local zzso during development zzso zzso of zzso immune zzso zzso However, a limited number of zzso species undergo much more extensive reorganizations as a normal feature of their zzso Here, we show that the sea zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a dramatic zzso of its zzso resulting in the elimination of hundreds of millions of base pairs (and at least one transcribed zzso from many zzso cell lineages during embryonic zzso These studies reveal the highly dynamic nature of the zzso zzso and provide the first example of zzso programmed zzso of a definitively zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms by which this zzso species regulates such extensive zzso of its zzso will provide invaluable insight into factors that can promote stability and change in zzso zzso
