The zzso zzso protein of the Human zzso zzso plays a key role in viral zzso packaging by specifically recognizing the zzso zzso sequence within the zzso zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso was developed to probe the specific interactions in zzso between the NC and zzso using zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to examine the zzso of this zzso zzso to zzso other than zzso this study tested the zzso zzso isolated in zzso using the zzso method, but whose specific binding ability to NC in a living cellular environment has not been zzso The results demonstrate for the first time that each of those zzso zzso can bind specifically to NC in a NC zinc finger motif dependent manner within the zzso This confirms that the zzso zzso developed for zzso interaction can be further extended and applied to zzso zzso other than zzso
