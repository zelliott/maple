Tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that are zzso zzso The corresponding zzso were isolated and zzso Both genes code for putative zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences are zzso zzso A comparison of the known zzso zzso zzso indicates two distinct zzso zzso The zzso levels of transcripts of the two tomato genes differ in all zzso zzso
