A fundamental question in molecular zzso is how genes that determine basic zzso properties shape the functional organization of brain circuits underlying complex learned zzso Given the growing availability of complete zzso zzso comparative zzso represents a promising approach to address this zzso Here we used zzso and molecular approaches to study how zzso channel genes influence the properties of the brain zzso that regulates zzso a learned vocal behavior with important similarities to human speech zzso We focused on zzso zzso which are major zzso of zzso cell zzso 

We identified 107 zzso zzso zzso including 6 novel genes common to zzso zzso zzso Twenty human genes are absent in zzso birds, or zzso or unique to zzso suggesting zzso properties may be zzso We also identified specific family members with zzso and/or high zzso ratios compared to chicken, a zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that while most zzso genes are broadly expressed in the brain, a subset is selectively expressed in song zzso representing molecular zzso of the vocal zzso 

Together, these findings shed new light on genes that may regulate zzso and excitable properties of the song circuitry, identify potential targets for the manipulation of the song system, and reveal zzso zzso that may relate to the emergence of vocal learning and associated brain areas in zzso
