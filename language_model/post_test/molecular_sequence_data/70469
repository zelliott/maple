Proper zzso presentation by major zzso complex zzso class II zzso is dependent on the products of the zzso zzso zzso We identified the rabbit zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso and zzso and found that they have zzso and zzso identity with zzso and zzso zzso Like classical class II zzso zzso zzso genes are more closely related to human zzso genes than to mouse zzso Among the zzso family, there is a high degree of zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and length zzso in the zzso tails of both zzso and zzso The rabbit zzso genes are zzso with class II genes in zzso zzso as are the zzso genes of other zzso The zzso locus maps to the class II region of the rabbit zzso and is flanked by the zzso and zzso zzso Despite having some similarities to class II genes of zzso fishes, the zzso family represents a separate branch of the zzso class II zzso
