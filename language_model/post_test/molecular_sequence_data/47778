The presence of zzso zzso was examined in eight zzso species and some related species of zzso A clone zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso generated in zzso coli, containing a DNA zzso spanning two genes designated zzso and zzso We show that these genes are likely to be involved in the zzso acid zzso metabolism of this zzso This DNA zzso has been zzso and zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso protein demonstrated that the protein had significant zzso with the zzso zzso of other zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein of zzso zzso also showed a strong zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso and some zzso zzso zzso all belonging to the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene products confirm the identity of the genes from the isolated DNA zzso and reveal a possible role for the zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso zzso is discussed in relation to the growth of the zzso in response to carbon source zzso
