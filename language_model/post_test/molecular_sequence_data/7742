zzso hybrids containing various regions of human zzso 8 were formed by zzso transfer of zzso zzso 8 into the cells derived from severe combined zzso zzso zzso Thus, 110 zzso markers were isolated from zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso containing a zzso region of human zzso 8 and were assigned to eight regions in zzso using a zzso zzso For zzso cloning of a human gene that restores the zzso zzso in a mouse with zzso on zzso zzso zzso we constructed a zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso of about zzso zzso Overlapping zzso were further aligned by restriction zzso using zzso restriction zzso The zzso and zzso zzso should facilitate isolation of the zzso gene and other zzso such as the zzso zzso gene in or near this zzso
