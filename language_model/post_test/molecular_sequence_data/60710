Multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso 1) is zzso by the combination of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso In 1988 the zzso 1 gene was mapped to zzso zzso and it was cloned in zzso This gene contains 10 zzso and extends across 9 zzso of zzso zzso it encodes for a product of 610 zzso acid named zzso whose function is zzso We have studied 10 unrelated zzso 1 zzso by a complete sequencing analysis of the entire zzso zzso were identified in nine of them: five zzso one zzso two nonsense zzso and a complex zzso consisting of a deletion and an zzso that can be explained by a hairpin loop zzso Two of the zzso have been previously zzso the other seven were novel, and they were scattered throughout the coding sequence of the zzso As in previous series, no correlation was found between zzso and zzso
