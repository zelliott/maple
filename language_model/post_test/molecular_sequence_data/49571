An activity that inhibited both zzso zzso zzso and nitrate zzso zzso was highly zzso from cauliflower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The final preparation contained an zzso zzso and a second protein of the plant zzso zzso zzso This preparation zzso zzso zzso and zzso to generate zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso fraction had no effect on the activity of zzso when reduced zzso was used as electron donor instead of zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso by both spinach zzso and an zzso coli extract in a zzso zzso The apparent zzso of zzso and zzso and the ability of zzso and zzso to relieve the zzso of zzso can therefore be explained by zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We have no evidence that the zzso zzso is a specific zzso regulator of zzso and zzso but suggest that zzso zzso activity may zzso some confusion in the literature about the effects of zzso and protein factors on zzso and zzso in zzso
