The envelope zzso B zzso coding sequences of two strains of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by sequencing a zzso open reading frame adjacent to the DNA zzso zzso The deduced primary translation product is 830 zzso acids in length and is zzso zzso between the two divergent strains with no localized zzso zzso It contains the expected signal and zzso sequence motifs as well as a putative site of zzso zzso There was zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso of human zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident through the entire zzso but was especially strong in the zzso portion of zzso zzso which contains linear and zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso All 10 zzso zzso of zzso zzso match corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso data suggest strong structural similarity and possible zzso zzso of zzso from the two zzso
