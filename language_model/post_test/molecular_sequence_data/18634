Plants sense potential pathogens by recognizing zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso that cause zzso immunity zzso We previously reported that rice recognizes zzso from the zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso and subsequently zzso immune zzso Cell extracts isolated from zzso zzso zzso still induced zzso responses, suggesting that zzso possesses an additional zzso distinct from zzso Here, we show that zzso factor Tu zzso one of the most abundant bacterial zzso acts as a zzso in rice and causes several zzso zzso In zzso species, zzso and an zzso zzso zzso the first 18 zzso acids of the zzso termed zzso are fully active as zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso did not cause any immune responses in rice, whereas an zzso middle region zzso zzso to zzso termed zzso is fully active as a zzso in zzso In the leaves of rice plants, zzso induced zzso generation and zzso deposition, and also triggered resistance to zzso with zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that rice recognizes zzso which is distinct from zzso and that this zzso zzso zzso zzso
