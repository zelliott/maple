Protection against zzso zzso and zzso coli in mice was enhanced by an zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso from mice administered zzso with 30 zzso doses of zzso 4 days earlier exhibited increased scavenger functions as assessed by in zzso zzso in zzso zzso killing and generation of zzso zzso When zzso production of the zzso was assessed by biological zzso and Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso production and zzso alpha gene expression were significantly increased in zzso from zzso zzso On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor zzso alpha gene was expressed in zzso from zzso mice at a much reduced level as compared with those in mice treated zzso with zzso zzso on 4 days zzso In correlation with expression of zzso gene in the zzso zzso mice were less susceptible to the lethal toxicity of zzso than zzso zzso In zzso mice, in zzso elimination of bacteria was enhanced at the early phase of infection with zzso or zzso resulting in zzso of host defense against these bacterial zzso These results suggest that adequately enhanced activities of zzso acting as scavenger zzso play important roles in the enhanced resistance against bacteria in mice treated zzso with zzso
