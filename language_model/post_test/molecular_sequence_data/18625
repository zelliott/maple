zzso locus C zzso a floral zzso is a critical factor for the transition from the zzso to the zzso zzso Here, the mechanisms regulating the activity and stability of the zzso protein were zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso pull-down analyses showed that zzso interacts with the zzso small zzso modifier zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso for zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is modified by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso E1 and zzso zzso zzso but its zzso is inhibited by zzso In transgenic plants, zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in the concentration of zzso and delayed the zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso through direct zzso Also, the flowering time in zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso plants was comparable with that in the wild type, whereas flowering was considerably delayed in zzso plants, supporting the notion that zzso is an important mechanism for zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso of zzso is critical for its role in the control of flowering time and that zzso positively regulates zzso floral zzso
