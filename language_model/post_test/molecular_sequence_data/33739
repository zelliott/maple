zzso protein zzso and fatty zzso protein zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in multiple cellular tasks including zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso regulation, zzso trafficking, and gene zzso In our study, a 536 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and identified as a widely distributed gene in the Chinese white shrimp, zzso zzso Its expression in zzso was zzso in response to white spot syndrome virus zzso or zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns were confirmed by Western zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso protein zzso play an important role in zzso metabolism and also participate in zzso innate zzso A zzso of zzso zzso cloned from the zzso of the shrimp was zzso zzso in size and zzso a 14 zzso zzso zzso appeared to be a basic fatty acid binding protein with a predicted zzso point of zzso It showed sequence similarity to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso together with zzso were clustered into one zzso zzso was detected mainly in the zzso and expression level increased after a challenge with zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso The protein also had bacterial binding zzso These two zzso metabolism related proteins may play important roles in shrimp innate zzso
