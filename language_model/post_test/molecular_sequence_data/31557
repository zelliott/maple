zzso promoter zzso is a zzso promoter only expressed in the zzso to regulate its zzso To investigate the activity of zzso in diverse dairy goat cells, zzso was cloned from dairy goat zzso and used to construct the zzso reporter zzso zzso to examine the zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso contained multiple zzso factor binding sites, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and so on, and the zzso sequence of zzso shared zzso and zzso similarity with those of zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, two zzso were identified in the zzso zzso was deletion and zzso In diverse cells, the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso was extremely significantly higher than that in fetal zzso and zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the expression of zzso in zzso zzso was extremely significantly higher than that in the zzso cells of zzso zzso In zzso we successfully extracted dairy goat zzso and identified its zzso activity, which in part shed light on the study of zzso zzso and provided further insights into the development and regulation of dairy zzso zzso as zzso
