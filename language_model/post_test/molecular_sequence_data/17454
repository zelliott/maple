zzso zzso zzso is characterized by progressive deterioration of central nervous system function including zzso and zzso in 50% of cases, and elevated levels of zzso acid in zzso blood and zzso fluid zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging shows distinct zzso We report the identification of a gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso including three zzso zzso two nonsense zzso two zzso site zzso and two deletions were identified in the gene zzso localized on zzso zzso in 21 patients from one zzso and 14 zzso Turkish zzso We propose to name the gene zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein with zzso to zzso zzso The functional role of this zzso in zzso metabolism in humans remains to be zzso
