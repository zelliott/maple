Mobile elements rely on cellular processes to zzso and therefore, mobile element proteins frequently interact with a variety of cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso and this interaction determines zzso preference to integrate into zzso We explored the hypothesis that zzso targeting mechanism arose by mimicking an interaction between zzso and another cellular zzso zzso analyses defined the requirements for the zzso interaction, providing criteria to screen for cellular zzso zzso a protein associated with the inner nuclear zzso zzso with the same domain of zzso as zzso and zzso of zzso that disrupted zzso interactions also zzso zzso zzso A small motif critical for recognizing zzso was identified in zzso The functional zzso of this motif and the zzso domain of IN was demonstrated by swapping these motifs and showing that the zzso IN and zzso proteins effectively target integration and partition DNA, zzso We conclude that zzso targets integration by imitating the zzso interaction and suggest molecular mimicry as a general mechanism that enables mobile elements to interface with cellular zzso
