The mechanism that regulates the plasticity of bone zzso cells zzso into zzso is poorly zzso We developed a green fluorescent zzso zzso model to find that zzso transplantation recovered liver zzso zzso zzso level and liver zzso were recovered by zzso zzso To understand the zzso we used zzso technology to profile the change of transient gene expression before and after zzso zzso On the basis of gene expression with zzso map using specific zzso genes were classified into 153 zzso The information is useful to understand the dramatic gene zzso during the process of the plasticity of zzso
