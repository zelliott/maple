zzso storage disease type zzso zzso is an zzso zzso genetic disorder resulting in zzso zzso and growth zzso It is caused by zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso To date, over 80 zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso Here we reported a novel zzso found in a Chinese patient with abnormal zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso sequencing of the coding region and zzso in the zzso gene revealed a novel zzso zzso zzso leading to a 43 zzso extension of zzso The expression level of zzso zzso transcripts was only zzso relative to zzso zzso This zzso was not found in 120 zzso from 60 unrelated healthy control subjects using direct sequencing, and was further confirmed by zzso with zzso I restriction zzso In conclusion, we revealed a novel zzso zzso in this study which expands the spectrum of zzso in the zzso zzso The molecular genetic analysis was indispensable to the diagnosis of zzso for the zzso
