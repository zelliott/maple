In the present study, we used the N zzso zzso acids 1 approximately zzso of type VI zzso zzso zzso as bait to screen a mouse brain zzso library and identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso is a binding protein of zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso analyses confirmed the interaction between zzso and full-length zzso zzso analysis revealed that the interaction zzso of zzso and zzso were located within zzso acids 1 approximately 86 of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was observed in primary zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso specifically eliminated protein zzso C zzso suppression of zzso but not that of zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the potential zzso and zzso zzso sites of zzso did not affect the ability of zzso to reverse the zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso therefore might not be crucial for zzso action on zzso In contrast, zzso which harbors an internal deletion of zzso acids zzso did not affect zzso zzso of zzso supporting that zzso acids zzso of zzso comprises the zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted no effect on zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso which lacked the zzso region zzso acids zzso zzso thus reverses its action via direct interaction with the N zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate zzso that in addition to its association with the zzso complex, zzso also functions as a regulator of an important zzso synthesis zzso in the zzso
