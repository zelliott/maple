zzso is the most severe complication of diabetes zzso We investigated the effect of zzso growth hormone zzso administration on zzso function and zzso deposition in the zzso zzso model of type zzso zzso 

Adult female zzso rats zzso zzso control rats injected with saline zzso and control and diabetic rats injected with bovine zzso for 3 months zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

The usual zzso zzso seen in D animals was more pronounced in the zzso zzso zzso clearance increased only in the D rats, but not in the other groups, including zzso zzso was observed in the D animals but was significantly elevated in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso animals showed more extensive zzso zzso zzso as an increase in zzso area zzso Renal zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso was decreased in the D and zzso groups, but zzso zzso protein was not significantly zzso Renal zzso binding zzso was increased in the D groups and further increased in the zzso group, at both the zzso and protein zzso 

zzso diabetic rats had less zzso and more zzso zzso with more zzso zzso deposition, when compared with regular diabetic zzso This was associated with a significant increase in zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Thus, in this model, zzso zzso the course of diabetic kidney zzso
