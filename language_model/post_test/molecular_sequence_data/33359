As part of a more extensive investigation on structural features of different zzso zzso zzso that can affect their biological activities, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with regards to the distribution of different chain length zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso as well as their structure as defined by zzso zzso zzso The three zzso were also zzso into high affinity zzso and no affinity zzso pools with regards to their ability to bind zzso zzso The zzso zzso were further zzso and zzso For the parent zzso and selected zzso molecular weight parameters were measured using a zzso zzso system with a triple detector zzso to obtain absolute molecular zzso The zzso zzso clearly indicate that zzso is consistently richer in shorter zzso than zzso and zzso Besides providing the content of terminal groups and individual zzso and zzso acid zzso with different zzso zzso the zzso zzso permitted us to evaluate and correlate the content of the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso through zzso of signals of the zzso sequence zzso Whereas the percent content of zzso species is approximately the same for the three zzso substantial differences were observed for the chain distribution of zzso as a function of zzso with the zzso being zzso contained in the longest chains of each zzso The above information will be useful in establishing zzso relationships currently under zzso This study is therefore critical for establishing correlations between structural features of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso
