In a search for clones from a zzso zzso expression library of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA that expressed zzso from a zzso zzso membrane zzso we inadvertently identified clones that zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The gene appears to zzso a zzso of zzso as the zzso sequence has approximately zzso identity with the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso Growth of an zzso zzso zzso zzso at 42 degrees C was reduced to 50% of the parent strain, similar to an zzso zzso deletion zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso performs a function similar to zzso zzso
