A crucial event in the acute regulation of zzso by zzso hormones is the delivery of cholesterol into the zzso where it is converted to zzso by the cholesterol side chain zzso zzso Although considerable controversy exists regarding the exact mechanisms that zzso this acute response to hormone zzso recent studies suggest that the zzso Acute Regulatory zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential zzso We now extend these studies by establishing in zzso mouse zzso tumor cells a zzso relationship between levels of zzso expression and zzso in response to hormone zzso These data indicate that zzso hormones regulate zzso zzso and protein within a time frame zzso with the acute production of steroid hormones and provide the first evidence implicating changes in zzso zzso and/or zzso stability in the functional response of zzso cells to hormone zzso In addition, in zzso zzso analyses of zzso expression in embryonic and adult mice demonstrated a precise spatial and zzso relationship in zzso between zzso expression and the capacity to produce steroid zzso These experiments strengthen considerably the evidence that zzso is the key zzso of the acute induction of zzso and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which zzso hormones activate zzso in zzso zzso
