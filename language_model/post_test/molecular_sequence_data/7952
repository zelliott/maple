zzso of zzso zzso during zzso differentiation is dependent on their extraordinary zzso The longevity of human zzso zzso is associated with a zzso complex zzso formed on the 3' untranslated region zzso One or more of the proteins within this zzso contain strong zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso In the present report we purify alpha zzso activity from human zzso zzso zzso Although not able to bind the zzso zzso directly, alpha zzso activity is sufficient to complement zzso formation in a zzso extract depleted of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that alpha zzso activity contains two structurally related zzso binding zzso These two zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso have an overall structural identity of zzso and contain three repeats of the K zzso zzso domain which is found in a subset of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso expressed in cells are each incorporated into the zzso We conclude that alpha zzso and alpha zzso members of the zzso domain zzso binding protein family, are involved in formation of a zzso zzso zzso complex associated with zzso zzso zzso As such this represents the first example of a specific function for this class of proteins and suggests potential roles for other members of this protein zzso
