zzso zzso cell death contributes to the progression of zzso zzso and several zzso regulators are involved in the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was shown to be highly expressed in vascular zzso cells and zzso of human zzso zzso by zzso zzso The expression was zzso in these cells which were positive for zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso by tumor necrosis factor zzso oxidized low density zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly induced zzso which showed an increased DNA binding to the consensus zzso sequence by zzso of gel shift zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis with zzso zzso showed that zzso was highly expressed in cell death induced by these zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso partly suppressed the cell death induced by zzso zzso and zzso From these results, it is indicated that zzso is one of the immediate early response genes in vascular zzso cells in response to zzso zzso and may play a role in the zzso cell death associated with zzso
