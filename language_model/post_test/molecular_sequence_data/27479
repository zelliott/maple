The zzso zzso zzso gene reverted Ras transformation of zzso zzso zzso and tumor formation by gastric cancer cells, which frequently carry zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is processed to a zzso zzso and a functional zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso activity mapped to the zzso domain, which inhibited tumor formation and the invasive zzso of zzso breast cancer cells driven by human zzso growth factor zzso which signals via zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in an zzso substitution in a highly zzso region within zzso occurs with an average zzso zzso carrier frequency of zzso in the zzso database, but was present in many breast cancer cell lines zzso Here, we show that the zzso substitution profoundly zzso the ability of zzso to inhibit the invasive zzso and tumor formation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed attenuated ability to oppose the effects of zzso which promoted a more invasive zzso In a zzso study of African American women, a potential association of the zzso A zzso was seen with increased risk of zzso zzso zzso invasive breast cancer in African American zzso zzso zzso gene expression was higher in zzso versus zzso primary breast zzso and zzso zzso was unable to inhibit invasion by zzso cell zzso Thus, these findings identify for the first time genetic zzso as a mechanism of impaired tumor zzso function of zzso and suggest that it may play an zzso role in zzso breast zzso
