zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaching out from zzso into the zzso The present study describes transcript expression and zzso of the zzso gene cloned from an extreme zzso zzso zzso in the steady state and under different zzso About zzso elevated transcript expression was found in zzso and zzso shoots at 12 h compared with control, while zzso increased expression was observed under heat zzso In roots, the transcript level was zzso at 2 zzso thereafter increasing with the time of exposure and reaching a maximum at the control zzso The zzso promoter has characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length promoter zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were fused with the zzso zzso gene and transformed into tobacco for functional zzso zzso of zzso increased significantly in transgenic plants under zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso in zzso plants revealed that promoter zzso is efficient for gene zzso In zzso transient expression further suggested that the promoter zzso contains efficient zzso zzso A steep decline in zzso expression in zzso and thereafter an elevated expression in zzso and zzso suggested the presence of a zzso element between zzso and zzso zzso while an zzso element was predicted between zzso and zzso zzso Further, transient expression analyses and zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that the core sequence of zzso motifs zzso and zzso function as zzso and zzso binding sites, zzso Based on the study, a model is proposed for the zzso of the zzso zzso The present study provides a useful insight for understanding gene expression regulation in a zzso with or without zzso Furthermore, potential zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso can be used for engineering crops with enhanced stress zzso
