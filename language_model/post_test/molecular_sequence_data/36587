Previous studies from this laboratory have described the primary zzso acid sequences of the group I and group II zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso This report concentrates on zzso of zzso within a zzso zzso four zzso clones of zzso zzso produced by zzso chain reaction have been zzso and are compared to the sequences published previously by ourselves and zzso Although the sequences come from different sources, Australia and Japan, the overriding conclusion is one of zzso with only two possible zzso changes in the six zzso The zzso were also very zzso including the 3' untranslated regions, although some zzso differences could be found which may provide a genetic zzso zzso are reported to help define the group III zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have zzso the group III of zzso zzso as a Mr zzso zzso which can be defined by zzso zzso A Mr zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been reported with an almost identical zzso zzso Here it is described that zzso zzso isolated from different preparations of spent zzso media by affinity zzso have predominantly Mr zzso zzso and zzso forms which vary in degree from batch to zzso zzso of adults and 38% of children react with the preparation by zzso zzso The difference between the children and adults is statistically significant and zzso can be to at least the zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced in mice against the zzso zzso react to zzso zzso zzso extract by Western zzso primarily to a zzso zzso but also zzso and zzso forms in some zzso
