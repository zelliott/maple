We have tested the predictions of a model that accounts for the zzso preferences of bacteria in terms of a growth zzso zzso According to this model the zzso species zzso to minor and major zzso should be regulated differently under different growth conditions: the zzso zzso to major zzso should increase at fast growth rates while those zzso to minor zzso should decrease at fast growth zzso We have used a quantitative Northern zzso technique to measure the abundance of the zzso and the zzso zzso families over growth rates ranging from zzso to zzso zzso per zzso Five zzso species that are zzso to major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase both as a relative fraction of total zzso and in absolute concentration with increasing growth zzso Three zzso species that are zzso to minor zzso zzso zzso and zzso decrease as a relative fraction of total zzso and in absolute concentration with increasing growth zzso These data suggest that the zzso of groups of zzso species are regulated in different ways, and that they are not regulated simply according to zzso zzso In particular, the data support the growth zzso model for zzso zzso
