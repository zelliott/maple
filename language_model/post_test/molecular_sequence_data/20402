zzso approaches zzso zzso gel zzso zzso were used to determine whether three different zzso zzso zzso zzso commercially used in Brazil and considered economically important over the world, select specific bacterial populations to coexist in their zzso zzso profiles revealed that the zzso zzso bacterial community hardly varies regarding the zzso zzso Moreover, using traditional zzso methods, bacterial strains were isolated from the different zzso zzso presenting different zzso zzso were selected for determining their potential for plant growth zzso More than half of the strains tested zzso were amplified by zzso using zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso The production of zzso was observed in zzso of the zzso while the production of zzso substances was detected in only zzso of the zzso when zzso zzso was used as the indicator zzso zzso of zzso acid and the zzso of zzso were observed in zzso and 59% of the zzso zzso In total, 44 strains zzso presented at least three characteristics of plant growth promotion and were submitted to amplified zzso DNA restriction zzso zzso genetic groups were formed at zzso similarity and one representative of each group was selected for their identification by partial zzso zzso gene zzso They were affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso These strains can be considered of great importance as possible zzso in zzso
