An zzso zzso from Atlantic salmon and bovine zzso have been zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor II, zzso zzso The crystal structures of three such complexes have been determined to zzso A resolution and refined to zzso R factors ranging from zzso to zzso The two zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso and the zzso complex zzso have been compared to other zzso complexes by means of general structure and primary and secondary binding zzso In all three new structures, the primary binding zzso of the inhibitor binds to zzso in the classical manner, but with small differences in the primary and secondary binding zzso zzso in zzso binds deeper in the specificity pocket of bovine zzso than zzso in other known zzso complexes, and zzso salmon zzso lacks some of the secondary binding interactions found in the complexes formed between squash zzso and bovine zzso The zzso complex was formed from the zzso form of the zzso However, well defined electron density was observed for the zzso zzso bond, together with a zzso pattern virtually identical to those of all zzso complexes, indicating a zzso of the zzso zzso
