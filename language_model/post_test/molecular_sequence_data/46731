zzso modified zzso were used to investigate the zzso properties of a major cooked food zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by reacting an zzso containing a single zzso zzso where X zzso C, A, G, or zzso with zzso The unmodified and zzso zzso were inserted into zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were zzso into zzso kidney zzso zzso The progeny zzso obtained was used to transform zzso coli zzso When zzso was at the zzso position to zzso preferential incorporation of zzso the correct base, was observed opposite the zzso zzso G zzso T zzso were zzso along with lesser amounts of G zzso A transitions and G zzso C zzso No zzso were detected for the unmodified zzso The influence of sequence context on the zzso zzso frequency and spectrum was also zzso When the zzso zzso base was replaced by zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso were similar to that observed with zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso were observed when zzso or zzso was zzso to zzso A lower zzso frequency zzso was observed when zzso was at the zzso to the zzso zzso deletions were detected only when zzso or zzso flanked the zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso generating primarily G zzso T zzso in zzso zzso The zzso frequency and specificity of zzso vary depending on the neighboring sequence zzso
