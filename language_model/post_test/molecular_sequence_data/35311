We evaluated zzso markers in zzso sequences of avian influenza zzso to identify avian strains with increased potential for transmission and zzso in zzso Of 149 markers zzso 67 were positive in the consensus sequences from 206 avian zzso Analysis of deep sequencing data in a subset of 24 zzso revealed that 344 zzso occurred at marker zzso zzso in zzso were significantly more likely to be negative zzso than positive zzso but nearly all of the zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso consensus zzso Our analysis revealed significant variation in important markers among avian zzso and showed that consensus sequences do not fully convey an zzso potential for increased zzso and zzso in zzso
