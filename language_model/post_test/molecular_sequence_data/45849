Plants use specialized zzso to detect the amount, quality, zzso and direction of light and to zzso their growth and development zzso These regulatory light signals often interact with other environmental zzso Exposure of zzso zzso zzso to red zzso or zzso zzso light causes zzso to grow in random zzso with respect to the zzso zzso thus overcoming the signal from gravity to grow zzso This light response, zzso by either zzso A or zzso B, represents a prime example of zzso between environmental zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation the zzso zzso (for zzso in the light) in which zzso continue to grow zzso after exposure of zzso to R or zzso zzso The zzso zzso displays no other zzso zzso in response to gravity or zzso Cloning of zzso has identified a novel gene that is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso Using zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso orientation provides a fitness advantage to zzso developing in zzso zzso zzso
