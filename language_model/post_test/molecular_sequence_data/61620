The human zzso related protein zzso family consists of 12 members, which can be divided into six zzso based on the zzso organization and zzso acid zzso Here we performed basic characterization of zzso III, which consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso According to zzso zzso the three genes are expressed in a zzso zzso While zzso zzso is most abundant in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle, and zzso in the gastrointestinal zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we confirmed the presence of the three proteins in human and mouse zzso zzso gene expression was induced upon differentiation of zzso embryonic zzso cells into zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso levels were zzso In the zzso cells, zzso zzso associated predominantly with the nuclear zzso When expressed from the zzso in cultured cells, the three proteins were distributed between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with a minor portion found at the plasma zzso zzso with truncated zzso showed that the zzso portion of the zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso domain, has markedly strong plasma membrane targeting zzso while the zzso half remains largely zzso The expression data demonstrates that zzso zzso and zzso are not merely redundant gene products but show marked quantitative differences in tissue zzso suggesting zzso aspects in their zzso The dual targeting of the proteins indicates a putative role in communication between the zzso and the plasma zzso
