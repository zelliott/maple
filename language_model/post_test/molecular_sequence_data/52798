zzso and zzso hormone receptors are members of the zzso of nuclear receptors zzso that participate in zzso and zzso mechanisms by changes in the zzso of specific zzso These activities are governed by the zzso zzso zzso and through interaction with the components of the zzso zzso A number of zzso molecules of the steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family interact with zzso functions within zzso through a zzso region containing zzso zzso of a core zzso sequence and, zzso participate in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we show that the zzso hormone zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso have different zzso motif preferences for interactions with zzso Using large random and focused zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity libraries, we have obtained novel zzso sequences that interact specifically with zzso or with zzso in a zzso zzso Random sequence libraries yielded zzso zzso and sequence analysis of selected clones revealed that the preferred zzso within and around the zzso motif vary significantly between these two zzso We compared the zzso binding of zzso peptides to that of peptides derived from natural zzso The affinities of selected peptides for the zzso binding zzso of zzso and zzso were similar to the best natural zzso motifs tested, but showed a higher degree of zzso zzso These selected peptides also display zzso dominant zzso activities when introduced into zzso zzso Finally, by directed zzso in specific zzso we were able to alter the zzso binding preference of these zzso
