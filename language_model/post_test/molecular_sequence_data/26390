A zzso probe coding for rat zzso 43 zzso et zzso zzso a gap zzso zzso was used to detect specific zzso and estimate its relative abundance in mouse heart at different zzso zzso 11, 14 and 19 days zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 weeks zzso zzso and at the adult zzso On Northern blots of total cellular zzso a single zzso zzso message was detected at all stages of development, and the differential zzso of labeling indicated zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso levels were further investigated by zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso showed a zzso increase of the zzso level between 11 zzso and 1 zzso then a gradual decrease until the adult stage where it reached a value close to that detected at 11 zzso By comparison, zzso heavy chains and zzso zzso zzso were found to peak at 3 zzso and 14 zzso zzso The presence and the relative abundance of zzso 43 were investigated at the same zzso stages as previously by zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso specific for this zzso zzso zzso data obtained from zzso analyses of zzso showed that from 14 zzso to 1 zzso intensity of labeling of zzso 43 was roughly multiplied by a factor of zzso It peaked at 3 zzso before dropping to about zzso at the adult zzso The data obtained with both the zzso probe and the zzso were significant as shown by zzso zzso They suggest that expression of cardiac zzso 43 is zzso at the early stages of heart development the expression levels of the protein would seem to be mainly regulated by zzso zzso beyond 2 weeks after birth, the levels of zzso 43 would seem rather to depend upon its stability and/or the efficiency of the zzso
