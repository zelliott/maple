zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso red blood zzso Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of zzso infection in a colony of captive zzso and to evaluate potential experimental routes of the transmission of the zzso DNA was extracted from the blood of zzso and tested for infection with zzso by zzso and zzso that amplify the zzso zzso gene of the zzso The overall prevalence of infection of zzso in the zzso population was zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA from 2 zzso revealed that the zzso isolate found in captive zzso was a novel species most closely related zzso to zzso to zzso zzso Blood from a zzso donor zzso was zzso zzso intramuscularly, or zzso into 3 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso at 7 d after zzso the 2 zzso zzso by other routes became zzso at 10 d after zzso All 3 zzso remained zzso for zzso through day zzso zzso zzso zzso with the new zzso isolate did not exhibit clinical signs of zzso during the zzso We demonstrated that captive zzso are infected with a novel zzso zzso In addition we showed that zzso can be transmitted in the absence of the zzso definitive host zzso by transfer of infected blood through zzso zzso and subcutaneous routes to zzso zzso
