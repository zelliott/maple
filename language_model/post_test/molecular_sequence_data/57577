The zzso chain reaction has been employed to isolate a zzso zzso a functional zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cell line zzso Overall, the zzso acid sequence predicted from this clone demonstrates a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso A zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso A deletion of 6 zzso acid zzso located within the putative large zzso loop, which may result from alternative zzso represents the principal difference between the two zzso Upon expression in zzso zzso the zzso zzso displayed pharmacological properties which define it as a functional zzso zzso
