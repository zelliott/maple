zzso zzso is used for industrial production of zzso acid, yet little is known about the zzso of this zzso In this study I cloned two zzso zzso and zzso which code for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso These genes are similar to each other and exhibit more than zzso zzso sequence identity and they contain no zzso This is the first description of zzso genes in a zzso and sequence comparisons revealed that these genes are distinct from previously isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso during zzso acid production confirmed that zzso codes for a zzso protein that converts zzso to zzso zzso of zzso was greatest when zzso was the carbon source, followed by zzso and zzso all of these zzso could be fermented to zzso zzso zzso from zzso were not detected when zzso zzso was grown on any of these zzso but were present when zzso zzso was grown on zzso ethanol, and zzso I zzso that zzso encodes a second zzso zzso that is capable of converting zzso to zzso and is produced by cultures grown on these zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso restored zzso growth to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso so that they grew zzso and produced zzso zzso
