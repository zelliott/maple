The zzso promoter of the rat zzso repeat consists of two functional zzso a core zzso element that is sufficient for zzso in zzso and an upstream zzso promoter element that increases the efficiency of zzso Two of the zzso factors that interact with the zzso promoter also interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso zzso human, and rat zzso is required for efficient zzso in zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso complex formed by these factors on the zzso promoter is not as stable as the complex formed on the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso experiments demonstrated binding sites for rat zzso and zzso on the zzso element of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso of the zzso promoter may explain both the reduced stability of the zzso complex formed on that promoter and the lower efficiency of zzso of that promoter when compared to the zzso zzso
