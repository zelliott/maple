The major zzso fusion gene is presently seen as the hallmark of chronic zzso leukemia zzso and presumably as the cause of its zzso zzso long-term disappearance of zzso after intensive therapy is considered to be a probable cure of zzso The zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso provides a powerful tool for minimal residual zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso increasing the amount of total zzso involved in the reverse zzso reaction to zzso to total zzso extracted from zzso cells, zzso using a specific zzso primer in this reverse reaction, and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso product in zzso zzso This zzso zzso permitted us to detect up to 1 copy of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mixed with zzso zzso in an equivalent quantity to zzso white blood cells zzso Using this highly sensitive zzso during the follow-up of zzso patients, a signal was unexpectedly found in healthy zzso zzso a systematic study of the possible expression of zzso zzso in the zzso of healthy adults and children and in zzso zzso blood was zzso It showed the presence of zzso transcript in the blood of 22 of 73 healthy adults and in the blood of 1 of 22 children but not in 22 samples of zzso zzso zzso
