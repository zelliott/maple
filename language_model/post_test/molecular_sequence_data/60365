Gene amplification is clearly an important aspect of zzso growth and development and has zzso significance in certain zzso The identification and genetic zzso of new areas of amplification in human zzso remains an important goal in understanding the underlying genetic zzso within these zzso In the present work, arbitrarily zzso zzso has been applied to detect and zzso amplified DNA fragments in human non small cell lung cancer zzso Our results show that gains of zzso sequences occur at high frequency zzso of all zzso changes zzso Moreover, we succeeded in detecting a zzso sequence that is highly amplified in one of the zzso zzso The amplification intensity of this DNA zzso was also increased in 29 zzso of the 65 zzso patients from our zzso The amplified DNA zzso was isolated and identified as a 600 zzso sequence mapped to zzso zzso This sequence did not show significant zzso with known human DNA zzso Interestingly, a gene related to cancer zzso the zzso zzso is placed zzso to this region on zzso zzso Survival studies revealed that zzso zzso of zzso patients was shorter in patients bearing the amplified sequence zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the amplified sequence located on zzso 6 might be relevant in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso
