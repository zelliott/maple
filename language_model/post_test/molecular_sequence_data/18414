The arrangement of the zzso bridges of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, has been confirmed by zzso and chemical zzso of the native protein and analysis of the resulting zzso fragments using zzso liquid zzso zzso Although the zzso bridges of zzso I have recently been assigned from the zzso zzso structure, direct chemical analysis of the zzso bonds using classical techniques proved zzso The zzso I zzso is extremely resistant to zzso zzso and only one site of the zzso chain zzso can be used efficiently for chemical zzso A series of zzso conditions were employed in the studies reported zzso The progress of protein modification was monitored directly by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso The zzso pairings could be deduced directly from the mass zzso of the peptides produced by the fragmentation processes and resolved by zzso liquid zzso In two instances, fragments involving a zzso bond were isolated and further zzso and these confirmed the mass spectral zzso The zzso bridges identified, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to those of the zzso structure and are consistent with those assigned for two other closely related zzso zzso
