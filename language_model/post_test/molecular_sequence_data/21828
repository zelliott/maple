The mechanism through which the large zzso zzso bind DNA is poorly zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its relatives indicate the presence of a zzso motif containing four zzso resembling a zinc zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso confirmed that an zzso zzso contains one atom of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid zzso was zzso for both zzso activity and DNA binding affinities but full activity could be restored by adding back zzso zzso in the zzso and other highly zzso zzso yielded proteins that were hypersensitive to zzso suggesting that without zinc the domain is zzso zzso in the highly charged region between the zzso zzso led to lowered DNA binding affinities while circular zzso revealed that these zzso zzso were not greatly affected in overall zzso zzso was protected from zzso by zzso when DNA containing an attachment site was present suggesting that the zinc finger and the DNA are in close zzso A truncated zzso of zzso zzso zzso lacking the putative zinc finger could bind DNA with low zzso The data are consistent with there being at least two DNA binding motifs in zzso one of which is the zinc zzso zzso
