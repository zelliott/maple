The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso located in the exposed loop of the beta chain zzso and having the sequence zzso suppresses the immune zzso On the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso we designed new zzso zzso in which the zzso peptides are linked through their zzso by zzso zzso zzso of different lengths and are able to mimic the zzso nature of the zzso fragments of zzso class II zzso The zzso were zzso using standard zzso zzso synthesis zzso The zzso was achieved by zzso the zzso positions of the zzso attached to an zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso with zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso of the zzso results in enhanced zzso activity and that the potency of the zzso depends on the length of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the obtained zzso peptides is also zzso
