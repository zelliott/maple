zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso reduced, zzso zzso and the products were separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso 1, was isolated as the major product, representing the core zzso attached to the reduced zzso zzso A zzso Its structure was established by compositional and zzso zzso and extensive zzso investigations including zzso correlation zzso zzso total correlation zzso zzso and nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In another reaction sequence the zzso was zzso with dilute zzso acid and reduced with zzso The resulting core zzso were separated by zzso giving seven individual zzso differing at the reducing zzso acid zzso zzso A major product, 2, was isolated and investigated by the same methods as described for the zzso zzso The following structures are proposed for compounds 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where R is zzso in 1 and zzso in 2, and zzso is zzso In zzso the terminal zzso of zzso possessed a free zzso group, as proved by zzso with nitrous acid and the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso The zzso preferences of the terminal core zzso was assessed by zzso Carlo simulations combined with restrained calculations of side chains based on zzso determined zzso zzso These calculations, confirmed by zzso data, displayed several long-range zzso which resulted in a zzso three-dimensional structure of the core zzso
