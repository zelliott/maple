zzso zzso has been used widely as a potential molecular marker to detect the deleterious effects of heavy metals in aquatic zzso Here we exposed zzso zzso zzso to zinc zzso and tested the distribution as well as the induction of zzso in various zzso such as liver, zzso zzso and zzso zzso induction was significant in liver zzso followed by kidney and zzso whereas no induction was detected in zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was successfully cloned and zzso Complete zzso sequencing and analysis of the zzso zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso gene revealed that the gene has three zzso interrupted by two zzso a zzso region of about zzso zzso and about zzso zzso of zzso zzso In grouper heart and kidney cells, the zzso zzso promoter containing eight metal responsive elements zzso two zzso nuclear factor 5 responsive elements zzso and one zzso responsive element zzso had the highest reporter zzso
