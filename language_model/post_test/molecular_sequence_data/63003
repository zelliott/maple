zzso VA zzso are short zzso transcripts that assist in maintaining viral protein expression in infected zzso Six sets of mismatch and zzso base pair zzso of VA zzso were examined by gel mobility and zzso zzso melting to assess the contribution of each structural domain to its overall structure and zzso Each domain of VA zzso was first assigned to one of two apparent unfolding transitions in the zzso melting zzso The Terminal Stem and Central zzso unfold in a single cooperative apparent transition with an apparent zzso of approximately 60 degrees zzso In contrast, the zzso Stem unfolds independently and with much higher apparent zzso of approximately 83 degrees zzso zzso this domain appears to behave as an almost entirely autonomous unit within the zzso mirroring the functional division within the zzso between zzso binding and zzso The effects of mismatch and zzso zzso at five of the six sites on the zzso melting profile are consistent with proposed base pairing and provide further validation of the current secondary structure zzso zzso in the Central zzso were tested in zzso zzso zzso and a component of the VA zzso Central zzso structure essential for zzso zzso activity was zzso
