A gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso has been cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using reverse genetic zzso A probe obtained by zzso amplification from zzso zzso DNA, using zzso derived from two zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used for screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine clones with partially overlapping zzso were zzso The zzso DNA zzso contains a complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the deduced zzso shares significant zzso with the products of zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the sequence of zzso is more closely related to the sequences from zzso than to those from zzso zzso Moreover, this analysis revealed that the gene zzso producing zzso and zzso proteins has occurred in the common zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the cloned gene allowed growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in medium containing zzso as the only carbon and energy source, indicating that it encodes a functional zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso cells expressing zzso have a shorter lag time, in medium containing zzso zzso zzso plus zzso acid zzso zzso No differences in cell response to zzso acid stress were detected both by specific growth and death zzso The mode of regulation of zzso appears to be different from zzso and zzso being subject to repression by a zzso pulse in zzso zzso zzso
