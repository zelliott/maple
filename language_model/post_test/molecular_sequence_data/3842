This work presents a theoretical study aimed at the identification of the zzso site for the blocking of the zzso dependent zzso channels by zzso zzso Thus, the density functional theory zzso at the zzso G zzso level is applied, both in vacuum and in solution, to a series of active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the X-ray structure of the zzso of the channel shows that charged zzso can interact zzso with a zzso acid zzso in the outside of the zzso or through a zzso interaction in the zzso To test both possibilities, model complexes are built using as zzso a zzso group and an zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso potential distribution of the zzso zzso shows that an approaching zzso will be oriented toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso leads to a zzso transfer, with the zzso acid linked by a hydrogen zzso The observed breaking of the zzso of the zzso of the charge density, the relative energy variation for the complexes, and the interaction with only one of the zzso zzso in the fourfold zzso of the zzso channel are not compatible with the observed in zzso activity variation of zzso On the other hand, the study on the zzso complexes shows, in vacuum and solution, a zzso interaction, clearly characterized by the atoms in molecules zzso zzso The variation of relative energy in solution is very small, but approaches the variation of in zzso zzso Our results, the zzso characteristics of zzso and the analysis of the three-dimensional internal structure of the zzso channel zzso suggest two putative zzso zzso One is formed by the four zzso chains zzso the entrance to the narrow part of the inner zzso zzso The other is defined by four zzso zzso within the zzso
