zzso zzso contain zzso active proteins that interfere with zzso transmission by binding to and altering the normal functioning of zzso proteins involved, directly or zzso with regulating nerve zzso Of the zzso toxins studied to date, many act on zzso zzso channels, zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso In an attempt to zzso zzso and express the genes zzso these zzso as well as other genes specifying activities not completely zzso as yet, a zzso library was constructed from zzso isolated from the zzso of the black zzso zzso from the library harboring sequences zzso 14 different zzso toxins were isolated and characterized by zzso sequence zzso Genes coding for three zzso zzso zzso K, I, and zzso were expressed as zzso zzso fusion proteins in the zzso space of zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein was affinity zzso zzso from its zzso and the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was shown to be identical to native zzso in its zzso zzso zzso behavior, zzso activity, and binding to zzso zzso channels in bovine synaptic zzso Computer modeling was employed to create three-dimensional structures of zzso and zzso from the X-ray crystal structure of zzso utilizing both structural and sequence zzso Comparisons were made between the three zzso providing a framework for zzso zzso
