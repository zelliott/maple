During zzso zzso the control of division between daughter cells is critical for pattern zzso Two zzso zzso zzso lines named zzso zzso were characterized by forward and reverse zzso The terminal arrest of zzso and zzso zzso was at the zzso stage, just prior to the round of zzso divisions that establishes the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso of a weaker zzso of zzso were able to divide further, resulting in zzso zzso zzso These zzso analyses support an essential role of the zzso proteins in the correct formation of the zzso zzso That an important proportion of zzso zzso were arrested prior to the zzso stage indicated a more general role in cell zzso The analysis of zzso and zzso genes revealed that they belong to a small zzso of the large family zzso zzso binding zzso and are widely zzso among plants, zzso and zzso We showed that zzso and zzso proteins interact with each other in a zzso zzso system, and that zzso and zzso zzso by distinct fluorescent zzso zzso with zzso during zzso in agreement with their potential role in cell division and their zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso proteins participate in the organization of zzso during cell division, and that this function is essential for the correct development of the early zzso
