The transfer of genes from an zzso to its host typically requires acquisition of targeting signals by the gene product to ensure its return to the zzso for zzso Many hundreds of zzso genes must have acquired transit peptides for successful relocation to the zzso Here, we explore potential evolutionary origins of zzso transit peptides in the malaria zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could serve as transit peptides after zzso zzso We further demonstrate that numerous zzso peptides and even whimsical sequences based on English words can also function as transit peptides in zzso Thus, facile acquisition of transit peptides from existing sequence likely expedited zzso integration through zzso gene zzso
