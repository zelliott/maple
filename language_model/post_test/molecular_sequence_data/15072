We describe a simple zzso approach to augment zzso zzso which we studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that single zzso acid modifications in zzso zzso could enhance zzso sensitivity through focal interactions with zzso zzso while minimizing the risk of zzso observed previously in zzso more broadly zzso using in zzso evolution zzso We show that this zzso method can indeed generate zzso with zzso sensitivity zzso greater than the parental zzso and can zzso zzso with zzso zzso However, we also find that single zzso acid zzso in the zzso can alter zzso fine zzso affecting recognition requirements for zzso zzso over most of the length of the zzso binding zzso Furthermore, minimal changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso even the addition of a single zzso group or conversion of a zzso or zzso zzso to a zzso can zzso modified zzso zzso with new zzso In zzso modeling of modified zzso through zzso zzso gene transfer into zzso mice confirmed the biological significance of these altered zzso although it also demonstrated the feasibility of producing zzso positively zzso zzso receptors with markedly increased zzso zzso These results affirm the possibility of readily generating zzso zzso for therapeutic purposes but demonstrate that minimal changes in zzso zzso structure can promote self zzso and thereby emphasize the importance of caution in zzso receptors with even subtle zzso before clinical zzso
