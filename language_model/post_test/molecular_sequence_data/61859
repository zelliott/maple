The zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso belong to a large group of proteins identified in numerous plant zzso These proteins share a similar zzso region containing 12 zzso zzso in zzso zzso To date, the function of these proteins remains zzso We previously found that zzso expression zzso with cell zzso in stems and flowers and is induced by zzso acid zzso zzso expression of a zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion in tobacco bright yellow 2 zzso cells and zzso analyses suggest zzso zzso with possible zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso also reacted with proteins extracted from the cell zzso Three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso While zzso similar to zzso is zzso localized to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso suggest cell wall zzso zzso and zzso are expressed during cell zzso whereas zzso and zzso are expressed during cell zzso zzso they all were induced by zzso We generated transgenic zzso in which we zzso the putative cell wall protein zzso The transgenic plants exhibited late flowering and reduced stem zzso These zzso zzso were found under low, but not zzso temperatures, suggesting functional zzso under normal growth zzso The expression pattern and cellular zzso of zzso its regulation by zzso and the zzso of the transgenic plants suggest a role in zzso cell zzso and transition to zzso
