The three main zzso substance zzso zzso A zzso and zzso B, are believed to be selective zzso for respectively the zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso also has actions which cannot be zzso through its normal zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso known to have zzso actions despite its apparent lack of binding to any known zzso zzso In the cloned zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso and zzso as expected were poor competitors for zzso substance zzso However, by using zzso zzso and zzso directly, it was found that both peptides in zzso binding zzso as well as in competition against each other in fact bound to the zzso zzso with high zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso for the zzso zzso but that they are poor competitors for substance zzso which in contrast competes very well for binding with both zzso and zzso
