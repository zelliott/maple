zzso zzso are a large family of small DNA viruses infecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso infection zzso cell proliferation that may lead to the formation of zzso or skin zzso zzso cell proliferation has been related mainly to the expression of two small zzso E6 and zzso In zzso zzso E6 contains two zzso zzso repeats, whereas zzso consists of a zzso unfolded zzso region followed by a zzso domain which folds as an zzso zzso Here, we show that both the novel zzso bird zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso and the zzso bird zzso zzso zzso zzso contain unusual E6 and zzso zzso The avian zzso proteins contain an extended unfolded N zzso and a zzso domain of reduced size, whereas the avian E6 proteins consist of a single zzso zzso A comparable zzso E6 protein may have existed in a common zzso of zzso and avian zzso zzso E6 zzso zzso are zzso related to those of zzso avian zzso whereas zzso E6 zzso zzso seem to have emerged by zzso and subsequently zzso from the original ancestral zzso In avian and zzso cells, both zzso E6 and zzso zzso were evenly expressed in the zzso and the zzso Finally, samples of full-length zzso E6 and the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain were prepared for zzso zzso Both zzso were highly soluble and well zzso according to nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso
