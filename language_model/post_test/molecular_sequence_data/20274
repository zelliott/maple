zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso is a key component zzso the zzso system, and its evolutionary origin remains unknown during the course of animal zzso In the present study, we isolated a zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso zzso with zzso activity from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso consisted of 430 zzso zzso which is structurally characterized by the presence of an zzso signal zzso of 16 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso with a zzso site structure, a zzso zzso domain with the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso site (between zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso expected for zzso function, and a potential zzso zzso site, all characteristic of zzso Besides, the zzso zzso zzso was readily activated by human zzso zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso zzso was also able to zzso at neutral and alkaline pH at 4 degrees C without the addition of zzso and the zzso was accelerated by addition of human zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a novel member of the zzso family, with a domain structure of zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain, pushing the evolutionary origin of zzso to the zzso In addition, zzso displays a zzso expression pattern in zzso zzso with the most abundant expression in the zzso zzso and zzso agreeing with the notion that the zzso zzso of zzso is the precursor of the zzso zzso
