zzso the nature of the genetic zzso in zzso zzso and their prevalence in the various tumor zzso is critical to understanding their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human tumors occurs predominantly through point zzso in two functional regions of the zzso zzso 12, 13 zzso zzso or zzso 61 zzso zzso We examined the prevalence of point zzso in zzso 12, 13, and 61 of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in benign and zzso human zzso tumors by zzso of zzso tumor DNA with synthetic zzso zzso None of the eight normal zzso zzso zzso point zzso Four of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained zzso point zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso for zzso substitution in zzso 12 of zzso None of the zzso zzso tumors known to be zzso (and thus due to zzso had point zzso whereas one of the two zzso zzso arising in zzso zzso contained in zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso which was confirmed by sequencing the tumor zzso These data show that zzso zzso is about equally prevalent in benign and zzso zzso zzso and thus may be an early event in the zzso zzso
