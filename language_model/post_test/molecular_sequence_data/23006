zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso requires the interaction of zzso with zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso While it is known that zzso and zzso activates zzso interaction with zzso neither the mechanism of zzso nor the surface that binds to zzso is zzso We addressed this through zzso suppression of zzso zzso that cause zzso zzso zzso We created a new zzso zzso and showed that it suppressed a new zzso zzso We tested the effect of zzso on several newly isolated and existing zzso zzso that map throughout the zzso All except one zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and all zzso zzso were localized on a zzso zzso model that is based on the structure of the highly related zzso zzso These results provide evidence for zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso binding to zzso In addition, because zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso to a domain that is absent in zzso proteins that do not bind to zzso we suggest that zzso is a part of the zzso zzso
