The zzso zzso of both bovine zzso 1 zzso 1) and zzso virus zzso mediate the initial and dominant interactions between virus and zzso host zzso By studying virus binding to zzso and zzso zzso cells, we demonstrated that the cellular zzso zzso play an essential role in zzso 1 and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso studies were carried out to map the zzso structures that are responsible for zzso zzso First, based on the observation that zzso 1 and zzso are zzso sensitive to zzso zzso of zzso attachment to cells, we conducted a zzso domain zzso zzso This involved the construction of a set of zzso zzso 1 expressing zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso and then using the sensitivity to zzso zzso as a means of mapping the potential zzso regions on the zzso zzso Next, we zzso panels of partially overlapping zzso 1 and zzso zzso peptides and examined their zzso to zzso The results from these experiments demonstrated five zzso sites between zzso acid 129 and 310 of zzso 1 zzso and four zzso sites between zzso acid 90 and 275 of zzso zzso
