We have recently zzso an inhibitor of zzso stem cell proliferation zzso zzso and report here on its zzso and initial biological and zzso zzso The activity can be detected by direct addition to the zzso stem cell zzso and this simple test for zzso activity has greatly facilitated the zzso of the zzso The zzso involves a combination of zzso Q zzso exchange zzso zzso affinity zzso and Blue zzso affinity zzso The zzso stem cell inhibitor is an 8 zzso zzso which is identical to the previously described zzso zzso inflammatory protein 1 zzso The zzso has a natural tendency to form large zzso and appears, in zzso zzso to have a native molecular weight of around 90 zzso zzso is a heat stable, zzso sensitive protein which is half zzso active at between 10 and 25 zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso can be disrupted by dilute solutions of zzso acid and it appears that disruption increases the specific activity of zzso zzso We also report the zzso of the human zzso of the stem cell inhibitor zzso zzso zzso which is zzso identical to zzso zzso alpha and which shares all the above features of the zzso zzso
