The identification of plant genes involved in early zzso of in zzso zzso can not only contribute to our understanding of the processes underlying growth zzso determination, but also provide novel markers for evaluating the outcome of in zzso zzso zzso To search for such genes and to monitor changes in gene expression accompanying in zzso zzso we have adapted the zzso differential display technique to the comparative analysis of a model system of tomato zzso that can be driven selectively toward either shoot or callus formation by means of previously determined growth regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to be the most common event, indicating that a zzso zzso of gene expression zzso zzso during the early zzso of in zzso zzso However, zzso fragments representative of genes that are either zzso or induced in a zzso manner could also be identified, and two of them zzso zzso were further zzso One of these zzso fragments, zzso zzso to an zzso that is zzso much earlier in zzso zzso 2) than in zzso zzso zzso zzso The other, zzso identifies an zzso that is zzso expressed in zzso zzso only, well before any zzso signs of differentiation become apparent, and thus exhibits typical features of a zzso zzso
