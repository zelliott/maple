zzso is one class of relatively unexplored drug zzso Since zzso play a myriad of essential roles, it is likely that new drugs can be developed that target zzso There are several factors that make targeting zzso particularly zzso First, the amount of information about the roles of zzso in essential biological processes is currently being zzso Second, sequence information about zzso zzso is pouring out of zzso sequencing efforts at unprecedented zzso Third, designing and screening potential zzso zzso to target zzso is relatively zzso The use of zzso in cell culture, however, presents several challenges such as zzso zzso and stability, and selective targeting of genes of zzso Here, we review investigations aimed at targeting zzso with zzso that can circumvent several of these potential zzso The hallmark of the strategies discussed is the use of short zzso which may have the advantage of higher cellular zzso and improved binding selectivity compared to longer zzso These strategies have been applied to Group I zzso from the zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both are examples of zzso infections that are increasing in number and zzso
