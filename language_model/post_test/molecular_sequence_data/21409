The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex was discovered and has become established close to the North American Great Lakes in the zzso This invasive forest insect zzso represents a very high risk to native and exotic zzso in North zzso We investigated the geographical origin of zzso lineages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the recently zzso eastern Canadian region by analyzing zzso and nuclear sequence variations and comparing the genetic diversity of a worldwide collection of zzso zzso among six countries where the zzso complex is native and four countries from which the zzso complex has been zzso In total, 102 zzso were zzso While 12 zzso zzso zzso are observed in the areas where zzso zzso is native, only two zzso are retrieved from areas where zzso zzso is not native, indicating the wide spread of zzso lineages in the introduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso of the Canadian zzso and is also observed in Chile and South Africa, where the zzso complex has also been zzso zzso comprises zzso of the Canadian zzso and is also observed in the USA, but nowhere else in our worldwide zzso Thus, at least one of the Canadian zzso lineages shares a common origin with zzso zzso from the Southern zzso The source of the second zzso lineage is still unknown, but zzso analyses show that zzso is zzso More extended sampling is necessary to determine the origin of this zzso zzso lineage and investigate its probable symbiotic association with native North American zzso
