zzso is a widely distributed type I zzso zzso and functions as the major zzso zzso on most cell zzso Although alternative zzso can produce a large number of different zzso they all retain the zzso zzso region and a common zzso and zzso domain, which are highly zzso between zzso The past decade has seen an extensive investigation of this zzso zzso to its importance in zzso zzso and zzso interactions in both normal and disease zzso Although roles for alternative zzso and variable zzso in determining zzso interactions are now well established, the mechanisms by which zzso zzso structural and zzso events to elicit cellular responses have been less well zzso However, there is now increasing evidence that zzso is assembled in a regulated manner into zzso zzso complexes and, through both direct and indirect zzso serves to focus downstream signal zzso zzso
