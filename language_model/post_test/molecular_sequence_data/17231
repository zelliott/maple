Although the zzso gene was first identified as a putative candidate gene to understand the molecular basis of hypertension in rat and humans, the concept has not been supported in recently generated zzso zzso We had first identified the mouse zzso gene on the basis of its strong zzso regulation in mouse kidney and further characterized its zzso organization, zzso start site and zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso determined mouse strain, tissue distribution, zzso dependence and cell expression of the zzso zzso zzso and liver constitute the main expression sites of the zzso zzso in particular it is expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso This zzso expression is zzso when zzso are also zzso By using the sensitive zzso technique, minor zzso expression sites, corresponding to zzso stomach, heart and zzso have also zzso Like in zzso expression of the zzso gene in heart and lung is zzso zzso of rabbit zzso against zzso peptides identified the zzso zzso a zzso of unknown function, which has been defined as a member of the zzso zzso zzso We have determined that the zzso protein follows the same distribution and regulation as its corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso identified the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells as the zzso location of the zzso zzso Different zzso units produced by zzso events, occurring before the translation initiation site, have been identified from mouse zzso This work provides the basis to further understand the molecular mechanisms that control the zzso expression of the zzso gene in mouse zzso heart and zzso where zzso is also expressed in an zzso zzso
