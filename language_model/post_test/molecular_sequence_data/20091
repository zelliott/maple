Using zzso zzso gene zzso and cell zzso zzso we followed changes in the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso gene expression and culture zzso zzso from the end of the zzso phase up to 5 h after entry into the stationary zzso The concentration of each of the 22 proteins in the culture zzso was determined at various zzso In addition, the stability of the proteins was zzso Fifteen of these zzso including 14 members of the zzso zzso zzso were known or predicted to be zzso All of the zzso proteins reached a maximum concentration during early stationary phase, but there were significant differences in the zzso of their zzso The time courses of protein zzso were in agreement with gene expression data, except for zzso zzso which was zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also peaked in early stationary phase, and the zzso of zzso paralleled the time course of concentration of the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso study of the time course of protein zzso gene expression and zzso zzso reveals that the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso during the transition zzso It also suggests that there is diversity in the regulation of gene expression within the zzso zzso
