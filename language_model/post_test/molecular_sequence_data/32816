zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso The structural characterization and ecological roles of the zzso zzso zzso by this strain were studied in this zzso The yield of the zzso increased as the culture temperature decreased in the range zzso degrees C, and it reached zzso g zzso zzso zzso under optimal growth conditions (15 degrees C, 52 zzso zzso fraction was zzso and its structure was identified by the combination of zzso zzso high-resolution mass zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso The ratio of the sugar units, the zzso group and the zzso group was close to 4 : 5 : zzso The major sugar unit of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso other sugar units present included terminal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small amount of other sugar zzso Its structure was different from zzso reported for other marine zzso Besides the structural zzso of the zzso its ecological roles were zzso This zzso could enhance the stability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the same strain through preventing its zzso It could bind many metal zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso It was also a very good zzso agent and could conglomerate zzso and suspended zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso by strain zzso might help this strain enrich the zzso particles and the trace metals in the zzso environment, stabilize the zzso zzso zzso and avoid its zzso This is believed to be the first report on the structure of the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and its ecological zzso According to these results and other studies, a zzso zzso of the lifestyle of the zzso zzso strain zzso is zzso
