The growth hormone zzso gene has been characterized for a number of zzso and used to establish zzso relationships and as a candidate gene for studies of genetic variation in connection with growth zzso In this study, we report the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso including its zzso region, being cloned by zzso and zzso walking zzso The zzso gene spans approximately zzso zzso and consists of six zzso and five zzso as found for all cloned zzso zzso genes with the exception of zzso and zzso The zzso region contains consensus sequences for a zzso box, a zzso a zzso a zzso two zzso a zzso and a zzso Five zzso are identified in the zzso gene and three of them are zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso of zzso is zzso zzso in length zzso a zzso of 204 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and theoretical zzso point of zzso The precursor of zzso consists of a 17 zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso mature zzso The four zzso zzso are located at zzso positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso and One possible site for zzso zzso zzso is present at zzso The coding region sequence of zzso is used to align with the sequences of 18 other species from zzso and one species from zzso using zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso was used to construct the zzso trees using zzso and maximum zzso zzso The zzso trees by two methods are identical in most of the zzso with high zzso zzso Every family all forms independent zzso on the zzso trees, in the family, the different species also forms the zzso according to the different zzso The results are also identical to those from zzso data, and demonstrated that the zzso gene is very suitable for zzso relationship analysis of zzso To validate the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso is cloned using zzso and tissue zzso are investigated using zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the predicted zzso is correct, the zzso zzso are mainly expressed in zzso and zzso expressed in zzso brain, liver, zzso zzso muscle and hear, but not expressed in zzso and zzso
