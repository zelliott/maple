zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso gene in the zzso zzso This protein was recently shown to interact with zzso regulatory factor 7 and inhibit zzso zzso zzso induction zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso zzso and it is localized in the zzso of infected zzso In this report, we provide evidence that zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso by Western zzso along with known structural proteins of zzso including zzso zzso and major zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso zzso but became sensitive after the zzso were treated with zzso which destroys the viral zzso zzso zzso remained associated with zzso complex when zzso zzso were removed after zzso zzso zzso An zzso protein band was zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of extensively zzso zzso zzso and identified by mass zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso structures were specifically stained by zzso zzso Based on the evidence, we conclude that zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso and appears to be a zzso zzso The presence of zzso in zzso zzso raised the possibility that this protein may be delivered to host cells at the start of infection and therefore have the opportunity to act at the very early stage of the infection, suggesting an important role of zzso in zzso primary zzso
