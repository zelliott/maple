zzso zzso sequencing enables zzso of transcripts (both known and zzso zzso junctions and zzso of zzso from different zzso Discovery of gene zzso those expressed with low zzso is a challenge with zzso and zzso sequencing zzso To address this challenge, we implemented an zzso mapping pipeline within the zzso zzso We introduced new features including filter and junction zzso zzso pairing rescue and accurate mapping quality zzso We combined this pipeline with a zzso zzso zzso Read zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso Performing zzso zzso of the breast cancer cell line zzso using the zzso system, we called 40 gene zzso among over zzso zzso zzso We validated 36 of these 40 zzso with zzso zzso of which 25 were expressed in zzso but not the Human Brain zzso An zzso gene fusion involving the zzso zzso alpha gene zzso and another involving the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in a number of breast tumor cell lines and a clinical tumor zzso
