Tropical zzso is a highly fatal epidemic and endemic infectious disease that occurs throughout the communities of the zzso Mountains in South zzso The disease is caused by the zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso The emergence of zzso in new geographic areas and an increase in the number of reported cases suggest the need for a rapid test for zzso study and investigation of the disease zzso The objective of this research is to develop a rapid zzso diagnostic test using zzso zzso to overcome the limitations of the current standard zzso technique for laboratory zzso Western zzso analysis with patient zzso of whole cell zzso separated on a zzso gel identified zzso as a dominant zzso zzso zzso were designed according to the sequence of zzso strain zzso to amplify the gene coding for zzso from a local isolate zzso zzso zzso The zzso was subsequently cloned into zzso adding the zzso tag, and expressed in zzso zzso Patient zzso with different zzso zzso confirmed the diagnostic band of 31 zzso on a Western zzso of zzso The performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also evaluated in an zzso format with 137 patient zzso of known zzso zzso The range of zzso reading from positive zzso did not overlap with the range of those from negative zzso suggesting the potential application of zzso in both zzso for high zzso regional hospital settings and in the construction of handheld rapid tests for rural clinical zzso
