Two products of human zzso zzso zzso gene have been previously identified to resemble human zzso zzso These viral zzso zzso are able to induce signal zzso events and biological activities in a variety of zzso In this study, five novel zzso transcripts were identified from zzso zzso infected zzso zzso Some zzso zzso were zzso zzso depending on the existence of a predicted zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso four of the zzso zzso apparently formed putative zzso Among the different zzso zzso zzso significantly induced the zzso of zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso All identified zzso zzso were able to form complexes with zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso in different zzso Identification of diverse forms of zzso suggests that zzso has developed a sophisticated mechanism to interfere with zzso signaling zzso
