zzso hormone receptors zzso are zzso zzso factors that are zzso as multiple zzso on two zzso To date, no functional differences have been shown between the zzso zzso however, the maintenance of alpha and beta genes during zzso evolution argues that functional differences do zzso We have localized a zzso site in the rabbit zzso heavy chain zzso This site and zzso sites in the chicken zzso and rat zzso hormone genes were used to compare the zzso activities of zzso alpha and zzso beta and the influence of auxiliary proteins zzso zzso alpha formed zzso zzso poorly, whereas zzso beta formed zzso zzso zzso This difference was not due to either a lower amount of zzso alpha zzso in the zzso zzso or to an inability of the expressed zzso alpha to form zzso since both zzso alpha and zzso beta readily formed zzso with zzso on these zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso alpha zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso blocks zzso zzso complexes but not zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso alpha zzso form more readily than zzso zzso alpha zzso We conclude that on the binding sites zzso zzso beta has a greater tendency to form zzso than zzso zzso whereas both zzso form zzso zzso The different zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta may zzso functional differences that affect zzso hormone zzso
