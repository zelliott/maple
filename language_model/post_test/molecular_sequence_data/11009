zzso is transported in bacteria by a zzso transport system composed of a zzso binding zzso an integral membrane zzso and an zzso zzso These three proteins are coded by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins from various organisms zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are very zzso The lowest zzso value reported for zzso in the zzso transport process is approximately 50 zzso In a mod zzso zzso is transported by the zzso transport system or by a zzso zzso zzso zzso transport is tightly coupled to zzso in zzso coli and zzso pneumoniae, while other zzso organisms appear to have a zzso storage zzso In all organisms studied so far, zzso transport genes are regulated by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex binds to the sequences zzso zzso zzso T or zzso in the zzso promoter region in zzso coli and prevents zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso complex binds to DNA as a zzso in zzso coli and possibly in other organisms as zzso In zzso zzso however, two zzso zzso zzso zzso are required for zzso
