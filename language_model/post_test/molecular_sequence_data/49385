Two new mouse zzso zzso zzso were generated to zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso The clones zzso and zzso each of the zzso zzso chain zzso detect zzso with high sensitivity, respectively, at 20 zzso and 2 zzso of protein per lane in Western zzso They both recognize different zzso on the zzso of zzso located between zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and zzso human zzso zzso revealed all known expression sites of zzso zzso the zzso brush borders of zzso kidney zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso cells, activated zzso as well as germ cells during zzso In contrast to other zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate zzso with a broad spectrum of animal species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso dog, cat, and guinea zzso In addition, zzso zzso recognized mouse zzso in Western zzso and on zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are useful for identifying even subtle changes in zzso zzso resulting from zzso These zzso are also sensitive tools for the detection of minimal amounts of zzso in biological zzso and zzso using zzso zzso Their zzso in routinely processed zzso of various species may prove useful for correlation of zzso expression in animal models to human zzso
