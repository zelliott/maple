The complete primary structure of a base zzso and zzso acid preferential zzso zzso zzso from the fruit bodies of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence was mostly determined by analysis of the peptides generated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (including zzso and zzso zzso digest of zzso zzso It consists of 239 zzso acid zzso The molecular weight is zzso The location of 10 half zzso zzso were almost zzso on those of known zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso between zzso zzso and four known zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are 102, zzso zzso and 74, zzso The zzso sequences are concentrated around the three zzso which are supposed to form the active site of zzso zzso family zzso
