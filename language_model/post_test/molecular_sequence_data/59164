zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Arctic zzso zzso zzso Each zzso is composed of two zzso and these differ markedly in zzso zzso and life zzso We used molecular genetic approaches to test whether zzso genetic zzso exists among zzso and zzso if zzso arose in zzso and came into secondary contact or arose zzso within the lake through genetic segregation and/or zzso zzso zzso sequencing of 275 zzso of the zzso DNA zzso control region, zzso restriction zzso length zzso and single locus zzso analyses detected insufficient variation to test our zzso Analysis of zzso zzso band sharing detected no significant differences between zzso within the same zzso However, significant differences among zzso belonging to different zzso suggest some genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso were more similar to zzso zzso zzso than to zzso zzso from two other zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso arose zzso within the lake rather than in zzso followed by secondary zzso
