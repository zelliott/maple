zzso zzso agents will be of great value in controlling virus replication and delaying the onset of zzso disease zzso Current therapy involves the use of zzso agents that target the zzso functions of the virus, resulting in the emergence of resistant viruses to these agents, thus lowering their zzso To overcome this problem, we have considered the idea of developing novel agents from within zzso as zzso of virus zzso The specificity of the zzso protein for the zzso virus particle makes it an attractive zzso for the development of zzso agents targeting the events associated with virus zzso We have generated zzso zzso proteins containing zzso sequences added to the C zzso of zzso These sequences zzso to nine zzso sites of the zzso and zzso precursors of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso DNA to assess their effect on virus zzso using zzso and zzso replication zzso The virus particles generated exhibited a variable replication pattern depending on the zzso zzso site used as a fusion zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso containing the zzso sequences from the junction of zzso and zzso zzso completely abolished virus zzso These results show that zzso proteins generated from within zzso have the ability to suppress zzso replication and make ideal agents for gene therapy or zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso
