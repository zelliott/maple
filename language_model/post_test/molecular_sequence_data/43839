zzso activity in the culture medium of zzso zzso markedly increased during the growth of the zzso The zzso activity in the culture medium was zzso by sequential column zzso The zzso zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 28 zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing analysis suggested that the zzso is a mature form of zzso zzso zzso of free zzso groups for activity and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also indicated that the zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso was designated as zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was present in higher amount in the culture medium in the stationary phase than in the zzso zzso zzso has high activities at neutral to alkaline pH zzso This suggests that zzso has functional roles in the culture medium in the stationary phase, because the pH of the culture medium became alkaline with the progress of zzso zzso
