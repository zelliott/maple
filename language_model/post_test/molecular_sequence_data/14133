The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify the zzso transcript as a marker of minimal residual disease zzso in 76 patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso subjected to zzso zzso and in complete zzso zzso We examined 56 patients transplanted in chronic phase zzso and 20 in advanced phase zzso including 16 in accelerated phase and four in zzso zzso A total of 135 samples collected between 4 and 105 months from zzso were analyzed and the zzso analysis was positive in 33 zzso samples from 20 zzso The zzso zzso transcript was detected in zzso zzso patients analyzed within 1 year and in zzso zzso beyond 1 year from zzso zzso of the residual disease at the molecular level in individual patients was zzso The results have been correlated with a number of clinical parameters obtained before and after zzso among the tested variables only the phase of the disease at zzso was associated with higher frequency of zzso zzso after zzso The probability of finding zzso disease 1 year beyond zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso in zzso zzso zzso as compared to patients grafted in zzso zzso zzso At any zzso from zzso the difference between the two groups remained statistically zzso the zzso transcript was present in zzso patients transplanted in zzso compared to zzso patients transplanted in zzso zzso zzso zzso between 12 and 36 months from zzso and in zzso zzso vs zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso beyond 36 months from zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
