We zzso evaluated the effectiveness of a repeat administration of a zzso zzso zzso expressing bacterial zzso coli zzso into the same zzso site of a relatively large animal, the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was introduced zzso into zzso zzso arteries through a zzso zzso After a single dose of zzso zzso up to zzso of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) and smooth muscle cells in multiple layers of the media showed zzso expression as evaluated by zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso as assessed by zzso chain zzso zzso expression zzso as zzso zzso peaked 7 days after transfer and was zzso although it was retained for a zzso Second does of the same zzso to the same zzso site were given 1, 2, 5, or 8 weeks after the first zzso At 1 week the second dose significantly enhanced zzso zzso At 2, 5, or 8 weeks the second dose zzso zzso expression at zzso to zzso of the full zzso zzso expression was also detected in zzso dogs, although the expression levels correlated zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso in their zzso These results demonstrate that zzso gene expression can be enhanced by a second administration of the same zzso after a short zzso and that a repeat dose after a long zzso partially but significantly zzso gene expression despite the presence of an immune zzso These data may provide an additional scientific foundation for the use of zzso zzso gene transfer in future clinical zzso
