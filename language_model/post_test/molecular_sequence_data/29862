We have used zzso zzso to investigate possible interactions between zzso and portions of the zzso contained within the zzso center of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso complementary to bases zzso zzso and zzso of 23 S zzso were zzso to 50 S zzso in zzso zzso binding was zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso Each probe was shown to bind specifically with its intended binding site through zzso of the zzso within the zzso zzso with zzso H and analysis of the zzso fragments using gel zzso Competitive binding experiments were conducted between each probe and the antibiotics zzso and zzso The binding of a probe complementary to bases zzso was attenuated by zzso upon the binding of zzso A probe complementary to bases zzso showed an increase in binding of zzso while binding of a probe complementary to bases zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso did not affect the binding of any of these zzso to 50 S zzso These results suggest that bases within the zzso region of 23 S zzso in zzso coli may be involved in a zzso zzso
