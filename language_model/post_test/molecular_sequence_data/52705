The bacterial cell wall and the zzso that zzso it are targets of zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cell wall zzso requires a zzso of zzso zzso on adjacent zzso zzso The zzso zzso which zzso this zzso is the target of zzso zzso zzso in contrast, do not inhibit an zzso but bind directly to zzso and prevent subsequent zzso by the zzso Clinical resistance to zzso in zzso pathogens has been traced to altered zzso producing zzso rather than zzso 

The structure of a zzso zzso has been determined by multiple anomalous zzso zzso phasing to zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso produced zzso and a zzso analog of the reaction intermediate of cell wall zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso with the known structure of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that does not provide zzso resistance, reveals zzso in the size and zzso of the site for zzso binding zzso zzso A decrease was noted in the ability of the zzso to hydrogen bond a zzso zzso entering zzso zzso 

zzso differences at zzso 2 of the zzso zzso help explain a zzso specificity shift zzso to zzso leading to remodeled cell wall zzso and zzso resistance in zzso zzso
