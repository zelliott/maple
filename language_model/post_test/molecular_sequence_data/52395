A zzso zzso liquid zzso method was developed to zzso a zzso zzso in rat and monkey zzso The compound and internal standard, a zzso zzso were extracted from plasma with an zzso zzso extraction column with an extraction efficiency in the range zzso A zzso zzso column was used to separate the zzso by zzso zzso followed by ultraviolet detection at 215 zzso zzso of the zzso over the concentration range zzso zzso resulted in an zzso relative error and relative standard zzso both less than zzso The zzso zzso was stable in both rat and monkey plasma frozen at zzso degrees zzso
