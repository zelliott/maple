In zzso incubation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with isolated disrupted zzso yields different zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso These zzso were isolated by zzso and characterized by zzso zzso The first steps of the degradation involve an zzso zzso activity and lead to the formation of one zzso one zzso two zzso and two zzso zzso These reactions do not require zzso as zzso On the other hand, the following steps, which lead to the formation of zzso and zzso are zzso This process is characterized by the preferential action of an zzso zzso activity, and the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso inside the zzso appears to follow a very specific pathway, since only nine intermediate compounds can be identified instead of the 38 possible zzso Our results are consistent both with the existence of several specific zzso for alpha zzso alpha 1-3 and alpha zzso zzso and with the presence of a unique zzso whose specificity would be dependent either on zzso or on the spatial zzso of the zzso Nevertheless, previous work on the structural analysis of zzso zzso in the urine of patients suffering from zzso demonstrates the absence of the core alpha zzso zzso zzso in the major storage product derived from zzso zzso This observation indicates the presence of a specific zzso zzso form, unaffected in zzso
