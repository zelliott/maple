We undertook the cloning of zzso zzso from the South African clawed zzso zzso zzso in order to study the role of insulin during zzso in this zzso We found that zzso zzso contains two different zzso zzso both of which code for peptides containing 106 zzso acids of typical structure but which differ by eight zzso zzso one in the signal zzso two in the zzso four in the zzso and one in the zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that the two zzso zzso identified zzso to two different zzso genes which we believe arose through a recent gene zzso within the zzso radiation possibly during the development of zzso in this zzso Both genes are zzso since we have recently identified the two corresponding zzso in pancreatic extracts of adult toads zzso zzso Bennett, zzso Robinson, zzso and Roth, zzso (1989) zzso in zzso These zzso represent the first zzso zzso sequences to be zzso
