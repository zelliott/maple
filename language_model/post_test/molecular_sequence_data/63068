The zzso of zzso zzso spores consists of a zzso layer and an external zzso zzso The nap is composed primarily of the zzso zzso which contains a zzso region with multiple copies of a zzso side zzso This zzso possesses an unusual terminal sugar called zzso followed by three zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Based on the structure of zzso we proposed an zzso zzso for its zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed six zzso genes that could zzso the predicted zzso zzso zzso These genes are transcribed in the same direction and appear to form two zzso We introduced zzso into the zzso zzso zzso that either delete the promoter of the putative upstream, zzso zzso or delete selected genes in both putative zzso zzso produced by strains carrying zzso in the upstream zzso completely lacked or contained much less zzso indicating that this zzso is required for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso Additional experiments confirmed the organization of the zzso zzso and indicated that it is transcribed from a zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is not restricted to zzso zzso as previously zzso
