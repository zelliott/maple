zzso diversity in zzso salt lake, a zzso lake in Iran, was studied by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques, zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso fragments of zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso gene clone library zzso zzso counts obtained zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were similar to total cell abundance in the lake determined by zzso direct count zzso cells zzso The proportion of zzso to zzso in the community zzso by FISH was unexpectedly high and ranged between zzso and zzso We analyzed 101 zzso zzso and found that most belonged to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Eleven bacterial zzso obtained in pure culture were affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso of 100 clones from the eight zzso zzso clone libraries constructed revealed 37 zzso The majority zzso of these sequences were not related to any previously identified zzso Within this sampling effort we most frequently retrieved zzso related to zzso zzso of zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso of bacterial sequences zzso Other zzso groups that were abundant included representatives of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso purple sulfur bacteria of the zzso zzso and zzso
