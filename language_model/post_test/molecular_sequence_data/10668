The identification of individuals zzso for a specific zzso offers advantages for the zzso of molecular mechanisms of zzso disease zzso zzso syndrome is a rare zzso zzso disorder, the molecular basis of which is complicated by significant genetic and clinical zzso The genes associated with both genetic zzso groups, zzso and zzso have been zzso We have previously identified a number of zzso zzso including a single base substitution that introduces a stop zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region for at least one zzso of the zzso gene in a severely affected zzso We now present data confirming the existence of zzso in this patient using a strategy with general zzso zzso cell hybrids were established by fusing patient cells with mouse A9 zzso zzso with zzso 5 specific zzso markers facilitated identification of hybrid clones bearing only one of the distinct zzso zzso zzso of a portion of the human zzso gene in a subset of these hybrids permitted zzso zzso analysis and confirmed the presence of the zzso zzso in both zzso
