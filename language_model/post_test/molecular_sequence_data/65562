We cloned and isolated a zzso zzso designated zzso from zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso protein family that is highly zzso to zzso previously obtained from zzso textile and reported as a zzso responsible for processing of zzso zzso zzso by a procedure similar to that of zzso indeed showed low zzso zzso However, further investigations revealed that the detected zzso activity actually resulted from a trace amount of zzso contamination rather than from zzso zzso This finding led us to rethink the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso they were probably not responsible for the processing of zzso as previously zzso but their real biological functions remained to be zzso
