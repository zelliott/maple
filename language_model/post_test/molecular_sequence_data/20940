zzso zzso is an essential zzso for zzso hormone zzso whose production is primarily limited to the zzso zzso zzso We have previously identified an approximately zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cultured mouse zzso cells, and in the present study provide evidence showing that this transcript is transcribed and translated into a unique protein zzso in the zzso but not the zzso zzso Cloning of zzso from a mouse kidney zzso library showed that zzso starts in the middle of zzso 41 of the zzso gene and continues zzso with the remaining coding sequence of zzso zzso beginning with zzso zzso zzso of this zzso is predicted to yield a protein of zzso zzso acids (40 zzso containing a unique 13 zzso acid sequence serving as a signal zzso followed by a 354 zzso acid segment identical to the zzso end of zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with an zzso directed against the zzso of zzso zzso detected a 40 zzso protein expressed in the zzso zzso with this zzso showed that zzso zzso was localized in zzso and the zzso area of the zzso zzso A part of a zzso transcript was also detected in human zzso and the zzso protein was recognized by zzso from zzso zzso but not from zzso Together these results suggest that a unique low molecular weight zzso of zzso is expressed in the zzso where it could serve both zzso and pathological roles, including that of an zzso
