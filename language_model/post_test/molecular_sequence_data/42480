In order to study zzso from the zzso malaria zzso zzso clones reacting with mouse zzso serum were selected from an expression library of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso such clones were shown to derive from 19 different zzso zzso zzso One of these, zzso zzso zzso has a predicted size of zzso zzso and an observed size of 24 zzso It is located in the zzso zzso membrane of maturing zzso and in the dense zzso of zzso The zzso sequence predicts a highly charged zzso with an zzso signal sequence and a central zzso domain, but no tandem zzso The sequence reported for zzso a previously identified but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to part of the 3' untranslated region in the zzso zzso zzso has many features in common with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
