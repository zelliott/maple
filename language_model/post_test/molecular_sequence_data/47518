The zzso zzso of human respiratory zzso virus zzso contains two overlapping zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso protein of unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso was recovered in which expression of zzso was zzso identifying it as an accessory factor zzso for growth in zzso zzso lacking zzso grew less efficiently than did the zzso parent in zzso with zzso that were reduced 1, zzso during the initial zzso days and zzso by days zzso Compared with zzso virus, the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso knockout virus was reduced 3- to zzso or more for zzso zzso and increased zzso to zzso or more for zzso zzso of the F and G zzso the major zzso zzso and protective zzso was increased in proportion with that of zzso In cells infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased dramatically up to approximately zzso zzso after infection and then leveled off, whereas zzso continued to increase in cells infected with the zzso knockout zzso These findings suggest that zzso mediates a regulatory zzso from zzso to zzso zzso one that provides an initial high level of zzso synthesis followed by a shift in the zzso synthetic program in favor of zzso zzso for zzso zzso With regard to vaccine development, the zzso knockout has a highly desirable zzso in which virus growth is attenuated while gene expression is zzso zzso
