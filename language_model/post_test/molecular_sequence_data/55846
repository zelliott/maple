A new zzso B zzso DNA zzso clone zzso isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso library, was tested for its ability to zzso expression of other zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso cellular sequences and an integrated zzso zzso zzso DNA which covers the region of zzso zzso and the 3' truncated zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso a number of cellular and viral promoters were zzso by zzso and the spectrum of zzso effect was the same as that by the wild type X gene of the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso function of zzso is expressed by the region that encodes a truncated zzso fusion zzso
