T cell acute zzso leukemia zzso is generally considered to be a zzso disorder arising as an expansion of committed zzso zzso The generation of functional T cell zzso zzso genes involves DNA zzso zzso This zzso immature zzso cells to abnormal zzso Previous analysis of the zzso genes strongly suggested the zzso origin of human zzso We present a sensitive zzso analysis of bone zzso zzso V beta transcripts in a case of zzso This study allows the analysis not only of zzso V beta transcripts in tumor cells but also the zzso modification of the global zzso repertoire in the follow-up of clinical specimens from bone zzso zzso Moreover, we used zzso zzso region zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso population for the molecular monitoring of the zzso clone throughout the clinical course of the zzso This molecular fingerprint appears to be a sensitive method to detect minimal residual zzso It shows that zzso regions of rearranged zzso beta genes corresponding to the tumor cells can also be detected at the time of the complete zzso
