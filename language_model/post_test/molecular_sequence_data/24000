zzso zzso and design of zzso centers have been used to determine a set of specific zzso interactions between the zzso zzso a zzso G zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding affinity of the zzso is strongly dependent on the nature of its first and third zzso and on zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso were able to form zzso complexes with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contact of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso was suggested by the binding affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The improved binding affinity of the free zzso analogue of zzso for binding to the zzso zzso revealed an interaction between the zzso group of the zzso and zzso of the zzso The experimental constraints that were obtained were applied for distance geometry modeling of the zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The active zzso of the zzso zzso was calculated using the crystal structure of zzso zzso and published engineered and intrinsic zzso sites and zzso bonds that allow or facilitate zzso of zzso zzso zzso existing in the zzso were applied as additional distance zzso The calculated model of the zzso complex can serve as a zzso of the active state for all zzso zzso It displays a strongly shifted zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso upon its interaction with the zzso zzso the binding pockets of the active and inactive states are not zzso which implies distinct interaction modes of zzso and zzso In the active state, the binding pocket of the zzso is complementary to the previously proposed zzso zzso of zzso
