zzso whorls and other zzso hair patterns are found in a variety of zzso species, including zzso We show here that zzso zzso one member of a large family of integral membrane zzso zzso controls zzso hair patterning in the zzso zzso is expressed in the skin and hair zzso and targeted deletion of the zzso gene produces stereotyped whorls on the hind feet, variable whorls and zzso on the head, and zzso of hairs on the zzso zzso zzso experiments imply that zzso acts locally to control or zzso the zzso hair pattern and that zzso cells rather than zzso are the source of zzso zzso The zzso zzso strongly resembles the zzso and bristle patterning defects observed in zzso zzso zzso These data imply that hair patterning in zzso uses a zzso tissue polarity system similar to the one that patterns the zzso zzso
