zzso at the zzso locus causes zzso a zzso eye condition characterized by iris zzso and a variety of other anterior and zzso eye defects leading to poor zzso This study was performed to identify novel zzso zzso that lead to familial zzso in Indian zzso 

zzso DNA was isolated from affected individuals zzso diagnosed zzso from nine unrelated zzso zzso unaffected family members, and unrelated normal zzso The coding regions of zzso were amplified and subjected to single strand zzso zzso zzso gel analysis, and direct cloning and zzso 

zzso band shifts, indicative of DNA base pair zzso were observed in five of these unrelated zzso Four zzso were shown to be previously zzso zzso or deletions in zzso leading to zzso These new zzso were zzso (in zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso The other nonsense zzso a transition zzso in zzso 9, has been reported previously as a zzso hotspot for zzso in other ethnic zzso All zzso zzso transmitted through zzso individuals in each zzso 

These new deletions and an zzso create zzso which are predicted to introduce premature termination zzso into the zzso reading zzso The genetic zzso carried by affected individuals are predicted to lead to zzso zzso that would segregate in an zzso dominant manner to subsequent zzso This is the first report of the zzso zzso transition from Indian zzso
