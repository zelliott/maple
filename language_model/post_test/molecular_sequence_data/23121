zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fundamental mechanism for controlling a wide range of cellular zzso zzso of membrane embedded proteins results in soluble fragments exerting their function, zzso as zzso factors and thereby regulating gene zzso This process is highly zzso throughout all kingdom of life as are the involved zzso zzso has been described in zzso bacteria and zzso though until recently not in plant zzso Here we describe a zzso membrane zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso family of membrane zzso zzso We show that this zzso is localized in the inner envelope membrane and is essential for plant zzso It could function in a zzso like process regulating the zzso action in the plant zzso nucleus and zzso
