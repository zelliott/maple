A truncated zzso zzso of the plasma membrane zzso pump was expressed in zzso zzso The full-length pump zzso consisted of zzso zzso and the zzso lacked 120 zzso (including the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso To characterize this zzso zzso transport was determined in a zzso zzso zzso was added to increase zzso zzso and specificity was enhanced by adding zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a similar level of expression as zzso and a zzso affinity and zzso transport activity about equal to that of zzso when zzso was zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso binding region of the zzso inhibited the zzso and restored the zzso state of the zzso In these respects, the truncated zzso acted like zzso when zzso had been zzso to cleave a bond between the zzso binding region and the zzso portion of the zzso This indicates that the effects of zzso are due to removal of the zzso zzso and not to zzso of the two zzso Since the truncated zzso was fully active and its zzso zzso resulted in the appearance of the expected zzso and zzso active fragments, we concluded that the zzso portion which is missing cannot be important in synthesis or proper folding of the zzso
