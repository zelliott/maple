To clone the variable region gene of light chain of zzso zzso against human zzso and to analyze the characterization of its zzso sequence as well as zzso acid zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso zzso cells zzso specific zzso zzso zzso against human zzso zzso then zzso zzso into zzso with zzso zzso The variable region of the light chain zzso gene fragments was amplified using zzso chain zzso and further cloned into zzso zzso Easy zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis was done by zzso zzso 

The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso consisted of 321 zzso zzso 107 zzso acid zzso containing four zzso regions zzso and three zzso zzso as well as the typical structure of two zzso zzso The sequence is most zzso to a member of the zzso gene family, and its chain zzso the zzso gene zzso 

The light chain variable region gene of the zzso against human RB was amplified zzso which belongs to the zzso gene family and zzso zzso gene zzso This study lays a good basis for constructing a zzso zzso and for making a new targeted therapeutic agents against zzso
