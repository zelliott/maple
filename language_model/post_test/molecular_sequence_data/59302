For the prevention of zzso B virus zzso infection, zzso zzso zzso against the surface zzso of zzso would offer several advantages over the current human zzso zzso We have developed a humanized zzso with specificity for the zzso surface zzso of zzso and evaluated the zzso activity of the humanized zzso The zzso regions of the heavy and light chains of a zzso zzso zzso zzso were grafted onto the variable regions of a highly zzso human zzso zzso which were then combined with the constant regions of human gamma 1 and zzso zzso The affinity of the resulting humanized zzso zzso was about one tenth that of the zzso zzso The new version zzso of the humanized zzso which was constructed by substituting the zzso framework zzso at position 94 of the zzso with original mouse zzso showed almost the same affinity as that of the zzso zzso The evaluation of the zzso zzso activity of zzso using in zzso infection of adult human zzso primary culture by zzso showed that it had a specific activity that was approximately 1000 times higher than commercially available zzso zzso B immune zzso We expect that the present humanized zzso will be useful in the prevention of zzso zzso
