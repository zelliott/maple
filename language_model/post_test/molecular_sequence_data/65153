zzso zzso for zzso or zzso develop zzso dominant zzso kidney disease, a common genetic disorder characterized by zzso zzso formation and zzso complications such as hypertension and vascular zzso zzso formation requires the zzso zzso of the wild type zzso However, it is unknown whether this zzso mechanism applies to life-threatening vascular zzso which could involve weakening of the zzso lining or surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso encodes a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso severely reduced the zzso of the visceral zzso which was restored by expressing wild type zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso alone on the skeletal muscle was minimal but was exacerbated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso strongly with a zzso zzso zzso causing a synergistic reduction of zzso body wall contraction rate that is normally regulated through zzso zzso during zzso zzso in the skeletal zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso to promote optimal muscle zzso through zzso zzso zzso Further genetic analysis indicated that zzso is strongly zzso for normal zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is a zzso mechanism for optimal muscle performance, our results raise the possibility that zzso of just one zzso copy is sufficient to compromise vascular zzso zzso and function in zzso zzso patients, thus explaining their increased zzso to hypertension and vascular zzso
