The binding of peptides to zzso class II molecules is zzso in part by a zzso array of zzso hydrogen zzso We have evaluated the consequences of zzso the hydrogen bond between zzso of the class II zzso and bound zzso These studies revealed that zzso zzso rates were accelerated by factors ranging to zzso The sensitivity of a zzso to loss of the hydrogen bond is zzso correlated with the inherent kinetic stability of the zzso zzso The same relationship has been observed between inherent kinetic stability and the zzso to zzso Given that the rate enhancement observed for zzso class II zzso protein zzso at position 81 in the zzso is comparable with zzso rates for other class II zzso we suggest that zzso could function by stabilizing a zzso intermediate in which one or more hydrogen bonds between the zzso and zzso such as that contributed by the zzso hydrogen bond, are zzso
