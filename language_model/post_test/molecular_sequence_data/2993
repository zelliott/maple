The zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso is essential for the transition from female zzso to zzso zzso Its zzso and, zzso function is under zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso protein is zzso and zzso in zzso Upon egg zzso zzso is partially zzso and acquires the ability to enter zzso Its function is first detected at this zzso To investigate the zzso retention machinery that keeps zzso from entering zzso we used affinity zzso and zzso overlay zzso to identify zzso proteins that associate with zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that is also an zzso zzso binds to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind specifically and directly in zzso and are present in a zzso complex in the zzso zzso zzso protein can be zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso in zzso This zzso increases zzso binding to zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso complex retains zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In response to egg zzso zzso is partially zzso and its binding to the zzso complex is zzso zzso some zzso zzso from the complex and enters zzso zzso with this model, decreasing zzso levels partially suppress a zzso Ya zzso zzso
