zzso zzso are valuable tools for generating zzso fragments and in sequence determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso III is known to cleave the linkages between zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso as the primary sites and the linkages between zzso zzso or zzso and zzso acid as secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs as a minor component in zzso and it has been associated with various zzso Here we investigate the specificity of zzso zzso III toward the zzso linkage using a zzso zzso of high purity and as zzso the partially zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso strain and derived zzso The specificity of zzso III toward the zzso linkage is deduced by sequencing of the zzso products using zzso mass zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrate that under controlled conditions for partial zzso zzso III does not act at the zzso linkage, whereas zzso is zzso Even under forced conditions for exhaustive zzso the zzso linkage is only partly zzso It is this property of zzso III that has enabled the isolation of a unique, zzso zzso zzso zzso from HS and from partially zzso zzso zzso It was unexpected that zzso fragments were also detected among the zzso products of the zzso zzso zzso It is possible that these are products of an additional zzso activity of zzso III, although other mechanisms cannot be completely ruled zzso
