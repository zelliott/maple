zzso zinc finger protein zzso binds to zzso zzso in immature zzso to form a zzso zzso storage zzso To determine the role of individual zinc fingers of the protein in this zzso binding activity, a series of deletion and substitution zzso of zzso were zzso The effects of the various zzso on the zzso binding activity of zzso were determined using a quantitative equilibrium binding zzso The results indicate that zinc fingers 1 and 4 of zzso are essential for the binding of the protein to zzso zzso In the case of finger 1, four zzso acids key to zzso binding are found on the same face of the zzso while in the case of finger 4, two key zzso are clustered at the start of the zzso The similarities and differences in the mechanisms by which fingers 1 and 4 of zzso interact with zzso zzso are compared to the interaction of the zinc fingers of zzso zzso factor zzso with zzso zzso
