zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an intermediate filament zzso protein specific to central nervous system zzso zzso It has been the subject of intense interest due to its association with neurodegenerative diseases, and because of growing evidence that IF proteins not only zzso cellular structure, but also cellular zzso Moreover, zzso has a family of zzso zzso apparently more complex than that of other zzso IF zzso consistent with it possessing a range of functional and structural zzso The gene consists of 9 zzso and to date all zzso associated with 3' end zzso have been identified from modifications within zzso 7, resulting in the generation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To better understand the nature and functional significance of variation in this region, we used a zzso multiple zzso approach to identify zzso zzso This is the first successful application of this method to a single zzso has previously only been used in zzso zzso We identified several highly or moderately zzso regions throughout the zzso zzso regions, including untranslated regions and regulatory features, consistent with the biology of zzso Several putative zzso features were also identified, including a possible new zzso We then integrated multiple zzso analyses on both the DNA and protein sequences from the zzso rat and human, showing that the major zzso zzso has highly zzso structure and features across the three species, whereas the minor zzso zzso and zzso have low conservation of structure and features at the zzso 3' end, both relative to each other and relative to zzso The overall picture suggests distinct and tightly regulated functions for the 3' end zzso consistent with complex zzso zzso The results illustrate a zzso approach for zzso zzso zzso families, using both DNA and protein zzso
