The development of a stable zzso zzso was attempted by exchanging whole zzso between two native structural zzso zzso and zzso because the zzso specificity of zzso is valuable from the standpoint of its application but its activity is zzso whereas zzso is zzso The domain zzso obtained indicated that the zzso structures zzso three zzso were likely to be mainly associated with zzso recognition, and the fourth domain, the basic domain, is likely to be mainly associated with zzso zzso A combination of the leaf zzso of zzso and the basic domain of zzso attained a sufficient level of practical use as an artificial zzso zzso because the resulting zzso had both stability and zzso zzso However, the levels of stability and specificity were slightly lower than those of the respective zzso from which they were zzso
