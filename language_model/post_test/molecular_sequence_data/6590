zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso virus infection have been difficult to investigate due to the strong zzso effects exhibited by infectious zzso virus in zzso In order to circumvent zzso we used predicted zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso This was done by screening the structural proteins of zzso virus for zzso zzso motifs with zzso in position 2 and zzso in position zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso pp zzso from the zzso protein were zzso and used to expand zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with synthetic peptides was restricted to zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso We conclude that this method is a useful tool to demonstrate memory zzso zzso in zzso adults and to evaluate the role of structural proteins in zzso responses against zzso
