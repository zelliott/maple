Eight zzso strains originally isolated from soil and plant samples were studied to determine their zzso zzso All zzso produced branching zzso zzso but no distinct aerial zzso Relatively short chains of zzso spores (10 to 30 spores per zzso were borne on the tips of zzso arising directly from the zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the zzso with the exception of the zzso profile, coincided with those of members of the family zzso zzso Stanton, Simpson, and zzso zzso Furthermore, the results of a zzso analysis performed with zzso zzso support the conclusion that the zzso should be classified in this zzso The zzso differed from members of the constituent zzso of the zzso in zzso characteristics and zzso zzso zzso we propose a new zzso for the zzso zzso The type species and type strain are zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
