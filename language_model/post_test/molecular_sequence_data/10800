zzso with replicating virus leads to an increase in T cell numbers within zzso zzso that drain the site of zzso This increase has been associated with a zzso proliferation of bystander cells, with only a minority thought to be directed to the infectious zzso Such an assumption is largely based on precursor zzso T zzso zzso zzso using limiting dilution zzso Recently, studies using more advanced molecular approaches have suggested that such functionally derived precursor zzso considerably underestimate the proportion of T cells specific for the zzso under zzso We have defined T cell zzso sequences characteristic of zzso populations directed to a dominant zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso B zzso In this investigation, we used this zzso signature as a probe to directly monitor changes occurring within zzso zzso draining the sites of active infection with zzso We found that although zzso zzso zzso T cell numbers increase as a consequence of zzso infection, the majority of these cells are small resting cells that are not enriched for zzso zzso In contrast, a significant proportion of activated T cells are highly enriched for zzso bearing zzso zzso Our results are therefore consistent with a zzso migration of zzso precursors into the zzso zzso draining the site of infection, followed by the zzso and proliferation of the zzso subset that normally makes up a small proportion of the zzso T cell zzso
