zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso inflammation of the zzso To better understand the inflammatory process occurring during zzso we investigated in this study the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso of mice by quantitative reverse zzso Our results demonstrate that among the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso protein 10 zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein 1 beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso were strongly zzso in infected zzso mice, which correlated with the zzso zzso results showing zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Our in zzso data showed that zzso zzso cells infected by zzso zzso or zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso produce a pattern of zzso zzso similar to that observed in zzso suggesting that these cells may take part in the initial production of zzso In order to identify the zzso responsible for the recruitment of the inflammatory cells leading to a protective immune response, we compared the patterns of zzso expression in a healing zzso mouse model and a zzso zzso knockout zzso mouse model of zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso response was altered for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso while the three zzso zzso zzso zzso studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were strongly zzso These results are consistent with the zzso recruitment observed in the zzso zzso of zzso mice at day 9 zzso but are not consistent with the hypothesis that these cells play an important role in the resolution of the zzso On the contrary, the altered response of zzso responsible for the recruitment of zzso and T cells in zzso mice suggests that these two populations may be critical in the development of a protective immune zzso
