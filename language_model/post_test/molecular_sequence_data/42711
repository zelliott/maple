From the peripheral blood of a patient with chronic zzso leukemia zzso we generated a zzso line and clones which recognized zzso zzso The line comprised zzso clones which responded to the zzso as well as to zzso zzso virus zzso B cells in an zzso zzso In addition, the line comprised clones which were zzso and showed no zzso against zzso B cells and against zzso peripheral blood zzso cells obtained during zzso The zzso response of the zzso zzso clone was inhibited by zzso zzso to zzso the major zzso complex zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso binds a zzso zzso which is recognized by zzso T cells in an zzso zzso zzso Such a zzso may serve as a target for zzso
