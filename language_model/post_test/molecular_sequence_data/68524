The cartilage zzso zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso sites which act as zzso for the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we examined the zzso processing of these zzso zzso for subsequent addition of zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and newly zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso addition, whereas zzso was not zzso This indicated that the linkage regions must be processed to zzso but do not require further modification to zzso In both control and zzso cells one or two zzso zzso per zzso were modified with zzso containing 4-6 repeating zzso zzso Moreover, a single short chain was added either to the zzso or the zzso branch in control cultures, whereas only the zzso branch was zzso in the presence of zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso II zzso products of the zzso chains zzso in both culture conditions showed that only about zzso of the zzso zzso and less than zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso were zzso with zzso These findings are discussed in relation to the regulation of zzso zzso and the likely influence of zzso structure on the zzso interactions and turnover of zzso
