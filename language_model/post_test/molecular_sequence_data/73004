zzso and side chain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with 125 zzso per zzso have been assigned by zzso zzso methods with the zzso and zzso zzso The secondary structure in solution of zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and differences in chemical shifts of backbone H zzso C zzso C zzso and CO zzso from random zzso values, consists of two zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five turns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus zzso consists of zzso zzso 38% zzso and zzso zzso The remaining 20 zzso zzso are assumed to form zzso With the exception of a parallel interaction between zzso 1 and 7, all zzso interactions are zzso forming both a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in which the first strand is interrupted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the free zzso with the zzso analog zzso zzso revealed zzso changes in backbone zzso and zzso chemical shifts throughout the zzso with zzso effects on zzso I zzso zzso 1 of the zzso zzso the loop between zzso 3 and zzso 3 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso 7 zzso zzso of the zzso thus indicating the secondary structural components involved in steroid zzso These effects include regions near the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which function as the general acid and base, respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso indicate that the steroid binds near zzso 1 and 3, which form one wall of the active site, and one end of the zzso zzso which forms the other zzso zzso with these zzso zzso a steroid that is zzso at its zzso end zzso zzso Westbrook, zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso induced the selective zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of cross zzso of zzso at the end of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso due to the proximity of the zzso radical to the backbone zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso thus confirming the location of the D ring of the bound steroid and defining the mouth of the active zzso
