Native human zzso factor 4 zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso known for its zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of native zzso in solution show the presence of zzso zzso consistent with the formation of zzso zzso as observed in the X-ray crystal structure of both human and bovine zzso A zzso zzso of zzso (called zzso which zzso the first 11 zzso zzso for the first eight zzso from zzso zzso forms zzso zzso with essentially the same zzso binding activity as native zzso The solution structure of zzso has been investigated by using two- and three-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso and zzso simulated zzso molecular zzso As with other members of the zzso zzso family whose structures are known, the zzso zzso zzso consists of a mostly zzso zzso zzso zzso onto which is folded an zzso zzso zzso and a less periodic zzso zzso Although zzso substitution with the less zzso zzso sequence most affects the zzso structure relative to native zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso AB zzso stability is weakened as reflected in reduced equilibrium association binding zzso
