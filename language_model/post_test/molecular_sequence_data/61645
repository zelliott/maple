zzso is a zzso zzso fusion protein used for zzso delivery of an zzso to cancer zzso After clearance from normal zzso the zzso zzso is used to activate a subsequently administered zzso to give a potent zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to cancer deposits in zzso but we propose that its therapeutic potential could be improved by zzso obtained by expression in zzso zzso zzso could enhance clearance from healthy tissue and result in better zzso tissue zzso To test this, zzso zzso was expressed and zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein was zzso active and showed enhanced clearance from normal zzso in zzso Furthermore, it showed effective tumor zzso This favorable zzso pattern was analyzed by tandem mass zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso experiments proved essential for this zzso zzso showed that of the three potential zzso sites only two were consistently occupied with zzso zzso zzso appeared the most zzso populated with zzso carbohydrates extending from 5 to 13 units in zzso zzso was found only in its zzso zzso There was less zzso at zzso which was zzso with zzso structures ranging from 8 to 10 zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso were not zzso
