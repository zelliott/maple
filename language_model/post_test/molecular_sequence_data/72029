zzso zzso have been found in the zzso zzso of zzso We now show that in zzso zzso a zzso zzso as well as a short chain zzso and a zzso zzso are expressed specifically or zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso The zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggests that they play an important role in zzso In addition, we describe five zzso zzso belonging to two zzso All five zzso contain a putative zzso domain at their C zzso as is the case for zzso zzso where it is required for zzso zzso The primary sequence of the C zzso including part of the zzso domain, differs between the two families but is highly zzso not only within each zzso family, but also between the members of one of the zzso families and zzso zzso The partial overlap of the zzso primary sequence with the zzso domain suggests that this part of the protein is involved in specific interactions occurring at the membrane zzso The presence of different C zzso in the two zzso families suggests that they interact with different targets, one of which is zzso between zzso and zzso
