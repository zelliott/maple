The zzso DNA pilot protein H forms an zzso zzso tube during zzso However, zzso are incorporated into 12 zzso assembly zzso which become the zzso zzso zzso The zzso N zzso a predicted zzso zzso is not represented in the crystal zzso To investigate its functions, a series of absolute and conditional lethal zzso were zzso The absolute lethal zzso a deletion and a triple zzso were efficiently incorporated into zzso particles lacking zzso The conditional lethal zzso bearing zzso zzso and zzso zzso point zzso were more amenable to further zzso zzso particles containing the zzso protein can be generated at the zzso temperature and subsequently analyzed at the restrictive zzso The characterized zzso zzso directly affected host cell zzso In contrast, zzso defects were zzso during zzso zzso zzso at zzso temperature were indistinguishable from zzso particles in their ability to recognize host cells and deliver zzso One zzso zzso an zzso zzso synthesis zzso Although the zzso protein was efficiently incorporated into zzso particles at elevated temperature, the progeny appeared to be zzso trapped in a zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso in the N zzso can lead to H protein zzso albeit at zzso levels, and subsequently affect particle zzso All zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso rescued by the presence of the zzso H zzso Thus, mixed H protein zzso are functional during DNA zzso zzso and dominant zzso may temporally approximate H protein functions, occurring before or after zzso has gone to zzso
