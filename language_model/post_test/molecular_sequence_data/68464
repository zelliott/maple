zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso we recently isolated, shows rapid zzso growth even though it lacks a respiratory zzso Thus, the zzso consumption of zzso produced during zzso and zzso zzso should be especially important for maintenance of zzso zzso balance in this zzso We zzso a zzso functional as zzso zzso from zzso growing zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso composed of a zzso zzso zzso containing 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen zzso with zzso as the preferred electron donor and exhibits no activity with zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was cloned by using a specific zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso identities to the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso have a respiratory chain and grow well under zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso having no respiratory chain, grow equally well under both zzso and zzso conditions, which zzso these two zzso zzso zzso which are zzso bacteria, are zzso distant from zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The above findings, however, suggest that the zzso functional as zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso recently, with only small changes leading to their functional zzso
