zzso of domestic cats with zzso zzso virus zzso is an important model system for studying human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection due to numerous similarities in zzso induced by these two zzso However, many molecular aspects of zzso replication remain poorly zzso It is well established that zzso use short zzso motifs in zzso known as late zzso to zzso cellular zzso sorting machinery and promote virus release from infected zzso For example, the zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso a component of the zzso sorting complex required for transport I zzso A zzso zzso motif in zzso infectious anemia virus zzso and a related sequence in zzso bind the zzso sorting factor zzso In this study we sought to identify and characterize zzso late zzso and zzso cellular machinery involved in zzso zzso We determined that zzso of a zzso motif in zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso each inhibited zzso zzso We also observed direct binding of zzso zzso peptides to zzso In contrast, zzso of a potential zzso motif in zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso Similarly, expression of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso did not disrupt zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides showed no affinity for zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso relies predominantly on a zzso zzso motif in the C zzso of zzso to promote virus release in zzso cells, and this budding mechanism is highly zzso in zzso zzso
