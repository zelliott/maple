Some of the early genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso were hypothesized to function in the zzso of host zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso were cloned and zzso E22 showed no similarity to any known zzso while zzso a highly zzso zzso showed significant similarity only to other similarly zzso zzso Each gene was immediately downstream of a very active early zzso Each was expressed actively during the first few minutes of infection and was then rapidly shut off and its zzso rapidly zzso An zzso nonsense zzso severely retarded the degradation of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso coli, resulted in the zzso of host DNA, zzso and protein zzso and prevented colony zzso However, the zzso nonsense zzso caused no measurable decrease in either burst size or host zzso during infection and, in fact, caused an increased burst size at high zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso is one of several genes involved in host zzso that its function is zzso both for host zzso and for zzso zzso and that its zzso function is not entirely specific to host zzso
