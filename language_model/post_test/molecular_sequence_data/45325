Minor zzso zzso zzso are peptides zzso by zzso genes that are presented by major zzso complex zzso molecules and recognized by T cells in recipients of zzso zzso cell zzso Here we report that an alternative transcript of the zzso nuclear element 1 zzso gene encodes a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso that is selectively expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is entirely zzso within a unique zzso not present in other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells demonstrates that differential zzso recognition is due to a single zzso zzso within the zzso zzso that replaces an zzso zzso with a translation termination zzso The zzso transcript that encodes the zzso is expressed at high levels in resting zzso B cells and zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells, and at significantly lower levels in activated B zzso zzso of zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso stimulation decreases expression of the zzso zzso transcript and zzso increases expression of zzso transcripts lacking the zzso zzso These studies suggest distinct roles for different zzso zzso in resting compared with activated zzso cells, and identify zzso as a potential therapeutic target in zzso
