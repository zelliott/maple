At present, the zzso zzso zzso zzso provide the only information on folding of zzso in the core zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes all and only those Alzheimer's disease zzso core paired zzso filaments zzso zzso which terminate at zzso Using zzso zzso of the core zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso represented only one component of the structure recognized by zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso of the core zzso were generated to identify assembled parts of this zzso zzso We localized two zzso close components in the region zzso zzso and zzso contributing to formation of the structure identified by zzso zzso Thus, the spatial proximity of three zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso represents constraints for zzso folding of the core zzso zzso Since zzso represents a compelling drug target in zzso structural knowledge presented could contribute to zzso drug zzso
