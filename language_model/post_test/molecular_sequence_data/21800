zzso sludge plants, sporadically suffers malfunction due to the proliferation of zzso bacteria mainly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso was applied to study the distribution of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of mixed liquor were collected from three zzso activated sludge plants that were experiencing zzso biological zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso genes revealed the dominance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso species zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso exhibited zzso to zzso similarity at zzso zzso The zzso zzso results showed that there was an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso copies with respect to the total bacterial zzso zzso gene in zzso sludge samples with the highest being zzso and lowest being zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso samples was observed throughout the year but was lower during winter and its presence was significantly higher in zzso samples, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This approach could help to zzso and confirm the existence of genetically diverse indigenous zzso zzso in zzso samples and can be used as an indicator of forthcoming zzso zzso
