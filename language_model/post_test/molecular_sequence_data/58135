zzso diversity enables class zzso molecules to present a diverse repertoire of peptides to the T cell zzso This diversity is thought to be generated by zzso between class I zzso We have found that two class zzso zzso zzso exhibit extremely high sequence diversity, even higher than class zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso suggest that this sequence diversity was generated by zzso between zzso genes and other class I zzso The relatively high expression of zzso in the zzso may be significant and perhaps suggests a novel role for a zzso product in the education and selection of the T cell zzso
