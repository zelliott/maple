We report a new strategy for the synthesis of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso of specified zzso chain zzso and zzso In this zzso approach, which we term zzso directional zzso zzso short gene segments are seamlessly combined in tandem using zzso DNA zzso The resulting larger genes can then be zzso combined until a gene of a desired length is zzso This approach is modular and can be used to combine genes zzso different zzso zzso We used this method to zzso three different libraries of zzso zzso zzso each library encodes a unique zzso sequence with systematically varied molecular zzso We also combined two of these sequences to produce a block zzso Because the zzso properties of zzso depend on their sequence and chain zzso the synthesis of these zzso provides an example of the importance of precise control over these parameters that is afforded by zzso
