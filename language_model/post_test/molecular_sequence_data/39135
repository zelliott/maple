The zzso zzso has a zzso divergent zzso zzso which contains a short template for zzso DNA zzso To understand how zzso zzso zzso in zzso aspects of zzso zzso we studied a zzso secondary structure adjacent to the zzso zzso of this structure caused DNA synthesis to proceed beyond the normal template boundary, resulting in altered zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular growth zzso zzso zzso restored normal zzso zzso Thus, the zzso structure, rather than its zzso specifies the template zzso This study reveals a specific function for an zzso structure in the zzso action of zzso
