The composition of cell surface zzso is largely dependent on the relative activities of zzso resident zzso In the brain of birds and zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abound at late stages of development and in the adult, due to the relatively high activities of the zzso beta zzso zzso and the zzso zzso beta 1, zzso zzso relative to that of zzso alpha zzso zzso Unlike brain, the mature zzso neural zzso abundantly expresses the simple zzso zzso in relation to complex zzso due to the low activity of zzso and zzso relative to zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a mouse zzso zzso that drives the synthesis of an zzso protein of molecular mass 43 zzso which was zzso active and localized to the zzso complex in zzso cell zzso Using this zzso as a probe, it was found that zzso is coded by a single gene located in zzso 17, and that the coding sequence is contained in a single zzso The expression of the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highest in zzso which also showed elevated zzso zzso In the zzso neural zzso zzso zzso increased after day 3, maintained high levels of expression by days zzso and then decreased to initial values by day zzso The zzso pattern of zzso expression was temporally zzso with that of zzso activity zzso indicating that this zzso is under zzso control in the neural zzso
