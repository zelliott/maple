A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a hot spring of zzso zzso zzso Peninsula, zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso regular zzso zzso zzso in zzso The temperature range for growth at pH zzso was zzso degrees C, with an optimum at 85 degrees zzso The pH range for growth at 85 degrees C was zzso with an optimum at pH zzso Growth was not observed at or below 6 degrees C or at or above 90 degrees C, as well as at or below pH zzso and at or above pH zzso The isolate fermented a wide range of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sulfur was not essential for growth, but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 and 120 zzso zzso localized on the cell zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparison indicated that strain zzso was affiliated with the zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with other zzso species was zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be the most closely related zzso Based on the data from the zzso analysis and the zzso properties of the novel zzso strain zzso should be classified as representing a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
