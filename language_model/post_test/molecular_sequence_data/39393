Nuclear zzso signals zzso target proteins into the nucleus through zzso interactions with nuclear import zzso Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the correlation between zzso zzso affinity and the zzso distribution of zzso cargo proteins between the zzso and the nucleus of live zzso which reflects the relative import rates of various zzso zzso We find that there is a complicated, but zzso quantitative relationship between the affinity of an zzso for the import zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the cargo in the zzso This analysis takes into consideration the impact of protein zzso In addition, the hypothetical upper limit to an zzso affinity for the receptors is explored through genetic zzso Overall, our results indicate that there is a correlation between the binding affinity of an zzso cargo for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the import rate for this zzso This zzso however, is not maintained for zzso that bind to the zzso zzso with very weak or very strong zzso
