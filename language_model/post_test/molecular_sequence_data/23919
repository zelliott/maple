zzso and zzso zzso contain several zzso sites, and the zzso acting at position 32 had not been identified in zzso zzso By combining genetic and zzso zzso we demonstrate that two zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso formation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acts mostly in zzso and zzso is strictly zzso This is the first case reported so far of two distinct zzso modification zzso acting at the same position but present in two different zzso This zzso may be the consequence of a gene fusion that occurred during zzso zzso Indeed, zzso displays two distinct zzso activities involved in completely unrelated zzso its zzso domain has a zzso activity required for zzso zzso in the zzso whereas its zzso domain carries the zzso zzso zzso has only a zzso activity and contains a characteristic zzso targeting sequence at its N zzso These results are discussed in terms of zzso zzso
