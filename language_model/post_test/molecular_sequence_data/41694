Emerging evidence has suggested that zzso zzso receptors zzso are an important molecular target in the treatment of numerous neurological zzso zzso zzso is a medicinal plant with positive neurological zzso In this study, we showed that zzso a major zzso component of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso current zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso The zzso effect was neither zzso nor zzso zzso Moreover, zzso selectively inhibited zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso the zzso sensitivity of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that a zzso at position 59 of the zzso zzso is critical for the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a decline of zzso zzso expression during spinal zzso development, the degree of zzso zzso by zzso decreased with prolonged culture of rat spinal zzso horn zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso are novel molecular targets of zzso which may zzso its pharmaceutical effects in the central nervous zzso
