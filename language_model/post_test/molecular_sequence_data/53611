zzso zzso proteins zzso bind to zzso and are proposed to link this zzso network to other zzso zzso We are interested in zzso since this protein is enriched in zzso zzso and may operate in the control of zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso is characterized by two zzso zzso zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso This head domain is connected to the zzso tail through a long zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso as a single domain in other proteins involved in zzso based transport and zzso such as zzso Here we provide evidence that efficient binding of zzso to zzso is sensitive to zzso and is not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso alone, but requires the presence of the zzso zzso rich regions in addition to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso initially accumulates at the zzso ends of zzso and zzso with zzso indicating that both proteins mark growing zzso zzso However, when expressed at higher levels, zzso and zzso affect the zzso network zzso This might be partly due to the divergent zzso of the two zzso We demonstrate that, similar to zzso zzso forms zzso which, at least in zzso are linked by zzso zzso zzso of zzso however, is specific in that it controls the zzso bundling capacity of certain zzso zzso zzso zzso both similar and specific mechanisms appear to regulate the zzso of zzso as well as their binding to zzso
