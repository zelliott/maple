zzso coli generalized zzso utilizing the zzso zzso zzso pathway, requires large stretches zzso zzso of complete DNA sequence zzso In contrast, we have found that the zzso zzso can promote zzso between DNA with only short stretches of zzso A zzso containing 10 partially zzso direct repeats was zzso by zzso with specific restriction zzso After zzso a zzso zzso host was able to zzso the zzso by zzso between partially zzso direct repeat zzso zzso occurred in regions of as little as 6 zzso of perfect zzso zzso was enhanced in the regions adjacent to restriction sites used to zzso the zzso consistent with a role of zzso breaks in promoting zzso A mechanism is proposed in which the zzso zzso zzso produces 3' zzso ends from the zzso zzso These pair with other sequences of partial zzso zzso zzso in the sequences zzso the actual join serve to stabilize this zzso zzso zzso is completed by a process of zzso and zzso This zzso mechanism requires less zzso to stabilize zzso than the degree of zzso needed for mechanisms involving strand zzso Its role in nature may be to increase zzso diversity, for example, by enhancing zzso between zzso and regions of the bacterial zzso
