The zzso zzso zzso is detected in extracts of monkey zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein implicated in control of gene zzso and DNA zzso These complexes can be zzso from cell zzso using zzso zzso to either zzso alpha or zzso The zzso zzso complexes contain a form of zzso alpha with extensive zzso zzso as demonstrated following expression of zzso alpha zzso fused to a zzso acid zzso zzso Human zzso zzso expressed as a zzso zzso fusion zzso specifically binds to the zzso form of zzso with an affinity as high as that of zzso large zzso In the absence of DNA, zzso zzso alpha binds to zzso an zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso coli, containing the zzso binding domain, to form zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso alpha recognition element zzso these zzso zzso high zzso of zzso prevent zzso alpha binding to zzso Through use of a series of deletion zzso the DNA binding activity of zzso alpha is localized to a series of modular zzso acid zzso zzso binding involves a zzso alpha region with limited zzso to the zzso region of zzso large zzso zzso of zzso alpha to zzso the zzso portion of zzso is inhibited by a synthetic zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso
