A new, efficient and simple method based on zzso anchor zzso has been developed that allows for the generation of an zzso library from which the zzso ends in many zzso can be zzso Random zzso are used to prime zzso zzso zzso for the first strand synthesis of a zzso library, and a modified zzso anchor is then zzso to the 3' end of the zzso using T4 zzso zzso The library can then be used to amplify the zzso end of any zzso expressed in the zzso The efficiency and utility of this method has been demonstrated by amplification of three human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso
