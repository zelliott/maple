zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso repression of important regulators that are involved in many signaling zzso zzso and zzso are related proteins that form complexes with zzso and zzso zzso to induce local zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso is substantially smaller than zzso lacking an zzso domain of approximately 1,000 zzso that are present in zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso which contains an zzso sequence that shows striking similarity with zzso As in zzso this zzso domain also zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso expression is regulated during cell cycle progression and zzso transcripts are present in many embryonic zzso These data redefine a structurally and functionally more related nuclear zzso zzso family and suggest an additional role for zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression in diverse signaling zzso
