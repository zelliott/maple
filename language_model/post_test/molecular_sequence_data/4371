The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA segment, located between map zzso 100 and 92 in the zzso of zzso zzso type 3 zzso was zzso The segment includes the entire early region 4 zzso and the right zzso terminal repeat zzso There were two zzso boxes and one zzso zzso signal on the 1 zzso zzso searches of the zzso data base for the predicted zzso acid sequences revealed that, of the eight open reading frames zzso on the 1 zzso and four zzso on the r zzso only zzso 8 on the 1 strand showed zzso with the 34 zzso zzso protein of human zzso types 2, 12 and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso from the zzso region of zzso began 4 h after infection, peaked at 8 h and declined after 10 zzso before DNA replication began 16 h after zzso The zzso region of zzso was further characterized by zzso and 3' end mapping of the zzso zzso
