zzso were carried out to determine zzso protein zzso domain fragments which exhibit a characteristic zzso mobility shift noted with zzso protein zzso in response to serum and zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a zzso and zzso shift in gel mobility similar to that noted with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited a similar shift in gel mobility while the zzso mobility of the zzso zzso zzso remained zzso These results suggest that zzso within the 33 zzso zzso portion of zzso which occur independently of association with Ras may be responsible for the band shift observed with serum and zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso
