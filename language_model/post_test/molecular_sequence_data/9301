zzso is a zzso zzso and constitutes the bitter component in bitter almond zzso zzso zzso concentration increases in the course of fruit zzso The zzso zzso is the precursor of zzso zzso may be zzso to hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso by the action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or be zzso to form zzso The tissue and cellular zzso of zzso was determined during fruit development in two sweet and two bitter almond zzso using a specific zzso toward zzso zzso studies on sections of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso proteins is dependent on the stage of fruit development, shifting between zzso and zzso in opposite patterns in sweet and bitter zzso Two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in a sweet and a bitter almond zzso Both zzso are zzso identical on the zzso level, and their zzso proteins are zzso identical to each zzso In addition, zzso and zzso display zzso and zzso zzso identity to zzso from black cherry zzso zzso Both proteins were predicted to contain an zzso signal zzso with the size of 26 zzso acid zzso for zzso and 22 zzso for zzso The zzso activity and the zzso of the respective proteins in zzso differ between zzso This implies that there might be different zzso of zzso available in the seed for zzso synthesis and that these differences may determine whether the mature almond develops into bitter or zzso
