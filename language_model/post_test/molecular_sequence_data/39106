zzso A zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso incorporated into the zzso enables core zzso and zzso release and consequently plays a critical role in the viral replication zzso zzso specifically interacts with a single exposed loop of the zzso zzso zzso domain via a network of nine hydrogen bonds which mainly implicates a zzso zzso of the zzso As previously reported, the corresponding linear zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso with a low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso 220 zzso but a potentially useful selectivity for zzso relative to zzso another abundant zzso On the basis of X-ray structures of zzso zzso complexes, we generated a series of modified peptides in order to probe the zzso of the interaction and hence to select a zzso zzso displaying a higher affinity than the zzso domain of zzso We zzso a series of zzso to test the energetic contribution of zzso acids besides the zzso zzso In particular the importance of the zzso zzso for the interaction was zzso We also investigated the influence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing either zzso zzso in place of the zzso zzso or substitution of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso group displayed increased zzso Combination of both modifications gave the most potent competitor zzso zzso which has a higher affinity for zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso than the entire zzso protein zzso zzso 16 zzso 4 zzso and a very low affinity for zzso Some of our results strongly suggest that the title compound is not a zzso of zzso and interacts zzso in the trans zzso
