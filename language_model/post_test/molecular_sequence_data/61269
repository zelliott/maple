The sequence of zzso an 18 zzso bee zzso zzso encloses all the information required for the correct zzso folding into the zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso each containing a pair of zzso zzso replacing the related zzso were zzso to mimic the three possible zzso zzso with two crossed, zzso or consecutive zzso zzso zzso experiments clearly revealed that the zzso potential of zzso prevails over the sequence zzso structural information for proper folding of zzso Thus, zzso can be used as a new device to generate productive and zzso folding zzso of peptides and zzso In fact, zzso are selectively reduced in presence of the zzso and the zzso features derived from these zzso as well as from the three-dimensional zzso structures of the zzso zzso with their zzso networks of zzso bridges allowed to gain further insight into the subtle driving forces for the correct folding of zzso that mainly derive from local zzso zzso
