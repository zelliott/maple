The aim of this study is to investigate the role of zzso and respiratory zzso virus in the cause of chronic zzso media with zzso by use of the zzso chain reaction for zzso The zzso chain reaction has proved to be more sensitive and specific than viral cultures and zzso in the detection of viruses in other zzso zzso and respiratory zzso virus were chosen because these viruses have been the most commonly isolated viruses in middle ear zzso in studies using other zzso The zzso zzso total) were zzso collected from 88 children undergoing zzso and ventilation tube placement for chronic zzso media with zzso Nine zzso specimens were positive for zzso by the zzso chain reaction, and 13 zzso were positive for respiratory zzso virus by the zzso chain zzso Only one zzso was positive for zzso and respiratory zzso virus by viral culture and zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso chain reaction can be used to detect zzso and respiratory zzso virus in chronic middle ear zzso and that zzso is more sensitive than viral culture and zzso zzso
