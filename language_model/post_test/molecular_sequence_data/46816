zzso is a zzso zzso protein that binds to the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of the adapter protein zzso In this study, we isolated zzso coding for rat zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from various rat zzso and cell lines showed a major transcript of about 7 zzso which was present at the highest level in zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence zzso from the zzso zzso of rat zzso with the human form showed zzso sequence zzso The principal difference was the presence of an additional 51 zzso acids in the rat zzso sequence after the fifth zzso zzso This difference may be attributable to alternative zzso of the primary zzso This interpretation was supported by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso which resulted in two products differing by 153 zzso The zzso analysis of zzso from various rat zzso showed that the relative expression levels of the two zzso forms were zzso The form of zzso with the zzso of 51 zzso acids (named zzso was present in rat zzso at a high level and, to a lesser extent, in brain, but it was not seen (or was present at a very low zzso in other rat zzso and certain rat and mouse cell zzso This expression pattern of the zzso form was confirmed by Northern zzso using the insert region as a zzso The zzso form, without the zzso of 51 zzso zzso was present in almost all rat zzso except zzso and in cell lines of zzso zzso or human zzso Thus, in rat cells, we have identified a novel zzso zzso of zzso The expression pattern indicates that the form of zzso described here is likely to serve a zzso or zzso zzso zzso
