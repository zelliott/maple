Among zzso zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso family have the most sophisticated zzso design that includes a complex zzso tail zzso The zzso generally have larger zzso than the other zzso zzso Relatively few zzso zzso those with a zzso size of less than 50 zzso such as those of the zzso group, have been analyzed in zzso Here we report on the zzso sequencing and zzso characterization of a new group of such zzso that zzso a diverse range of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso 56, zzso zzso zzso 138 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This group of dwarf zzso shares an identical zzso zzso characterized by usually short zzso tails, and have zzso sizes of approximately 45 zzso Although their zzso sequences are variable in their zzso zzso and host zzso zzso presumably reflecting differing lifestyles and zzso their structural and zzso zzso have been zzso constrained by their zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis reveals that these zzso along with related zzso zzso form a new coherent group within the zzso The results presented in this communication support the hypothesis that the diversity of zzso may be more structured than generally believed and that the innumerable zzso in the zzso all belong to discrete lineages or zzso
