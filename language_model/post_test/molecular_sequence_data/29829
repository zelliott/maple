zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso were used to investigate the location of zzso zzso zzso on this zzso bovine viral zzso virus zzso zzso A goat zzso zzso and a panel of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso specific zzso zzso were used to verify the presence or absence of the zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso reacted only with the truncated protein encompassing the zzso domain of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was dependent on, but not zzso a 57 zzso acid sequence at the zzso end of this zzso supporting observations that these zzso zzso are zzso in zzso A comparison of deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso highlighted a single zzso acid that appeared to be unique to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that this zzso acid is critical for the expression of the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso acid was also important for an zzso zzso by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies, based on the structure of the zzso C zzso zzso domain, indicated that this zzso acid occupies a prominent position on the surface of the zzso
