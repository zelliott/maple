A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was selected by zzso of zzso zzso strain of zzso coli zzso zzso expressing zzso can grow on medium lacking Met and contain zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that there is a single gene zzso with zzso A zzso zzso carrying zzso was cloned and zzso Through combined analysis of the zzso and zzso clone it was determined that the zzso coding sequence is zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid, 60 zzso zzso and is interrupted by ten zzso A zzso initiation site was detected 260 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso contains a consensus zzso zzso site and is similar to zzso of zzso coli, with which it is 35 percent zzso The zzso product has a sequence at the zzso zzso that resembles a transit zzso for zzso to zzso At least 160 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are not essential for zzso zzso
