Chicken represents a species with a high frequency of zzso T cells in peripheral blood, suggesting an important zzso To zzso the genes specific for the avian zzso T cells, the suppression zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso T cells was zzso The zzso library, which was successfully enriched for the zzso gamma and delta (both V and C zzso zzso provided zzso zzso zzso including, for example, the zzso zzso signaling and structural zzso and molecules related to zzso and zzso Among these zzso a clone named zzso was shown to match the zzso profile for zzso and to have zzso zzso acid identity to the human zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso had lower sequence zzso from zzso to zzso to other zzso zzso bundle zzso members zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso signal zzso sequence and the presence of zzso needed for the zzso zzso bonds were found to be zzso between clone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript expression was studied by zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso and it was confirmed to be expressed in avian zzso T zzso We propose that this zzso zzso may represent the first zzso zzso supporting the findings that zzso T cells are important in the development of zzso
