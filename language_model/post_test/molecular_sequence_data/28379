A zzso zzso zzso was derived from the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Using this zzso probe, the structural gene of zzso zzso was located on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso codes for a zzso with 60 zzso and proves that zzso is zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso has a high zzso probability and a characteristic zzso zzso site precedes the zzso zzso zzso Our present theory is that maturation of zzso involves zzso zzso conversion of zzso zzso and zzso into dehydrated zzso acids and zzso bridges, zzso membrane zzso and zzso of the modified zzso
