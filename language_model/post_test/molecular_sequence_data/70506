zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been constructed in mice and used to characterize the zzso potentially implied in the induction of zzso and zzso viability immune zzso Among the zzso produced three were particularly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which inhibited zzso activity and zzso zzso which did zzso The use of overlapping peptides covering the entire zzso acid sequence of zzso allowed us to define the linear zzso recognized by these zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were recognized by both zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso recognized zzso acid zzso zzso Their capacity to inhibit zzso activity suggested binding to the active site or to zzso regions, which include the zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso When passively transferred into zzso mice zzso induced a significant reduction in egg zzso and an increase in immature zzso zzso on zzso burdens were, however, variable and no clear-cut association between the zzso of zzso activity and zzso or zzso activities was zzso Our data indicate that beside the zzso and zzso immunity related to the impairment of zzso activity, immune response to zzso located in other regions of the zzso also contribute to the reduction of egg zzso
