zzso recognition by the VS zzso involves a zzso zzso interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso hairpin from the zzso zzso Recent zzso studies of zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso stabilize a zzso loop structure and trigger a zzso change for the zzso loop zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso Here, we zzso characterized VS zzso zzso to evaluate the contribution of zzso and other zzso loop zzso to zzso zzso To help interpret the kinetic data, we structurally characterized the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and generated a three-dimensional model of the zzso complex by zzso modeling with zzso We demonstrated that the zzso of zzso by A, C, or G does not significantly affect zzso activity, whereas deletion of zzso dramatically zzso this zzso The zzso backbone is likely important for zzso recognition, but does not appear to be required for either the structural integrity of the zzso loop or for direct interactions with zzso Thus, deletion of zzso may affect other aspects of zzso recognition, such as zzso zzso binding and zzso loop zzso As part of our zzso studies, we developed a convenient zzso based on detection of unusual zzso and zzso zzso chemical shifts to probe the formation of zzso structures in zzso Our model of the zzso complex, which is compatible with zzso data, leads us to propose novel interactions at the loop zzso V zzso
