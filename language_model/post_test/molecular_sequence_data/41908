We have investigated the possibility of using the zzso chain reaction to detect deletions of coding elements in the zzso zzso on zzso IV in the zzso zzso zzso Our analysis of approximately 13 zzso of zzso sequence immediately to the left of the zzso gene resulted in the identification of four possible zzso zzso zzso have been identified for three of zzso To determine whether any of these coding elements are essential for development, we required a method for the induction and selection of zzso in these zzso Our approach was to identify a set of zzso and gamma radiation induced zzso zzso that mapped to the zzso region, and then employ zzso chain reaction methodology to identify deficiencies that affected one or more of the four identified coding zzso Two small deficiencies were identified in this zzso zzso of these deficiencies shows that there are no coding elements between zzso and zzso (the nearest zzso identified gene to the left of zzso which are required in development under laboratory zzso We conclude that the zzso chain reaction is a practical tool for the detection of deletions of coding elements identified in this region, and that characterization of such deficiencies provides a method for assessing whether or not these elements are required for zzso
