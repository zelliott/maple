A unified understanding of zzso zzso of insect evolution requires insight into their zzso zzso clocks are widely applied for evolutionary dating, but clocks for the class zzso have remained zzso We now define a robust zzso and zzso acid zzso molecular clock encompassing five insect orders, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the clock using one of the zzso most extensive fossil records for insects (the early ancestors of extant zzso was zzso with all available insect zzso with zzso history, with the zzso explosion, and with independent dating estimates from zzso zzso In addition, dates obtained from both zzso and zzso acid clocks were zzso with each zzso Of particular interest to zzso biology is the early date of the emergence of zzso bugs zzso zzso zzso with the formation of the South American continent during the breakup of zzso More generally, we reveal the insects arising from a common zzso with the zzso zzso zzso at around the zzso boundary zzso zzso coinciding with the earliest plant zzso We explore zzso theory proposing that the zzso transition of the aquatic zzso zzso to the insects is associated with a particular plant group zzso vascular zzso The major output of the study is a comprehensive series of dates for zzso points within insect evolution that can act as zzso points for further dating studies within insect families and zzso
