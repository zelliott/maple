zzso zzso of type T zzso possess an alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso them with zzso properties, the capacity to form various zzso and to associate, as a zzso with zzso proteins containing a zzso rich attachment domain zzso The zzso zzso contains seven zzso aromatic zzso By zzso analyses of the synthetic peptides covering part or all of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso we show that the region containing the aromatic zzso adopts an alpha zzso structure, which is favored in the presence of lipids and zzso zzso these zzso therefore form a zzso cluster in a sector of the zzso We also analyzed the formation of zzso bonds between two different zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso possessing two zzso upstream or downstream of the zzso This shows that, in the complex formed by four T zzso with zzso zzso the zzso peptides are not folded on themselves as zzso but instead are all oriented in the same direction, zzso to that of the zzso The formation of zzso bonds between various pairs of zzso introduced by zzso at various positions in the zzso zzso indicates that this complex possesses a surprising zzso
