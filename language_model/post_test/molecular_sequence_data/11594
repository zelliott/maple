zzso which is the unique product of zzso zzso zzso may serve as a zzso zzso in zzso insulin zzso by pancreatic zzso Therefore we examined if and how zzso is affected by zzso in association with insulin zzso zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso activity which is closely related to insulin zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The acute effect of zzso in increasing zzso activity is caused by zzso of existing zzso zzso without the production of new zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by the use of zzso acid led to diminished zzso insulin zzso Likewise, when zzso zzso and zzso were induced by the use of zzso zzso zzso an zzso analog and zzso of zzso protein zzso the zzso insulin zzso was virtually zzso In the long term, zzso induced zzso and increased insulin zzso In zzso zzso gene expression is controlled by promoter II and zzso activated promoter II zzso zzso promoter I is not expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and insulin zzso by zzso in the short term occurred at 5 zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of the expression of zzso promoter II occurred when the cells were exposed to high zzso zzso for a long period of zzso Thus, we have shown that zzso the only zzso that produces zzso is activated by zzso zzso of zzso is accomplished by zzso in the short term and by induction of zzso by gene zzso in the long zzso
