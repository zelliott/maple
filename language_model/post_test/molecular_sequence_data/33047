The zzso zzso of strains of zzso zzso the zzso agent of the emerging human disease zzso zzso is difficult due to the zzso population structure of geographical zzso Although large sequence zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of patient zzso originating from across the globe, differentiation of strains within zzso using conventional typing methods is very zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence elements among 83 zzso zzso strains and identified single zzso zzso zzso that differentiate between regional zzso This is the first genetic discrimination based on zzso of zzso zzso strains from African countries where zzso zzso is endemic, resulting in the highest geographic resolution of zzso so zzso The findings support the concept of zzso zzso analyses as tools to study the epidemiology and evolution of zzso zzso at a local zzso
