Evolution of diverse zzso and zzso activities in a given protein fold is a widely observed phenomenon in the zzso zzso However, the details of this evolutionary process, general principles, if any, and implications for origins of particular zzso mechanisms are poorly understood in many common protein zzso Taking advantage of the wealth of currently available protein structure and sequence data, we explore these issues in the context of a large zzso of zzso diverse protein zzso sharing a common origin, namely the sugar zzso translation factor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that in at least three independent instances, including the zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso factors, this domain has been used as small zzso sensor coupled to zzso zzso zzso In at least two of these instances the domain functions as a zzso sensor of zzso We provide evidence that the ancestral version of this fold was a distinct version of the zzso zzso which probably possessed two distinct zzso areas that were zzso zzso in different zzso zzso the sequences and structures of proteins in this fold we show that there are two principal factors related to the origin of zzso diversity in this zzso zzso specific zzso and extension added to the core domain on multiple occasions in evolution have affected the access to the active site regions, and thereby allowed for different zzso and zzso zzso The second major factor appears to be the emergence of considerable diversity of zzso zzso with important zzso zzso Interestingly, proteins of this fold, which catalyze similar reactions on similar zzso might possess very distinctive sets of active zzso required for zzso binding zzso In particular, different sugar zzso or zzso zzso in this fold might show distinct zzso of active site zzso These findings suggest that whereas zzso and even generic zzso ability emerged early in the evolution of the fold, the specific zzso mechanisms appear to have independently emerged on multiple occasions in the generic precursors of this zzso
