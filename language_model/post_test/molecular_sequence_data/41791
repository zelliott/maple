zzso A zzso achieves zzso activity by complex formation with zzso and subsequent binding of the zzso complex to and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding zzso zzso do not inhibit protein zzso zzso suggesting a crucial role for this zzso in T cell zzso zzso of zzso A to zzso A, B, and C, respectively, results in complexes of significantly different zzso zzso The zzso zzso thus has two functional zzso one zzso zzso binding and a second one zzso affinity of the complex to zzso thereby zzso its zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso of zzso complexes indicate a crucial role of zzso side chains in positions 4 and 6 of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso
