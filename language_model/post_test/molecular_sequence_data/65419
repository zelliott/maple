zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to be responsible for a number of adverse drug reactions through modification of critical zzso zzso that defined the chemistry of protein modification at an early stage would provide invaluable tools for drug safety zzso Here, human zzso zzso zzso was exploited as a model target protein to determine the chemical, zzso and functional consequences of exposure to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso in native and zzso zzso was revealed by zzso and correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the adaptation of zzso zzso technology to define precisely the quantitative relationship between zzso modification and protein function is zzso Multiple reaction monitoring zzso of zzso allowed high sensitivity detection of modified peptides at zzso levels of zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a broad spectrum of zzso zzso was used in an in zzso reaction system to zzso zzso in this model, zzso trapped the zzso and exhibited both reduced zzso activity and zzso modification of the zzso These studies provide the foundation for the development of novel test systems to predict the zzso potential of zzso produced by new therapeutic zzso
