The zzso nuclear zzso zzso head zzso zzso proteins are an extensive family of zzso factors, which share zzso in the winged zzso DNA binding zzso Members of the zzso zzso family have been implicated in cell fate determination during pattern formation, in zzso and in zzso gene zzso In this study we isolated a full-length zzso zzso clone from a human kidney library which zzso a zzso acid protein containing a centrally located winged zzso DNA binding zzso We demonstrate that zzso is a potent zzso zzso requiring 138 zzso zzso for zzso We used in zzso zzso to demonstrate that zzso expression is restricted to the zzso of the zzso zzso convoluted zzso We determined the zzso DNA binding consensus sequence by in zzso DNA binding site selection using zzso zzso protein and used this consensus sequence to identify putative zzso target genes expressed zzso These putative zzso target genes include the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes as well as genes for the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso
