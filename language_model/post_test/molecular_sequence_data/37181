zzso scanning zzso was performed on zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 to systematically identify zzso important for zzso recognition by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso binding site zzso zzso that affected the binding of broadly zzso zzso zzso were compared to zzso that affected the binding of zzso and of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with affinities for zzso zzso comparable to that of zzso Not surprisingly, the sensitivities to a number of zzso acid changes were similar for the zzso and for zzso However, in contrast to what was seen for the zzso no enhancing zzso were observed for zzso suggesting that the virus has evolved toward an optimal zzso zzso Although the zzso maps of the zzso zzso a number of key differences between zzso and the other two zzso were zzso These differences may explain why zzso in contrast to zzso zzso is able to interact not only with zzso zzso but also with functional zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso bearing envelopes from a selection of zzso zzso mostly showed a reasonable correlation between the effects of the zzso on zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, some zzso produced an effect on zzso zzso counter to that predicted from zzso binding zzso It appears that these zzso have different effects on the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso can be engineered to zzso bind zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated containing combinations of zzso zzso shown to uniquely enhance zzso zzso Whereas zzso binding was maintained or increased, binding by five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was reduced or completely zzso These zzso zzso are prospective zzso that may prove capable of zzso broadly zzso zzso
