zzso bacteria possess the outer membrane protein zzso which acts as an exit duct across the outer zzso However, the region involved in the transport activity of zzso has remained zzso We analyzed this region by creating zzso zzso First, we expressed the genes for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The levels of sequence identity in the mature region of zzso and zzso with maximum matching are zzso and zzso zzso We found that the transport activity of zzso was weak compared with that of zzso of zzso coli zzso although the transport activity of zzso was similar to that of zzso A comparison of the sequence of the three zzso showed that the sequence around the zzso region covering zzso to zzso of zzso is lowly identical to that of zzso although the region of zzso is almost identical to that of zzso We think, therefore, that the region covering zzso to zzso of zzso may have an important role to express its transport activity in zzso zzso To examine the possibility, we divided the region of zzso into three and exchanged the gene for each portion with that of zzso These zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and the activity of each zzso zzso was zzso The results showed that the portion covering zzso to zzso of zzso is deeply involved in the transport zzso
