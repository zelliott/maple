zzso cloning identified complementary DNA species, from a rat zzso zzso library, zzso apparent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (which we now term zzso zzso revealed that one zzso zzso differs from zzso by the presence of a zzso acid insert near the zzso end of the zzso domain and by an alternate zzso domain in which the last 75 zzso acids are replaced by an unrelated sequence of 22 zzso zzso zzso is virtually identical to zzso in the remainder of the zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso and 3' zzso ends, and within the predicted zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that the two forms of the zzso arise by differential zzso of a transcript from the same zzso zzso of other clones indicates the existence of a third zzso zzso identical to zzso in its C zzso but lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso injected into zzso zzso generated functional zzso zzso channels with zzso properties distinct from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels exhibited a lower apparent affinity for zzso and for zzso zzso channels exhibited a lower affinity for zzso acid and a higher affinity for zzso The two zzso zzso showed nearly identical affinities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso responses, prominent in zzso injected with rat zzso message, was also prominent for zzso zzso but was greatly reduced or absent for zzso zzso Treatment with the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso by about zzso zzso of zzso responses in zzso zzso was much less, about zzso These findings support a role for alternate zzso in generating zzso channels with different functional zzso
