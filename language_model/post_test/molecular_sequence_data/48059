Many pathogens present highly variable surface proteins to their host as a means of evading immune zzso The structure of a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso was determined by solution of the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso complex of the zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso and a domain from zzso protein G to zzso A zzso The zzso adopted a zzso structure with a type I zzso between zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso being further zzso by a pair of hydrogen bonds from the zzso of zzso to zzso atoms in zzso The zzso binding site within the zzso formed a distinct zzso lined by a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso was supplemented by hydrogen bonds from heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso atoms in the zzso zzso region zzso 3 of the heavy chain was responsible for approximately 50 % of the buried surface area formed by zzso zzso with the remainder made up from zzso 1 and 3 of the light chain and zzso 1 and 2 of the heavy zzso zzso of the structures of variable surface zzso such as zzso is an essential prerequisite to a molecular understanding of zzso variation and its implications for vaccine zzso
