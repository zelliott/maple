The zzso sequence of the zzso genes of zzso coli zzso which zzso a zzso zzso zzso system for zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The genetic organization of the zzso differed from previously published zzso A single promoter, containing a putative pho box, was detected by zzso zzso The promoter is followed by four open reading zzso designated zzso A, E and C, which zzso a zzso binding zzso two zzso membrane proteins and a protein that is likely to couple energy to the transport system, zzso The sequences of the proteins contain the characteristics of several other binding zzso transport systems, but they seem to be particularly closely related to the zzso zzso
