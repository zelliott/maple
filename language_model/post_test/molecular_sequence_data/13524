The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that distinct zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are associated with the zzso inherited cancer syndromes multiple zzso zzso type 2A and zzso zzso 2A and zzso zzso and familial zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso disease zzso a zzso disorder zzso by absent enteric zzso In this study, we have zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both caused transformation of the zzso cells and differentiation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso on zzso and their in zzso zzso activity was significantly higher than that of the wild type zzso The zzso cell line zzso carries a zzso zzso zzso zzso and we have shown by zzso that zzso is clustered on the cell surface in a manner reminiscent of zzso zzso of cell surface zzso zzso is zzso as zzso zzso by zzso zzso which link the zzso domain to a zzso zzso interface in zzso zzso zzso We have compared the biological and zzso activity of the zzso zzso of the wild type and zzso zzso zzso in the context of the zzso The results show that the zzso zzso zzso significantly increases the zzso domain zzso activity suggesting that zzso may be still necessary for zzso zzso zzso to express its full zzso
