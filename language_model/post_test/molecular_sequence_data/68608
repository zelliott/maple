zzso secondary zzso mass zzso also called fast atom zzso mass zzso has been used to determine zzso zzso sites for peptides derived from zzso zzso that contain zzso attached zzso zzso An unexpected fragmentation occurs that breaks the zzso zzso bonds between the zzso and the zzso and the zzso zzso further zzso to give rise to an intense zzso at zzso of zzso that zzso to zzso iron zzso zzso The observation of this zzso zzso can be used to zzso identify the presence of authentic zzso c in peptides or zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
