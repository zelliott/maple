In the process of zzso zzso sequencing, initial zzso frequently contain cloning gaps that can be resolved using zzso methods, but the reason for their occurrence is largely zzso By analyzing zzso sequencing clones from zzso microbial zzso we systematically mapped more than 15,000 genes residing in cloning gaps and zzso showed that their expression products are toxic to the zzso coli zzso A subset of these toxic sequences was further evaluated through a series of functional zzso exploring the mechanisms of their zzso Among these zzso our zzso revealed novel toxins and restriction zzso and new classes of small, zzso toxic zzso that zzso inhibit zzso coli zzso Further analyses also revealed abundant, short, toxic DNA fragments that were predicted to suppress zzso coli growth by interacting with the replication zzso zzso Our results show that cloning gaps, once considered the result of technical problems, actually serve as a rich source for the discovery of zzso valuable functions, and suggest new modes of zzso zzso
