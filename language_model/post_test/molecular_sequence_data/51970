zzso sites zzso derived from end fragments of zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso can facilitate the assembly of an overlapping zzso zzso zzso form rapidly by zzso screening zzso collections with zzso zzso from zzso that have not yet been detected by any previous zzso The map is rendered rapidly useful during its assembly by incorporating supplementary zzso from genes and genetic linkage zzso with known zzso zzso for the systematic development and testing of the zzso zzso are given here, and a group of 100 zzso is presented for the X zzso The mapping strategy is shown to be successful in simulations with portions of the X zzso already largely mapped into overlapping zzso by other zzso
