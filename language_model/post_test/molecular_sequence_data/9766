The major differentiation products of maturing zzso contain zzso regulatory zzso and zzso DNA binding activity increases in cultured zzso induced to differentiate by zzso Here, we have zzso zzso zzso activity in mouse zzso treated with calcium and zzso zzso zzso two agents that induce terminal differentiation of zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso of zzso sequences found in zzso marker genes demonstrated that the zzso zzso DNA binding activity does not correlate with zzso zzso Moreover, expression from active zzso of the zzso and zzso 1 promoters increased in zzso zzso when the zzso sites were zzso indicating that zzso may zzso regulate certain promoters in these zzso In contrast, zzso reporter activity was increased in zzso treated with zzso This induction was dependent upon the expression of zzso since zzso zzso activity was not increased in zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso protein expression in zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that only zzso increased the expression of zzso while zzso B and zzso D were induced by both of these zzso zzso was expressed only in zzso treated zzso zzso was expressed only in zzso cells, and zzso was expressed in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso while zzso expression activated the zzso sequence in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso play opposing roles in regulating zzso activity in zzso and that multiple zzso regulatory pathways may exist for the expression of zzso differentiation zzso
