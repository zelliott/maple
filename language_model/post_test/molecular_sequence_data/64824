The protective efficacy of zzso zzso zzso can be markedly zzso by stable integration of zzso tuberculosis zzso region zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso encodes nine additional zzso Among them, zzso culture zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins that induce potent zzso zzso Using pools of synthetic zzso we have examined the potential zzso of four other zzso products zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the protein zzso by zzso was the only one to elicit gamma zzso zzso cells in zzso mice infected with zzso zzso zzso T cells were predominantly raised against an zzso mapped in the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso did not modify zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the generation of zzso responses to these zzso following zzso with zzso was independent of zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is an zzso product of the zzso region, which does not interfere with the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso
