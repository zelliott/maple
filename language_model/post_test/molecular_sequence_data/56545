A major objective of new rational zzso therapies is to be able to inhibit deleterious T cell responses in an zzso zzso Recently, a novel approach to inducing zzso zzso in T cells, termed zzso or zzso zzso has been zzso Several zzso of the influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to block recognition of the native zzso zzso by a zzso T cell clone at zzso zzso to zzso less than required to competitively inhibit zzso binding to zzso These zzso zzso that inhibited T cell recognition differed from the zzso zzso zzso only at single zzso How such limited changes affect the zzso complex interactions of zzso zzso and DR remains zzso In the present study, we have zzso two different zzso T cell clones that exhibit mutually exclusive zzso for zzso peptides with or without zzso at position 313 to investigate the molecular requirements for zzso zzso In this zzso model system, we show that a single zzso complex can antagonize one T cell clone while stimulating zzso A comparison of zzso sequences derived from the zzso of the T cell clones that were either antagonized or zzso by the zzso zzso complex indicated that the different responses of these T cells result from minor differences in the zzso acid zzso in zzso regions that most likely interact directly with position 313 of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso antagonism is an zzso phenomenon in which T cells are inhibited by interactions involving zzso zzso required for the recognition of conventional zzso and the altered zzso in zzso zzso
