zzso zzso sites represent zzso regions in zzso where the underlying DNA sequence is highly accessible to zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that it is possible to zzso gene activity from hypersensitive site zzso Point or substitution zzso were introduced into the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso heat shock protein zzso via zzso zzso zzso either the zzso box or heat shock element 1 zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso while mutating both essentially zzso zzso zzso zzso units exhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes still retained a hypersensitive site within their zzso zzso In addition, all zzso strains maintained a zzso hypersensitive site at zzso base pairs zzso while several zzso strains converted a zzso hypersensitive site at zzso zzso into a zzso zzso Thus, zzso in zzso elements within a promoter can zzso zzso without eliminating zzso zzso
