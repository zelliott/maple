zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also plays a role in zzso zzso which is associated with a number of clinical disorders, including cancer and zzso zzso The development of zzso antagonists, which prevent the interaction of zzso with its zzso may be important for the treatment of such zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso knot growth factor zzso showing greatest similarity to zzso growth factor zzso zzso binds to two different zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and a number of zzso zzso are known with distinct patterns of specificity for these same zzso The structure of zzso will help define the location of the zzso site, and shed light on the differences in specificity and zzso among the zzso zzso 

We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso at zzso A resolution in a zzso space group containing eight zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the eight copies of zzso shows that the zzso core regions of the zzso are very similar, with slightly greater differences in most loop zzso For one loop, the different copies represent different snapshots of a concerted zzso zzso mapping shows that this loop is part of the zzso site of zzso 

A comparison of the eight independent copies of zzso in the zzso unit indicates the zzso space sampled by the protein in zzso the root mean square differences observed are similar to those seen in ensembles of the highest precision zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso on a multiple sequence alignment of zzso zzso suggests the differences in specificity towards zzso and zzso may derive from both sequence variation and changes in the flexibility of binding zzso The structure can also be used to predict possible zzso zzso for related zzso knot growth factors, such as zzso
