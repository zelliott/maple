Each of the zzso zzso zzso contains large numbers of zzso mobile zzso both IS elements zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There are 344 in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 95 in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the former they constitute more than zzso of the zzso Experimental data suggest that zzso of IS elements occurs zzso Moreover, the gene order between the two organisms differs zzso indicating that multiple zzso have zzso This has also led to considerable speculation as to how the cells are zzso Recently, a third zzso zzso was completed which contains no IS elements or zzso This enabled us to compare the gene orders of the three zzso and provide evidence for mobile zzso zzso of sections of the zzso
