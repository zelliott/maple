To study the zzso chain reaction zzso performance in detecting human zzso virus zzso infections, we tested 53 zzso zzso patients and 29 zzso zzso subjects for four different zzso DNA zzso Fifty-one zzso patients were found positive by zzso with at least one primer pair, but two were repeatedly negative for all zzso Weekly blood samples from 12 zzso subjects all detected positive for at least one primer pair, but for three patients an irregular primer detection pattern was zzso One additional zzso zzso sample, found negative for zzso DNA, was also negative for the zzso zzso zzso The 29 zzso specimens were zzso DNA negative, as was a zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is almost as good as zzso tests for detecting zzso infections, with a specificity of zzso and a sensitivity of zzso and that zzso the patients may improve detection zzso
