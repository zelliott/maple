The zzso zzso has been implicated as an important zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso it is expressed for a limited time at a multitude of sites from embryonic day 7 to zzso zzso of zzso zzso at three promoter regions resulting in the generation of various zzso which nevertheless all zzso the same protein zzso A zzso DNA zzso which encompasses these regions was joined to the zzso reporter gene and shown to function as a promoter in zzso zzso zzso In stable zzso the promoter retains its zzso acid zzso initiating zzso at the same zzso as the zzso zzso In differentiated zzso cells, transient zzso of progressive and targeted deletion zzso of the promoter region has revealed at least two positive and three negative regulatory zzso With one exception, loss of these elements was shown to dramatically affect promoter activity in stable zzso of zzso zzso However the promoter remained zzso by zzso acid to differing degrees, apart from deletions encompassing zzso which essentially abolished promoter activity in both zzso and differentiated zzso The sequences of these potential regulatory regions were further defined using zzso zzso revealing some similarities to consensus binding sites for known zzso zzso
