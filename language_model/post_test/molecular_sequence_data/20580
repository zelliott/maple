The use of zzso zzso acids as zzso zzso of protein folding and function is growing zzso in large part because of advances in the methodology for their zzso Recently zzso has been employed as a zzso and zzso probe, as well as a zzso probe to study protein zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions and zzso zzso The probe has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to hydrogen bonding interactions involving the zzso group, and its zzso quantum yield increases dramatically when it is hydrogen zzso However, a detailed understanding of the factors which influence its zzso is required to be able to use this popular probe zzso Here we demonstrate the zzso incorporation of zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso Native state zzso is very low, which suggests that the group is zzso from zzso however, zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations show that the zzso group is exposed to zzso and forms hydrogen bonds to zzso Analysis of zzso proteins and model peptides demonstrates that the reduced native state zzso is caused by the effective zzso of zzso zzso via zzso to zzso zzso The implications for the interpretation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies are zzso
