The zzso zzso encodes for the zzso growth factor zzso zzso a plasma membrane zzso zzso that is involved in zzso growth and melanoma zzso In mouse melanoma cells, Met expression is increased by zzso via the zzso of the zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso and the biological consequences of this increase were not zzso In the present report, we show that zzso regulates zzso expression in both human zzso and mouse melanoma cells through a zzso mechanism that requires zzso Furthermore, the zzso driven expression of zzso is sufficient to increase zzso in melanoma zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter allows us to identify an zzso motif zzso in both human and mouse promoter that mediates the effect of zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso expression by zzso leads to an exacerbated zzso signaling and allows zzso to protect zzso and melanoma cells from zzso Thus, zzso stimuli or pathological events that would induce zzso expression may lead to increased zzso expression thereby favoring melanoma zzso These observations strengthen the roles of zzso and zzso in melanoma zzso
