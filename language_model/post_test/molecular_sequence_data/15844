The zzso gene zzso zzso located in the zzso complex of zzso encodes a family of closely related proteins that direct the zzso fates of zzso zzso and anterior abdominal zzso We have zzso a member of the zzso protein family from an zzso zzso coli strain and have shown that it is zzso DNA binding zzso The protein binds tightly to sequences near its own promoter and near the zzso promoter of zzso zzso a zzso gene zzso is known to repress from genetic zzso The binding sites occur in clusters downstream of the zzso start sites, and far upstream at zzso zzso They range in size from 40 to 90 zzso and contain tandem repeats of the zzso zzso or the related zzso zzso These results suggest that the regulatory activities of zzso are direct and are zzso by binding of zzso proteins to promoter region zzso
