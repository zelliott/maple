Despite its recognized utility, the extent to which evolutionary sequence zzso approaches may systematically overlook functional zzso sequences remains zzso We have tiled across sequence encompassing the zzso zzso zzso ultimately evaluating 48 zzso corresponding to all zzso sequences zzso for zzso activity in zzso Post hoc analyses of this zzso utilizing five commonly used measures of evolutionary constraint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that each systematically overlooks regulatory zzso These established zzso detected only zzso of our identified regulatory zzso consistent with the suggestion that many regulatory sequences may not be readily detected by metrics of sequence zzso However, we were able to discriminate functional from zzso sequences based upon zzso composition and identified position weight zzso zzso demonstrating that, in at least one case, deleting sequences containing a subset of these zzso from one identified regulatory element zzso its regulatory zzso zzso these data demonstrate that the zzso functional component of zzso zzso may far exceed estimates predicated on evolutionary zzso
