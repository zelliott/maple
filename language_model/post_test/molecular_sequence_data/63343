To identify zzso of the zzso B virus zzso X zzso gene and investigate the effect of the natural zzso on liver cell zzso 

We identified natural zzso of the zzso gene from 188 zzso and 48 zzso of Chinese patients infected with zzso by zzso zzso Based on the identification of the zzso of zzso zzso we cloned the fragments of the zzso into the zzso zzso The biological activities of the zzso were zzso 

We identified a natural zzso of the zzso gene with deletion from 382 to 401 base pairs from 3 zzso out of 188 patients, which resulted in the expression deletion of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso acid at the zzso zzso The similar zzso with deletion from 382 base pair at the zzso terminal was identified from 5 cases of zzso out of 48 zzso zzso zzso Regarding the biological activities of the zzso we found that the zzso of the zzso protein failed to induce zzso by transient zzso but promoted proliferation of human liver immortalized zzso cells by stable zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso The data showed that the proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells was enhanced by the zzso incorporation zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso showed that the zzso activities of zzso zzso and human zzso reverse zzso were zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that the expression levels of zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso 

Our findings suggest that the natural zzso zzso truncated 27 zzso acids at the zzso terminal promotes cell zzso
