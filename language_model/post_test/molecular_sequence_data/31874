As an essential member of the zzso family, heat shock zzso 70 zzso is a zzso expressed molecular zzso involved in protein zzso In this paper, zzso zzso was cloned and the expression profile was also zzso The full-length zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso including a zzso zzso zzso a zzso 3' zzso and a zzso open reading frame coding a protein with 651 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso acid sequence revealed the existence of three classical zzso family signature zzso a signature zzso and one repeat of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids sequence exhibited zzso zzso with zzso of 24 other known zzso In particular, the strongest zzso was found with the zzso members of zzso zzso and the highest identity was found with Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso transcripts were zzso expressed in all tested zzso under normal zzso condition, while the expression levels also increased zzso to zzso after heat shock and bacterial zzso In addition, zzso transcripts were detected throughout embryonic development and in zzso embryonic cell line zzso in the absence of any zzso Meanwhile, it was also heat zzso but not cold zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso gene may be involved in zzso and cellular protection events under normal and stress zzso
