The gene for human nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso 1 at zzso by in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso under control of the zzso promoter in zzso coli zzso the synthesis of a group of related proteins that were zzso with zzso zzso and that had zzso properties very similar to those of the human zzso zzso of this zzso activity was performed essentially as described for the human zzso The zzso pH zzso optimal reaction temperature, and zzso by zzso and zzso were found to be similar for the zzso and the human zzso The zzso zzso zzso consists of two major proteins of Mr zzso and Mr zzso Both proteins show zzso activity in activity gel analysis with zzso as zzso zzso of these two proteins isolated by zzso gel zzso and deletion zzso of the zzso expression zzso shows that the Mr zzso and Mr zzso proteins derive from initiation of translation at internal zzso start signals located within the zzso zzso
