zzso amplification and sequencing of the zzso zzso genes of zzso influenza virus zzso zzso was undertaken in order to characterize strains of this virus circulating in zzso The majority of viruses from outbreaks during 1997 analyzed belonged to the American lineage of zzso zzso zzso and one strain was shown to belong to the European zzso Furthermore, it was shown that recent zzso strains are zzso at zzso acid position 190 of the zzso during serial passage in zzso zzso zzso Host cell adaptation of these viruses thus takes place at zzso region B of the zzso
