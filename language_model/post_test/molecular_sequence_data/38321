zzso zzso virus zzso similar to human zzso B virus, causes acute liver inflammation that can progress to chronic zzso and zzso zzso zzso also invades cells of the host zzso system, where it persists for zzso We report here that acute and chronic zzso zzso is characterized by a profound difference in the expression of class I major zzso complex zzso molecules on the surface of infected zzso and, notably, zzso zzso While acute zzso infection is accompanied by the enhanced zzso surface presentation of class I zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the relevant zzso zzso zzso of class I zzso display on liver cells is a uniform hallmark of chronic zzso zzso This zzso in chronic zzso occurs despite zzso (as in acute zzso expression of zzso genes for class I zzso heavy chain, zzso and zzso associated with zzso processing zzso and zzso Further, the class I zzso zzso is not related to the zzso severity of zzso injury, the extent of zzso zzso the level of zzso gamma zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression is also inhibited on organ zzso cells of chronically infected zzso The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the defective presentation of class I zzso molecules on cells supporting persistent zzso replication is due to viral zzso zzso This event may diminish the zzso of infected zzso to zzso zzso zzso hinder virus zzso and zzso the class I zzso functions of the host immune zzso This zzso effect could be critical for perpetuation of liver damage and evasion of the zzso zzso surveillance in chronic infection and therefore could be supportive of zzso zzso
