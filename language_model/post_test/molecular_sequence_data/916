zzso studies of zzso folding and unfolding are providing impressive details of the zzso that occur and their rates of zzso The folding and unfolding of zzso are controlled by varying the concentration of zzso zzso and measuring zzso energy transfer, or by applying force to the zzso and measuring the zzso zzso The zzso nature of zzso folding - first secondary structure, then zzso structure - makes the process susceptible to analysis and zzso
