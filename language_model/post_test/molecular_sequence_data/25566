zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso is regulated by general control of zzso acid zzso but not by a specific regulatory zzso Three deletion zzso zzso I, delta II, delta zzso successively removing DNA sequences upstream from the coding sequence have been zzso analyzed after zzso into a single copy zzso As expected, delta I, which lacks the sequences upstream to zzso including the two putative upstream zzso sequences zzso was unable to zzso zzso zzso zzso under conditions of zzso acid zzso In delta II zzso up to zzso the zzso activity was very low and cells zzso this zzso were zzso zzso These drastic zzso changes can be attributed to the loss of 12 out of 14 zzso zzso from positions zzso to zzso This zzso zzso sequence most likely serves as an upstream promoter element for zzso expression of zzso The delta III deletion removes all zzso sequences including the putative zzso zzso This inactive zzso has been successfully used for selecting zzso promoters of unknown zzso
