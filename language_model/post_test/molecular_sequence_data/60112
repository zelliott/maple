We have previously reported that the early zzso of the immune response of rats to zzso zzso are characterized by the production of zzso zzso zzso by a restricted group of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso In the later zzso of the reaction, an zzso to zzso zzso switch occurs and our study examines the structure of the rearranged zzso genes used to zzso zzso zzso after this zzso zzso 

A quantitative zzso chain reaction was used to investigate the changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso seen after zzso zzso libraries specific for zzso zzso chain were established from total zzso extracted from zzso of zzso rats and zzso recipients of zzso hearts at days 4, 8, 21, and 28 zzso Colony filter zzso was used to estimate the relative frequency of the use of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones from day 21 zzso libraries were zzso and analyzed for zzso gene usage and zzso combining site zzso 

The level of zzso for zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso recipients at day 21 zzso when compared with zzso zzso The relative frequency of zzso usage for zzso zzso zzso alone increased from zzso at day 0 to zzso at day 21 zzso Ten zzso clones from the day 21 zzso libraries have been zzso for the rearranged zzso zzso Thirty percent zzso of these zzso clones used zzso genes for the coding of heavy chain variable region with limited numbers of zzso acid zzso zzso identity with their zzso zzso although others demonstrated increased variation in zzso sequences zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso binding site structure from the predicted zzso acid sequences demonstrated that the majority of zzso clones zzso displayed a similar pattern of zzso zzso for their combining zzso 

The change in zzso to zzso zzso production in the later stages of the zzso immune response of rats to zzso zzso is associated with an zzso to zzso zzso switch and an increased production of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso continue to express the zzso family of zzso zzso many in their original zzso zzso to zzso zzso recognition of the zzso target zzso There are, however, a majority of zzso for which the zzso genes express evidence of increased zzso acid sequence variation when compared to currently available zzso zzso The source of this variation is not known but may represent the expression of as yet unidentified zzso genes and/or the introduction of T zzso zzso zzso Despite the appearance of this variation, the unusual level of conservation in key zzso binding sites within the zzso region suggests the variation, independent of its origin, may have a limited influence on the restricted nature of the host zzso response to zzso
