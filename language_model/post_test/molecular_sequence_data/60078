Two strains of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from Greenland zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and molecular zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the unknown strains constitute a new line within the zzso zzso The nearest relatives of the zzso from fish were members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The unknown zzso was readily distinguished from these species by zzso zzso Based on zzso and zzso evidence, it is proposed that the unknown zzso be classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso
