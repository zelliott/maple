zzso S zzso is a key zzso employed in the zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso which are presented by processing class zzso zzso chains and loaded zzso peptides into class II zzso To date, little is known about the character and function of zzso in zzso In the present study, we screened and identified a zzso zzso sequence from the zzso red snapper head kidney zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso contained zzso zzso acids zzso 337 zzso zzso The sequence shared high identity and similarity with other known zzso especially zzso (about zzso and zzso zzso Like other zzso the deduced zzso consisted of regions with zzso signal zzso zzso and mature zzso A typical zzso motif in zzso zzso and three conservative zzso activity sites forming a zzso zzso active center were respectively identified in the zzso and mature zzso regions of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso red snapper zzso was located in the zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso group, and evolved from the same zzso To further characterize the biological activity of the putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso properties, can remove zzso and can release active mature zzso Active zzso had the ability to catalyze zzso zzso in zzso conditions zzso zzso and weak alkaline environments zzso zzso this activity could be blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Active zzso can process zzso zzso chains zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso The results indicate that zzso red snapper zzso is a zzso zzso zzso family member with a key role in zzso processing in zzso
