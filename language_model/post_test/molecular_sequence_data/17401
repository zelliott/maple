zzso are zzso zzso protein hormones that zzso regulate zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso B is produced by zzso zzso cells and is the primary circulating form of zzso in most adult male zzso zzso B is comprised of the zzso alpha zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning of the zzso zzso these zzso from adult zzso monkey zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso were cloned by a combination of reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso from adult zzso monkey zzso zzso 

Both the zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso and predicted protein sequences are highly zzso with other zzso species, particularly with zzso During the course of these zzso a novel zzso alpha zzso zzso was also zzso This form, referred to as zzso monkey zzso zzso 2, appears to derive from both alternative zzso initiation as well as alternative zzso zzso zzso 2 is comprised of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which is spliced zzso with zzso 2 of the conventional zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 is skipped in its entirety such that the zzso and part of the alpha N regions are not included in the predicted zzso zzso zzso 2 is of relatively low abundance and its biological function has not yet been zzso 

The data show that the predicted zzso B protein is very similar between monkeys and zzso zzso studies in monkeys using zzso human zzso are likely to reflect actions of the zzso zzso In addition, we have observed the first zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso It is possible that zzso will be observed in other species as well and this may lead to novel insights into zzso zzso
