It is generally believed that loop regions in zzso zzso and particularly zzso zzso in zzso can accommodate a wide variety of sequence changes without jeopardizing protein structure or zzso We show here, however, that novel sequences introduced within zzso determining regions zzso 1 and 3 of the zzso variable domain zzso zzso can significantly diminish the stability of the native state of this zzso Besides their implications for the general role of zzso in the stability of zzso zzso these results suggest previously zzso stability constraints on the zzso of zzso that may impact efforts to engineer new and improved activities into zzso
