Secondary zzso chemical and zzso zzso have been used to produce a model for the folding of the last 68 zzso of the zzso region of beet zzso yellow vein zzso zzso zzso The structure consists of two zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were produced containing zzso which either disrupted base pairing in the zzso or maintained the zzso but with zzso in the base pairing zzso Other zzso contained zzso in zzso regions zzso or zzso zzso With a few exceptions all three types of zzso abolished zzso 3 replication in zzso suggesting that both secondary structure and specific sequences are required for efficient recognition of the zzso region of zzso 3 by viral zzso zzso zzso
