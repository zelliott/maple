zzso controls cell cycle programs of zzso replication and genetic zzso zzso zzso approximately P exhibits high affinity zzso constant zzso zzso zzso for consensus zzso binding sites with zzso (N zzso 7) zzso We show here that zzso promoters zzso and zzso use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites with zzso (N not equal 7) zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso approximately P does not exhibit increased affinity for zzso sites, as it does for sites in the replication zzso Instead, high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso which can drive zzso binding to zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that when the stable zzso protein persists during the cell cycle, the zzso sites at zzso and zzso are persistently zzso Interestingly, the cell cycle timing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not altered by persistent zzso zzso zzso operator DNA occupancy is not sufficient for regulation, and it is the cell cycle variation of zzso approximately P zzso that provides the dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso is one potential means of zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and fusion with zzso zzso creates a stable zzso with enhanced affinity for zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso revealed cooperative modes of binding that further distinguish the zzso zzso zzso also binds a single zzso motif in zzso zzso aided by DNA in the extended zzso zzso We discuss how zzso sites are a common yet distinct category of zzso regulatory sites and new implications for the working and evolution of cell cycle control zzso
