zzso can catalyze the zzso of a wide range of organic and zzso zzso In this study, an easily zzso method was employed for screening zzso zzso by using zzso zzso as zzso zzso A novel zzso strain was isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso characteristics and the comparison of internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso gene zzso In further investigation, the production of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was greatly enhanced by the nontoxic zzso of copper zzso and zzso zzso Under the induction of 50 zzso copper zzso and 20 zzso zzso blue, the maximum zzso production was zzso When these zzso were added into zzso medium at 24 h and 12 zzso respectively, an zzso of about 100 times of zzso activity compared with that of in zzso medium and about two times of that of in single zzso medium was zzso Compared with other zzso species, zzso zzso zzso exhibit the better zzso characteristics with an activity of zzso zzso on the eighth day, suggesting its potential ability for industrial zzso
