The small G proteins of the Ras family act as zzso zzso in the transfer of zzso zzso This is a dynamic phenomenon involving a cascade of zzso interactions modulated by chemical zzso structural zzso and zzso zzso Most of the small G proteins could be zzso defined as proteins having two zzso states, each of which interacts with different cellular zzso These two states are determined by the nature of the bound zzso zzso or zzso This capacity to cycle between a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso enables them to zzso to amplify or to zzso the upstream signals that they zzso Thus the control of this cycle is zzso zzso zzso of the proteins in the Ras family is a prerequisite for their zzso Most of the proteins in the zzso and zzso zzso of Ras proteins cycle between zzso and zzso Then the control of membrane zzso is an other important regulation zzso This review will describe one family of crucial regulators acting on proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso As yet, only three zzso have been zzso zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 are zzso and participate in the regulation of both the zzso cycle and the membrane zzso cycle of zzso zzso The zzso zzso seems to act in a slightly different zzso
