We describe the preparation of zzso for zzso zzso high-level expression of rat zzso zzso or basic zzso zzso growth factors in zzso zzso Following zzso induction of zzso zzso rat zzso or zzso represented a major portion of the proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell extracts through an zzso zzso membrane provided zzso containing either zzso or zzso as the principal zzso A single zzso zzso of the zzso yielded essentially zzso biologically active, zzso rat zzso or zzso By zzso vessels and using buffers containing zzso acid, we could store zzso zzso or zzso preparations without significant loss during repeated freezing and zzso Previous methods for zzso zzso or zzso zzso salt zzso followed by sequential zzso exchange and zzso zzso These zzso zzso or zzso preparations routinely were stored in zzso carrier protein to minimize zzso loss resulting from zzso to glass or plastic zzso In contrast, the methods that we detail are zzso require minimal manipulation of zzso and permit storage of zzso zzso preparations without loss resulting from surface zzso The protocols can be used for preparation of zzso zzso or zzso of other species and may be readily applied to the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso present in cultured cell zzso zzso zzso or tissue zzso
