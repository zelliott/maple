Recent developments in sequencing technologies and zzso analyses provide an unprecedented opportunity for cost and time effective high quality zzso marker discovery in zzso organisms for which no zzso information is zzso Here, we use shotgun zzso of a zzso library to zzso for the first time, zzso markers for zzso zzso a zzso tree species of European zzso zzso zzso From a total of zzso short zzso we identified zzso perfect zzso from which zzso had designed zzso A subset of 48 zzso were tested for amplification, 12 of which were zzso in zzso zzso These 12 zzso were successfully zzso in a single multiplex zzso chain reaction experiment and validated for population zzso zzso In addition, 10 and 8 of these zzso were found to be zzso to the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The developed multiplex of 12 zzso markers therefore provides new opportunities for experimental evolutionary and forest zzso research in zzso
