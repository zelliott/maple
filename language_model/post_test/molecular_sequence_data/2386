During skeletal zzso approximately 20 zzso proteins and related gene products temporally accumulate as the cells fuse to form zzso muscle zzso In most instances, the zzso protein genes are regulated zzso which suggests that a common molecular mechanism may coordinate the expression of this diverse and zzso unrelated gene zzso Recent studies have examined the zzso zzso elements associated with numerous zzso protein zzso All of the identified regulatory elements are positioned in the zzso regions, usually within 1,500 base pairs of the zzso start zzso Surprisingly, a DNA consensus sequence that is common to each zzso protein gene has not been zzso In contrast to the results of these earlier studies, we have found that the zzso region of the quail zzso I zzso gene is not sufficient to permit the normal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Instead, the zzso gene zzso a unique internal regulatory element that is responsible for the correct zzso expression pattern associated with the zzso zzso This is the first example in which a zzso protein gene has been shown to rely primarily on an internal regulatory element to elicit zzso zzso during zzso The diversity of regulatory elements associated with the zzso protein genes suggests that the zzso expression of the genes may involve individual zzso regulatory components specific for each zzso
