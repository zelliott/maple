Many viruses use zzso zzso reading frame zzso as a means to increase protein diversity in zzso severely constrained by zzso However, the evolutionary steps that facilitate the de zzso generation of a novel protein within an ancestral zzso have remained poorly zzso Here, we describe the identification of an zzso zzso expressed from an zzso frame of the Large T Open reading frame zzso in the early region of Merkel cell zzso zzso the zzso agent of most Merkel cell zzso zzso is expressed zzso but not required for, replication of the zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso is zzso related to the middle T zzso of zzso zzso despite almost no sequence zzso zzso arose de zzso by zzso of the second zzso of T zzso in the common zzso of a large zzso of zzso zzso Taking advantage of the low evolutionary divergence and diverse sampling of zzso we propose evolutionary transitions that likely gave birth to this zzso We suggest that two highly constrained regions of the large T zzso zzso provided a start zzso and zzso zzso motif necessary for cellular zzso of zzso These two key features, together with zzso zzso of intervening stop zzso resulted in a unique zzso capacity that has been preserved ever since its zzso Our study not only reveals a previously undefined protein zzso by several zzso including zzso but also provides insight into de zzso protein zzso
