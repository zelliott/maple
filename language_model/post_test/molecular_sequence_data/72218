Current knowledge of genes that regulate pattern formation and differentiation processes during zzso embryonic development is zzso In an effort to isolate zzso relevant zzso 20 novel, zzso zzso selected from a Day zzso zzso mouse zzso library were genetically mapped in zzso zzso zzso Eleven of 20 zzso clones mapped to three mouse zzso zzso 5, 11, and zzso a result that was unlikely zzso zzso zzso if the distribution of genes expressed in zzso is random within the mouse zzso Several clones were candidates for mouse zzso zzso by virtue of genetic zzso and zzso of embryonic expression patterns with the distribution of defects in zzso zzso zzso was a candidate for the mouse zzso zzso zzso since zzso mapped in the vicinity of zzso on mouse zzso 14 and was expressed in those regions of embryonic brain that exhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis, genetic zzso and in zzso zzso appeared to be an effective combination of methods for identification and characterization of genes with potential regulatory functions during zzso zzso
