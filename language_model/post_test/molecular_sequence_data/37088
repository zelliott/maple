The zzso which is strongly associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso displaying zzso zzso zzso by the zzso cells, and a poor response to chemotherapy, zzso the zzso gene zzso with the zzso gene zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have been detected using zzso in zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso characterization of the zzso at the sequence level has never been zzso We have zzso the zzso in four zzso zzso cases with the aim to identify molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the origin of this zzso In addition, an zzso map of the zzso gene was constructed, which was found to be composed of 17 zzso zzso with zzso forward zzso in zzso 2 and zzso reverse zzso in zzso 17 as well as with a zzso forward primer in zzso 16 and a zzso reverse primer in zzso 2 successfully amplified zzso and zzso hybrid zzso DNA fragments in all four zzso The breaks clustered in both zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso 16, and were close to repetitive zzso and in one case an zzso junction for the zzso hybrid was zzso Additional zzso events zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso regions in both the zzso and zzso genes were found in all four zzso Thus, the zzso does not originate through a simple zzso zzso The findings of multiple breaks and zzso rather suggest the involvement of a zzso mechanism in the origin of this zzso
