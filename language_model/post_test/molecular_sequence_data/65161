zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in the zzso zzso channel zzso In this paper, we report that mutating zzso zzso within zzso to zzso or zzso prevents the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso when these zzso are zzso in human zzso kidney zzso cells, resulting in zzso retention of zzso zzso analysis based on a three-dimensional zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso may play a critical role in the formation and stabilization of an exposed turn structure that is part of the zzso interaction zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso could therefore result in zzso of the structure of the zzso interaction site, preventing correct zzso zzso
