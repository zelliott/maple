zzso zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso plays a pivotal role in controlling zzso activity, and zzso the zzso cycle and cell zzso Previously, the cloning of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the effects of zzso zzso its expression on plant growth and development has been zzso The first detailed analyses of the zzso and zzso effects of partial zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso driven by both zzso and zzso promoters are reported zzso The studies revealed an increased level of zzso in leaves of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso was also found in developing seeds of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso partial zzso of the zzso resulted in increased seed oil content and seed weight at zzso Feeding zzso zzso to bolted stems containing zzso zzso zzso or to isolated zzso or immature seeds zzso zzso confirmed a higher rate of incorporation of zzso into all seed zzso species, particularly zzso Neither zzso nor zzso partial zzso of zzso zzso affected overall zzso and seed zzso Instead, oil and seed yield, and overall plant productivity were zzso These findings suggest that a partial reduction of the repression of the zzso by zzso zzso expression can alter carbon flux and, in particular, the contribution of carbon zzso from zzso to fatty acid zzso and storage zzso zzso in developing seeds, implicating a role for zzso in fatty acid zzso in zzso
