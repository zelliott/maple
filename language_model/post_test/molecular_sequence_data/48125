An internal zzso gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso was amplified using zzso zzso zzso derived from consensus zzso The sequence had significant similarity to bacterial zzso zzso and included a motif typical of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso from zzso zzso lies on the zzso zzso of the zzso and is localized near zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso zzso To zzso the function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene replacement zzso were zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso was not zzso after an ammonium zzso However, the zzso activity of the zzso cells decreased to zzso of the original zzso The zzso zzso is not zzso zzso but in the zzso zzso no zzso activity was detected in zzso and shifted zzso zzso By snake zzso zzso treatment the zzso activity in the zzso can be zzso whereas no zzso is observed in the zzso zzso Additionally, the loss of short-term zzso regulation in the zzso zzso was accompanied by an increased zzso zzso
