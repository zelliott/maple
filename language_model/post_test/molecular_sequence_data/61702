The protein zzso for zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli and zzso zzso was found to be a zzso with a native molecular mass of 43 zzso and containing two zzso bound zzso zzso zzso The cell extract of zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduction of zzso that was zzso by the addition of zzso zzso was found to be a direct electron donor to zzso zzso whereas zzso was unable to zzso Neither zzso nor zzso was an electron zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso and zzso accepted electrons from reduced zzso whereas zzso zzso did zzso The rate of zzso c reduction was enhanced in the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso is a product of the interaction of reduced zzso with zzso Although zzso was previously zzso as zzso a zzso involved in zzso A zzso the results establish that zzso is an electron carrier protein with zzso as the zzso electron zzso The zzso of several diverse zzso contained zzso zzso clustered with open reading frames zzso as zzso of genes zzso zzso involved in the zzso stress response of zzso from the domain zzso A potential role for zzso in zzso electron flow from zzso to the putative zzso is zzso A search of the databases suggests that zzso is the zzso of a previously zzso zzso family unique to the domain zzso for which the name zzso is zzso
