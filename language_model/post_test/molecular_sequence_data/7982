The zzso positions of the moderately zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso amplification of zzso genes and direct zzso The resulting data were compared with data for other bacteria obtained from zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clustered zzso within the gamma zzso of the zzso and are closely related to other species on the zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs in the family zzso and has the characteristic zzso zzso signatures defined for this family, including the distinctive zzso zzso at position zzso found in all members of the zzso zzso zzso is closely related to the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and we formally propose that zzso zzso should be transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of this species is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not as closely related to other species belonging to the zzso complex, but is more closely related to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso the type species of the zzso zzso A zzso approach will be necessary to determine the natural zzso positions of the species belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
