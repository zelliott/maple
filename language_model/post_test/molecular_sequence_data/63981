The breast zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in nuclear zzso in the S phase and after DNA damage, and the two proteins form a stable zzso implicated in DNA repair, protein zzso and control of zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso however, little is known about its zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso activity are regulated by zzso zzso We identified a functional zzso nuclear export sequence zzso near the zzso zzso domain of zzso The zzso forms part of the zzso zzso domain, and zzso of zzso resulted in masking of the zzso and nuclear retention of zzso In transient expression zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by nuclear export, and both zzso function and nuclear export were markedly reduced by zzso Similar findings were obtained for zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso or zzso the zzso zzso interaction by zzso competition caused a reduction in zzso nuclear zzso and zzso formation, and increased the level of zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso formation is important for optimal nuclear targeting of zzso and its role in DNA repair and cell zzso
