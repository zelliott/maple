zzso is a zzso specific protein zzso that binds to DNA and is localized to the nucleus in association with zzso It plays a role in the regulation of cell zzso Here we show that the zzso distribution of this protein changes during cell zzso While zzso was localized exclusively to the nucleus in zzso cells, during zzso and zzso it was distributed throughout the zzso and excluded from condensed zzso At zzso zzso began to associate with zzso and at zzso it was associated with zzso in the newly formed zzso It was zzso and showed retarded mobility in cells arrested in zzso In zzso experiments showed that it was zzso by zzso resulting in mobility zzso Using a deletion zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso sensitive zzso from zzso cell extracts zzso zzso resulting in mobility zzso These results are consistent with the suggestion that during zzso zzso is zzso zzso by zzso or a zzso zzso resulting in its zzso from zzso
