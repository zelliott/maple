In the zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso are present originating from about 30 different zzso distributed within the zzso With regard to the chemical structures of zzso zzso and the genetic basis of their zzso a number, but not all, of zzso zzso strains representing different zzso have been zzso In order to present an overall picture of the relationship between zzso and structures, we have been working on the zzso and structures of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a structural and genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that this zzso structure has the same backbone as that of zzso zzso zzso but with a zzso zzso instead of zzso The 3' end of the gene cluster is the same as that for zzso and has the genes for synthesis of the backbone and for processing the completed repeat zzso The zzso end has genes for synthesis of zzso and its transfer to the repeating unit zzso The zzso for the synthesis of the zzso appears to be different from that for zzso in zzso zzso zzso The chemical structure of the zzso repeating unit is zzso see zzso
