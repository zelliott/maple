zzso belongs to the major constituents of plasma and acts as zzso and zzso zzso Due to the occurrence of three major zzso zzso and further structural zzso the alpha chains of zzso form varying spot patterns in two-dimensional gel zzso zzso gels, which is generally observed in differential zzso analyses using plasma or related body zzso of zzso In the present study plasma samples from 10 donors of initially unknown zzso zzso were separated by zzso and zzso zzso of excised zzso alpha chain spots were analyzed by zzso laser zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso trap zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso chains were found to occur each with at least three structurally differing protein zzso zzso the unmodified form, which zzso to the sequence database zzso zzso zzso in which zzso at position five is zzso to zzso zzso and zzso derivatives with an additional zzso zzso zzso These structural zzso account for the most commonly observed spot patterns of zzso alpha chains in zzso zzso Additionally, a minor zzso of the zzso zzso chain carrying both zzso zzso at position five and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso values of the characterized structural zzso are, consistent with their observed migration in the zzso zzso
