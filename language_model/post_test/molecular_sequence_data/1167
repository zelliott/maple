A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso of larvae of the wax zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso coli, and its zzso activity was examined in a zzso diffusion zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso was zzso Da by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The full-length zzso of the zzso zzso precursor was cloned by a combination of zzso based on the zzso sequence obtained by zzso degradation, and zzso Analysis of the zzso showed that zzso is zzso as a zzso with a putative zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso mature zzso with a calculated mass of zzso Da the difference between the calculated and measured masses suggests that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso generated by removal of the zzso zzso and zzso
