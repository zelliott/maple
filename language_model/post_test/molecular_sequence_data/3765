Genome analysis of the fruit fly zzso zzso reveals three new zzso zzso channel zzso with the characteristic zzso motif found only in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso are designated zzso zzso and zzso Cloning of the zzso embryonic zzso reveals an atypically large N zzso part of which is without identifiable sequence motifs and is specified by two zzso zzso zzso clones from zzso contain multiple zzso transcripts arising from alternative zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Alternative zzso in zzso involves zzso zzso zzso functional zzso The zzso transcript is a target of the zzso zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso This is the first case for any zzso where a zzso gene is the target of zzso zzso Seven zzso could be modified in the zzso zzso region of zzso four of which are also edited in the zzso zzso in the tobacco zzso zzso zzso The conservation of an editing site between the insect orders zzso and zzso makes zzso editing the most zzso zzso zzso zzso editing site so far zzso These findings add to our understanding of zzso zzso diversity, which is increased and regulated by mechanisms acting at the zzso and zzso zzso
