The zzso consequences of zzso zzso induced in zzso DNA by zzso zzso and UVA have been determined in a forward zzso system capable of detecting all classes of zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso has been carried out at a very low zzso ratio of zzso to DNA which zzso the induction of zzso between high affinity reaction zzso When damaged zzso DNA is used to zzso competent zzso coli zzso zzso cells, a zzso increase in zzso frequency is observed at zzso survivors when measured as a loss of zzso zzso The enhanced zzso frequency is largely due to base zzso zzso events and large zzso The single zzso zzso occur both in the zzso Z coding sequence and in its regulatory zzso zzso and transition have been detected with a zzso form consisting of zzso zzso at position zzso zzso zzso have been observed at five positions while three large deletions removing either part of the coding sequence or both the coding and the regulatory regions have been detected with a higher zzso The spectrum of base zzso detected between the zzso zzso zzso zzso surviving to the treatment is totally different from those appearing spontaneously whereas several zzso events or deletions can already be detected between the spontaneous zzso Despite the presence of these spontaneous hot spots, the spectrum of zzso recovered after zzso zzso appears to be unique and a detailed analysis of the different classes of zzso indicates an important role of zzso in the production of zzso
