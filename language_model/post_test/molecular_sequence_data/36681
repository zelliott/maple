Despite advances in the in zzso zzso of human B cells zzso et zzso 1988) and the development of zzso mice zzso et zzso 1988) for the zzso of the human immune system ex zzso zzso of zzso human B cells remains the limiting step in the generation of human zzso zzso Typically this is performed with the aid of zzso virus transformation followed by zzso confirmation of zzso binding and zzso of the B zzso to a suitable fusion partner such as zzso This general approach is effective and widely zzso however, it is time-consuming with erratic zzso These were the immediate reasons we and others devised methods to directly obtain the variable regions from small numbers of human B cells zzso et zzso zzso The success of the zzso approach is illustrated zzso In the present studies we successfully captured and zzso produced zzso from the V regions of two potent human zzso zzso zzso by zzso that were too unstable for zzso zzso Although further zzso evaluation of these zzso is in progress, results to date indicate that the zzso zzso produced in zzso cell lines or zzso cells are equivalent in binding specificity and activity to the native zzso zzso Recent studies from this laboratory indicate that effective zzso protection will require a cocktail of zzso zzso Details of this work will be the subject of a future communication zzso et zzso in zzso
