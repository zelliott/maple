The zzso are distributed throughout the zzso zzso and all known zzso zzso bind zzso zzso To determine whether zzso peptides function as zzso proteins in zzso we zzso zzso acid extracts of the zzso of both the sea urchin, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and screened the zzso for proteins which could be zzso to zzso In each case a zzso was isolated which zzso to zzso from both rabbit skeletal muscle and zzso zzso zzso zzso both peptides were zzso and each was found to consist of 40 zzso acid zzso compared with zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso and sea zzso zzso are zzso identical to each other, zzso identical to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso of other zzso zzso The sea zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso The affinity of the sea zzso zzso for rabbit muscle zzso is apparently lower than that of zzso zzso since about twice the concentration of sea zzso zzso is required to give zzso of zzso zzso or zzso exchange equivalent to zzso zzso
