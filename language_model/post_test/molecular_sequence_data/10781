We have isolated zzso clones zzso the dog and human forms of a novel protein whose function is still zzso zzso analysis indicates that dog clone zzso protein contains zzso zzso acid zzso several potential zzso zzso and two of the 12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso that fold into a common zzso core structure of the large family of protein zzso Human clone zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with its dog zzso We have also isolated another zzso clone zzso sharing zzso zzso acid identity with the dog zzso We zzso expressed zzso zzso clone zzso protein in zzso cells and infected zzso in primary culture with a zzso zzso containing clone zzso zzso zzso zzso In both experiments, a zzso protein was detected and subsequently more extensively zzso By two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso we showed that this zzso protein is zzso on different zzso Moreover, cells zzso with zzso or zzso growth factor, zzso and fetal calf serum increased the level of clone zzso protein produced after infection by zzso containing clone zzso The disappearance of this zzso protein after 1 h of zzso treatment indicates that it is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis have revealed that zzso clone zzso was zzso and localized mainly in the zzso in the form of zzso
