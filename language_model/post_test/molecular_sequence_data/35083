The complete zzso sequence was determined for a cryptic zzso zzso recovered from several zzso zzso zzso from wild birds in the zzso United zzso zzso is a circular zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso content zzso similar to that of many zzso zzso zzso A typical origin of zzso with zzso zzso was identified upstream of DNA sequences that demonstrated similarity to replication initiation zzso A total of five open reading frames zzso were zzso two of the five zzso demonstrated significant similarity to zzso zzso found within zzso zzso These two zzso were similar to essential replication proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A third identified zzso demonstrated significant similarity zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein from zzso coli zzso originally recovered from zzso The other two identified zzso were either similar to hypothetical proteins from other zzso zzso or exhibited no significant similarity to any DNA or protein sequence in the zzso zzso zzso regions zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso binding sites upstream of zzso and zzso structures were also identified within the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso represents a previously zzso small cryptic zzso with unique sequences as well as highly similar sequences to other small plasmids found within zzso zzso and that this cryptic zzso is present among zzso zzso recovered from different zzso of wild zzso
