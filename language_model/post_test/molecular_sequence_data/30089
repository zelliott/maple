An expression zzso zzso containing the complete coding sequence of a rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso zzso The entire zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1985, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction, zzso into modified expression zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1986, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 83, zzso and zzso et zzso 1987, zzso 5, zzso and transformed into zzso coli strain zzso The colonies were screened by zzso to zzso and the production of zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was active in the zzso and zzso zzso and appeared homogeneous as judged by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso acid sequencing of the expressed zzso zzso revealed that about zzso of the expressed protein was blocked at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso of total zzso contained the initiation zzso zzso at the zzso zzso whereas the rest of the zzso protein had zzso as the zzso In contrast, only one molecular species with Pro as the first zzso acid was identified when the zzso zzso was omitted in the growth zzso Our observation indicated that under certain growth conditions, the zzso responsible for protein maturation were not able to complete the processing of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
