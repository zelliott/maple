The zzso position of an zzso strain zzso isolated from a cold desert of the Himalayas, India, was established by a zzso zzso The strain exhibited zzso characters that were typical of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso comparisons confirmed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity studies showed that the isolate is very closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been recently reclassified as zzso zzso It showed zzso % sequence similarity with other species of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso was low (62 zzso Based on zzso analysis, strain zzso could be clearly distinguished from other zzso It is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
