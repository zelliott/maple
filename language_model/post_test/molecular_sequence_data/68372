We report the discovery of a bacterial zzso zzso that codes for a zzso unknown type of zzso zzso The gene was found in the course of studying a zzso zzso zzso of the soybean root zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein shared up to zzso zzso acid sequence identity with various zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso and possessed a characteristic zzso zzso zzso In contrast to all members of the zzso family known to date, zzso was shown to be anchored to the zzso membrane by means of an zzso zzso domain, while the active zzso part of the protein faced the zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso zzso in that it was defective in the development of a nitrogen fixing zzso and exhibited a strongly decreased zzso activity, as compared with the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso whereas the zzso of zzso one zzso of this zzso was still zzso and incorporated into the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is not a prerequisite for the development of zzso the results suggest that zzso is involved in at least two independent cellular zzso one of which is an essential zzso step in the maturation of zzso zzso
