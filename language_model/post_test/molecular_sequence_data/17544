A new method for characterizing zzso zzso without chemical degradation is zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso was zzso For zzso containing one zzso unit, both the zzso sequence and the site of attachment of the sugar zzso were obtained from a single zzso zzso zzso However, in a zzso bearing multiple sugar zzso per site, the zzso spectrum was dominated by fragments resulting from zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso thus obviating the zzso observation of zzso sequence zzso zzso information on the structures of the zzso zzso was zzso but not on the sites of attachment of these zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to obtain the sequence of the zzso backbone from the same zzso This method holds promise for simultaneously determining the zzso structure and the zzso sequence of intact zzso zzso without chemical zzso
