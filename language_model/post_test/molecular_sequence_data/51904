Three zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso were constructed by synthetic zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso and zzso proteins contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso acid zzso changes increased the positive charge of the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso of the arm structure, which is believed to be a domain for DNA zzso The three zzso proteins bound to DNA more tightly than zzso zzso and their affinities for DNA increased in the order of zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins showed a slightly increased zzso activity for supporting zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein with increased zzso but with an altered zzso sequence in the arm region due to a zzso zzso was also zzso This zzso protein showed a reduced affinity to DNA and was unable to support zzso growth, suggesting that a unique zzso sequence of the arm domain, rather than mere zzso of this domain, is required for efficient binding to zzso
