One general point to emerge from this review is that each step in the zzso for gene expression from DNA to final zzso via zzso structure, primary transcript, zzso processing, stability, and translation is exploited in some zzso context as a means of zzso Moreover, there is little evidence that the regulation of different stages in this zzso is associated consistently with particular classes of genes or zzso zzso for example, zzso and other regulatory zzso which are important in early development and in determining the overall structures of organisms, are regulated by both zzso and zzso mechanisms, as are many other genes zzso zzso proteins expressed late during terminal zzso There are also instances in which zzso factors regulating zzso zzso are present zzso but are activated only in certain cell types by zzso events, and in zzso coordinate regulation of zzso zzso genes involves the translation control of a zzso zzso Second, as far as zzso control is concerned, it is now clear that in most instances zzso specificity arises from the activities of multiple zzso elements that can act either positively or zzso The precise way in which the gene functions depends on what combination of zzso elements it zzso A third somewhat negative point is that in general the mechanisms responsible for the coordinate expression of genes during cell differentiation and development are not yet zzso In view of the complexities of possible mechanisms noted above, it may be that closely related genes (such as those zzso the zzso and zzso for example) in fact come to be zzso expressed via a complex, indirect zzso Indeed, it is quite possible that such mechanisms will not be revealed simply by a zzso approach studying relatively short regions of DNA and that some form of overall zzso zzso will be zzso Finally, what we know relates mainly to expression of genes within particular cell zzso How groups of cells are organized into complex structures remains a mystery at the molecular level, although progress into the genetic principles involved in the regulation of such zzso is being made, mainly in insects, reviewed recently by Brower, although to some extent also in the mouse zzso by zzso and zzso
