The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso and thereby attenuating the cellular response to low tissue oxygen zzso We report the zzso structure of the zzso zzso domain bound to the zzso domain of zzso The structure of zzso consisting of four zzso zzso stabilized by three zinc zzso is very similar in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is zzso when free and folds upon zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso and an extended structure that wraps around zzso The zzso zzso zzso packs in the zzso zzso zzso a site that forms weak interactions with the poorly defined zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso both contain a four zzso zzso zzso which binds in the zzso zzso junction in each zzso The zzso region of zzso forms an extended structure with zzso contacts in the zzso zzso interface in the site occupied by the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not bind at all to the zzso site occupied by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso partly overlapping surfaces of zzso to achieve high affinity binding and to compete effectively with each other for interaction with zzso zzso and zzso use these binding sites differently to maintain similar binding affinities in order to zzso each other in a feedback loop during the hypoxic zzso
