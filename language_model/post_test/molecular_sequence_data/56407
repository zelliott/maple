The development of transformed human airway zzso cell lines has been important in advancing the understanding of the zzso and genetic mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the most common zzso associated with zzso is a zzso deletion at position 508 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso a transformed airway zzso cell line zzso for this zzso will be important for determining the zzso significance of this zzso in the zzso We report the zzso and zzso characterization of a delta zzso zzso cell line derived from zzso zzso in the zzso The cells were transformed with a zzso containing an origin of replication defective zzso zzso and have progressed through zzso zzso characterization of the cells shows that they express zzso indicating zzso cell origin, and that a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is present at plasma membrane junctions between zzso zzso the cells show no zzso zzso zzso However, after treatment with the calcium zzso zzso cells zzso zzso albeit at a lower level than that observed in normal zzso zzso the cells express zzso zzso as determined by zzso chain reaction amplification and zzso protein as determined by Western zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso of the cells contain two copies of zzso zzso
