The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the alpha zzso of the translation initiation factor 2, which plays an important role in zzso regulation during zzso zzso zzso is expressed mainly in zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms that regulate the zzso expression of the mouse zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized its zzso zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso analyses identified a major zzso initiation site 84 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed that zzso promoter lacked a zzso element, but contained an zzso core element and three zzso consensus binding zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso reporter gene zzso containing a series of deletions and zzso in the zzso region identified a 159 zzso sequence which is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso promoter activities in zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso Both the zzso and one of the zzso binding sites in the 159 zzso are essential for zzso promoter zzso
