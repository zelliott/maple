As zzso zzso T cells play a key role during acute and chronic zzso infection in humans, the ability of potential zzso vaccines to elicit strong, broad T cell responses is likely to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso is widely considered a relevant zzso for the development of an zzso vaccine since it is one of the most zzso viral proteins and is also known to induce T cell zzso In the majority of studies reporting zzso cellular immune responses induced by zzso vaccines, only a small number of zzso T cell zzso were tested in zzso mouse models, thus giving an incomplete picture of the numerous possible cellular immune responses against this zzso As is, this partial knowledge of zzso T cell responses directed to zzso will unavoidably result in a limited zzso evaluation of zzso zzso 

In this study we identified new zzso zzso T cell zzso in zzso mice vaccinated with the zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with the zzso zzso zzso which was recently shown to broaden T cell responses directed to zzso Specifically, we found that zzso responses to zzso may be directed to nine different zzso zzso and four of these were mapped as minimal zzso zzso 

These newly identified zzso zzso should be considered in the zzso evaluation of T cell responses induced by zzso vaccines in zzso
