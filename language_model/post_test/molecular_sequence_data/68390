The structure of a zzso complex formed at the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This complex involves the first 90 zzso of zzso zzso which fold into a zzso structure and interact with both zzso zzso the viral zzso zzso and a 36 zzso zzso cellular zzso The cellular protein is required for complex formation and interacts with zzso bases in one zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acids within the zzso zzso which are important for zzso binding were identified by zzso zzso and the crystal structure of a related zzso was used to model the zzso binding domain within the viral zzso zzso The zzso importance of the zzso complex is suggested by the finding that zzso that disrupt complex formation abolish zzso replication but do not affect zzso translation or zzso Based on these structural and functional findings we propose a model for the initiation of zzso zzso synthesis where an initiation complex consisting of zzso a cellular zzso and the zzso of the positive strand zzso zzso in trans the initiation of synthesis of new positive stranded zzso
