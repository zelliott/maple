The barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise an zzso group of 14 zzso zzso zzso The genetic map position of zzso zzso to the physical map position of the gene zzso zzso a zzso This zzso converts zzso a to zzso b and it is essential for zzso b zzso The zzso and zzso barley lines were shown to be zzso in the gene for zzso a zzso A zzso zzso was found in zzso and base deletions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and zzso nonsense base exchanges were zzso All of these zzso led to a premature stop of translation and none of the zzso formed zzso zzso The zzso zzso was transcript deficient and formed no zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso (leading to the zzso acid exchange zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a total lack of zzso zzso whereas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso intermediate contents of zzso b were zzso The zzso zzso affect zzso zzso and their effect on zzso a zzso is zzso The zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso may influence electron transfer as illustrated in the active site of a structural model zzso The changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso may lead to zzso zzso by interfering with the regulation of zzso a zzso The correlation of zzso and zzso strongly supports that the barley locus zzso encodes zzso a zzso
