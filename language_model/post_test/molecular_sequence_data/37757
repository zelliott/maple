In 1997 zzso was detected using zzso difference analysis zzso in serum of a patient with zzso zzso unrelated to known zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is a circular zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso with negative zzso zzso possibly can be grouped either into the existing family zzso or into a recently established virus family zzso Analysis of the complete DNA zzso sequence of zzso identified three partially overlapping open reading frames zzso Neither DNA zzso nor corresponding zzso acid sequences of zzso do show significant zzso to known zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences amplified by zzso from zzso of different patients show considerable sequence zzso Although the natural route of transmission of zzso is still unknown, there is clear evidence for a transmission of zzso through blood and blood zzso zzso DNA can be detected in the feces of infected individuals suggesting that it may be possible to attract zzso infection from environmental zzso Since the discovery of zzso numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of zzso infections in different human population groups all over the zzso All these studies are based on zzso detection systems, but the technical aspects of the zzso systems vary significantly between the different zzso The results of the zzso studies do not show a clear zzso The discovery of zzso as a viral agent and particularly the identification of a high percentage of infected carriers in the healthy human population raises the following questions: zzso what is the origin and molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso what is the significance of zzso as a human zzso And zzso what are the exact molecular mechanisms of viral zzso To answer these questions it will be necessary to determine the primary structure and the coding capacity of several zzso patient zzso
