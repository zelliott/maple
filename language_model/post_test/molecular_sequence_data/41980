This paper describes the cloning of a zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso The gene was isolated using zzso zzso to zzso sequences amongst the small zzso proteins in a zzso chain reaction on zzso DNA of the zzso major cloned line zzso The reading frame of one clone showed high similarity to the zzso zzso of small zzso zzso A full length copy of the gene was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library and zzso At the zzso acid level the gene showed highest similarity to the zzso zzso A gene and the zzso zzso gene and was named zzso The zzso gene was present as a single copy gene in both the zzso major and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso gene to zzso band 18 in zzso but it was located on a larger zzso in the different zzso major isolate zzso The zzso gene was transcribed as a zzso transcript in both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso Western zzso analysis, using a zzso rabbit zzso raised against an zzso coli expressed portion of the zzso identified a zzso at 20 and 23 zzso in total zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso localized the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
