In this study, the association between zzso gene zzso and disease resistance was evaluated by challenging grass carp zzso zzso with zzso zzso Eight zzso and six zzso were found, and named by common zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was associated with higher resistance to zzso zzso as well as two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has decreased resistance to zzso zzso The expression of zzso gene was decreased in the liver, zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso and skin at 2 days post infection zzso versus to that in the control zzso zzso gene expression was zzso in most zzso but remained at normal levels in the zzso at 15 days post zzso Our data suggested that zzso zzso can be used as a potential genetic marker for disease resistance breeding of grass carp in the zzso
