In the present work, to analyze the zzso of the zzso zzso immune response, a large number of T cell clones were generated from the zzso of a zzso invaded zzso zzso and two kinds of zzso zzso zzso clones were zzso The majority of T cell clones (about a zzso are characterized by a specific zzso of the zzso tumor cell zzso Among 34 of the latter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to play a zzso role in tumor zzso However, no significant amplification at the tumor site was observed for 3 of these zzso The other kind of zzso zzso (1 zzso and 2 zzso cell zzso did not lyse the zzso melanoma cell lines but zzso the zzso zzso tumor cells in a zzso class zzso zzso zzso analysis of the two different zzso clones have shown that they did not lyse zzso targets, zzso peripheral zzso activated T cells, and transformed B cells or any of the few zzso cultured and zzso melanoma cells we zzso zzso repertoire analysis has shown that one of these zzso clones was significantly zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso while not zzso among zzso Such zzso zzso which could not have been picked out through conventional screening procedures using tumor cell lines, could potentially play a role in tumor zzso These results suggest that the immune response analyzed toward melanoma cell lines does not totally reflect the in zzso immune zzso
