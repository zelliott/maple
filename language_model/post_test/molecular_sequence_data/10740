zzso illness is a serious psychiatric disorder that in many, but far from all, patients can be treated with zzso The main causes for zzso of zzso therapy are unpleasant or serious side effects and lack of zzso The reason for the striking variation in clinical efficacy of zzso treatment among bipolar patients is not zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso as a target for the zzso effects of lithium, but variation in the coding region of the human zzso gene zzso zzso activity has not been observed in zzso patients zzso et zzso zzso 1996, 6, zzso It is nevertheless conceivable that zzso or zzso in the zzso regions of this gene could influence the zzso response in psychiatric zzso As a first step in investigating this possibility, we here report the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso The gene is composed of at least nine zzso and covers more than 20 zzso of sequence on zzso zzso In the zzso part of the zzso we observed a zzso (a G to A zzso and also two short sequences similar to the zzso element zzso Finally, we zzso that two additional zzso transcripts originate from the human zzso one from a position close to zzso itself on zzso 8 and the other from zzso zzso Our data may contribute to the identification of genetic factors involved in the zzso and determination of treatment response in zzso zzso
