In zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso leading to production of the zzso factor zzso that activates the unfolded protein response zzso In zzso no zzso counterpart has yet been discovered despite the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Instead, the zzso factor zzso specific to the zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Here, we identified the zzso factor zzso a target of zzso as a zzso zzso of such an unconventional zzso zzso system and showed that only the spliced form of zzso can activate the zzso zzso Our results reveal features of the zzso zzso during evolution and clarify the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso
