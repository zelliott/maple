We expressed zzso amounts of functional human zzso D3 zzso in a bacterial expression system in which the cloned zzso for the zzso was expressed under the control of bacterial zzso zzso The zzso protein comprised approximately zzso of total bacterial zzso It migrated on zzso zzso zzso gels with an zzso of zzso It had the predicted zzso acid composition and zzso acid sequence zzso The expressed protein was bound by zzso D3 zzso with a zzso in the zzso zzso It zzso on zzso density zzso at zzso Furthermore, the expressed protein bound to the zzso vitamin D response element zzso as assessed by a gel mobility shift zzso The expression of large amounts of zzso protein should allow for the use of this protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
