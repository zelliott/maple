The zzso zzso produces two-thirds of zzso derived zzso zzso form the largest and most diverse group of these natural zzso zzso diversity of zzso is generated during their zzso by several means, including zzso modification performed by zzso a broad group of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze zzso zzso of zzso zzso precursors significantly affecting zzso zzso zzso manipulation of zzso zzso in generating new antibiotics will require identification and/or engineering of zzso with activities toward a diverse array of chemical zzso To begin to link structure to function of zzso involved in secondary zzso pathways of industrially important species, we determined the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso A and analyzed it in the context of the closely related zzso and more distant zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso reveals an active site zzso from the molecular surface, and an absence of zzso activities observed for zzso zzso variations in the zzso acid patterns and length of the surface zzso loop correlate with degree of rotation of the F and G zzso relative to the active site in zzso zzso presumably regulating the degree of active site accessibility and its zzso zzso in zzso is in a 180 degrees flipped orientation compared with most other structurally determined zzso
