zzso is one of the most zzso compounds produced from the zzso degradation of animal zzso Little is known about the zzso of zzso production, the zzso of zzso zzso or the conditions that favor their zzso These deficiencies hamper attempts to reduce zzso zzso Our goals were to enrich for zzso producers in zzso zzso slurry zzso and evaluate the resulting microbial community structure using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso producers were enriched by zzso zzso of zzso with 100 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was used to measure zzso production in the zzso after 0, 7 and 17 days' zzso Based on most probable number analysis, zzso producers increased zzso in zzso samples supplemented with zzso Based on zzso fingerprint patterns from day 0, 7 and 17 treatments with high, mid or low levels of zzso production, changes in the zzso population occurred as zzso production zzso Changes in the bacterial community fingerprints were associated with an increase in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from this study provides valuable new information concerning the organisms responsible for production of this zzso a necessary first step towards controlling zzso zzso
