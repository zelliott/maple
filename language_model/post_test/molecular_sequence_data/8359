zzso is a zzso linking protein that is concentrated in zzso surface zzso It is closely related to the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and to the tumor zzso zzso Cell extracts contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins were zzso by zzso overlay to determine which regions mediate zzso Here we report that zzso zzso occurs by zzso joining of distinct zzso and zzso zzso It is likely that these zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso association zzso are responsible for zzso and zzso associations among zzso family zzso The zzso of zzso resided within zzso acids zzso deletion of 10 additional zzso resulted in loss of zzso The zzso was mapped to the last 107 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso The two zzso at the zzso were required for activity, and the region from zzso was zzso The zzso was masked in the native zzso Exposure of this domain required unfolding zzso with sodium zzso zzso or expressing the domain as part of a truncated zzso zzso association could not occur unless the zzso had been made accessible to its zzso zzso It can be zzso that zzso in zzso requires an zzso step that exposes this masked zzso The zzso zzso zzso region included the zzso binding site, suggesting that this activity is likewise regulated by zzso
