The binding of the zzso zzso zzso to a defined linear DNA zzso was investigated using both zzso III and zzso zzso We show that most of the zzso zzso are zzso toward zzso however, several zzso zzso showed preferential zzso for the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins we present evidence that these three proteins in concert are able to recognize and produce specific strand zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is specific and results in strand breaks at five or six bases zzso and three or four bases zzso an zzso At some zzso zzso single incisions were observed only on one side of the zzso The zzso strand breaks observed often occurred as zzso bands on sequencing gels, indicating plasticity in the site of zzso zzso whereas the 3' zzso did not show this zzso When DNA fragments modified with elevated levels of zzso were used as zzso the activity of the zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms for the recognition and specific zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso and other zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso are zzso
