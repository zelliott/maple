The zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso for zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso We mapped the zzso zzso of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso of zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and for inducing zzso changes in zzso that lead to membrane zzso We identified zzso that bound to zzso zzso zzso loop 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso composed of more than one single zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized specific zzso that span the first 13 zzso acids of zzso while nearly all zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso to zzso In addition, all MD zzso involved zzso including at least zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso were more efficient than zzso or zzso in blocking zzso or zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso blocked zzso binding more effectively than zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso were more potent zzso of viral infection than zzso zzso Thus, the ability to block virus infection did not correlate with the ability to block zzso zzso Together, these results imply that zzso and zzso bind to distinct but overlapping sites in zzso and suggest that the zzso domain of zzso is more important for zzso binding while the zzso zzso are more important for inducing zzso changes in zzso that lead to membrane fusion and virus zzso zzso of individual zzso affinities coupled with kinetic analysis of equilibrium binding states also suggested that there are multiple zzso states of zzso A previously described zzso zzso was unique in its ability to effectively block both zzso and zzso binding as well as zzso zzso zzso bound to a unique zzso zzso in the first half of zzso and recognized a far greater proportion of cell surface zzso molecules than the other zzso zzso Thus, the zzso recognized by zzso may represent a particularly attractive target for zzso zzso
