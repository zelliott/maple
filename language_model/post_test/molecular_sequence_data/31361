During zzso cell zzso the deposition of a layer of zzso zzso protein on the zzso face of the plasma membrane forms the cell zzso We have isolated and characterized zzso clones zzso a major differentiation product of mouse zzso cells, which has an zzso acid composition similar to that of zzso cell zzso zzso of this gene are restricted to the zzso layer and are as abundant as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso against a zzso zzso zzso this protein in discrete zzso in the stratum zzso and subsequently at the periphery of stratum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detect this zzso only on the inner surface of zzso cell zzso Taken together, these results suggest that it is a major component of cell zzso On the basis of its presumed function, this protein is named zzso
