zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso of 26 zzso receptors zzso (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone receptors and two related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were calculated by distance geometry using zzso hydrogen bonds formed by various proteins from the family and collectively applied as distance constraints, as described previously zzso et zzso zzso zzso 70 (1997) zzso The main structural features of the calculated zzso models are described and illustrated by zzso Some of the features reflect physical interactions that are responsible for the structural stability of the zzso zzso the formation of extensive networks of zzso zzso and zzso clusters that are zzso organized as zzso zzso the close packing of zzso throughout the zzso zzso and the formation of zzso zzso bonds in some receptors and a plausible zzso binding center in zzso Other features of the models are related to biological function and evolution of zzso the formation of a common zzso of 43 zzso zzso zzso a multitude of correlated replacements throughout the zzso zzso an zzso site in some zzso and excellent zzso of zzso binding pockets to many structurally zzso zzso constrained zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The calculated models are in good agreement with numerous experimental zzso
