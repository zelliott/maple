A zzso zzso zzso complementary to rat zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from an adult rat zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso sequence was shown to be zzso similar to the human zzso zzso sequence over the zzso acid coding region and over zzso similar in the sequences known to be responsible for iron regulation in the human zzso The zzso was shown by Northern zzso analysis to be regulated by iron levels in zzso cells in zzso Iron depletion resulted in at least a zzso increase in zzso message in zzso cells, as well as in an actively growing zzso cell line zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells was not influenced by zzso however, chronic administration of testosterone or zzso to zzso rats resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from zzso of rats synchronized at various stages of the cycle of the zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso was zzso regulated throughout the zzso Northern blots of zzso from zzso cell populations derived from synchronized tests showed that the message was regulated in the zzso cell components of the zzso most likely the zzso zzso The comparison of zzso zzso zzso levels in normal zzso and zzso from zzso rats, as well as in isolated zzso cells and cultured zzso cells, suggested that zzso zzso zzso levels were considerably higher in zzso cells than in other cell types of the zzso zzso
