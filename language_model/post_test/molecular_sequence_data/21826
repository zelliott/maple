Many zzso contain zzso interactions that contribute to folding the zzso into its functional zzso zzso In the VS zzso a zzso zzso kissing interaction involving zzso I and V is also required to rearrange the secondary structure of zzso I such that zzso at the base of stem I, which contains the zzso site, can adopt the zzso required for zzso In the current work, we have used zzso that zzso adopt the zzso zzso zzso to search for additional roles of the kissing interaction in zzso Using zzso that disrupt or restore the kissing interaction, we find that the kissing interaction contributes zzso enhancement to the rates of zzso and zzso Large zzso effects on equilibrium were also zzso in the presence of the kissing interaction zzso is favored zzso at zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso is favored zzso at zzso zzso of zzso In the absence of the kissing interaction zzso exceeds zzso at all zzso of zzso These data provide evidence that the kissing interaction strongly affects the observed zzso and zzso rate zzso and the zzso equilibrium of the zzso
