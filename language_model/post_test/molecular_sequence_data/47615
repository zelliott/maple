From the culture broth of the mold zzso zzso zzso zzso a mixture of zzso named zzso zzso could be isolated and zzso by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso gel using zzso zzso as zzso provided a mixture of peptides named TV zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso yielded a second group of peptides named TV zzso That group could be separated into individual components by repetitive zzso on an zzso and a zzso stationary zzso The sequences of 12 peptides of TV II could be determined by zzso zzso tandem mass zzso of isolated peptides and gas zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of the zzso peptides are zzso and the zzso consist of zzso zzso to the presence of zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso activity, the peptides belong to the family of zzso zzso
