Using zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequence of an zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso an amplification reaction was used to isolate a DNA segment containing a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso sequence of this fragment, a zzso zzso was zzso and used to screen a zzso library of strain zzso DNA for fragments containing zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing zzso was cloned into zzso coli, and the zzso sequence of a zzso region containing zzso was zzso Under control of the zzso promoter of zzso zzso expression in zzso coli cultures was zzso zzso higher than in strain zzso under the native zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no significant zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso
