Cell cycle growth arrest is an important cellular response to zzso zzso zzso a zzso stress zzso plays an important role in the cell cycle zzso checkpoint following exposure to certain types of zzso agents such as zzso radiation and zzso zzso Recent findings indicate that zzso interacts with zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a series of zzso zzso deletion zzso and a zzso overlapping zzso library were used to define the zzso zzso that are involved in the interaction of zzso with zzso Both in zzso and in zzso studies indicate that the interaction of zzso with zzso involves a central region of the zzso protein zzso acids zzso The zzso domain of zzso is also required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the central zzso region reveals no zzso to zzso motifs of known zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso are a novel zzso The zzso containing the zzso domain zzso acids zzso disrupted the zzso B1 protein complex, suggesting that zzso of this complex results from a direct interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso arrest was abolished when its zzso binding motif was zzso zzso a short term survival zzso demonstrated that zzso cell cycle zzso arrest zzso with zzso growth zzso These findings indicate that the cell cycle zzso growth arrest zzso by zzso is one of the major mechanisms by which zzso suppresses cell zzso
