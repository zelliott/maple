A zzso zzso has been developed for the specific and qualitative detection of pork zzso zzso zzso beef zzso zzso sheep zzso zzso and goat zzso zzso in raw and heat-treated meat zzso A forward common primer was designed on a zzso DNA sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and reverse zzso were designed to zzso on zzso DNA sequences of each species zzso The different sizes of the zzso zzso separated by zzso gel zzso allowed clear species zzso Analysis of experimental meat zzso demonstrated that the detection limit of the zzso was zzso zzso for each species zzso This zzso can be useful for the accurate identification of these species, avoiding zzso or fraudulent species substitution in meat zzso
