The cloning and analysis of a zzso clone zzso the soybean zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction zzso and the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso reaction are zzso The zzso was constructed from zzso zzso isolated from 15-17 day old zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso reveals that the plant zzso is zzso as a zzso and the zzso form shares a structural zzso responsible for maintenance of inactive zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso from zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso transcript and protein are under a strict zzso program in that both are expressed only in leaf tissue and in a zzso zzso The zzso function of the zzso still remains unclear although the data suggest that the zzso is zzso and a portion of the mature form of the zzso is tightly bound to the cell zzso
