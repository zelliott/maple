Physical mapping of zzso zzso in 2 species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed using zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso product from the zzso of both species was also zzso and aligned to determine zzso zzso sequences zzso Both species under study had different patterns of zzso zzso gene cluster zzso While in the zzso of zzso zzso two zzso zzso pairs were observed, the zzso of zzso zzso possessed as many as 19 such zzso Such zzso of zzso zzso gene clusters might be caused by the involvement of zzso elements because the zzso of zzso zzso was 400 zzso long with high identity zzso with a mobile zzso element called zzso zzso described from the zzso fish zzso zzso
