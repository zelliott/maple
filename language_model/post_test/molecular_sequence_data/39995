Several publications have described biological roles for human zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Here, we report on the characterization and expression profiling of 10 human zzso A variety of zzso approaches were used to identify and characterize all zzso zzso by the human zzso The genes described represent a divergent family, most with a highly zzso zzso in several zzso zzso In zzso characterization predicts that two of the genes function as integral membrane proteins and are regulated by zzso A structurally guided protein alignment of the zzso domain identifies a number of zzso zzso in all family zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the expression profile of each family zzso zzso profiling of a human zzso cell line identified several members that are zzso regulated during cell zzso zzso data suggest that zzso genes normally expressed at very low levels are induced in response to environmental zzso Given the observed conservation of the zzso fold and zzso motif in all human zzso a single nomenclature to describe the zzso family is zzso
