We have isolated and characterized zzso zzso rat zzso from a zzso library prepared from rat zzso zzso Analysis of these clones reveals that rat zzso is zzso initially as part of a zzso acid precursor that includes a signal zzso zzso (29 zzso zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso includes a zzso zzso and is flanked on each side by zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat zzso is zzso similar to zzso zzso with all three zzso acid differences in the zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso acid sequence that is zzso similar to the previously reported zzso zzso This sequence is set off by a single basic zzso zzso site and includes a zzso acid region that is nearly identical to the zzso zzso The high zzso conservation suggests a biological role for this putative zzso zzso zzso analysis using rat zzso DNA is consistent with a single zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of total zzso prepared from rat zzso reveals a single band of zzso zzso that is approximately 900 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located predominantly in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal zzso zzso central nervous system zzso are found in the zzso with lower levels in the zzso and zzso zzso rat zzso zzso is most abundant in the zzso with progressively lower zzso in the stomach, small zzso and zzso
