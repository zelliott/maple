zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso beta zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor which has been shown to be a zzso inhibitor of zzso factors zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso beta zzso and its zzso domain also inhibited isolated factor zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso On a solid phase binding zzso zzso beta zzso formed a complex with factor zzso zzso of zzso excess factor zzso to zzso beta zzso produced a single zzso within zzso beta zzso zzso binding domain liberating a zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and its zzso domain equally inhibited factor zzso in the zzso complex with a Ki of zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso A beta zzso which does not contain the zzso domain was a zzso of factor zzso but did not inhibit it, indicating the zzso beta zzso zzso of factor zzso was not zzso zzso All of the factor zzso zzso in the zzso complex by zzso beta zzso and its zzso domain on the zzso zzso was accounted for by zzso of release of zzso zzso zzso as determined on zzso zzso In the zzso complex, zzso beta zzso inhibited factor zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso III and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies indicated that zzso beta zzso in the assembled zzso complex inhibited factor zzso comparable to zzso III in the presence of zzso zzso beta zzso factor zzso zzso activity along with its known zzso of factors zzso and zzso suggest that this zzso inhibitor and related proteins could be regulators of zzso reactions on zzso of cells in the zzso zzso
