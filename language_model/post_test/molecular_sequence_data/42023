Loss of tumor zzso gene function is essential in the zzso progression of cells to zzso zzso cells were established by zzso treatment of Syrian zzso zzso zzso At early passages, these zzso cells retained the ability to suppress zzso in cell hybrids with zzso zzso Upon passage and zzso of these zzso zzso cells, zzso clones that had lost tumor zzso activity were zzso These zzso zzso clones remained zzso The zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso a zzso differentiation marker, and zzso a zzso controlled zzso were more abundant in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Nuclear zzso analysis indicated that the zzso of these genes is zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that a zzso element in the rat collagen II zzso zzso sequences directs zzso regulated zzso zzso retention analysis demonstrated the presence of a nuclear zzso zzso that specifically recognizes a DNA sequence common to both the rat collagen II sequences and the mouse zzso zzso In one set of zzso zzso regulation could account for differential collagen II and zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso In another set of zzso zzso controls are responsible for the decreased expression of these genes in zzso zzso The emergence of two independent mechanisms that cause differential expression of collagen II and zzso related to tumor zzso loss suggests that coordinate regulation of these zzso or others regulated by common mechanisms, may be important in tumor zzso
