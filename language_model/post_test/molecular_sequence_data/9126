zzso zzso is the unique intermediate host of zzso zzso The zzso interaction is zzso zzso To identify zzso expressed transcripts in zzso zzso chronically infected with zzso zzso suppression zzso zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso library in each direction for transcripts that are more abundantly enriched in zzso part of the infected zzso zzso and for those that are more abundantly enriched in the zzso as zzso part contains zzso and zzso which are associated with the snail internal defense zzso After differential zzso 39 transcripts were identified, including nine and 30 transcripts enriched in infected and zzso zzso zzso Some of the transcripts have similar zzso to available sequences in current databases, including zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several hypothetical zzso while most of the transcripts do not match with any sequences in available zzso The identified transcripts were involved functionally in cell growth, zzso signal zzso and immune zzso Two forward library transcripts and 11 reverse library transcripts were selected for real-time zzso and 10 of them were confirmed to be consistent with the zzso zzso It is intriguing to continue functional studies for some genes such as pancreatic zzso zzso a hypothetical protein zzso related to calcium zzso zzso zzso and several unknown proteins zzso and zzso These identified zzso expressed genes may be key targets for understanding the molecular mechanism of zzso during which the snail is unable to rid itself of the zzso in chronic infection zzso
