zzso of zzso coli zzso have been isolated containing either the zzso or the zzso transport systems for zzso This enabled the zzso system containing a zzso zzso protein to be associated with zzso zzso apparent zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso system exhibited relatively low zzso apparent zzso zzso zzso Their apparent zzso values were zzso Isolation of a zzso zzso zzso in a downstream zzso zzso and a series of zzso experiments enabled the gene order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be proposed near 80 zzso on the zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was highly zzso from the zzso and the sequence of its zzso 44 zzso acids zzso From this a mixed zzso zzso zzso was zzso of corresponding DNA zzso zzso of which to restriction fragments from the zzso I hybrid zzso zzso which zzso zzso transport activity on a zzso zzso double zzso enabled precise location of the zzso gene next to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso physical zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso II zzso containing the zzso gene was then determined, which confirmed the above gene order and revealed two divergent zzso probably regulated in a zzso manner, one containing zzso for zzso of zzso and the other proteins zzso the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the 330 zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein located the zzso point of its leader zzso between zzso and zzso and revealed significant zzso with the other sugar zzso proteins for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
