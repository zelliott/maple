We have shown that the zzso protein zzso 3 from zzso zzso zzso exhibits compositional zzso For the first time, we have isolated and characterized the three major components of this zzso These zzso display different zzso zzso on zzso acid zzso zzso However, they have a very similar molecular mass of 5 zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso equilibrium in the zzso zzso All of them show a marked trend toward zzso We have also established the sequence for each of these three zzso The sequencing data suggest an even greater extent of zzso for this zzso The predicted secondary structure from the zzso as well as infrared analyzes carried out on the native zzso suggest a structure organization into an alpha zzso
