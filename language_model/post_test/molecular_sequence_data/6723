delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the final step in zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso encodes zzso The zzso gene was localized to a zzso zzso region by zzso of zzso of zzso growth to) a zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso zzso region contains an open reading frame with coding capacity of 311 zzso zzso The deduced zzso shows significant similarity to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is greatest to that of the zzso zzso zzso but is also strong to zzso sequences from zzso zzso plants, and zzso In zzso zzso zzso acid zzso including zzso or excess of a single zzso acid, such as zzso zzso expression of many zzso acid zzso genes that are under zzso control, a general regulatory system analogous to general zzso acid control in zzso Although zzso zzso the only committed step in zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso and independent of zzso a positively acting zzso factor that mediates zzso control in zzso zzso
