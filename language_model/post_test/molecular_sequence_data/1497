zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso and a zzso target for neurodegenerative zzso However, a protein zzso relevant to zzso death had not been zzso We identified human brain zzso protein zzso zzso zzso an zzso key to zzso survival, as the first relevant zzso protein by using a focused zzso and zzso approach that can be generalized to protein zzso open reading frames identified in zzso projects without prior knowledge of zzso zzso First, zzso proteins were detected in zzso zzso screens and in zzso of brain zzso Second, potential zzso site sequences in zzso zzso hits were identified on the basis of our previous results from zzso zzso zzso libraries and molecular zzso Third, zzso zzso using zzso components demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of nearly 1 zzso of zzso per mole of zzso and a zzso value of 3 zzso Fourth, zzso was identified as the zzso site by zzso mapping using mass zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis with a zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso a potential mechanism of action was identified on the basis of the location of zzso near the zzso recognition domain of zzso and demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso The results raise the possibility of a zzso protein zzso cascade as a key mechanism in acute zzso amenable to therapeutic zzso
