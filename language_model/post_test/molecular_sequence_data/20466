The diversity of zzso bacteria zzso in the zzso underlying the zzso zzso along the shore of the East China Sea was zzso The DNA extracted from 15 groundwater samples was subjected to zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were then used to construct 4 clone libraries, while the zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso were used for zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso The clones in the 4 libraries covered all cultured zzso zzso as well as a deeply branching zzso not affiliated with any cultured zzso In addition, nearly zzso of the 388 clones in the 4 libraries were similar to sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, a wide variety of marine zzso was zzso which indicated that seawater has infiltrated the zzso Indeed, the zzso profiles revealed obvious variations in zzso diversity among the 15 samples, which clustered in accordance with the zzso concentration of the samples zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso and zzso diversity along the zzso plume did not show regular variation, which suggests the impact of both groundwater flow and seawater zzso
