Treatment with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso has achieved high clinical response rates in patients with zzso cell lung zzso zzso However, over time, most tumors develop acquired resistance to zzso which is associated with the secondary zzso zzso resistance zzso in about half the zzso Currently there are no effective treatment options for patients with this resistance zzso Here we identified two novel zzso zzso T cell zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as potential targets for zzso zzso When peripheral blood cells were repeatedly zzso in zzso with these two peptides and assessed by zzso zzso zzso T cell lines responsive to zzso and zzso were established in 5 of 6 zzso and 3 of 6 zzso healthy donors, zzso Additionally, the zzso and zzso T cell lines displayed an zzso class zzso zzso against zzso cell lines expressing both zzso and the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso patients with zzso T cell responses to these zzso showed a significantly less frequency of zzso zzso than those without them zzso of 7 zzso vs 9 of 15 zzso zzso test, p zzso zzso indicating the negative correlation between the immune responses to the zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This finding could possibly be explained by the hypothesis that immune responses to the zzso zzso derived from zzso might prevent the emergence of tumor cell zzso with the zzso resistance zzso in zzso patients during zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that the identified T cell zzso might provide a novel zzso approach for prevention and/or treatment of zzso resistance with the secondary zzso zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso
