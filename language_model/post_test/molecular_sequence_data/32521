The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso for the zzso sole zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso DNA was zzso base pairs zzso in zzso zzso features of the 13 zzso zzso two zzso zzso and 22 transfer zzso are zzso The zzso control region zzso zzso was compared with those of the closely related soles zzso zzso and zzso zzso The typical conservative blocks were zzso A cluster of 42 and 22 zzso arrayed repeats was detected near the 3' end of control region in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, only two zzso of zzso or three copies zzso of an zzso repeated sequence motif was found in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 7 out of 9 of zzso bearing three copies grouped in a separate zzso zzso mechanisms influencing the evolution of control region among soles are zzso
