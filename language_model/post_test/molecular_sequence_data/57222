Many zzso zzso including skin, are known to develop as a consequence of zzso zzso Much less is known about the role of zzso interaction within the zzso or the zzso compartments in zzso To investigate zzso interactions during skin development, and the potential role of the zzso zzso in this process, we cloned the mouse zzso of zzso zzso and studied its expression pattern, starting as early as zzso zzso The novel application of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso allowed high resolution analysis to follow the fate of zzso expressing cells zzso In comparison with the distribution of Id zzso analysis confirmed that in the hair zzso high levels of zzso are expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells start expressing zzso as different cell types become distinguishable in the developing zzso zzso zzso expression persists throughout the growth phase of the zzso and maintains the same expression profile in the second hair zzso The cells in the zzso that undergo a phase of high level zzso expression are in transition from zzso precursors to several discreet, zzso cell zzso Our observations point out that both in time (during zzso and in space (by being removed one cell layer from the zzso zzso zzso expression is clearly separated from the zzso zzso This is a novel finding and suggests that zzso is important for zzso differentiation and possibly cell fate selection within the zzso
