zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a complex mixture zzso a common core zzso zzso alpha zzso the zzso zzso delta zzso zzso and of one of several zzso zzso specificity zzso The delta zzso together with several truncated zzso has been zzso and zzso from zzso zzso It is highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and contains two distinct regions, a 13 zzso zzso domain with fairly uniform charge distribution and a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso N) contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso as judged by circular zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region zzso zzso is largely zzso and highly charged zzso charge of zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso in the delta gene zzso contains a truncated delta zzso indicating that the zzso domain is stable in zzso and contains a zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso A or delta zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The ability of delta to zzso zzso efficiently requires the activities of both the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso Although delta C can also zzso zzso acids from zzso zzso this activity requires the addition of a large zzso excess of protein and is relatively non specific in that both DNA and zzso are zzso This suggests that the function of the zzso domain is to bind and orient the zzso region on the surface of zzso zzso
