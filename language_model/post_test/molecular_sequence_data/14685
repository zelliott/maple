Methane emissions have been previously detected from zzso but characterization of the diversity of zzso in this species has yet to be zzso This preliminary study identified zzso producing zzso also called zzso present in the feces from a colony of captive zzso orangutans at the zzso zzso All animals were housed in the same zzso and were fed primarily a zzso zzso zzso were detected using a zzso zzso gene clone zzso A total of zzso clones were zzso revealing 37 different zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Of these, 31 zzso represented by 170 clones had zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso four zzso (32 zzso had zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso while two zzso (five zzso had zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso Overall, five possible new species were identified from the clone zzso This represents the first report of zzso zzso a methanol zzso as the most zzso zzso in the gastrointestinal tract of zzso This is likely due to the increased availability of methanol from the highly zzso diet of the zzso Further studies are warranted to properly assess the effects of zzso diets on the zzso zzso
