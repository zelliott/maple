The zzso sequence has been determined for the zzso zzso zzso protein A zzso gene from zzso c strains zzso and zzso The zzso sequence for each zzso gene was virtually zzso although the gene from strain zzso contained a 24 base pair zzso A 29 zzso acid signal zzso was specified by each zzso gene with a mature protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso for strain zzso and 416 zzso acids zzso zzso for strain zzso In the zzso region of the zzso protein A, considerable sequence similarity was found with the membrane anchor region of proteins from other zzso organisms such as the group A zzso M protein and the group G zzso zzso binding zzso zzso to the proposed membrane anchor is a highly zzso region which may span the cell wall; both sequence data and experimental evidence indicate the existence of a region immediately outside the wall at which zzso zzso occurs to release zzso A of Mr zzso into the culture zzso Thus, the zzso protein A is a precursor of the zzso Mr zzso zzso
