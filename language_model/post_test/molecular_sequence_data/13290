zzso in the failed zzso connections zzso gene have been identified as dominant genetic enhancers of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso in fax all result in defective or absent protein zzso In a genetic background with zzso zzso function, the fax zzso zzso are zzso viable, demonstrating that fax is not an essential gene unless the animal is also zzso for zzso The fax gene encodes a novel zzso protein expressed in a zzso pattern similar to that of zzso in the embryonic zzso and zzso of the central nervous zzso The zzso zzso zzso between fax and another zzso modifier zzso disabled, reveal that the two proteins are likely to function together in a process downstream or parallel to the zzso protein zzso zzso
