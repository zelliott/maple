zzso zzso sequence repeats, zzso and zzso DNA markers were used to assess the structure of European zzso zzso populations showing different levels of zzso towards one of the most important zzso agents used in apple production, the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso individuals from 33 different populations a total of 92 different zzso were scored using six zzso zzso The global estimate of genetic differentiation for all 33 populations was not significantly different from zero, thus indicating a lack of genetic zzso zzso analysis revealed a very weak but significant zzso among zzso zzso populations from different geographic regions, however, no significant variation was evident between zzso resistant or susceptible zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1 in eight zzso zzso populations resulted in 27 zzso which were grouped in two distinct zzso Again, no genetic differentiation between zzso resistant and susceptible zzso zzso populations was zzso In addition, zzso analysis using zzso and association tests with zzso zzso found neither zzso nor individual correlations associated with zzso zzso zzso this lack of population structure does not allow discriminating between one or zzso separate origins of zzso zzso
