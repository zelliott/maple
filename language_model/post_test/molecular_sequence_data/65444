zzso play an important role in male sexual differentiation and zzso They exert their function by binding to and zzso the zzso zzso zzso a member of the steroid hormone zzso zzso Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso The complete transcript of zzso zzso is zzso zzso long zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our experimental and zzso analysis has found a single zzso locus in zzso zzso analysis using the zzso domain showed that the zzso zzso clustered with its zzso zzso to form a separate group, which was closer to the beta zzso than to the alpha zzso zzso expression analysis revealed that the zzso zzso was expressed zzso in all adult zzso tested, with sexually zzso expression in the zzso and zzso While the zzso transcript was zzso deposited into the zzso signs of zzso expression could be detected as early as 24 h after zzso and the expression level increased substantially zzso When analyzed during zzso development, the expression level of zzso zzso at 4 zzso after zzso was similar in both developing zzso but later became higher in the transforming zzso suggesting a potential role during male zzso zzso We also combined theoretical modeling with in zzso experiments to show that the zzso zzso is zzso activated by zzso
