In this study, the traditional zzso technique and the zzso zzso sequencing method were used to investigate the characterization of bacterial community in the stomach contents and zzso of yellow zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique disclosed that the average bacterial numbers in the gastric contents and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colony forming zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several different bacteria were obtained from gastric zzso including species from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, only two species were isolated from the gastric zzso including species from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed from the 65 positive clones from the stomach contents zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected from the 45 clones from the stomach zzso zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that the fish stomach zzso characteristic zzso where zzso was dominant, followed by zzso and zzso and zzso This characterization of bacterial community is markedly different from that of the fish zzso where zzso is zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was only found in the library zzso while zzso zzso was only found in the library zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso contents was quite different from that of zzso zzso In addition, several species of bacteria found in the stomach may be potentially opportunistic zzso indicating that fish zzso tract is a zzso for many zzso zzso
