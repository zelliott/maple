zzso zzso an important zzso disease zzso forms zzso colonies on blood zzso zzso is believed to result from zzso of iron zzso IX zzso derived from zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso bind and degrade zzso We have observed that zzso abolishing activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in loss of black pigmentation of zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso strains were reduced but not zzso we hypothesized that this zzso played a role in acquisition of zzso from zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso suggesting that this zzso played a role near the cell surface where high zzso of zzso zzso the black zzso Human zzso contains 11 zzso zzso in the alpha chain and 10 zzso zzso in the beta zzso In contrast, there are only three zzso zzso in each of the alpha and beta zzso These observations are consistent with human zzso being a preferred zzso for zzso but not zzso The ability of the zzso to cleave human zzso at zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso of zzso fragments resulting from zzso with the zzso zzso We were able to detect several of the predicted zzso fragments rendered by zzso with zzso zzso Thus, we zzso that the zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso which plays a role in zzso and iron zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso on the bacterial cell zzso
