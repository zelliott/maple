The zzso analogue of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and two zzso fragments zzso and zzso of the zzso sequence of this protein were zzso using the zzso strategy of solid phase zzso zzso The effect of the synthetic peptides upon the zzso migration of zzso zzso cells was studied in zzso The activity of the zzso analogue was found to be comparable with that of the initial zzso zzso both peptides inhibit the migration of zzso and zzso into inflammation zones of experimental zzso
