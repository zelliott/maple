A novel zzso strain, zzso zzso was isolated from a sample taken from zzso zzso zzso a marine zzso collected at a depth of 30 m from the Bay of zzso This strain was identified by using a zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso zzso should be assigned to the zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mainly zzso cellular fatty zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as cellular zzso supported zzso placement in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values obtained were well below the threshold that is required for the proposal of a novel zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data showed that strain zzso zzso merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
