As in many other zzso plant zzso bacteria, the zzso zzso zzso genes are involved in the production of a type III zzso apparatus that allows the zzso of zzso protein to the external zzso Here, we show that zzso genes are also involved in the zzso of zzso that are mainly composed of the zzso zzso These zzso are produced at one pole of the zzso and are also released into the external medium where they can form very long straight zzso An zzso zzso is defective in zzso production, impaired in interactions with plants and in zzso of the zzso protein but not in attachment to plant zzso
