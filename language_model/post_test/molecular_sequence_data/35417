zzso oxygen species zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their related dual zzso are known to have significant roles in innate immunity and cell zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso dual zzso zzso gene containing a full-length open reading frame was zzso It was shown to include an zzso signal zzso consisting of 28 zzso acid zzso a 240 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso an 802 zzso zzso region zzso which contains nine zzso zzso and a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso of 1,500 zzso acid zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso contains a typical zzso domain at the zzso followed by a zzso domain, a zzso domain, six zzso regions and binding zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was expressed more highly in the head, zzso and trachea compared to the zzso zzso zzso tube, zzso fat bodies and silk zzso zzso zzso was expressed during all the zzso stages of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was present mainly in the periphery of the zzso Some zzso zzso was zzso with rare signals in the zzso zzso of zzso was induced significantly in the zzso zzso upon challenge by zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae showed a marked increase in microbial proliferation in the zzso after zzso of zzso bacteria compared to the zzso We conclude that reducing zzso expression greatly increased the bacterial load, suggesting zzso has an important role in zzso microbial proliferation and the maintenance of zzso in the zzso zzso
