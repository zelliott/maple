Using DNA zzso analysis, zzso levels from zzso zzso zzso cells treated with the iron zzso zzso were compared with those supplemented with excessive iron, and subsequent to this, gene expression in the fur zzso was compared with that in the zzso strain under iron rich zzso The zzso analysis revealed many iron transport or storage systems that had been induced in response to the iron zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso using the iron as a zzso The zzso complex also affected some genes involved in various zzso functions zzso zzso membrane zzso electron transport and zzso defense, zzso The zzso protein still participated in the regulation of genes involved in broad cellular processes zzso factors, zzso activity, zzso storage and many proteins with unknown zzso that were not affected by iron depletion zzso In addition to its classical negative regulatory activities, the zzso protein activates gene zzso Using zzso tools, we were able to predict the zzso zzso zzso box sequence that was clearly the zzso motif in the promoter regions of members of the zzso zzso
