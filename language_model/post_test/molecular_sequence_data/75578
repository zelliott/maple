We have isolated zzso clones zzso human zzso from libraries constructed in a modified zzso zzso expression zzso by using zzso prepared from activated human T cell zzso zzso acid sequence of human zzso deduced from DNA sequence of these zzso clones agrees with that predicted from zzso sequence except at zzso acid position zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso analysis show that almost all activated T cell clones express zzso zzso with zzso similar to that observed in mouse T cell zzso However, striking difference was found in the level of zzso and zzso zzso expressed in activated human T zzso In contrast to mouse T cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed at least two orders of magnitude more abundant than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying human zzso zzso fused downstream to zzso leader sequence expressed and zzso biologically active zzso Several different rat zzso zzso have been used to confirm the presence of human zzso zzso The zzso human zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells or in zzso was observed to be zzso Human zzso expressed in zzso cells has zzso zzso activity in zzso cultures of bone zzso cells, and selectively induced the proliferation of zzso zzso or zzso blood cells in liquid zzso
