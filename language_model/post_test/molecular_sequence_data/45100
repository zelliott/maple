The zzso zzso was analyzed in both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso through zzso As a result, five and six transcripts were detected in zzso and zzso zzso Four of them have identical sequences between zzso and zzso Those are the transcripts with zzso 9, zzso 8 and 9, zzso 7 and 9, and zzso 7-9 spliced out compared normal zzso zzso that was detected in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso two additional transcripts were found in zzso zzso Its zzso 9 or zzso zzso were spliced out, but interestingly both possess a 170 zzso segment of sequence from zzso 7 of zzso We may conclude that a normal zzso protein does not exist in a zzso individual with zzso zzso zzso since the zzso 9 was always spliced out due to the silent zzso at the end of zzso zzso The transcripts without zzso 9 was also detected in the normal zzso individual and further confirmed by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso
