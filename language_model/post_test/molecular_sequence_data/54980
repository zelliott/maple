zzso comprise a group of 50 species of zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso region, have been zzso via several zzso to identify zzso stages of the zzso species that affect zzso These methods rely on the availability of accurate sequence information for each species, as well as detailed knowledge of the levels of zzso and zzso zzso Here, the zzso DNA region was amplified and zzso from 10 zzso species for which sequence was not previously zzso Also, additional zzso DNA sequences were generated from individual worms of 8 species already zzso Comparative analysis of these sequences revealed a greater range of zzso variation than previously reported (up to zzso whilst the level of zzso variation zzso was similar to that identified in earlier zzso The reverse line zzso zzso method has been used to exploit the zzso zzso DNA region for species zzso Here, we report validation of novel and existing DNA zzso for identification of zzso using this method and highlight their application in zzso zzso stages such as third-stage larvae that cannot be identified to species by zzso zzso
