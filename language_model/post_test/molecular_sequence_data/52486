The stimulating activity of several preparations isolated from a membrane zzso of a zzso smooth strain of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso burst of human blood zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso Five zzso derivatives were zzso a zzso zzso zzso obtained by drastic alkaline zzso and zzso by zzso an zzso preparation subjected to acid zzso that removed the core part and all fatty zzso leaving intact the zzso chain of zzso zzso an zzso preparation subjected to mild zzso zzso zzso a preparation obtained by mild alkaline zzso of zzso containing additional zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids bound to the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of the latter compound, zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and the whole bacterial cells had little or no zzso zzso itself and zzso zzso induced a weaker response than zzso zzso B zzso completely inhibited the zzso response to bacterial zzso zzso but not to zzso The stimulating action of zzso on blood zzso was dependent on the zzso levels of both calcium and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso the alpha chain of complement zzso type 3 zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso by zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso by zzso zzso and rough zzso Altogether, these findings provide indirect evidence for the contribution of the zzso zzso in the functional interaction of zzso with zzso zzso They demonstrate the role of fatty acids in the triggering of zzso zzso burst, while the zzso chain itself does not contribute to induction of the zzso response in this zzso In keeping with the effects of zzso and zzso we show that the zzso zzso response was triggered by bacterial zzso from the rough strain of zzso zzso Re zzso and its zzso A, but not by zzso from smooth zzso again suggesting a critical role for the zzso zzso
