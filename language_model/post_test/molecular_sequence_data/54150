High levels of zzso in zzso zzso are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA zzso Here, we describe a zzso forward zzso zzso for studying zzso zzso zzso in zzso In a zzso background with no zzso in DNA repair capacity, zzso of forward zzso that arise in the zzso gene under zzso conditions are deletions of zzso zzso Furthermore, the deletions characteristic of zzso zzso to discrete hotspots that coincide with 2-4 copies of a tandem zzso Although the signature deletions of zzso are not affected by the loss of zzso or zzso zzso bypass zzso they are completely eliminated by deletion of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso type zzso zzso zzso can be zzso into the context of a zzso zzso zzso which is sensitive enough to detect zzso deletions even in the absence of high zzso We suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso complexes is related to the level of zzso and that their removal leads to the signature zzso Given the high degree of conservation between DNA zzso zzso the links established here among transcription, zzso and zzso are likely to extend beyond the zzso zzso
