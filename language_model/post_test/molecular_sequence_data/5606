In zzso zzso the zzso gene is essential for cell cycle zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso enter the cell cycle and arrest at restrictive zzso We have identified two human zzso zzso proteins which share sequence identity to the zzso zzso The cell cycle arrest in zzso can be specifically zzso by the human zzso suggesting that they are functionally equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso Another clone identified in the search for human zzso proteins corresponded to the putative tumor zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 or zzso in multiple advanced zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso showed that it did not complement the zzso zzso and that it is more closely related to the zzso open reading frame zzso Human zzso and zzso were expressed as zzso zzso and both were shown to have kinetic properties characteristic of dual specific zzso The human zzso was localized in the nucleus while zzso has been reported to be localized in the zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso represent two zzso but zzso families of human and zzso zzso
