The zzso zzso in zzso zzso has a dual function where it is involved in the zzso of zzso and certain zzso A search for negative regulators of the zzso gene has resulted in the identification of zzso A zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso increase in zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated an increase in zzso zzso zzso that was specific to cells at high zzso In addition, the zzso zzso also resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was isolated by zzso and encodes a predicted protein of 365 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein exhibited zzso zzso acid zzso to the previously identified zzso protein of zzso coli and zzso zzso to a gene product from zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso gene was able to functionally complement the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as a T to G zzso that resulted in a zzso to zzso substitution at position 136 in the zzso zzso The zzso gene appears to be essential for cell viability as construction of a disrupted copy zzso was possible only in cells that carried an zzso copy of zzso or zzso
