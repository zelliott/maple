zzso transfer proteins zzso are relevant zzso and have recently been proposed as model plant zzso from fruit, vegetables, seeds, and zzso However, no zzso spice zzso has been characterized to zzso 

To identify and isolate saffron zzso and to explore their relevance in saffron zzso 

Six patients with zzso and positive skin prick test zzso results to saffron extract were zzso Two zzso zzso from saffron were isolated, cloned into zzso zzso and produced in zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed with the 2 zzso zzso and with the major zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

Full zzso corresponding to 2 saffron zzso zzso was isolated and expressed in P zzso The molecular weight of zzso s zzso and zzso s zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequences obtained had a zzso identity with each other and 51% and zzso with zzso p zzso Both proteins were recognized by zzso p 3 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was found in 50% of patients for zzso s zzso and zzso for zzso s zzso and zzso p 3 in the zzso zzso 

Our results indicated that zzso s zzso and zzso s zzso are minor zzso of saffron, at least in the study zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on the implication of zzso in spice zzso
