The alpha zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso plays a key role in assembly of the core zzso In previous studies the zzso domain consisting of 215 zzso acid zzso between positions 21 and 235 was identified to be involved in this zzso and the sites for beta and zzso association were suggested to be located within or near the two zzso regions in this zzso assembly domain of zzso For detailed functional zzso Ala was zzso for 26 highly zzso zzso acids around zzso 40, 80 and 170 to zzso The zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso for their abilities to form zzso and to assemble beta zzso zzso New types of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala for zzso at zzso zzso zzso but did not assemble beta (and zzso zzso and zzso showed a decreased level of alpha 2 beta zzso formation, indicating that this region zzso 45 to zzso is responsible for zzso Isolation of two zzso zzso and zzso both forming alpha 2 beta but not alpha 2 beta zzso complex, confirmed our previous conclusion that two separated regions participate in zzso
