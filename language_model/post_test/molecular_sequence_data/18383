zzso zzso (AP) activity is stage specific in mouse zzso and may be associated with zzso and separation of zzso from inner cell mass in zzso zzso We previously zzso a zzso and two mouse zzso genes that could contribute to the zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso were constructed from the three sequences and used in the reverse zzso chain reaction technique to establish that two of the three zzso zzso are transcribed during zzso zzso The zzso transcript zzso is from a gene highly zzso to the human zzso zzso but different from the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also is zzso but there is approximately 10 times less zzso than zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the zzso transcript of 7 to 14 day zzso and primordial germ zzso A switch in predominance from zzso to zzso must occur during early zzso zzso This study establishes a framework for experiments to determine the functions of the two zzso during zzso zzso
