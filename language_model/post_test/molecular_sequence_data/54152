One of the two essential zzso factors of zzso zzso is the zzso acid zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso were generated from zzso zzso The two selected for further study, zzso zzso and zzso were both converted into full-length zzso and zzso zzso having human zzso or zzso constant zzso These two zzso had similar binding zzso in zzso zzso activities, and in zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso reacting zzso The zzso bound to zzso specifically with estimated binding affinities zzso of zzso zzso and effective affinities zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso in an zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso or zzso A single zzso dose of either zzso given to zzso mice 18 h before challenge zzso about 50% protection against a lethal zzso spore challenge by the virulent zzso zzso Ames zzso More importantly, either zzso given 8 h or 20 h after challenge provided significant protection against lethal zzso Thus, these zzso zzso should be useful, alone or in combination with antitoxin zzso for achieving a safe and zzso zzso therapy for zzso
