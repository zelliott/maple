Cell zzso of zzso developing pumpkin zzso demonstrated that zzso precursor to zzso zzso is transported from the zzso zzso to dense zzso and then to the zzso in which zzso zzso is processed to the mature zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that dense zzso of about 300 zzso in diameter mediate the transport of zzso zzso to the zzso The primary structure of the precursor zzso zzso to pumpkin zzso zzso has been deduced from the zzso sequence of an isolated zzso zzso The presence of a zzso signal zzso at the zzso indicates that the precursor is a zzso that is converted into zzso zzso after zzso of the signal zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso in the isolated zzso revealed that the signal zzso is zzso off zzso on the zzso side of zzso zzso 22 of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso occur on the zzso sides of zzso zzso 35 and 74, which are zzso among precursors to zzso zzso from different zzso zzso analysis revealed that the two zzso zzso are located in the zzso regions of zzso zzso These findings suggest that a zzso processing zzso can recognize exposed zzso zzso on the molecular surface of zzso zzso and cleave the zzso bond on the zzso side of each zzso zzso to produce mature zzso zzso in the zzso
