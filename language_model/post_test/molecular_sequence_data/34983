zzso is a unique type I zzso whose zzso expression in zzso brain, small zzso and zzso zzso is only partially zzso Our previous observation that zzso events participate in the regulation of zzso zzso expression led us to investigate whether the zzso and/or 3' untranslated regions zzso have regulatory zzso Surprisingly, we found that full-length zzso zzso markedly suppressed zzso expression under zzso zzso Analysis of the secondary structure of this region predicted formation of two stable zzso structures, zzso 1 and zzso Studies using zzso zzso harboring various stretches of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso of loop structures was disrupted showed that loop 1 is essential for regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell extracts with zzso zzso harboring zzso loop structures identified zzso 9 zzso a molecular zzso and zzso as a candidate that associates with these regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso Our studies uncover a previously zzso function for zzso as a specific, and negative, zzso regulator of zzso zzso and they identify key roles for zzso zzso structure 1 in this zzso zzso effects on zzso appear to extend to additional zzso including zzso zzso that can form specific loop zzso
