Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso peptides can zzso the zzso of zzso An zzso zzso motif was mapped to its membrane zzso region and a double zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that its central turn motif had zzso zzso However, the zzso critical for zzso of zzso zzso were not zzso Using central turn peptides derived from zzso and zzso zzso critical for suppression of zzso zzso were identified and the importance of these zzso in zzso interactions was zzso 

zzso peptides were used to determine the capacity of the central turn peptides to suppress zzso and zzso zzso Far Western analysis was used to characterize the capacity of the peptides to interact with zzso and surface zzso resonance was used to characterize the binding of an zzso to the zzso tails of zzso and zzso 

The central turn zzso from zzso zzso has full zzso capacity while that derived from zzso requires additional zzso located adjacent to zzso Within these two sequences there is a switch in the position of an zzso and zzso zzso for a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This switch had a dramatic effect on their zzso capacity and on zzso zzso The two zzso and zzso zzso zzso at identical locations in both zzso appeared to be important in specifying the orientation by which proteins can dock to this region in zzso and zzso
