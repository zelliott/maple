zzso of zzso toxin zzso production directed by different gene zzso and zzso zzso mapping revealed the presence of a zzso promoter within the zzso coding zzso zzso of zzso in this region occurred in zzso El zzso and classical zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso from the zzso promoter and a stronger zzso binding site on the zzso zzso zzso contribute to achieve the correct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a CT zzso zzso expressing only zzso was used to detect promoter activity by restoration of zzso zzso zzso activity expressed in zzso and in zzso was detected upstream of the zzso zzso toxin zzso suggesting that this factor could be produced in zzso to contribute to fluid zzso No promoter activity was detected in zzso and in zzso upstream from the accessory zzso zzso zzso
