The direct zzso characterization of zzso zzso channels has been precluded by their small size and flat zzso An alternative to study these channels is to use zzso cells, the zzso of zzso which are larger and easier to zzso In mouse and zzso the only zzso zzso currents displayed by these cells are of the T zzso Because compounds that block these currents inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso reaction zzso at similar zzso it is likely that they are fundamental for this zzso Recent single channel recordings in mouse zzso demonstrated the presence of a zzso zzso This channel and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso acid zzso an zzso channel blocker zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso and other zzso channel zzso zzso zzso channels as well, it became important to determine whether they affect the zzso zzso currents of zzso zzso These currents were blocked in a zzso manner by zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso The zzso values at zzso zzso were 43 zzso for zzso 28 zzso for zzso and 15 zzso for zzso Moreover, zzso partially inhibited the zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso and zzso displayed an zzso value of 6 zzso for this zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso do not inhibit the zzso zzso by blocking zzso zzso zzso while zzso may do zzso Interestingly 200 zzso zzso was basically unable to inhibit zzso zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso questioning that this alpha zzso codes for the zzso zzso channels present in zzso zzso Evidence for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso and in round and condensing zzso is zzso
