zzso zzso 1 zzso shares sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is capable of zzso and zzso of both zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In zzso however, zzso predominantly activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso are zzso We have identified a major site of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment of a zzso active zzso decreased zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso was rapidly zzso by zzso zzso of zzso to zzso decreased zzso zzso activity with a zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso of a second zzso zzso zzso to zzso eliminated the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso is an zzso reaction because active zzso cannot zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso on zzso within cells, suggesting that the zzso of zzso in zzso results from zzso rather than zzso by an upstream zzso zzso of zzso via zzso of zzso might be an immediate response to initial zzso zzso through zzso zzso
