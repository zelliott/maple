Four prior zzso have been reported in three patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso none of whom had the zzso zzso zzso form of the zzso We identified two zzso in the first reported case of zzso zzso zzso zzso whose cultured zzso had zzso zzso of residual zzso The first zzso was a zzso transition at position 1061 of the zzso in zzso 6 that gave rise to an zzso substitution in zzso 354 zzso The second was a zzso transition at position 1831 in zzso 12 that produced an zzso substitution in zzso 611 zzso zzso expression in zzso cells revealed that both zzso zzso were zzso as zzso precursors in normal zzso but both exhibited accelerated zzso The expressed zzso zzso had a zzso zzso of 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso and a specific activity zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso of 20 zzso and no zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso produced on zzso with zzso and zzso was nearly identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells gave similar residual activities relative to the zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso formed mixed zzso with zzso rat zzso but the product of zzso did zzso The higher than expected activity, both in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso provides further evidence that zzso can partially correct some zzso zzso apparently by driving the folding reaction of zzso or the assembly into zzso by mass zzso
