zzso zzso coli molecular zzso zzso zzso has been further zzso from tightly bound zzso zzso by two different zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso by using the zzso dye zzso yellow zzso as affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso yellow binds specifically to aromatic zzso side chains present in the majority of zzso but has no affinity to zzso because of its low content of aromatic zzso Some zzso zzso are buried within the zzso cavity of the zzso zzso whereas others are exposed on its surface and available for zzso interactions and the complex is thereby retarded on zzso yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained after zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso into functional zzso zzso The final preparation contained no zzso zzso bound to zzso as judged by zzso analysis and lack of zzso zzso zzso preparations also displayed two equally strong bands on native zzso suggesting the presence of two zzso zzso of zzso showed zzso with respect to zzso point and molecular mass when zzso by zzso and zzso under native and zzso conditions zzso By use of zzso highly accurate molecular masses of zzso and a truncated form of zzso were determined and verified, by comparison with their respective gene zzso
