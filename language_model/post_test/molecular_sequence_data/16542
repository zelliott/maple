zzso zzso were made for 15 zzso acids in the zzso loop between zzso zzso 6 and 7 zzso of the human zzso of zzso Most zzso reduced zzso activity by less than zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso activity by 75, 89, and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation from zzso was reduced in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso also had a faster zzso zzso zzso zzso rate compared with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso domain of the protein were also demonstrated by zzso exchange, which showed that intrinsic rate zzso for zzso binding and/or reaction with the protein were zzso Although most zzso zzso had no effect on the interaction of zzso or zzso with zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the apparent affinity of the zzso for both zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso a competitive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was used to test whether charged zzso in zzso are involved in binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding to wild type zzso with an zzso of 30 zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was still inhibited by zzso indicating that zzso does not bind to charged zzso in zzso This observation makes it unlikely that zzso functions as a zzso zzso binding site in zzso and together with the effects of zzso zzso on zzso interactions with the zzso suggests that zzso is important in stabilizing the zzso domain and its relationship to the zzso binding sites of the zzso
