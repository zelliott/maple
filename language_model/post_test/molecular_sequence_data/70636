The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a critical factor in positive control of zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are essential proteins required for zzso growth, whereas alternative zzso factors mediate zzso in response to various zzso Late gene expression during zzso zzso in zzso zzso is dependent upon an alternative zzso factor, zzso the product of the zzso zzso We have characterized the intermediate complexes formed by zzso zzso on the zzso to open complex zzso zzso with the promoter for the zzso gene zzso were analyzed using zzso I and zzso zzso over a range of zzso We propose a model in which closed complexes are established in the upstream region of the promoter, including the zzso element, but with little significant contact in the zzso element or downstream regions of the zzso An zzso event extends the DNA contacts into the zzso element and the start site, with loss of the most zzso upstream contacts accompanied by DNA melting to form open zzso Melting occurs efficiently even at 16 degrees zzso Once open complexes have formed, they are unstable to zzso challenge even in the presence of zzso zzso which have been observed to stabilize open complexes at zzso zzso
