A new zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from a culture of the strictly zzso and extremely zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass was 30 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso showed the zzso zzso activity higher than pH zzso in zzso buffer at 40 degrees zzso zzso of the oxidized insulin zzso followed by mass zzso analysis of the zzso products revealed that as many as 24 of the total 29 zzso bonds are zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso has a widespread zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the activity and stability of zzso unlike known zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso comprised 279 zzso acids plus 97 zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of mature zzso was confirmed by zzso liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso which was the zzso coverage of the deduced zzso acid zzso The mature zzso showed moderate zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso with zzso identity, and both zzso formed a new zzso at an intermediate position among true zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso tree of zzso family zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso reported from a strict zzso in this zzso
