zzso as the probable earliest offshoot of the zzso tree, represents a key zzso for understanding zzso zzso To gain further insight into the zzso evolution and zzso organization of the zzso we have established the first zzso comparative zzso map between human and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso species on the zzso branch, by zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, 22 human zzso paints revealed 41 zzso segments in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results provide further support for the notion that the 2 human zzso zzso associations, zzso zzso zzso and zzso could constitute the zzso that unite the zzso Moreover, we propose that the putative ancestral zzso zzso closely resemble the zzso zzso 54 zzso of the zzso zzso consisting of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso 11, zzso zzso 13, zzso zzso 17, 18, zzso 20, and zzso In addition, we have zzso the zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 7 novel repetitive DNA zzso providing further information on the complexity of zzso architecture of zzso zzso
