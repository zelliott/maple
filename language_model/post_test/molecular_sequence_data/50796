We have previously reported the cloning of zzso for a zzso zzso zzso of man, designated zzso zzso Shephard, zzso Palmer, zzso zzso Smith & Phillips (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is the zzso of pig and rabbit zzso zzso We now describe the isolation and characterization of zzso clones for a second human zzso which we have designated zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso is zzso zzso acid zzso long, has a calculated zzso of zzso and contains putative zzso and zzso sites that align exactly with those described in other zzso zzso Human zzso has zzso primary sequence identity with human zzso rabbit pulmonary zzso and rabbit liver zzso form 2, and thus represents a fourth, zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso is present in low abundance in adult human zzso Southern zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that human zzso and zzso are the products of single zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso chain reaction, to human zzso 1, the same zzso on which zzso is zzso
