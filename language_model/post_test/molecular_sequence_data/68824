The aim of this study was to identify in rat zzso cellular zzso that bind protein zzso C zzso and may influence its activity and its zzso At least seven zzso with apparent zzso values between 12,000 and zzso that behave like zzso for zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso fraction of these zzso zzso zzso bound to these zzso when it was in its active zzso zzso seem to be zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso suggested some selectivity of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso approximately zzso region bound zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso whereas those of zzso approximately zzso bound all zzso zzso and, in contrast with the other zzso they did this even in the absence of zzso zzso I zzso which has a sequence suggested to be involved in the zzso interaction zzso zzso Lopez and Smith (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso directed against zzso I prevented zzso binding to zzso The data suggest that zzso I blocks zzso binding to zzso by two zzso zzso of zzso activity and competition with a putative binding zzso
