An analysis of published zzso sequences of the zzso region zzso of 7 zzso and 3 zzso has allowed us to derive a consensus secondary structure model that differs from that previously proposed for the zzso of zzso and zzso though all these viruses belong to the same family, zzso The theoretical model derived here was zzso supported by investigating the accessibility of zzso virus zzso to modifications with zzso zzso and its zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The possible involvement of the zzso secondary structure zzso in the zzso control is briefly zzso
