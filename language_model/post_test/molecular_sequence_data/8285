In order to determine whether distributing the pairing bases in zzso I and III of a zzso zzso zzso would enhance the zzso of zzso zzso designed to degrade cellular zzso we measured the zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso targeted to the zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso Five zzso were formed from three beta zzso synthetic zzso zzso and two zzso zzso core zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso contained 8 zzso in zzso I and 7 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso had 13 zzso in zzso I and 4 zzso in zzso III, zzso zzso beta zzso had 11 zzso in zzso I and 4 zzso in zzso III, while zzso zzso beta zzso contained 8 zzso in zzso I and 4 zzso in zzso zzso The ability of each zzso to cleave its zzso zzso was first assessed under zzso conditions at 37 degrees zzso These studies revealed that only zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso effectively zzso their zzso Further studies using a 80 degrees C, zzso degrees C, zzso temperature cycling paradigm were performed to increase the zzso efficiency of the zzso Under these conditions zzso beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso were zzso well zzso zzso the fact that the zzso zzso beta zzso was more active than its zzso counterparts indicates that zzso distributing the pairing bases in zzso I and III around this zzso site is zzso
