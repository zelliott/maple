We report here the rational design and construction of a zzso transfer zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso acid specific zzso was transformed into a highly efficient zzso of zzso and zzso and a moderate zzso of zzso The transformation was guided by available knowledge of the requirements for zzso by each of the three zzso acids and was achieved by zzso changes in the local sequence context and the structural framework of the variable loop and the two variable regions of the zzso zzso The changes introduced to zzso efficient acceptance of the three zzso acids eliminate zzso with zzso The interplay of zzso and zzso for different specific zzso and the constraints imposed by the structural zzso suggest that a zzso with an appreciable capacity for more than three efficient zzso may be inherently difficult to zzso
