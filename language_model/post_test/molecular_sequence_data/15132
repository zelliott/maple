The zzso of zzso zzso is generally performed by the analysis of zzso or zzso zzso by zzso field gel zzso zzso or zzso chain reaction zzso zzso However, zzso methods allow typing technique zzso and data zzso In the present study 100 zzso zzso zzso obtained from various institutions in the state of zzso Germany, were zzso analyzed by surface layer protein A single locus sequence typing zzso A high proportion zzso of zzso attributable to zzso zzso zzso was found indicating that the new outbreak strain has become endemic, at least in parts of zzso zzso strains displayed characteristic zzso of the potential toxin zzso gene zzso and zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso attributable to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and to more sporadic zzso were also zzso Overall, the prevalence of strains with resistance to zzso or zzso was zzso zzso allows the comprehensive identification of zzso zzso strains by global data comparison, exemplified here by our identification of zzso strains previously identified by zzso of a Japanese zzso In conclusion, zzso appears to be a powerful zzso tool for the straightforward, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
