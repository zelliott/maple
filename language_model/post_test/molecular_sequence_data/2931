The zzso protein of zzso zzso stimulates the expression of zzso acid zzso genes under conditions of zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso of these zzso zzso contains sequences zzso to the zzso domain of protein zzso We show here that substitution of a highly zzso zzso in the presumed zzso site of this domain zzso the zzso of zzso zzso genes under zzso zzso This result supports the idea that protein zzso activity is required for zzso positive regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the entire zzso zzso unit, and measurement of the molecular weight of zzso protein expressed in zzso indicate that zzso is a Mr approximately 180,000 protein and contains a Mr approximately 60,000 segment zzso to zzso zzso zzso juxtaposed to the protein zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso in the zzso coding sequences zzso zzso regulatory zzso Based on these results, we propose that the zzso zzso domain responds to the presence of zzso zzso by zzso the adjacent protein zzso zzso thus providing a means of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression to the availability of zzso zzso
