zzso zzso zzso are precursor proteins of egg envelope of zzso and zzso in the zzso female liver in response to zzso We linked a gene construct zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso gene fused with a green zzso protein zzso zzso to another construct zzso (a zzso region of embryonic zzso gene fused with an zzso zzso injected the double fusion gene construct into zzso or zzso zzso and selected zzso expressing the zzso in zzso zzso From the zzso we established two lines of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso females and zzso zzso males displayed the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was detected in the zzso liver of the stage zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso expression was found in the liver of the stage 34 zzso of wild zzso suggesting that such zzso is achieved shortly after differentiation of the zzso Analysis using serial deletion zzso fused with zzso showed that the region zzso to zzso of the zzso gene or the region zzso to zzso of the zzso gene had the ability to promote the zzso zzso zzso expression of its downstream zzso Further analyses suggested that an zzso response element zzso at zzso an zzso zzso at zzso and a binding site for zzso at zzso of the zzso gene played important roles in its downstream zzso gene zzso In addition, this transgenic zzso may be useful as one of the test animals for detecting environmental zzso zzso
