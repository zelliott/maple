zzso a common site of viral integration in zzso zzso zzso is located within a large zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso integration at zzso appears to induce disease by zzso normal zzso zzso During our attempts to characterize the nature of the zzso located at zzso we found that approximately half of the zzso were defective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jenkins, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was surprising, since most zzso characterized at other zzso common integration sites are full-length zzso zzso In the studies described here, we found that this defective zzso carries two large zzso one in pol and one in zzso and is structurally related to another zzso zzso the zzso AIDS zzso By using zzso zzso specific for this defective zzso designated zzso we showed that zzso zzso are carried as zzso germ line zzso in most zzso zzso In addition, we identified the zzso zzso zzso that gives rise to the defective zzso identified at zzso We present a model that accounts for the positive selection of zzso zzso at zzso which may allow selective identification of common viral integration sites harboring tumor zzso zzso
