A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which can detect target zzso has been zzso AES is an zzso zzso bearing a zzso binding site which can zzso control zzso zzso The zzso zzso bearing a zzso structure was chosen as the zzso zzso The zzso structure, which contains a strand complementary to the target DNA, was inserted into the zzso structure of the zzso zzso to disrupt the zzso structure through the zzso of the target DNA with the complementary strand in the zzso The disruption of the zzso structure led to a decrease of the zzso activity of the whole zzso zzso Using this designed zzso we were able to detect target zzso by measuring the zzso activity in a homogeneous solution without zzso zzso and the lower detection limit was 20 zzso
