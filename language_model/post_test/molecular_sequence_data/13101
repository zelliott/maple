zzso termination factor zzso from zzso coli is a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso an zzso release of nascent zzso zzso A zzso zzso has three distinct zzso functioning independently at the first zzso the zzso one quarter containing a primary zzso site, the central zzso acids region zzso an zzso domain with zzso to zzso and the zzso remainder with unknown zzso To further delineate the structural and functional organizations of zzso zzso we undertook its random zzso using zzso zzso chain reactions with the zzso zzso acid region chosen as the initial zzso From 14 zzso identified, zzso protein was zzso and characterized in zzso Of these, 11 zzso are defective in termination in zzso and show decreased activities in various partial functions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities dependent on three zzso with decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A few of them are also affected in the putative secondary zzso site that is functionally coupled to zzso zzso By contrast, the three other zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso interaction at the primary zzso In these properties, the zzso zzso zzso resemble the zzso zzso zzso formerly found in the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that the zzso region plays a pivotal role in functionally zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso by acting as an interface for their interaction within or across individual zzso In light of the reported X-ray zzso structure of zzso we propose a model for the zzso and zzso structure of zzso that is consistent with the observed zzso effects as well as a number of structural and functional properties characteristic of zzso
