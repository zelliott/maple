The zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso mediate interactions by binding to specific zzso acid sequences in target zzso The solution structure of the second zzso domain of zzso zzso displays a compact fold with six beta strands and two zzso A unique feature of this domain compared to the zzso zzso fold is an extended flexible loop at the base of the binding pocket, termed zzso that folds back onto the protein zzso a feature that is shared by both the zzso and human zzso The structure of zzso differs significantly from the zzso human zzso A comparison of structural quality indicators clearly demonstrates that the zzso ensemble is statistically more reasonable than that of the human zzso The analysis of zzso relaxation data for zzso shows a normal pattern, with more rigid secondary structures and more flexible loop zzso Close to the binding pocket, zzso and zzso display greater mobility when compared to surrounding zzso zzso binding studies demonstrated a lack of interaction between zzso zzso and the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is not an in zzso target for zzso In addition, zzso specifically binds the C zzso of both human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso despite zzso containing a zzso zzso sequence of zzso A model of zzso with the zzso zzso reveals that the zzso binding pocket is able to accommodate the zzso zzso of zzso acid while maintaining crucial protein to zzso hydrogen bond zzso
