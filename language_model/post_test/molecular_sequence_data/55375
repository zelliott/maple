A new zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The full-length gene consists of zzso and encodes zzso zzso acids including a putative zzso signal zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows the highest identity of zzso to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a high specific activity of zzso towards soluble wheat zzso exhibited optimal activity at pH zzso and zzso showed broad pH zzso zzso of the maximum activity at pH zzso was resistant to neutral zzso and most zzso and produced simple zzso The zzso products of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were predominantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and no zzso These characteristics suggest that zzso has potential in various applications, especially in the food zzso
