zzso is the most recently approved human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and is active against many zzso type 1 zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso shows a high genetic barrier to resistance development, and virus strains with lower sensitivity to zzso have a higher number of zzso zzso zzso than viruses resistant to other zzso In this work, we have zzso and structurally characterized a number of highly zzso clinically derived zzso with high levels of zzso resistance to zzso With 18 to 21 zzso acid zzso changes, the zzso zzso studied in this work are the most highly zzso zzso zzso species ever studied by means of zzso zzso and X-ray zzso The zzso proteins showed major defects in zzso zzso while the zzso turnover was less zzso zzso the overall zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso that of the zzso zzso is still sufficient to support zzso processing and particle maturation in the corresponding zzso The X-ray structures of drug-resistant zzso zzso with zzso suggest that the impaired inhibitor binding could be explained by change in the zzso hydrogen bond pattern in the zzso binding pocket due to a substantial shift of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and X-ray structural analysis thus help to explain zzso resistance development in zzso zzso
