The zzso sequence of gene 18 of zzso T4 was determined by the zzso method, partially aided by the zzso zzso To confirm the deduced zzso acid sequence of the tail sheath protein zzso that is zzso by gene 18, zzso was extensively zzso by zzso or zzso zzso and subjected to zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso 40 zzso which cover zzso of the primary structure, were zzso the zzso acid compositions were determined, and the corresponding sequences in DNA were zzso Furthermore, the zzso acid sequences of 10 of the 40 peptides were determined by a gas phase protein zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso which consists of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso was zzso
