zzso gene zzso are the most frequent genetic zzso in the zzso of adult acute zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso and no evidence of typical fusion genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using direct sequencing we previously identified six different zzso zzso within zzso 12 zzso the zzso zzso Because of these zzso the shuttling protein zzso is zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso cells zzso Here, we designed and tested a zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso To assess zzso sensitivity, zzso and zzso we analyzed DNA from 120 primary adult zzso and compared zzso results with zzso and zzso All zzso profiles in the 26 zzso zzso were different from the wild type, indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, B, and D, and all zzso A cases gave identical zzso zzso The other zzso showed typical zzso with zzso B and D differing for one zzso zzso profiles and sequencing also identified four new zzso Our results suggest that zzso detects zzso as well as direct sequencing and zzso providing a helpful approach in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
