It is generally believed that zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso synthesis and release in the zzso of zzso However, the identity of the zzso zzso of zzso is still unresolved in zzso zzso including zzso In this study, we have successfully identified the chicken zzso zzso zzso which consists of seven zzso including two zzso zzso 4 and 5) coding for the predicted mature zzso zzso of 47 zzso zzso Interestingly, the differential usage of zzso donor sites at zzso 6 results in the generation of two zzso zzso and 188 zzso acids in zzso with different zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso was detected to be predominantly expressed in the zzso by zzso zzso Using the zzso reporter system, we further demonstrated that both the synthetic zzso peptides zzso and zzso and zzso medium from zzso cells expressing zzso could strongly induce zzso activity via zzso of zzso indicating that zzso could bind zzso and activate downstream zzso zzso A signaling zzso Using the same system, zzso zzso was also shown to be capable of zzso zzso in zzso As in chicken, a zzso zzso gene was identified in the zzso of lower zzso species including zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso perhaps together with zzso zzso zzso may function as the authentic zzso zzso of zzso in chicken as well as in other lower zzso zzso
