The rat zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein that is expressed zzso The zzso and steroid hormone responsive expression of the zzso gene is zzso regulated by a promoter with multiple zzso and zzso elements that exhibit activity controlled by a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we established the contribution of the rat zzso zzso box domain zzso to zzso a zzso zzso element with a zzso motif as a central core, to zzso activity of the rat zzso gene with in zzso zzso zzso By this same zzso however, the highly zzso zzso of 24 zzso human OC box element was unable to compete for zzso factor binding with the rat OC zzso In zzso zzso interaction studies confirm the presence of two protein binding sites in the OC box region, one of which zzso the zzso motif and, at least in part, accounts for zzso zzso Competition analysis established that the single zzso substitution of zzso for zzso which converts the core motif of the rat OC box zzso to the core motif of the human OC box zzso accounts for observed species differences in zzso factor zzso The zzso zzso interactions are heat stable and insensitive to zzso zzso At second zzso interaction located upstream of the zzso motif includes two zzso zzso These interactions are heat zzso and sensitive to zzso treatment in contrast to the zzso zzso The human OC promoter contains only a single zzso zzso while two steroid zzso with an 11 zzso zzso are present in the rat OC zzso These observed variations in sequence organization and zzso factor binding in analogous zzso zzso regulatory regions of the OC gene promoter may provide a basis for zzso variations in responsiveness to zzso zzso of OC gene expression at the zzso zzso
