Group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is generally known to display potent zzso zzso activity, while group zzso zzso zzso reportedly is zzso In this work, a novel zzso named zzso was identified from zzso zzso zzso and its zzso activity was studied as zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein precursor was zzso acid in zzso and contained a predicted zzso acid signal zzso and a zzso acid mature zzso Unlike the well-known zzso which have 14 zzso forming 7 zzso zzso bridges, zzso possesses 15 zzso The additional zzso might contribute to the formation of an zzso zzso bridge of the zzso zzso In the biological activities zzso zzso displayed the activities of zzso and zzso against zzso coli and zzso zzso This study is the first report about zzso zzso activity of zzso
