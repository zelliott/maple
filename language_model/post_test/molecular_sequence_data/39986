The zzso initiation region zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso which encodes zzso protein S1, shows a number of unusual zzso It extends far upstream (to position zzso of the zzso zzso it lacks a zzso zzso sequence zzso element, and it can fold into three successive zzso zzso II, and zzso that are essential for high zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso of zzso I and II, have been proposed to form a zzso zzso Here, we have tested this hypothesis with the zzso zzso zzso Depending upon the zzso used, translation initiation was decreased three- to zzso upon changing the zzso zzso to zzso However, although chemical probing showed that the zzso zzso were accessible, no restoration was observed when the zzso zzso was zzso changed from zzso to zzso When the same change was introduced in the zzso from a conventional zzso as a control, activity was zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso do not form a zzso zzso Others hypotheses that may account for their role are zzso zzso we also find that, when expressed at moderate level (30 to zzso of total zzso specialized zzso are only twofold disadvantaged over normal zzso for the translation of bulk cellular zzso These findings suggest that, under these conditions, the zzso interaction plays a significant but not essential role for the synthesis of bulk cellular zzso
