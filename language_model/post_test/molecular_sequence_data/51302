The modifications of zzso patterns were studied when Southern zzso carrying zzso DNA samples, were zzso with eight synthetic tandem repeats zzso related by sequence variations in the basic zzso Because zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso they usually give patterns looking more like DNA zzso but we found that even small modifications in the zzso zzso could cause major changes in the zzso profiles and could induce a shift of fingerprint pattern towards the detection of only one or two zzso This enables the use of zzso as direct genetic markers for linkage analysis, without cloning of the corresponding DNA zzso Moreover, the set of zzso zzso can suggest consensus sequences allowing some prediction of the zzso zzso
