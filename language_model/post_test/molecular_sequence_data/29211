The zzso composition of the internally transcribed sequences zzso of the six zzso zzso of two strains of zzso zzso were zzso Four variable and five zzso zzso blocks were zzso Five different modular organizations were revealed for each strain and no zzso zzso showed the same succession of zzso This suggests that zzso frequently occurs between the zzso zzso leading to the exchange of zzso zzso The modular structure was also observed within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showing the same number of constant blocks but with fewer variable zzso This confirms that a high degree of ITS zzso is a common characteristic among zzso zzso The functional significance of the combinations of variable and constant zzso blocks of the ITS was examined by in zzso prediction of secondary structures from zzso zzso The secondary structures were shown to be analogous whatever the combination of zzso blocks at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
