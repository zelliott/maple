Previous studies have shown that gene zzso play a significant role in zzso Gene zzso involving the human zzso zzso zzso gene have been identified as a mechanism for zzso zzso in human zzso zzso In 2 zzso human cancer zzso with high levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso hybrid zzso containing sequences from zzso and an unrelated gene have previously been zzso To characterize and determine the site of the zzso resulting in generation of hybrid zzso we first constructed a zzso zzso library extending over a zzso zzso region of 100 zzso and containing the region upstream of zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso was observed involving an zzso repeat 80 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso with a 79 zzso zzso deletion flanked by zzso sequences at the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells with zzso repeats near the junction zzso While the specific features of the zzso appear to be different, zzso repeats might be involved in both gene zzso The gene zzso at or near the zzso sequence should be regarded as potentially involved in the zzso zzso of human zzso
