To better understand how the zzso system functions in birds, we zzso a molecular cloning strategy to sequence and characterize the chicken zzso gene that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This gene has seven zzso and six zzso with evidence for an additional zzso first zzso and two promoter zzso We identified two distinct classes of zzso zzso transcripts zzso and zzso produced by alternative zzso at their zzso These were zzso in all zzso examined with zzso and zzso showing the highest levels of zzso Although both zzso classes contained coding sequence for zzso and zzso class A zzso lacked that portion of the coding region zzso containing zzso zzso class B zzso had a larger zzso that included zzso Both classes of zzso transcripts exhibited two zzso each with a different zzso arising from alternate promoter and alternate first zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso expression despite significant changes in plasma zzso zzso To investigate potential differences in zzso precursor processing among zzso zzso expression for two zzso zzso zzso genes was zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso was more highly expressed in zzso and zzso We also determined zzso expression of the specific zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso to help define major sites of hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso was most highly expressed in liver and abdominal fat, whereas zzso and zzso zzso genes were highly expressed in the gastrointestinal zzso brain, zzso and abdominal zzso These results offer new insights into structure and function of the chicken zzso zzso processing of the precursor proteins produced from it and potential activity sites for zzso zzso hormones zzso by their zzso zzso
