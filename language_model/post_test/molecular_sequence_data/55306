zzso zzso has recently emerged as an important zzso zzso zzso Defining population structure in this species is required to provide insight into the existence, distribution, and dynamics of specific zzso or zzso lineages in particular zzso like the zzso Here, we probe the population structure of zzso zzso using zzso population genetic modeling implemented in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis involved zzso zzso belonging to zzso sequence types zzso zzso for zzso zzso and 28 for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grouped into 13 zzso zzso but the large majority zzso of zzso zzso clustered in two zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso groups 2 and 3 confirmed the existence of three separate hospital lineages zzso 18, and zzso highlighting different evolutionary zzso for zzso 2-1 zzso zzso and 3-3 zzso 17 and lineage zzso zzso zzso analysis of 29 zzso zzso zzso showed agreement between zzso assignment of zzso and their relative positions in the zzso zzso zzso ratio calculation confirmed the significant association between hospital zzso with zzso 3-3 and lineages 17, 18, and zzso zzso analysis showed a scarce number of zzso events between the different zzso zzso For the zzso zzso hospital population, we propose an evolutionary model in which strains with a high propensity to colonize and zzso hospitalized patients arise through horizontal gene zzso Once adapted to the distinct hospital zzso this zzso becomes isolated, and zzso with other populations zzso 

zzso zzso zzso has become one of the most important zzso zzso causing increasing numbers of zzso infections zzso Here, we used zzso population genetic analysis to identify groups of related zzso zzso strains and show a significant association of hospital and farm animal zzso to different genetic zzso We also found that hospital zzso could be divided into three lineages originating from sequence types zzso 17, 18, and zzso We propose that, driven by the selective pressure in hospitals, the three hospital lineages have arisen through horizontal gene transfer, but once adapted to the distinct zzso zzso this population has become isolated and zzso with other populations zzso zzso of the population structure is a prerequisite for effective control of zzso zzso zzso since it provides insight into the processes that have led to the progressive change of zzso zzso from an innocent zzso to a zzso zzso zzso
