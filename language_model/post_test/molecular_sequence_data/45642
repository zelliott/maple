Down syndrome critical region gene zzso 2 zzso belongs to the human zzso gene family, which also includes zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins interact with zzso a zzso zzso To date, no zzso has been described for zzso The aim of this work was to perform a first functional study of zzso using zzso zzso analysis conducted on a human heart zzso zzso Here, we report the interaction between zzso and the human cardiac zzso I zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex, a central component of the zzso zzso This interaction was confirmed by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso Moreover, a new zzso zzso zzso generated by alternative zzso was identified and cloned in different zzso it lacks two central zzso zzso the most zzso zzso among the zzso protein zzso A quantitative relative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso showed that in heart tissue the zzso expression level ratio for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso fusion protein zzso demonstrated the interaction between this new zzso zzso and the human cardiac zzso I and the prominent role of zzso zzso 2 in determining binding between both zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate an entirely new role for a zzso family zzso suggesting a possible involvement of zzso in cardiac zzso
