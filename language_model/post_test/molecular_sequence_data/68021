We zzso that inclusion of zzso proteins in the set of reference native proteins may better represent the zzso form in the current circular zzso zzso analyses of proteins involving unfolding zzso Adding three zzso zzso and one zzso spectrum to 16 reference protein zzso markedly improved the correlation zzso zzso between CD calculations and X-ray zzso for the zzso form and, to a lesser extent, for zzso but the zzso for zzso and zzso decreased zzso With 20 reference proteins the estimates of the zzso form of zzso proteins were significantly zzso Thus, we suggest that as a compromise the new set of reference proteins be used for zzso the changes in zzso for unfolding zzso However, the current use of 16 reference native proteins appears to be adequate for CD analysis of native proteins and the expansion to 20 reference proteins including zzso ones may not enhance the analysis of native zzso
