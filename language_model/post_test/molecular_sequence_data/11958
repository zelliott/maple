We determined the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso segments of zzso virus zzso zzso 2, 11, 13, and 17, which zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso gene contained zzso zzso and was 10 bases shorter than the previously reported zzso gene of zzso zzso A single open reading frame which could zzso the reported zzso zzso zzso zzso acids in size, began with an initiation zzso at zzso zzso and a termination zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso genes and the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso proteins of the five zzso zzso zzso indicated that the most recently isolated zzso zzso from Florida was more zzso related than zzso 11, 13, and 17, which were isolated primarily in the western zzso The results are consistent with our hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are derived from a single and common gene pool, and that zzso belongs to a second, distinct gene zzso These genetic distinctions also reflected well with the known geographic distribution of the five zzso zzso zzso in North zzso This putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a basic zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso proteins contained seven highly zzso zzso zzso and many other sequence motifs which were also found in other known zzso zzso Four zzso but linear zzso zzso zzso among the zzso of five zzso zzso were also been identified and mapped using zzso zzso zzso
