In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene was initially isolated as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused by depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the synthesis of zzso zzso the first zzso in zzso zzso pathway, which is zzso to zzso zzso zzso has a well zzso zzso domain called zzso at the zzso region and is predicted to be a zzso factor in zzso zzso However, its role has not been revealed in further zzso Here we examined its expression pattern and the zzso of its zzso zzso to get clues on its zzso 

Fluorescence from the zzso expressed from a zzso fusion gene demonstrated that it is localized primarily in the nucleus, and is distinctly visible during the stationary zzso When we replaced the zzso zzso domain of zzso with the DNA binding domain of zzso a zzso zzso factor, the zzso protein caused the zzso of transcripts from zzso genes such as zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso possesses zzso zzso activity when bound to zzso The amount of zzso transcripts sharply increased as cells entered the stationary phase and was maintained at high level throughout the stationary zzso zzso shift down to low nitrogen or carbon sources caused zzso induction during the exponential phase, suggesting that cells need zzso for maintenance function during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed decreased viability in long-term culture, whereas overproduction of zzso increased zzso zzso in long-term survival was also observed for zzso under zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was more sensitive to various zzso and heat zzso When we examined zzso of the zzso zzso strain, significant decrease in the formation of zzso spores was zzso 

zzso is a zzso regulator whose synthesis is elevated during stationary phase and by zzso zzso in zzso zzso It supports long-term survival and stress tolerance against zzso and heat, and plays a key role in the formation of zzso zzso
