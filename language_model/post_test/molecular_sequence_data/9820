Previous studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso regulates its own zzso Moreover, zzso levels of zzso protein increase following exposure to the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may release the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we have considered the possibility that zzso directly contacts its zzso zzso zzso studies using a series of truncated zzso zzso as zzso localized the zzso interaction to a zzso region containing two putative zzso zzso initial studies indicated that both of these loop structures are involved in protein zzso Moreover, the binding of zzso to zzso prevents interaction of the protein with its zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso
