zzso 2 is a zzso protein present in the cell walls of the zzso fungus zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso based on the sequences of zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso was cloned from zzso DNA derived from the zzso phase of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso sequence analyses showed a 582 base pair zzso zzso disrupted by two zzso which are 78 zzso and 101 zzso zzso The deduced primary translation product consists of zzso zzso acids zzso contains an zzso putative signal sequence to allow transport into the zzso zzso and a zzso putative signal sequence to enable a zzso anchor zzso zzso zzso zzso site and zzso sites, as well as zzso and zzso sites are also zzso On the basis of these zzso we predict that a zzso zzso a zzso modification to yield the mature zzso zzso protein which is anchored on the zzso plasma membrane of zzso and zzso zzso
