In a previous study, we reported the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso from the human bone zzso zzso cell line zzso Analysis of the sequence of this zzso revealed it to be the previously reported human zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso which was recently isolated from human lung zzso zzso cells as a zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are thought to be essential for protecting cells from the damage caused by zzso oxygen zzso To obtain the zzso zzso zzso zzso we introduced a secondary structure, which is identical to the zzso zzso signal of zzso coli zzso zzso H zzso downstream of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso As a result, a significant amount of zzso was incorporated into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed reducing activities toward human and zzso coli zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso Our results suggest that this strategy will be zzso to the production of other zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
