zzso zzso in which each zzso bond was systematically replaced with a zzso zzso bond, were zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso bond was introduced by the zzso acid zzso method on a solid zzso In the zzso of the zzso zzso double zzso took place at the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso possibly due to the low zzso hindrance of the zzso zzso To suppress the double zzso a minimum amount of zzso was zzso In the zzso binding zzso the zzso replacement of zzso zzso bonds which led to 1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso resulted in a marked reduction in binding affinities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso while that of the other zzso bonds afforded zzso with a high zzso zzso A 3 zzso zzso zzso showed extremely high zzso selectivity zzso Ki ratio zzso 339, zzso Ki ratio zzso zzso In the in zzso zzso zzso zzso pig zzso zzso 2 showed a very low zzso ratio zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso whereas those of other zzso were zzso suggesting that the introduction of the zzso zzso at zzso greatly enhanced the zzso stability of the parent zzso Furthermore, zzso 2 and 3 showed a very low sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso plus zzso on their binding at a zzso site as compared with the other zzso and the parent zzso These results suggest that the two zzso (2 and 3) have partial zzso zzso
