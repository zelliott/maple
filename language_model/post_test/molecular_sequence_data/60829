The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso in the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso contains two zzso zzso Each repeat contains a binding site for the zzso factor zzso (also called zzso The zzso binding sites are called core zzso zzso is a zzso that is identical to zzso except for the presence of a zzso substitution in each of the two core zzso This zzso significantly zzso viral zzso Most zzso that occur in zzso mice contain zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso within the core zzso We examined the selective pressures that might account for the predominance of the zzso and zzso zzso in tumor zzso by analyzing when zzso with altered core sequences became abundant during the course of zzso zzso core sequences were easily detected in zzso zzso by 4 to 6 weeks after zzso infection of mice, well before zzso were zzso zzso This result is consistent with the hypothesis that viruses with the core sequence zzso emerged because they zzso more effectively in mice than zzso The number of zzso tandem, repeats in the viral zzso was found to vary, presumably as a consequence of reverse zzso zzso during zzso zzso with two repeats predominated in the zzso of zzso and zzso mice before zzso developed, although zzso with one or three repeats were also zzso This suggested that two was the optimal number of zzso repeats for viral zzso However, in zzso zzso with three or four repeats usually zzso This suggested that a late step in the process of zzso led to the abundance of zzso with additional zzso We zzso that zzso with additional zzso repeats endowed the cells containing them with a selective growth zzso
