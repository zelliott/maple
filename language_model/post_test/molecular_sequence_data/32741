zzso weight is one of the most important components of grain yield and is controlled by quantitative trait zzso zzso derived from natural variations in zzso However, the molecular roles of zzso in the regulation of grain weight have not been fully zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of zzso a new zzso that controls rice grain zzso and zzso Our data show that zzso encodes a previously unknown zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso activity, which is known to function in the degradation by the zzso zzso Loss of zzso function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger zzso zzso zzso and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain zzso weight and zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso regulates cell division by targeting its zzso to zzso for regulated zzso The functional characterization of zzso provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in zzso
