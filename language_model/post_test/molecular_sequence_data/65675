A DNA zzso containing zzso base pairs from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using zzso zzso and inverse zzso An open reading frame containing zzso zzso was identified that zzso zzso zzso acids zzso including a putative signal zzso of 31 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed the highest identity zzso with zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso of the zzso zzso family 5 zzso The sequence zzso the mature protein was cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein containing an zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso and its zzso tag zzso to yield a zzso zzso having a specific activity of zzso zzso The optimal activity of the zzso zzso zzso was at 58 degrees C and pH zzso The zzso product on zzso locust bean gum included a zzso and mainly zzso The zzso zzso may be of potential use in the feed zzso
