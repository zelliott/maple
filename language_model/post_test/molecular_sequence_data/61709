The complete sequence of the circular zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which represents the first described zzso DNA of a member of this zzso was zzso zzso zzso harbors 105 open reading zzso The predicted products of 46 of these are significantly related to proteins of known zzso zzso zzso is organized into three functional regions that are flanked by zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso a replication and putative zzso region, zzso a putative zzso region, and zzso a large putative zzso transfer region, which is interrupted by an additional IS zzso Southern zzso experiments revealed the presence of another copy of this zzso transfer region on the bacterial zzso The origin of replication zzso of zzso was identified and used for construction of zzso zzso shuttle zzso which was also suitable for several other zzso species and related zzso The zzso region included the zzso resistance gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli zzso resistance to cadmium, but not to zzso and decreased the cellular content of cadmium in this zzso When zzso zzso strain zzso was cured of zzso zzso the resulting zzso strains exhibited slightly decreased cadmium zzso Furthermore, they had lost the ability to use zzso rubber as a sole source of carbon and energy, suggesting that genes essential for rubber degradation are zzso by zzso
