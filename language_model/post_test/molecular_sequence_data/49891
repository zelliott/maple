zzso zzso spores can zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso a compound present at high levels in the spore zzso Using a genetic screen to identify genes zzso proteins that are specifically involved in spore zzso by zzso three zzso were zzso One was in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso that was previously shown to be essential for spore zzso by zzso The other two were mapped to an open reading frame, zzso zzso a protein of unknown zzso Analysis of zzso expression showed that the gene is expressed during zzso in the mother cell compartment of the zzso cell and that its zzso is zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso demonstrated that it is a new spore coat protein that is essential for the presence of zzso in the spore zzso Assembly of zzso itself into the spore coat is dependent on the coat zzso proteins zzso and zzso However, other than lacking zzso zzso spores have no obvious zzso in their spore zzso Because of the role for zzso in a part of the spore zzso process, we propose zzso zzso as a spore zzso zzso zzso
