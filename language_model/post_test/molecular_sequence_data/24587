zzso zzso of zzso genes requires the stabilization and nuclear zzso of zzso a dedicated zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso strongly enhances binding and zzso by zzso on zzso templates in zzso Interestingly, different zzso zzso vary in their ability to bind zzso templates in the absence of zzso zzso to zzso zzso that repress binding to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso requires both the zzso zzso repeats and the C zzso of zzso whereas the zzso N zzso is zzso to zzso A zzso spanning the C zzso zzso and zzso repeats 11 and 12 zzso but not the CT alone, functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso activity in zzso and can block zzso binding of the complex to zzso zzso zzso in zzso was also zzso by inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso signaling that interacts with zzso repeats 11 and 12, and by the zzso zzso compound, zzso None of these zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso could disrupt the zzso complex after it was zzso bound to zzso We conclude that the zzso region of zzso functions as a zzso zzso domain, and that several zzso of the zzso zzso directly zzso zzso activity on zzso
