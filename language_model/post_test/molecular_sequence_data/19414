Plant zzso transfer proteins zzso are zzso zzso subdivided into two families, which present molecular masses of around 7 and 10 zzso The peptides were, thus, denominated due to their ability to zzso bind and transport zzso molecules in zzso Both zzso possess zzso patterns of eight zzso zzso and the three-dimensional structure reveals an internal zzso cavity that comprises the zzso binding zzso Based on the growing knowledge regarding structure, gene expression and regulation and in zzso activity, zzso are likely to play a role in key processes of plant zzso Although the roles of plant zzso have not yet been fully zzso This review aims to present comprehensive information of recent topics, cover new additional data, and present new perspectives on these families of zzso
