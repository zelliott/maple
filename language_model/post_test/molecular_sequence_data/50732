A variable number of tandem repeat from a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The repeat has a unit size of 39 zzso is highly zzso and is present in at least 14 zzso zzso sequences show a sequence zzso of zzso zzso and some sequence zzso to the 39 zzso zzso A considerable part of the zzso DNA has been lost during zzso and is considered to be deletion prone or zzso to propagation in zzso zzso The tandem repeat is locus specific and detects at least six zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso to other tandem repeat sequences has been zzso
