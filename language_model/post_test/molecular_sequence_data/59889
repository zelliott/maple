A zzso zzso gene zzso of an industrial zzso zzso strain was cloned and found to be organized in an zzso structure of three open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso zzso was preceded by a typical zzso promoter region, and a putative zzso zzso was found downstream of zzso identified as the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso only one zzso start site, upstream of zzso was identifiable in the predicted zzso Although the size of zzso could not be judged by Northern analysis either with zzso zzso or zzso zzso reverse zzso analyses further supported the zzso structure of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso had coding capacities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein showed zzso identity with the zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein had significant zzso with several members of the ABC zzso family but, with two distinct putative zzso sites, it would represent an unusual type among the bacterial ABC zzso zzso zzso a putative integral membrane protein also characteristic of the ABC zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only di and zzso with zzso in the first zzso zzso zzso activity was observed at pH zzso and 40 degrees zzso A gel zzso analysis indicated that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso zzso having zzso groups at or near the active zzso zzso studies with zzso as zzso revealed zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and 350 zzso zzso zzso respectively, and a very high turnover number of 135,000 zzso
