The complete zzso sequences of six zzso B viral zzso zzso were determined by zzso chain termination sequencing of ten overlapping zzso fragments obtained by the zzso chain zzso Four of the zzso belonged to the two zzso groups E and F of zzso which have been previously identified by us on the basis of sequence zzso within the S zzso zzso group E encodes the zzso zzso zzso group F zzso The other two zzso were of Pacific origin within group C and zzso zzso The relationship of these complete human zzso zzso to 21 that have been previously published, together with one zzso virus and four zzso zzso zzso was investigated by constructing a zzso tree utilizing a combination of distance zzso and approximate zzso zzso zzso the previously demonstrated segregation of human zzso strains into six zzso groups was zzso Both of the representatives of the groups E and F were found to differ by zzso and by zzso from the zzso of the other zzso groups and by zzso and zzso from each zzso Since they differed by more than zzso from the zzso in the other groups, the limit originally used to define zzso zzso groups their status as new zzso groups was zzso The two Pacific group C strains were found to differ by zzso from each other and by zzso to zzso from other group C zzso suggesting that they zzso early from the other group C zzso According to both the overall similarity and the zzso zzso the F strains formed the most divergent cluster of zzso zzso favoring the concept that they represented the original zzso strains of the New zzso The next split in the zzso zzso the A, D, E and the zzso strains from the Asian B and C zzso Information on the zzso sequences and their zzso products of zzso strains of different zzso groups will provide a basis to understand biological variations of the zzso infection in different parts of the zzso
