The reliability of arbitrarily primed amplification products was zzso The segregation analysis of zzso amplification products obtained using 17 different zzso zzso in 34 zzso from a single tree of zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso out of the 165 variable bands fit the zzso segregation ratio expected for zzso zzso The segregation ratio of a subset of six zzso markers in five other individuals from the same population confirmed their genetic zzso Our results strengthen the evidence previously reported that zzso markers can be considered zzso traits useful in the detection of genetic zzso among both different individuals and zzso
