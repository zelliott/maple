During development of zzso zzso cells acquire zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso cell binding activity is associated with a cell surface zzso of Mr zzso zzso which mediates zzso binding via zzso zzso Analysis of the structure of zzso deduced from zzso sequence reveals the presence of three internally zzso segments in the zzso domain, which also contains regions with zzso to the neural cell zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions show an abundance of zzso and very few zzso This is confirmed by circular zzso zzso It is likely that the zzso segments are organized into zzso structures, extended from the cell surface by a zzso stalk zzso The cell binding activity of zzso resides within the first zzso repeat of the zzso domain and has been mapped to a 51 zzso acid region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso corresponding to sequences within this region have been prepared and zzso for their ability to bind to cell surface zzso zzso lead to identification of the zzso binding site to an zzso sequence within this zzso zzso peptides containing this zzso sequence and zzso zzso directed against this site block the formation of organized cell zzso during zzso Although cell zzso are eventually formed, most fail to undergo further development to give rise to zzso and zzso bodies, indicating that zzso zzso involving zzso is an important step in normal zzso
