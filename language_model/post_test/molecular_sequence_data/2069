The zzso sequence zzso the human zzso zzso zzso is zzso The two chains of zzso are coded in a single open reading frame on the same zzso zzso indicating the existence of a zzso precursor protein which matures zzso by the zzso of at least one zzso zzso The precursor is preceded by a signal sequence for zzso export and contains six zzso zzso sites distributed equally between the two chains of the zzso The sequence of the zzso precursor bears a zzso identity to a rat zzso zzso zzso which is the major zzso product of zzso zzso The presence of zzso within human seminal plasma at levels comparable to those in serum was demonstrated, indicating that zzso and zzso are serum and seminal forms of the same zzso A sequence of 23 zzso acids within the zzso of zzso exhibited significant zzso to corresponding segments located within complement components zzso zzso and zzso The short zzso motif represented the only evidence of a possible vestigial relationship between zzso and other complement zzso The precise role of zzso is not known in either blood or zzso but the present findings document an intriguing link between the immune and the zzso zzso
