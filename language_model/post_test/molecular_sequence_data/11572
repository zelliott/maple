A zzso zzso for zzso zzso that uses the zzso of an internal zzso probe to monitor the amplification of the target has been zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso takes advantage of the zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso to digest a probe which is zzso with two fluorescent zzso and zzso to the zzso during zzso When the probe is intact, the two zzso interact such that the zzso of the reporter dye is zzso During amplification, the probe is zzso zzso the zzso of the reporter and resulting in an increase in its zzso zzso This change in reporter dye zzso is quantitative for the amount of zzso product and, under appropriate conditions, for the amount of zzso We have applied the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso using an zzso zzso of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso sensitivity was achieved by evaluating various zzso zzso and then zzso the zzso components and cycling zzso With crude cell zzso the total zzso could be completed in 3 h with a detection limit of approximately 50 zzso zzso was linear over a range of 5 zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso zzso
