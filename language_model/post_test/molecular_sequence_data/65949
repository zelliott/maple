zzso cannot be made de zzso zzso zzso requires that up to 1000 proteins are imported into zzso and the protein import zzso relies on zzso zzso complexes in both the inner and outer zzso zzso The zzso in the outer zzso the TOM complex, is composed of a core complex formed from the zzso channel zzso and additional zzso each with single, zzso zzso zzso How zzso zzso segments might be assembled onto a zzso zzso in the context of a membrane environment is a question of fundamental zzso The master zzso zzso of the TOM complex, zzso recognizes the targeting sequence on incoming zzso precursor zzso binds these protein zzso and then transfers them to the core complex for zzso across the outer zzso Here we show that the zzso segment of zzso contains critical zzso essential for zzso the zzso zzso into its correct environment within the TOM zzso This crucial zzso reaction is zzso by the unique assembly factor zzso zzso in the zzso segment that destabilize zzso or deletion of zzso prevent zzso from functioning as a zzso for protein import into zzso
