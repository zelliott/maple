zzso of zzso zzso zzso II zzso in zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso It was proposed that zzso degrades zzso from the zzso that is created by transcript zzso catches up with zzso pol II, and acts like a zzso that removes pol II from zzso Here we test the zzso model in an in zzso system based on zzso pol II zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso and with zzso and zzso degrade zzso extending from the zzso until they reach the zzso surface but fail to terminate pol zzso Instead, the zzso retains an approximately zzso zzso that remains with its zzso at the active site and can be zzso Thus, pol II termination apparently requires a factor or several factors in addition to zzso zzso and zzso zzso modifications of these factors, or unusual reaction zzso
