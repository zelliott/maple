The turkey zzso gene zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso DNA library by virtue of high identity with chicken zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso 240 zzso of the zzso region, of each of the three zzso and of the zzso boundaries were zzso Comparisons of the zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso genes revealed zzso absolute conservation of zzso DNA immediately zzso each respective zzso boundary, zzso high conservation zzso of zzso DNA zzso translated regions of the zzso and zzso high conservation zzso of zzso DNA encompassing the putative zzso start point and zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso and zzso promoters regions near the zzso box revealed that both promoters contain a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso of zzso was identical with that of zzso In order to further explore the degree of conservation of the protein coding regions of avian zzso zzso partial zzso zzso from zzso quail zzso and zzso zzso were amplified using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso and zzso coding regions of zzso zzso zzso reaction products were cloned and the DNA sequences of multiple zzso clones from each species were zzso The results suggest the existence of a single zzso zzso in zzso liver from turkey and zzso and the existence of a major and possibly a minor zzso zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
