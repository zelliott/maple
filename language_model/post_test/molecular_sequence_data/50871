The capacity of the large zzso of DNA zzso I from zzso coli and of DNA zzso alpha from zzso zzso to replicate zzso zzso DNA containing either zzso or zzso zzso was zzso The zzso were respectively induced by zzso and by zzso zzso For both types of zzso it is observed that the zzso zzso is more inhibited than the zzso zzso By mapping the arrest sites produced by zzso zzso on the synthesis zzso by DNA zzso zzso we show that, in contrast with the zzso observed with zzso DNA, these compounds do not show a strong sequence specificity in reacting with zzso zzso
