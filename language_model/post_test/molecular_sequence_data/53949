G proteins play vital roles in cellular responses to external zzso The specificity of G zzso interaction is zzso mostly by the zzso and the individual members of the zzso zzso family would hence be expected to each have a particular expression zzso In an experiment designed to isolate genes expressed predominantly in human zzso we identified a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso Although the protein sequence of the zzso zzso has previously been published, the zzso zzso expression pattern, zzso structure, and zzso of the human zzso gene have not been zzso We report the complete sequence of the zzso zzso which is zzso zzso long and contains an open reading frame zzso a protein of 71 zzso zzso This protein is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and rat G protein zzso zzso The gene structure is very similar to that of other zzso genes in that there are two zzso one located in the zzso zzso and the other within the zzso We show that this gene is expressed in a range of zzso zzso as well as adult zzso adrenal zzso brain, white blood cells and lung but not in adult liver, muscle, zzso prostate zzso nor in the zzso of two different zzso zzso There is evidence that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso Using two independent methods, we have mapped the human zzso gene to zzso zzso
