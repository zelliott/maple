zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are highly zzso and zzso have been found in all zzso zzso Although less is known of the zzso these also appear to be zzso To generate a comprehensive database of zzso zzso zzso which will aid in the design of zzso typing zzso we have established a method for cloning and sequencing of zzso genes from zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the entire zzso gene from zzso DNA using long template touchdown zzso and high capacity cloning zzso Overlapping secondary zzso were modified to include a zzso analogue that reduced sequencing problems associated with secondary structure formation in the zzso zzso Using a modified sequencing chemistry we were able to sequence approximately 11,000 bases confirming the previously published zzso zzso zzso
