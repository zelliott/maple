The interaction of the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso factor zzso is essential for zzso zzso The minimal structure required for this zzso binding to zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso as normal level of zzso interactions are required for maintaining zzso elevated zzso zzso can cause adverse pathological zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso of zzso consisting of zzso and zzso groups of zzso and zzso divided by a linear zzso zzso acquired a significant affinity for the zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso The structural requirements for the interactions of the zzso sequence with zzso and the zzso potential of a newly designed series of zzso on zzso zzso and interactions with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by various zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso of 3 zzso for the most potent zzso zzso in which a zzso ring was introduced into the zzso chain, which exceeded the zzso attained with the original zzso zzso The zzso effect of the zzso zzso was attributed to their specific interaction with the zzso zzso since these zzso inhibited the binding of the zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, the binding of zzso zzso to zzso was inhibited by the zzso surrogates in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso also inhibited up to zzso the zzso zzso and deposition of zzso onto zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
