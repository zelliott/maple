We have analyzed sequence zzso between zzso zzso displayed peptides mimicking zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed zzso to proteins involved in zzso zzso Besides this expected zzso molecular mimicry of critical regulatory proteins was zzso These data contribute to our understanding of the structural zzso of zzso zzso defined by specific zzso zzso zzso and, in addition, suggest that molecular mimicry might explain the zzso of these peptides otherwise characterized by specificity to the zzso zzso We conclude that construction of peptides harboring motifs absent or scarcely represented in zzso zzso might be a useful approach in melanoma zzso
