The zzso components of the zzso zzso leaf zzso virus zzso were cloned from symptomatic zzso leaves collected in Guatemala during zzso The zzso zzso and zzso components shared their closest zzso identities among zzso at approximately 90 and zzso respectively, with a zzso isolate of zzso from Costa zzso The closest relatives at the species level were other members of the zzso leaf zzso virus zzso zzso which is endemic in the southwestern United States and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso components resulted in the development of characteristic disease symptoms, providing definitive evidence of zzso zzso zzso infected species within the zzso zzso and zzso The potential for zzso zzso was examined for zzso and its closest relatives, including the zzso zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso and three other zzso species, zzso leaf zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso The zzso viruses have distinct but overlapping host zzso All possible zzso were established using zzso combinations of the zzso or zzso zzso Surprisingly, only certain zzso arising from zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso were viable in zzso even though it is a host of all of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso assisted in zzso infecting the zzso test species by the components of the four zzso zzso In certain zzso combinations, the zzso zzso or zzso component was able to zzso one or more zzso zzso Generally, the zzso were less virulent in the test hosts than the respective zzso zzso zzso strongly implicating zzso zzso of zzso This is the first illustration of zzso resulting in the host range expansion of a zzso zzso
