zzso zzso are pivotal for regulation of zzso but their critical targets remain largely zzso Here, we show that zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso all zzso zzso zzso increases zzso colony outgrowth and zzso capacity of zzso zzso and results in enhanced zzso zzso We found that these zzso are zzso and abundantly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso in mature zzso zzso zzso identified zzso 1 zzso an zzso protein and regulator of zzso protein degradation, as a major target for these zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we found increased expression of zzso transcripts during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells and an inverse correlation of zzso protein levels and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Further, zzso binds to the zzso zzso factor 3 zzso zzso mainly in the late zzso zzso but not in zzso positive zzso zzso regulates zzso stability and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso promote cell expansion, zzso capacity and signaling in zzso cells by interference with zzso zzso
