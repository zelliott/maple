zzso zzso have become useful techniques for the identification of zzso zzso species and for the recognition of novel species that are capable of causing human zzso Two zzso recovered from zzso patients were characterized as zzso nova by zzso and zzso testing zzso The restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns obtained by restriction zzso analysis zzso of an amplified portion of the heat shock protein gene were identical to those obtained with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso of an amplified portion of the zzso zzso gene showed zzso patterns that were unlike those obtained for the type strain of zzso nova but that were similar to those obtained for the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a portion of the zzso zzso gene produced identical results for the two patient zzso zzso analysis of zzso portions of the zzso zzso gene indicated that these zzso were zzso similar to the recently described species zzso zzso but were only zzso zzso and zzso similar to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso nova, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that the two patient zzso belonged to the same species but were not closely related to zzso zzso zzso nova, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The patient zzso have been designated zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso and the new species are not readily differentiated from zzso nova by zzso methods alone, the designation zzso nova zzso can be used to designate zzso such as these that zzso resemble zzso nova but that have not been definitively characterized by zzso zzso gene sequencing or zzso zzso
