The human zzso factor zzso zzso gene exists as a single copy on zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso each of which has distinct zzso initiation zzso These zzso are alternatively spliced to a common zzso zzso site on a third zzso that contains the total open reading frame to yield two different species of functional zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 1 has consensus sequences for zzso factor zzso B and zzso and the zzso zzso sequence zzso to the zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso 2 also contains consensus sequences for zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 were both detected in heart, zzso zzso and zzso whereas only zzso 1 was found in peripheral zzso a differentiated human zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso zzso of distinct promoters was thus suggested to play a role in the regulatory control of zzso zzso gene expression in different human zzso and zzso
