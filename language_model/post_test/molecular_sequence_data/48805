Growing evidence supports a role for the unfolded protein response zzso in zzso however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain zzso zzso we identified the zzso clock zzso zzso as a novel zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso sensor zzso Analysis of the mechanism shows that zzso zzso activity decreased zzso zzso in tumor cells without affecting zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso signaling using either zzso zzso or a zzso strategy prevented zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and increased survival, features that were reversed upon zzso zzso zzso patients showing reduced survival have lower levels of zzso zzso expression and increased zzso of zzso a known zzso zzso thereby pointing toward an increased zzso activity in these zzso zzso we describe a novel mechanism connecting the zzso and zzso clock components in tumor cells, thereby highlighting the importance of this interplay in tumor zzso
