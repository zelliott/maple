We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso in contrast to zzso infected with the zzso stage of these zzso are able to present the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of receptors for activated C zzso to specific, zzso T cell hybrids and to the T cell clone zzso These T cells react with the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that the level of stimulation of the zzso T cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso is clearly dependent upon the differentiation state of the zzso zzso Thus, shortly after infection with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso major or of zzso zzso zzso strongly activated zzso The activity was transient and rapidly zzso However, under the same conditions, zzso of zzso by zzso infected with zzso zzso of zzso major or of zzso zzso was barely zzso At the extreme, zzso infected with zzso were incapable to stimulate zzso Thus, the presentation of zzso by infected zzso zzso with the degree of zzso of the zzso zzso the less virulent being the best for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso While the zzso killing of the zzso appears to be an important condition for the presentation of zzso it is not the only zzso The partial or total destruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso does not allow the presentation of zzso to zzso A preferential interaction of zzso zzso with recycling rather than newly zzso zzso class II molecules does not explain the transient presentation of zzso by zzso infected with zzso or zzso zzso because zzso A strongly inhibited the presentation of zzso to zzso Taken together, these results suggest that virulent stages of zzso namely zzso and zzso have evolved strategies to avoid or minimize their recognition by zzso T zzso
