Usually spices are identified zzso using simple methods like magnifying glasses or microscopic zzso On the other hand, molecular biological methods like the zzso chain reaction zzso enable an accurate and specific detection also in complex zzso Generally, the origins of spices are plants with diverse genetic backgrounds and zzso The processing methods used for the production of spices are complex and zzso zzso the development of a reliable zzso method for spice analysis is a challenging zzso However, once established, this method will be easily adapted to less difficult food zzso In the current study, several alternative methods for the isolation of DNA from spices have been developed and evaluated in detail with regard to zzso its purity zzso zzso yield zzso zzso and zzso its zzso zzso Whole zzso amplification methods were used to zzso zzso to improve the ratio between zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso primer sets were zzso and the zzso conditions were zzso to detect 18 spices zzso zzso of self-made spice zzso were performed to proof the zzso of the developed zzso
