Two different zzso genes were identified that when zzso suppressed the low iron growth zzso of a zzso in the zzso zzso iron binding zzso zzso zzso zzso These genes were determined to be novel and highly zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences indicated that both were membrane proteins having two identical zzso zzso The predicted zzso while not ABC zzso are zzso to a widely distributed family of transition metal zzso present in all zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso localized these gene products to zzso Based on this result we term these genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with disruptions in both genes show a growth zzso on low iron zzso suggesting that these genes have redundant function and can affect zzso iron zzso zzso of zzso iron in cells grown in zzso medium zzso zzso or zzso show a zzso increase in iron compared with zzso from control zzso These results suggest that the zzso may act as a zzso for iron that can be mobilized and used for zzso zzso
