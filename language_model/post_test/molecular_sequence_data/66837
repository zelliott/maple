zzso of zzso zzso in the promoter sequence of a gene can lead to zzso and suppressed gene zzso In this study, we have developed procedures for zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing analysis to determine zzso zzso status of the promoter sequences of nine zzso genes in 35 zzso zzso zzso and paired zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was found in the promoter sequences of zzso zzso and zzso but not of other six zzso genes in the zzso and normal zzso zzso Eleven of the 35 zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in the promoter sequences of zzso zzso or zzso Of these 11 cases, 1 had promoter zzso in all the three zzso 1 in zzso and zzso 3 in zzso and zzso and 6 in zzso zzso In comparison, promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso was found in only 7 of 35 paired zzso zzso including 2 in zzso and zzso 2 in zzso and 3 in zzso In zzso promoter zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes was detected in about one-third of zzso and one-fifth of zzso zzso zzso of 35 paired specimens indicating possible disruption of the zzso clock in the development of zzso
