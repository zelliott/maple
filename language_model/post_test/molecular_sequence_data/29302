The zzso protein of zzso viruses zzso is an auxiliary protein zzso by the 3' end of the viral zzso Although its function during the viral replication cycle is still unknown, zzso seems to play a key role in the establishment and/or maintenance of viral zzso representing the zzso viral protein detected during chronic zzso To clarify the function of this viral zzso the zzso distribution of zzso from the zzso human zzso virus zzso was zzso We report here that this protein is distributed in both the zzso and the nucleus of zzso or zzso zzso The nuclear targeting results from the presence of a zzso nuclear zzso signal at the zzso region, sufficient to direct zzso reporter proteins to the zzso Since zzso zzso spreads between cells, we show here that the zzso protein targets the zzso of recipient zzso zzso zzso follows an unconventional route to exit the cell since its zzso is not affected by zzso A, a drug which zzso the trafficking between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Finally, these zzso and zzso movements were also observed for the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso strongly suggesting that these remarkable features are zzso among zzso
