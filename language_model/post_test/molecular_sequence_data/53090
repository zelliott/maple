A number of studies have addressed the question of which are the critical zzso at zzso zzso These studies examined either a single or a few zzso zzso The most extensive study to date has been an analysis of zzso zzso However, although the total number of zzso was large, the number of protein zzso was small, with some of the zzso closely zzso Here we show that although overall binding sites are zzso they are zzso with specific, zzso polar zzso at specific locations, possibly serving as energy zzso zzso Our results confirm and zzso the zzso data analysis, despite its limited zzso Previously zzso zzso and zzso were shown to constitute energetic hot zzso These were rationalized by their polar interactions and by their surrounding rings of zzso zzso However, there was no compelling reason as to why specifically these zzso were zzso Here we show that other polar zzso are similarly zzso These zzso zzso have been detected consistently in all interface families that we have zzso Our results are based on an extensive examination of zzso which are in contact across protein zzso We zzso all clustered interface families with at least five members and with sequence similarity between the members in the range of zzso There are 11 such clustered interface families, zzso a total of 97 crystal zzso Our three-dimensional zzso analysis of the zzso of matched zzso in each of the families identifies zzso zzso at zzso similar zzso Additionally, in zzso zzso we observe that zzso are more zzso at the zzso than at other zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso have similar surface conservation as compared to their corresponding linear sequence zzso consistent with the suggestion that evolution has zzso protein zzso for zzso
