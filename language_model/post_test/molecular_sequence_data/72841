zzso zzso in zzso zzso a candidate tumor zzso gene located in zzso band zzso encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein with nearly 50% zzso acid identity to zzso was recently identified because of its dynamic expression in the developing nervous system and gastrointestinal tract of the zzso To explore a role for the human zzso zzso gene in cancer, we have isolated zzso for two alternatively spliced forms of zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso studies zzso localized zzso in zzso band zzso a region infrequently affected by zzso in zzso zzso transcripts of about zzso and zzso zzso were detected in all adult zzso zzso In contrast to the frequent loss of zzso zzso no zzso in zzso expression were observed in more than 50 zzso zzso including glioblastoma, zzso zzso zzso breast, cervical and pancreatic cancer cell lines and zzso Based on their sequence conservation and similar expression during development, zzso and zzso may have related zzso However, the zzso location and ubiquitous expression of zzso in various human tumors suggest it is infrequently altered in zzso
