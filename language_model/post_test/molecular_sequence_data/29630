Most patients with zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso V genes with zzso variation, consistent with location in the zzso center zzso Using our own and published zzso we have investigated the frequency of potential zzso sites introduced into functional zzso genes as a consequence of zzso zzso FL cells were compared with normal memory B cells or plasma cells matched for similar levels of zzso zzso novel sites were detected in 55 of 70 zzso patients with FL, compared to 7 of 75 zzso in the normal zzso population zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso showed an intermediate frequency (13 of 32 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso subset of chronic zzso leukemia showed zzso similar to those of normal cells in 5 of 64 zzso patients and 5 of 40 zzso patients, zzso In 3 of 3 random patients with FL, zzso was expressed as zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was zzso These findings indicate that zzso of the variable region may be common in FL and in a subset of zzso Most novel sites are located in the zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso genes contained few sites, arguing for positive selection in zzso One possibility is that the added zzso in the variable region contributes to interaction with elements in the zzso center zzso This common feature of FL may be critical for tumor zzso
