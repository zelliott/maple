The gene zzso zzso the envelope zzso of the zzso virus zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso of of the viral zzso and expression of the zzso gene was examined at various times zzso To locate the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1983, zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso expression library of zzso and insert zzso from zzso zzso were used for Southern zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso and zzso of the zzso gene was examined by Northern zzso zzso zzso and primer extension zzso Two sets of zzso transcripts were detected during zzso a single early transcript which initiated at zzso zzso and four late transcripts which initiated at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to the start of the zzso open reading zzso zzso of the zzso early zzso initiation site with several other early zzso genes revealed a zzso consensus sequence zzso which is zzso at the early zzso initiation sites of the zzso and zzso zzso The four late zzso transcripts initiated at two of the four upstream zzso zzso All zzso zzso appear to be zzso at the 3' zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso gene revealed that the late zzso zzso are zzso consisting of a three zzso acid zzso located 70 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso acid zzso open reading zzso Early transcripts do not contain the zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of 58 zzso The predicted zzso protein contains seven potential zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso and zzso characteristic of signal and membrane anchor sequences found on envelope zzso By western zzso analyses and indirect zzso zzso we show that the zzso protein is present at early times (6 zzso zzso and accumulates in the infected cell, moving to the periphery at later times zzso Western zzso comparisons of the zzso expression of the zzso protein with the zzso zzso protein revealed that these two zzso structural protein genes differ significantly in the timing of their initial zzso The upstream regulatory regions, open reading zzso and predicted proteins from the zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
