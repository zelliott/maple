zzso belongs to an ancient family of proteins responsible for zzso cluster assembly in essential zzso pathways preserved throughout zzso We report here the zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso coli zzso a novel fold in which mixed zzso form a compact zzso sandwich zzso In contrast to the highly mobile secondary structural elements within the bacterial zzso scaffold protein zzso a protein which is thought to have a similar function, the great majority of the zzso acids that are zzso in zzso zzso are located in elements that constitute a zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso tail segment that contains two zzso zzso critical for the zzso function of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not ordered in our zzso In addition, the crystal packing reveals a zzso assembly that is constructed from two possible zzso zzso of zzso
