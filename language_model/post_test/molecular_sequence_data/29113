zzso cells from marine zzso retain their proliferation capacity if they are allowed to form special zzso the zzso On the basis of incorporation studies and zzso gene zzso we show that zzso zzso are required for the proliferation of cells in zzso from zzso zzso In zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso and strongly zzso the synthesis of zzso This result is supported by the finding that the zzso activity of zzso converting zzso to zzso acid, depends on zzso Moreover, the expression of a scavenger zzso zzso possibly involved in the zzso of zzso depends on the presence of zzso We conclude that iron is an essential factor in zzso and zzso processes in zzso
