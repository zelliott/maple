Type II collagen is coded by a large gene zzso consisting of 54 zzso on zzso zzso During the past few years several cartilage disorders have been linked to this zzso and some specific zzso changes have been identified in zzso In a zzso form of zzso the three zzso found so far are all in zzso 48 in the region coding for the zzso end of the triple zzso Since folding of the type II collagen zzso to the triple zzso is initiated from the zzso end, it has been suggested that zzso in this region typically result in severe cartilage zzso Here we report a novel zzso located in the area coding for the zzso part of the triple zzso in a sporadic patient with zzso zzso zzso The zzso a substitution of zzso to A, which results in the conversion of zzso to zzso was identified using zzso amplification of zzso DNA and subsequent analyses with zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The substitution was not found in any other zzso patient in zzso This novel zzso demonstrates that zzso acid zzso in the zzso part of the type II collagen triple zzso can also result in zzso
