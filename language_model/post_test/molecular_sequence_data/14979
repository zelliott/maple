In and zzso of zzso cell sheets are major shape generating processes in animal zzso They result from directed movement and zzso of polarized cells associated with cell shape zzso Work on several zzso model organisms has emphasized the role of zzso zzso signaling in cell polarization and zzso However, the molecular processes responsible for generating tissue and body shape in zzso zzso animals are zzso We show that zzso zzso signaling acts in mass tissue movements during bud and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell clusters define the positions, where bud and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain zzso in those zzso cells, undergoing cell shape changes during the entire zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is required for the zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso centers and the subsequent zzso of zzso tentacles are induced throughout the body column by zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that integration of zzso patterning and tissue zzso by the coordinated action of zzso and zzso zzso pathways was crucial for the evolution of zzso body zzso
