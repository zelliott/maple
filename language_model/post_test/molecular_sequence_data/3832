zzso that enabled the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso species by zzso targeting the zzso gene were zzso zzso species isolated from the feces of human adults and babies were identified by zzso amplification of a zzso zzso gene sequence and comparison of the relative zzso of the DNA fragments in zzso zzso gel zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso five zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso could be differentiated using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type cultures could not be differentiated from each zzso zzso species were also detected directly in zzso samples by this combination of zzso and zzso The number of species detected was less than that detected by zzso using zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso quantitative zzso targeting a zzso zzso gene sequence was used to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso of zzso in zzso samples from adults correlated well with results obtained by culture when either a zzso zzso sequence or the zzso gene sequence was zzso In the case of samples from zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso targeting the zzso gene for the zzso of zzso zzso
