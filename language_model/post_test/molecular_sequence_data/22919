Combination therapy with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in chronic zzso C demonstrates the best responses against zzso C virus zzso of zzso zzso Still, it has proven to be ineffective in zzso of patients infected with this zzso In the present study, we zzso the translation efficiency zzso by the internal zzso entry site zzso region in zzso zzso 3 zzso isolated from sustained zzso zzso and zzso zzso assuming that this may influence the outcome of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3 from 22 individuals (15 zzso seven zzso were selected for such zzso The zzso region zzso zzso zzso was cloned into a dual zzso zzso and zzso activity assessed following zzso into various cell zzso Low relative translation efficiency was observed for zzso elements derived from zzso patients, whereas those of zzso patients showed significantly greater translation efficiency zzso zzso 13 vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso plus zzso on zzso translation in zzso was zzso A greater zzso effect was observed on zzso activity isolated from seven zzso patients, when compared with seven zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso efficiency in zzso correlated with treatment response for zzso zzso zzso Further studies are warranted to investigate whether zzso efficiency in zzso or sequence motifs associated with zzso efficiency, will be worthwhile to explore as zzso tools for other zzso zzso in the treatment of chronic zzso zzso
