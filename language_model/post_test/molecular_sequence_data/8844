zzso virus zzso capping zzso is a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso termination factor zzso The protein is a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso virus D1 and zzso zzso zzso The capping reaction zzso transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso end of zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The active site is situated at zzso of the D1 zzso within a sequence element, zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in the capping zzso from zzso and other DNA viruses and at the active sites of zzso zzso of zzso and DNA zzso Four additional sequence motifs zzso to zzso are zzso in the same order and with similar spacing among the capping zzso and several zzso zzso The relevance of these common sequence elements to the zzso capping reaction was addressed by zzso analysis of the zzso virus D1 zzso Nine zzso substitution zzso were targeted to motifs II to zzso zzso versions of the zzso D1 zzso were zzso in bacteria with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso by Ni affinity and zzso zzso zzso Whereas each of the zzso zzso retained zzso zzso and termination factor activities, six of nine zzso zzso were defective in some aspect of zzso Individual zzso in motifs III, IV, and V had distinctive effects on the affinity of zzso for zzso the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso These results are zzso with zzso studies of zzso zzso capping zzso and suggest a zzso structural basis for zzso zzso zzso
