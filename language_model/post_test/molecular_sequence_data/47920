zzso zzso functionally isolate neighboring genes by blocking interactions between zzso zzso elements and zzso Here we report that a DNA zzso located in the upstream region of sea urchin, zzso zzso zzso zzso gene blocks the interaction of the zzso zzso when positioned between the zzso and the target promoter, in an orientation dependent zzso The zzso zzso works only 3' to zzso direction and has no significant zzso or zzso effects on its own zzso In transgenic zzso the zzso zzso blocks the interaction between zzso stripe zzso and its target zzso The insulation mechanism operates also zzso in zzso We also show that the efficiency of transformation of zzso cells is enhanced when the integrated gene is flanked by the zzso zzso suggesting the sea zzso zzso overcomes the zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the mechanism of action of the zzso has been zzso throughout zzso
