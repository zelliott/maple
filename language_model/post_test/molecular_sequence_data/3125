Three overlapping zzso clones of the chicken zzso joining zzso chain were isolated and then characterized using restriction zzso analysis, Southern zzso analysis with zzso zzso and DNA zzso The gene consisted of four zzso separated by a zzso zzso 1, a zzso zzso 2, and a zzso zzso zzso A zzso initiation site was identified by a primer extension method using zzso and zzso indicating that zzso 1 was 86 zzso zzso 20 zzso acid zzso A zzso box was positioned at 29 approximately 25 zzso upstream of zzso zzso zzso 2, and 3 consisted of 133 zzso and 81 zzso zzso 43 and 26 zzso acid zzso of the mature zzso zzso zzso 4 consisted of 202 zzso zzso 66 zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso of untranslated zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso 1 showed high levels of promoter activities when examined in zzso reporter zzso following zzso into the zzso chicken zzso zzso These results suggest that the chicken zzso gene consists of four zzso and three zzso and that the zzso regulatory elements may be present within zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso
