zzso muscle zzso C zzso is structured into two separate zzso linked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that calcium binding to the regulatory sites within the zzso domain zzso zzso changes in the zzso domain of isolated zzso Since the only contact between the two zzso is the long zzso zzso the transfer of information must involve zzso changes within this zzso The center of the zzso is occupied by a zzso zzso A zzso mechanism for allowing zzso interaction involves a zzso change of the zzso zzso around zzso zzso zzso and James, zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis using zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two separate zzso containing an zzso and a zzso replacing zzso were constructed and compared with wild type zzso zzso binding studies showed no significant differences among the zzso zzso The different zzso were assembled into thin filaments and used to zzso the calcium regulation of zzso zzso of zzso All zzso species were able to mediate the calcium regulation of zzso Under the conditions used for the zzso no differences were detected among the zzso zzso These results show that zzso is not essential for the proper interaction of the calcium regulatory sites with the other components of the thin filament, and therefore exclude a large rotation around zzso as the mechanism of information transfer between the two zzso of zzso zzso
