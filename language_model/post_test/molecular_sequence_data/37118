We zzso zzso 6 of the nuclear zzso zzso protein 1 zzso gene from 19 species of bats zzso zzso to assess the utility of this gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed high support zzso probabilities zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso and most families zzso zzso of the zzso information present in zzso with zzso zzso and nuclear zzso genes indicated no significant zzso Thus, we zzso these three data sets into a single zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined analysis was zzso with study of zzso and combined zzso and zzso zzso but improved support zzso zzso zzso for many zzso Our results indicate that zzso 6 of zzso is rapidly evolving, able to tolerate zzso shifting zzso and deletion events, is more variable than zzso and provides zzso resolution from the zzso to zzso levels in zzso
