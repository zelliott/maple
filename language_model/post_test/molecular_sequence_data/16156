The zzso gene is expressed specifically in the alpha cells of the pancreatic zzso We show here that 300 base pairs of the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso linked to a zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso into zzso cell lines of different zzso zzso directs zzso only in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso identify three zzso control elements within these 300 base zzso Two of these elements zzso and zzso independently display zzso functions on both zzso and zzso promoters in zzso zzso cells, but only on zzso promoters in zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing cells, and not in zzso zzso The zzso promoter element zzso characterized by low intrinsic zzso activity, is critical for specific expression of the zzso gene in alpha zzso However, nuclear extracts prepared from all three zzso cell zzso give similar protection to the three control elements of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that these zzso distinct zzso cell lines all contain regulatory zzso proteins interacting with the three control elements of the zzso zzso but that factors interacting with the zzso promoter result in zzso zzso only in alpha cells, to restrict zzso gene expression to these zzso These observations suggest that interactions of nuclear proteins with zzso elements are involved in the programmed zzso expression of the zzso zzso hormone zzso
