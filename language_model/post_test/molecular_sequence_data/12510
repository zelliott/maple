Pay zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fail to assemble functional zzso One zzso strain, zzso has zzso small zzso that are often found in clusters surrounded by zzso zzso The functionally zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso that is a member of the zzso repeat zzso zzso is zzso In zzso zzso zzso is associated primarily with the inner surface of the zzso zzso but approximately zzso of zzso is localized to the zzso zzso The majority of zzso in the zzso is zzso with two zzso of 62 and 64 zzso recognized by zzso to zzso zzso targeting zzso In contrast, in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is localized exclusively to the zzso and forms no zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso gene disruption zzso showed that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene prevent the zzso of most zzso proteins into the zzso zzso These zzso including the zzso zzso zzso are trapped in the zzso membrane at an intermediate stage of zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that there are at least two distinct zzso zzso involved in the import of proteins into zzso
