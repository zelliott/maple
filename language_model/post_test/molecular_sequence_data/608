zzso is well characterized in zzso as an zzso protein and its increased expression is correlated with the zzso of various zzso However, the actual roles and regulation of zzso in zzso remain zzso Here we show that zzso is required for the zzso migration of blood cells in zzso zzso zzso expression is highly regulated during embryonic development and, within the blood zzso is specific to the zzso zzso of cells, which comprises zzso zzso We show that zzso is required for zzso migration, both as these cells undergo zzso zzso and during an inflammatory response to zzso zzso Live analyses further demonstrate that zzso zzso to, and is essential for the assembly of, dynamic zzso zzso within zzso zzso that zzso towards the direction of zzso We show that a regulatory zzso of zzso identified from in zzso studies is not required for in zzso cell zzso but is crucial for the formation of zzso zzso within zzso zzso Together, these results offer a first glimpse into the mechanisms regulating zzso function during normal development, which might be relevant for understanding the impact of zzso in zzso
