There is a pressing need in zzso for zzso fluorescent zzso zzso that can be targeted to specific zzso and circuits to allow study of neural activity using fluorescent zzso We created 90 zzso in which the zzso sensing portion zzso of zzso zzso zzso sensitive zzso zzso was fused to zzso zzso zzso This led to zzso a probe that is an order of magnitude faster zzso zzso zzso than any currently published fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso can follow the rise and fall of zzso action zzso with a modest decrease in zzso intensity zzso zzso The probe has a nearly linear zzso potential response to both zzso and zzso zzso This is the first probe based on zzso that captures the rapid movements of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso designed with zzso zzso fluorescent proteins may have some zzso
