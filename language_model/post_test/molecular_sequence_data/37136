zzso zzso metal zzso 1) is a zzso zzso metal zzso with a zzso preference for iron, although the protein when expressed in zzso zzso zzso a broad range of metals, including the toxic metals cadmium and zzso zzso zzso cells displayed zzso transport of lead and iron that was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso inhibited transport of iron, but zinc and lead did zzso The involvement of zzso in the transport of toxic metals was examined by establishing zzso zzso zzso and control zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines displayed much lower levels of zzso zzso and a smaller zzso for iron zzso compared with control cell zzso One clone was further characterized and found to display an approximately 50% reduction in zzso of iron across a pH range from zzso to zzso zzso for cadmium also decreased 50% across the same pH range, but zzso for lead did zzso These results show that zzso is important in iron and cadmium transport in zzso cells but that lead enters these cells through an independent zzso zzso
