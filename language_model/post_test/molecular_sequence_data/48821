The rapid evolution of essential zzso genes and their protein products is both intriguing and zzso The rapid evolution of gene products with simple protein folds and a lack of zzso functional zzso typically result in a low discovery rate of zzso zzso Additionally, in the absence of zzso it is difficult to study the processes and mechanisms underlying rapid zzso In this study, we have investigated the rapid evolution of zzso zzso an essential gene zzso zzso protein zzso required during zzso development in zzso zzso Until recently the rapid divergence of zzso made identification of zzso difficult and questionable because zzso violates many of the assumptions underlying models for protein zzso To overcome these limitations, we have identified a group of insect zzso and present zzso features likely to be required for the functions attributed to zzso in zzso zzso We also show that the rapid divergence of zzso zzso is apparently due to frequent coding sequence zzso and an accelerated rate of zzso additions and zzso These changes appear to be zzso by zzso and zzso frame maximum potential zzso simple protein zzso and the zzso zzso These zzso features also occur in other genes in zzso and may help prevent potentially deleterious zzso due to zzso in genes with large coding zzso and zzso regions separated by small zzso This work promises to be useful for future investigations of zzso and potentially other rapidly evolving genes and zzso
