zzso a zzso for zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso a group of cell surface molecules characterized by zzso sequence motifs within their zzso binding zzso A recurring mechanism for the zzso of zzso receptors is the formation of functional complexes by zzso zzso zzso Within the growth hormone zzso a cluster of zzso zzso acids forms a zzso interface domain that zzso zzso zzso This domain appears to be functionally zzso in the zzso zzso zzso because substitution of zzso for zzso in the analogous region causes zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso This report identifies an zzso domain within the zzso zzso The substitution of zzso zzso for specific zzso acids in the zzso interface zzso regions of zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells expressing the active zzso zzso no longer required zzso factors and proliferated zzso The results imply that the normal process of zzso zzso zzso occurs through zzso zzso and is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso interface zzso Moreover, cells expressing activated zzso zzso receptors were zzso in transplanted zzso Thus, like zzso its viral counterpart, zzso forms of the cellular zzso gene also have zzso zzso
