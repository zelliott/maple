We have recently described a large (20 zzso protein zzso zzso complex, termed the zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso functions to modify specific zzso to zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso and this modification targets these proteins to the survival of motor zzso zzso complex for assembly into small nuclear zzso zzso core zzso Here, we describe a novel component of the zzso a zzso zzso repeat protein termed zzso protein 50 zzso We show that zzso is important for zzso activity and binds to zzso and to a subset of zzso zzso Because zzso repeat proteins provide a platform for multiple protein zzso zzso may function to mediate the interaction of multiple zzso with the zzso Interestingly, all of the known components of the zzso bind zzso zzso suggesting that in addition to producing properly zzso zzso for the zzso complex, the zzso may be involved in zzso protein zzso or zzso required for zzso zzso
