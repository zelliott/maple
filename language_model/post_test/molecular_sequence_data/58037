We expressed the following fragments of chicken gizzard zzso in the zzso zzso zzso system at zzso zzso of pure zzso of zzso full-length smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound with affinities at least zzso fold zzso zzso bound zzso and zzso did not zzso Only zzso and zzso bound to smooth muscle myosin, both about zzso weaker than zzso and zzso Only zzso and zzso bound to zzso with affinities zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding to zzso was zzso whereas the binding to zzso was zzso corresponding to the weak binding component found in the presence of zzso zzso bound only to the zzso fragments with the same affinity as zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso correlated with 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso was reversed by zzso Thus, the zzso zzso regulatory function, zzso zzso and most zzso binding is located within the zzso 99 zzso zzso whereas zzso binding is distributed throughout the rest of the zzso
