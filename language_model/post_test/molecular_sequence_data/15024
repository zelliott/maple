Cellular zzso signaling zzso diverse vital biological zzso including muscle zzso memory zzso zzso cell survival, and cell zzso Despite extensive studies, the fundamental control mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso movement remain zzso We have found recently that zzso of the zzso markedly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of rat heart zzso Little is known about the zzso responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which zzso of the zzso is coupled to increased zzso zzso channel function through a signaling cascade involving zzso and zzso but not well established regulators of the channel, such as zzso zzso system or zzso of zzso or zzso We have also identified zzso a zzso site for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channel that may participate in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The findings reported here uncover a novel molecular zzso between zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso channel and provide new insights into zzso signaling mechanisms for deeper understanding of the nature of cellular zzso handling in zzso
