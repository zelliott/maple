The zzso sequence of zzso 1 of the zzso strain zzso I) of cucumber mosaic virus zzso was determined and compared at both the zzso acid and protein levels with the corresponding sequence of zzso 1 of the Q strain zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 consisted of zzso zzso and contained a single long open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso 1 consists of zzso zzso and contains a single zzso of zzso zzso The levels of sequence zzso between the two zzso were zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the protein zzso These zzso were distributed widely over the zzso with zzso of the zzso differences in zzso acid sequence located between zzso acids zzso and zzso and another zzso of the differences located between zzso acids 224 and zzso While the zzso 141 zzso acids contain more basic than zzso zzso zzso the region of greatest zzso acid sequence zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso contained a preponderance of zzso zzso acids in the putative translation products of zzso 1 of both zzso and zzso The last 180 zzso of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso 1 and 2 were zzso zzso whereas the sequence zzso between zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 1 was zzso in this zzso Furthermore, the zzso secondary structures formed by the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso 1 and 2 were virtually zzso By contrast, there was only zzso sequence zzso between the zzso zzso regions of these two zzso and zzso sequence zzso between the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso divergence in the zzso regions of these zzso as well as possible functions for the translation product of zzso 1, are zzso
