zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso was found in zzso of red zzso zzso zzso and splendid zzso zzso zzso which were imported to Japan from China and South Africa, zzso zzso examinations of the zzso from the zzso muscle of red zzso revealed that spores zzso zzso in maximum zzso had 4 distinct zzso valves, in which 1 extremely large zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 small, and 1 vestigial polar capsule were zzso The small zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the zzso cluster within a zzso was composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all having zzso spores with 1 polar capsule larger than the other zzso On the basis of these zzso we describe this zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular analyses of the zzso from splendid zzso identified it as zzso zzso which has been described from many marine zzso To our knowledge, this is the first record of zzso zzso in splendid zzso
