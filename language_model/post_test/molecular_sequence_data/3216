The capture and spread of zzso resistance zzso by zzso zzso the rapid evolution of multiple zzso resistance among diverse zzso clinical zzso The association of multiple resistance zzso zzso with mobile DNA elements zzso their transit across zzso boundaries and zzso the potential impact of zzso on bacterial zzso Recently, ancestral zzso versions, the zzso zzso were found to be genuine components of the zzso of diverse bacterial zzso zzso possess evolutionary characteristics and zzso of zzso functions, including zzso related to zzso resistance zzso previously characterized in clinical zzso which suggest that zzso and their resistance genes were originally recruited from zzso and their pool of amassed zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso has never been demonstrated in a zzso other than zzso zzso We introduced a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso into zzso zzso a species known to zzso a zzso We show that zzso can randomly recruit genes directly from the zzso of zzso zzso By applying a selective constraint for the development of zzso resistance, we demonstrate bacterial resistance evolution through the recruitment a novel, but zzso silent, zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso and its precise zzso into the zzso The resulting resistance profile zzso zzso zzso could then be zzso by zzso to other clinically relevant pathogens at high zzso These results demonstrate that otherwise zzso sensitive strains may still be a genetic source for the evolution of resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics through zzso zzso zzso
