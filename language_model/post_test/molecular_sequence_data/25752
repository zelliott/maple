The zzso for protein zzso of the zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso both in consensus zzso context, at the beginning of its transit zzso coding region zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso Due to the location in the transit zzso zzso start from either zzso zzso would yield the same mature protein after transport into zzso and zzso zzso To test whether this arrangement, also found in the zzso of several other zzso zzso zzso could enhance the zzso of zzso we constructed a zzso gene containing the zzso part of the zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso that would prematurely terminate the translation from the first zzso zzso was introduced into the construct by zzso zzso zzso of the fusion gene in zzso and its expression in zzso in spinach zzso showed that protein synthesis occurs from both initiation zzso at zzso of the total level from the first and zzso from the zzso The results thus show that zzso zzso zzso can initiate to a significant level from a downstream zzso zzso and zzso the occurrence of two zzso initiation zzso enhances zzso zzso
