zzso zzso dependent protein zzso I zzso is a member of a zzso zzso zzso family, but its zzso and zzso functions have yet to be zzso Here, we have cloned two zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One is a novel zzso of zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso The other is an alpha zzso of zzso zzso which is a highly related to previously cloned zzso zzso zzso was constantly expressed through zzso whereas zzso zzso expression dramatically increased in the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso of zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso and caused a marked change of cell zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso regulation during early embryonic zzso
