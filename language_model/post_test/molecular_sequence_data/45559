Until now the bystander effect had only been described in zzso In the present study the existence of this effect has been demonstrated for the zzso oldest zzso zzso the zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso for the experiments in the zzso The lower dish contained zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and the upper dish the zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were treated with zzso light (40 zzso and 100 zzso hydrogen zzso zzso factors that exist also in the natural marine aquatic environment of zzso these factors caused a high level of DNA strand breaks followed by a reduced viability of the zzso If these cells were added to the zzso zzso these zzso cultures started to undergo zzso This effect could be abolished by the zzso scavenger zzso and zzso The conclusion that NO is zzso by the zzso cells was supported zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso High levels of zzso transcripts were measured in zzso zzso cells while after zzso treatment the zzso level of expression drops zzso We conclude that in the absence of zzso the concentration of the zzso inhibitor for the NO zzso zzso is low, due to the high level of zzso In consequence, high amounts of NO are released from zzso cells which cause zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso reduces the zzso expression with the consequence of higher levels of zzso which prevent the formation of larger amounts of zzso This study describes the zzso bystander effect also for the most zzso zzso and demonstrates that this effect is controlled by the two gases NO and zzso
