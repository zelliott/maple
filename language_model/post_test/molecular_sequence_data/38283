We describe the expression of an zzso single chain variable region zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso Four zzso for zzso display were zzso Two of them are able to display multiple copies of the zzso fragment, and the others can be used to make zzso zzso The zzso use different zzso sequences to direct the expression of the fused zzso All were able to promote the assembly of fusion zzso zzso In this paper we also show the affinity selection zzso of those zzso based on the capacity of their products to recognize the zzso We used zzso zzso and the selection was performed in a solution phase zzso The data presented here indicate that these zzso can be further used to construct zzso acid zzso zzso libraries that can be used to study the basis of zzso zzso interaction and its role in zzso zzso
