The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the expression of eight zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso were prepared by using zzso and zzso and selected zzso zzso were used to measure expression of each zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes is likely controlled at the zzso level, since in general, there were no differences between the results obtained with the two zzso zzso was the most highly zzso and zzso was expressed at very low zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso and part of zzso abolished the expression of zzso but had no effect on the zzso genes zzso to zzso To locate the DNA regions required for expression of zzso to zzso deletion zzso were prepared and the effects on expression of zzso to zzso were zzso The deletion of a segment between zzso and zzso abolished zzso and zzso expression but did not affect zzso and zzso The deletion of a portion of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso abolished the expression of zzso and zzso These results indicate the presence of regulatory elements zzso to zzso and to zzso zzso promoters were identified in these regions by DNA zzso and by primer zzso A zzso structure that may act as a zzso zzso of zzso was also found at the beginning of zzso These data confirm our previous model of zzso zzso zzso
