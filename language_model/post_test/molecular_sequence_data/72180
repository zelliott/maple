zzso zzso involves a cascade of binding interactions designed to assemble zzso regulatory proteins into functional zzso zzso zzso zzso surface protein contains a series of nearly identical zzso zzso sequences for binding zzso zzso zzso The latter is a zzso protein with numerous zzso zzso sites for zzso a 15 zzso regulatory protein that promotes zzso filament zzso Analysis of known zzso regulatory proteins led to the identification of distinct zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso (where X denotes G, A, zzso and zzso
