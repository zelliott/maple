The molecular interaction of the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso protein zzso of human zzso virus zzso 1, with its zzso zzso is characterized by a panel of overlapping zzso a zzso zzso library and molecular modeling zzso The sequence zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of zzso was identified as the best binding zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso This zzso served as a starting point to prepare a zzso zzso zzso library in which each zzso of the zzso is zzso by all zzso and zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso which were subsequently analyzed for binding zzso The library was zzso to identify zzso critical for binding and to obtain information about the molecular environment of the zzso zzso bound to zzso Both zzso zzso as well as zzso 6, zzso 8 and zzso 12, of the zzso were highly sensitive to zzso Using the data obtained from the zzso zzso as well as a zzso electron density map of a zzso zzso complex, a 3-D model of the zzso complex was generated by molecular zzso The modeling experiments predict binding of the zzso which is zzso via the two zzso zzso to a pocket formed zzso by the zzso zzso zzso determining regions zzso zzso and zzso
