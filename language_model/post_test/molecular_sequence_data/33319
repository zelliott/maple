zzso is a zzso zzso It has been observed to be deleted, to be duplicated and to undergo zzso events involving the zzso zzso and surrounding zzso The objective of this study was to discover the zzso structure of zzso zzso that interfere with clinical zzso platforms that are available zzso 

Clinical samples containing rare zzso zzso zzso ambiguous zzso and those with zzso signals and two different zzso were analyzed by long-range zzso amplification of individual zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso primer extension zzso and DNA sequencing to characterize zzso and zzso zzso 

Novel zzso zzso structures, and the DNA sequence of these structures are zzso Interestingly, in 49 of 50 DNA samples that had zzso gene zzso or zzso where two zzso were zzso the zzso containing the zzso or zzso had identical tandem zzso 

Several new zzso zzso and zzso structures are described which will be useful for zzso zzso The findings suggest that the zzso events responsible for zzso zzso and zzso are because of mechanisms other than zzso crossover during zzso
