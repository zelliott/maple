zzso syndrome is an zzso disorder characterized by deafness and zzso After our recent identification of the human gene zzso in zzso syndrome zzso we sought to investigate in greater detail the expression of the gene and the function of its zzso protein zzso Toward that end, we isolated the corresponding mouse zzso zzso and performed zzso in zzso zzso on mouse inner ears (from 8 days zzso to zzso day 5) to establish the expression pattern of zzso in the developing auditory and zzso zzso zzso expression was detected throughout the zzso duct and zzso in distinct areas of the zzso and zzso and in the external zzso region within the zzso This highly discrete expression pattern is unlike that of any other known gene and involves several regions thought to be important for zzso fluid zzso in the inner ear, consistent with the putative functioning of zzso as an zzso zzso These studies provide key first steps toward defining the precise role of zzso in inner ear development and zzso the zzso mechanism for the deafness seen in zzso zzso
