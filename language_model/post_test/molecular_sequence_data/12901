Several zzso zzso zzso precursors have been shown to consist of a zzso zzso similar to a protein named zzso and a structurally varied zzso zzso zzso zzso with these features have been named zzso In this paper we report the zzso sequences of three zzso zzso of zzso 160 and 190 zzso respectively, with zzso zzso sequences corresponding to putative zzso zzso These are structurally varied and include a zzso sequence of 12 zzso which is similar to the bovine zzso zzso zzso a novel 29 zzso sequence named zzso with a possible zzso zzso and a 60 zzso sequence named zzso which appears to be a new member of the zzso and zzso group of zzso zzso zzso
