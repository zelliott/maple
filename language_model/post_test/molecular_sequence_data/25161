The stable determination of different zzso regions of the zzso zzso is controlled by the persistent expression of zzso zzso zzso One mechanism that has been proposed to explain the persistent expression of the zzso gene zzso is an zzso circuit that would be used once zzso expression had been established by earlier acting patterning zzso Here we show that a large zzso element mapping approximately 5 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start has the properties predicted for a zzso zzso zzso This element provides late, zzso localized expression in the zzso cells of the zzso and zzso segments which is wholly dependent upon zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso can be activated zzso in zzso and in zzso disc cells by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso element indicates that it contains compartment specific zzso similar to those of other zzso zzso
