We report a technique to selectively and continuously label the zzso of individual cell types in zzso named cell zzso labeling using zzso acid precursors zzso Through transgenic expression of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cells overcome their dependence on supplemented essential zzso acids and can be selectively labeled through zzso incorporation of zzso acids produced from heavy zzso zzso When testing zzso in several human and mouse cell lines, we could zzso label the zzso of distinct cell populations in zzso and determine the relative expression of proteins by quantitative mass zzso In addition, using zzso we identified the cell of origin of zzso proteins zzso from cells in zzso We believe that this method, which allows linking of proteins to their cell source, will be useful in studies of zzso communication and potentially for discovery of zzso
