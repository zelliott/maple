zzso zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso at their C zzso There are conflicting reports about the function of zzso in virus zzso In the present work, zzso that affect zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso were constructed and zzso None of the zzso prevented virus release zzso however, detachment of budding particles was less efficient as evidenced by electron zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had a significantly reduced number of Pol proteins zzso zzso and zzso and an increased amount of incompletely processed zzso proteins compared with the parental zzso A zzso that altered the zzso site between zzso and zzso did not significantly affect virus zzso virus release or protein processing with the exception of zzso between zzso and zzso However, zzso of this zzso zzso exhibited zzso core structures that were distinct from the zzso core structure seen in the parental zzso zzso zzso virus was zzso in zzso T zzso These results suggest that zzso in zzso affect efficient detachment of budding particles from the cell zzso Proper zzso between zzso and zzso may be critical for the formation of the distinctive zzso core structure of zzso zzso
