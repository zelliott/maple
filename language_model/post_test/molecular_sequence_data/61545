In the course of a zzso search performed by muscle zzso transcript analysis in 72 zzso and Becker zzso zzso zzso patients without gross gene zzso we encountered four unrelated cases with additional zzso sequences precisely zzso between two intact zzso of the mature muscle zzso zzso An in zzso search of the whole zzso zzso sequence revealed that these zzso zzso to cryptic zzso flanked by one strong and one weak consensus zzso site and located in the zzso of large zzso zzso 60, 9, zzso and 62, zzso In each case we identified an zzso point zzso zzso the cryptic donor or zzso zzso zzso The patients exhibited a zzso zzso consistent with the presence of reduced amounts of normally spliced transcript and normal zzso The frequency of this new type of zzso is not negligible zzso of our series of 65 patients with zzso zzso It would be missed if the exploration of the zzso gene is exclusively performed on zzso and zzso sequences of zzso zzso
