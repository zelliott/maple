The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso contains three origins of DNA zzso one copy of zzso and two copies of zzso Although zzso and zzso are structurally different, they have extensive zzso sequence similarity and can substitute for each other to initiate viral DNA zzso A fundamental question that remains to be answered is why the zzso zzso contains two types of zzso We have recently identified a novel zzso response element zzso within zzso that is not present in zzso and have shown by gel mobility shift zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso present in cellular zzso can bind to the zzso in zzso To determine whether zzso and the zzso affect the efficiency of zzso DNA zzso we performed transient DNA replication zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso Because zzso is a zzso virus and establishes zzso in cells of neural origin, these tests were conducted in zzso cells, which assume the properties of sympathetic zzso when differentiated with nerve growth factor zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso DNA replication was enhanced zzso by zzso whereas in zzso cells, zzso enhanced replication approximately zzso zzso the enhancement of zzso function by zzso was abolished when the zzso was zzso zzso differentiation alone had no zzso In contrast to zzso zzso DNA replication was reduced approximately zzso in zzso zzso cells and an additional zzso in differentiated cells treated with zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso had only a minor zzso effect zzso zzso on zzso zzso Although the zzso elements that mediate the zzso and zzso repression of zzso DNA replication are unknown, a functional zzso is critical for the zzso enhancement of zzso function in zzso zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso DNA replication by zzso in differentiated zzso cells suggests the possibility that zzso agents long recognized to enhance zzso of zzso zzso infections, act through the zzso in zzso to stimulate viral DNA replication and zzso in terminally differentiated zzso in zzso
