We have identified and characterized the complete complement of genes zzso the core zzso of zzso zzso In addition to the previously identified pair of genes that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso we identified a second zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso transcribed pair of genes that zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso a zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso not described in other zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso identical in their coding regions and zzso identical zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in either gene were zzso wild type, in terms of growth rates and zzso but the double zzso were zzso As expected, we were unable to isolate zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso arrangement of the zzso and zzso zzso genes was zzso zzso and the zzso gene pair are on LG zzso with zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso are on LG zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso is on LG zzso and the zzso pair is located immediately right of the LG zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso Except for the zzso gene in the pairs, all of the zzso genes are transcribed toward the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso genes places them in the zzso zzso In contrast to the general case in zzso zzso genes in zzso are few in number and contain zzso This may be a reflection of the evolution of the zzso zzso point zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso processes that detect sizable zzso and silence associated zzso
