According to the multiple alignment of various zzso zzso zzso zzso three human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the center domain, zzso zzso and zzso were created, zzso and zzso We characterized these zzso to investigate the reaction mechanism of human zzso zzso The specific activities of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso content analysis indicated that these zzso zzso about zzso zzso and zzso of zzso content compared to that of zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight analysis showed that these three zzso proteins form the zzso zzso data demonstrated that the zzso of both forward and reverse reactions of these zzso proteins were zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso play a role in the zzso function of the zzso
