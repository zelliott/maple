zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso important zzso center reported to be zzso Little is known about the origin of this group or its linkage to the zzso To initiate structural studies on this zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from an zzso coli zzso clone in which the zzso gene zzso was under the control of the zzso zzso promoter on a zzso zzso In this clone from 6 to zzso of the soluble cell protein after heat induction was zzso and approximately 200 zzso of zzso pure zzso could be obtained from 120 g wet weight of cells in a 40 to zzso zzso The zzso protein was identical to zzso zzso zzso in native molecular weight zzso zzso zzso composition (four identical zzso of 53 zzso each), affinity for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso and its sensitivity to zzso by cyanide and zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was in agreement with the zzso zzso indicating proper zzso zzso These features make this zzso an appropriate candidate for protein structure investigations regarding the nature of the zzso center and its association with the zzso
