The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in pancreatic zzso and zzso termed zzso has been cloned and zzso The human zzso gene is composed of 11 zzso spanning approximately 30 zzso The sequence of the promoter region and all zzso and adjacent zzso regions has been determined and deposited in the zzso zzso Two highly zzso simple tandem repeat DNA zzso useful for linkage studies were localized in zzso 1 and zzso In addition, a zzso pair zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso The characterization of the human zzso gene will facilitate studies of its role in the development of diabetes zzso
