zzso response factors zzso are plant zzso regulators zzso zzso gene expression via binding to the zzso motif found in the promoter region of zzso zzso We report here on the structural and functional characterization of the tomato zzso gene that belongs to a distinct class of the large zzso gene zzso Both spliced and zzso versions of zzso transcripts were amplified from zzso samples and the search in the public tomato expressed sequence tag zzso database confirmed the existence of the two transcript species in a number of zzso zzso The zzso transcript contains two open reading frames yielding two hypothetical zzso a small highly truncated version lacking the zzso domain and a bigger protein lacking the zzso zzso consensus zzso specific to zzso members from zzso zzso Nevertheless, functional zzso protein may only derive from spliced transcripts since, depending on the zzso the level of the spliced transcript is much higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all plant zzso tested, though its transcript accumulates zzso in zzso seeds and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in transgenic tomato lines results in premature seed zzso and enhanced hook formation of zzso zzso which is indicative of increased zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene is zzso in zzso seeds, suggesting that zzso stimulates seed zzso through the induction of the zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the exaggerated hook zzso is abolished when zzso perception is zzso strongly suggesting that zzso requires other zzso components to impact the hook formation zzso
