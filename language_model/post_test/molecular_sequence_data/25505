A new model of U2 zzso secondary structure has been developed by comparing U2 zzso sequences from zzso related zzso which process their zzso by zzso and U2 zzso from zzso zzso The zzso U2 zzso retains structural similarity in important functional zzso of zzso U2 zzso yet differs from previous consensus models in that only two zzso rather than three, can form in the zzso II zzso This zzso eliminates the capacity for zzso formation and produces a zzso region 3' to zzso II, which may be accessible for zzso protein zzso zzso U2 zzso differ in the putative zzso recognition zzso which completely diverge from the zzso zzso consensus of zzso zzso
