In experimental zzso zzso zzso there are concurrent zzso zzso and cellular immune zzso Many studies have recently focused on zzso zzso in zzso while analysis of zzso responses to zzso zzso has been less well zzso In this study, a defined zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso designated zzso was used to induce zzso zzso analysis of eyes at day 10 demonstrated extensive zzso zzso of the anterior segment, with zzso and plasma cells in the zzso zzso The presence of plasma cells suggests local production of zzso within the zzso zzso analyses of serum, zzso and zzso from rats with zzso severe zzso revealed the presence of zzso against zzso zzso There was little difference between the serum and zzso zzso zzso presumably due to breakdown of the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso there were zzso zzso zzso against separate and distinct zzso zzso as well as, against zzso on zzso zzso These results indicate that in zzso severe zzso zzso immune responses are induced to the primary zzso and that there is also auxiliary production of zzso zzso against other zzso present on zzso zzso These auxiliary responses may contribute to the zzso of severe zzso
