zzso zzso a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso is a major product of zzso zzso and is believed to be largely responsible for the zzso effects observed during zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to form a stable zzso Michael zzso zzso possessing three zzso centers in the zzso zzso zzso We have previously raised the zzso zzso zzso 310 and zzso zzso zzso that zzso recognized the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and demonstrated the presence of both zzso in zzso In the present study, to further investigate the zzso immune response, we analyzed the variable genes and primary structure of these zzso and found that the sequence of zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso the hallmark of systemic lupus zzso An zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso binds to a zzso pocket in the zzso zzso Despite the structural identity to the zzso zzso however, zzso showed only a slight zzso with the native zzso DNA, whereas the zzso zzso was dramatically enhanced by the treatment of the DNA with zzso zzso an analog of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as alternative zzso of zzso zzso mimicry between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso base zzso is proposed for the dual zzso
