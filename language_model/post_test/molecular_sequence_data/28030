The zzso growth factors zzso I and II exert zzso effects on diverse cell types through interaction with specific high affinity cell surface receptors and with locally produced binding zzso In skeletal muscle and in zzso cell lines, the functions of zzso and zzso are zzso Both growth factors appear capable of stimulating cellular proliferation and zzso as well as exerting zzso effects on zzso zzso We have demonstrated recently that the expression of zzso and its zzso is induced during the terminal differentiation of the zzso cell line, zzso and have suggested that zzso may be an zzso growth factor in these cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso We now have examined this cell line for expression of other components involved in zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso is low during zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected only through use of a sensitive solution zzso zzso Typical zzso receptors can be measured in zzso whereas zzso binding proteins cannot be detected in zzso cells or in zzso culture zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso levels increase zzso by zzso within zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso is accompanied by a zzso zzso of zzso in the culture zzso zzso receptors also increase zzso doubling by 48 h after the onset of zzso By contrast, zzso of a Mr zzso zzso binding protein is induced zzso to 100 zzso within 16 h and continues to increase throughout zzso These studies demonstrate that several components critical to zzso action are produced in a fusing skeletal muscle cell line in a zzso manner and suggest that both zzso and zzso may be zzso factors for zzso
