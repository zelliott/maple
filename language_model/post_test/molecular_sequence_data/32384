zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In the previous study, several zzso with zzso acid zzso were designed to increase or decrease only the net zzso In particular, zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso 3) for zzso zzso acid caused a dramatic increase in zzso activity without a zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso that forms, in a zzso zzso an zzso structure consisting of an zzso random zzso region zzso zzso and extended zzso regular zzso region zzso zzso To obtain the short and potent zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso random zzso deleted zzso zzso and examined their zzso activity and mechanism of zzso The resulting zzso zzso showed increased zzso and zzso activity to zzso and zzso respectively, without zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was accumulated in the plasma zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso acted in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso causes significant zzso zzso of the bacterial surfaces as shown by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso showed higher zzso contents than the zzso zzso in 50% zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso which depended on the zzso content of zzso correlated zzso with their zzso zzso
