Here, we study the zzso properties of genetic sequence by viewing the entire sequence as a zzso First, a systematic way of coding the zzso in a genetic sequence is zzso Next, we apply the coding method to real genetic zzso and find a zzso zzso distribution for some particular kinds of zzso Furthermore, we also present a model to reproduce the observed zzso feature, which is based on three generic zzso 1) Growth mechanism - genetic sequences expands continuously by the addition of new zzso 2) zzso replication mechanism - the newly added zzso at every time step is a replication of one of existed zzso and the probability that a zzso is zzso is zzso to its emerging times in existed zzso and 3) zzso mechanism - following zzso the newly added zzso has a small probability to zzso To our knowledge, no report has been published to study the genetic sequences in such zzso
