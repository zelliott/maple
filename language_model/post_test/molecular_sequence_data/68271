We have determined the major sites responsible for zzso formation during in zzso aging of bovine brain zzso under mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso by the transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso side zzso More than zzso zzso of zzso sites per zzso of zzso accumulated during a zzso incubation without calcium at pH zzso 37 degrees zzso Analysis of zzso peptides of aged zzso revealed that zzso zzso of the zzso capacity is restricted to zzso in the four zzso zzso which are predicted to be highly flexible in the absence of zzso We estimate that zzso III, IV, and II accumulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso per zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso is the greatest contributor to zzso zzso Other major sites of zzso formation are zzso and zzso in domain IV, and zzso in domain zzso zzso zzso formation was also localized to zzso zzso and/or zzso in domain I, to zzso and/or zzso in domain II, and to zzso and/or zzso in domain zzso All of these zzso are calcium zzso in the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, other zzso proteins may also be subject to zzso formation at these zzso The results support the idea that zzso formation in structured proteins is strongly influenced by both the zzso zzso and by local zzso
