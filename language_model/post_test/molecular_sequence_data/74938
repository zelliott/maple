The zzso sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicates that the zzso zzso gene product has a molecular weight of zzso A typical zzso signal sequence is present at the zzso zzso of the zzso The processed zzso is relatively zzso and has a zzso of zzso An zzso repeat structure was detected upstream from the zzso gene and may function in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of the regions zzso the gene revealed the presence of four other putative open reading frames zzso Two of these, zzso 2 and 3, appear to code for zzso proteins containing zzso acid sequences sharing zzso with several zzso bacterial zzso zzso In addition, zzso 3 is transcribed from the zzso DNA coding zzso zzso sequencing of zzso 4 suggests that its gene product may be an zzso zzso
