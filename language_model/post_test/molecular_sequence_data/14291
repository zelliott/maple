The zzso protein of zzso C virus zzso is a zzso that is zzso for viral zzso replication but plays a critical role in virus zzso In this study, we generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The parental zzso zzso zzso was zzso in human zzso cells, and infectious zzso zzso were produced only when cells zzso with the zzso zzso were zzso several zzso zzso analysis of the entire zzso region of the recovered zzso virus revealed one zzso zzso acid substitution in zzso protein 2 zzso zzso and one in zzso zzso Forward genetic analysis demonstrated that each of these zzso per zzso restored the zzso of the parental zzso zzso suggesting that interactions between zzso zzso and zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cellular zzso and the zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso neither increased viral zzso replication in human zzso cells nor altered the zzso activity of zzso in an in zzso zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that zzso zzso is involved in virus zzso
