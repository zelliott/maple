During zzso a zzso cell zzso two rounds of nuclear division following one round of DNA replication to produce four zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso products are packaged into zzso To gain new insights into zzso development and spore formation, we followed differential expression of genes in zzso versus zzso growing cells in the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that there are at least five different classes of transcripts representing genes expressed at different stages of the zzso zzso Here we describe one of these zzso expressed zzso zzso which plays an essential role in zzso and spore zzso zzso is expressed midway through zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells fail to zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso is normal but viability declines zzso Both zzso divisions occur at the normal time; however, the fraction of cells completing zzso is significantly reduced, and zzso become fragmented soon after zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not appear to be related to a zzso event and is independent of two rounds of zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso is likely to function in a zzso that controls zzso nuclear divisions and coordinates zzso and spore zzso
