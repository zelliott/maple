The zzso zzso zzso causes the zzso of a group I zzso into a bacterial zzso zzso only example of an invasive mobile zzso within a bacterial zzso Using a zzso fold zzso zzso screen and crystal structure determination, we demonstrate that this protein is a zzso zzso zzso - a fold normally used to protect a bacterial zzso from invading DNA through the action of restriction zzso zzso uses its zzso assembly to promote recognition of a single long target site, whereas restriction zzso zzso facilitate cooperative binding and zzso of two short zzso The limited use of the zzso zzso by mobile zzso stands in contrast to their frequent use of zzso and zzso zzso - which in turn, are rarely incorporated into zzso zzso
