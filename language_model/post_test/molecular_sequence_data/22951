The major zzso of zzso zzso attachment to host cells is the zzso zzso domain of the zzso fiber zzso Ad type zzso zzso species zzso in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso at least two different cellular attachment zzso designated zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso B2 zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as one of the zzso attachment zzso However, zzso did not seem to constitute a functional zzso for zzso Although zzso shares high zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso is deficient in binding to both zzso and zzso To determine what regions of the zzso fiber zzso are necessary for zzso interaction, we constructed zzso fiber knobs zzso with zzso zzso and zzso sequences having a single zzso acid substitution from zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells was analyzed by flow zzso Our results indicate that an zzso zzso substitution is sufficient to convert the zzso zzso zzso to that of zzso and abolish zzso and zzso zzso Also a zzso substitution in zzso zzso increases zzso zzso Thus, the lateral zzso loop of the zzso fiber zzso seems to be the key zzso for zzso zzso zzso This result is comparable to another zzso zzso binding Ad zzso where substitution of one zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In conjunction with previous results, our findings also strongly suggest that zzso is equivalent to zzso
