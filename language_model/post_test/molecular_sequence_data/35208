To provide genetic diagnosis and counseling for patients from two families affected with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Potential zzso of the zzso gene was screened by DNA zzso For family 1, multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso analysis and zzso of zzso gene were also carried out for prenatal zzso 

For the patient from family 1, deletion of the zzso 1 of the zzso gene and 2 short tandem zzso sites zzso and zzso were zzso His daughter was carrier of the zzso Upon prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was confirmed to be a normal male, for whom the zzso of zzso gene has differed from that of the zzso In family 2, a zzso zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene was detected in the zzso whose mother was zzso for the same zzso 

The deletion zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene have probably zzso the disease in the two zzso During prenatal diagnosis, it may be necessary to obtain precise results through combining zzso detection and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso
