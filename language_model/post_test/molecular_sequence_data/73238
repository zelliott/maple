Alternative zzso of certain class I major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso is known to lead to generation of a zzso soluble protein zzso This study was undertaken to examine whether this process occurs with zzso whether the process is modified by zzso bacteria, and whether the assembly of the soluble molecules follows the same zzso as the integral parent zzso 

Alternative zzso of zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction, and assembly of soluble zzso by zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso 

There was alternative zzso of the zzso of zzso The process could be amplified by invasion with zzso or zzso zzso The soluble zzso was assembled in a zzso similar to that of the parent zzso 

The association between zzso bacteria and zzso positive cells is a complex zzso zzso zzso is a potential key zzso
