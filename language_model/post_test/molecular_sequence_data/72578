We have isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the anterior neural plate, and subsequently in the neural structures of the developing eye zzso zzso and pigmented zzso and in other zzso structures zzso from the anterior neural zzso in the zzso zzso throughout its development, in the zzso floor and in the zzso Its zzso limit of expression zzso to the zzso zzso which some authors consider as the zzso limit of the neural zzso thus, zzso may represent one of the most zzso expressed zzso genes reported to zzso Moreover, its expression in zzso implicated in the establishment of zzso zzso may suggest for zzso a role in the genetic control of this zzso Finally, analysis of zzso expression in zzso subjected to various treatments, or zzso with different zzso agents zzso zzso suggests that vertical zzso signals leading to head zzso are required to activate zzso
