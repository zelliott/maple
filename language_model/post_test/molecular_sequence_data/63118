In studying the regulation of zzso the structural gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso responsive element, zzso zzso zzso was zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is induced by sulfur zzso and zzso by addition of zzso to the growth zzso We detected a zzso motif zzso to zzso and a zzso motif zzso zzso to zzso which is one base shorter than the zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso One copy of the zzso determining element 1, zzso zzso zzso to zzso being responsible for regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso We tested the roles of these three elements in the regulation of zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we found that the zzso motif is required for zzso of zzso as well as for its repression by zzso In contrast, the zzso motif was responsible for only zzso of zzso We also found that two zzso factors, zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso of zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest a dual regulation of zzso by factors that interact with the zzso motif and the zzso zzso
