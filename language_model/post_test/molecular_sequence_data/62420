Eight zzso zzso strains were used to test their activity against zzso zzso When crystal proteins extracted from strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were injected into zzso mice through the tail vein at a rate of zzso zzso per zzso the lengths of survival for the mice were extended up to 5 days (from zzso days to zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that normal zzso were lightly stained and regularly shaped while the zzso from zzso mice zzso lost shape and even zzso This means that the crystal proteins could protect zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that most of the proteins are zzso of classic crystal zzso with the exception of the zzso protein of strain zzso a zzso zzso This study suggested a novel way to control zzso infections and even zzso
