We found several juvenile zzso zzso in the bean zzso zzso zzso by using zzso differential display zzso et zzso zzso One of them, a juvenile zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso characterized and identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed significant zzso with the zzso genes of several insects, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Aedes aegypti zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso was prepared by using zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli as an zzso The zzso reacted specifically with both the zzso protein and the native protein from the bugs, with sizes of 70 and 75 zzso zzso The 75 zzso protein was partially zzso from zzso of zzso female bugs and the first ten zzso acids were found to be identical to that of zzso zzso indicating that the 75 zzso protein is zzso The tissue distribution of zzso in the bug was examined by Western zzso zzso In zzso animals, zzso was detected in the fat body, zzso and zzso but not in the zzso In the zzso stage, zzso was also detected in eggs, in addition to the fat body and zzso These results indicate that zzso is incorporated into the zzso during zzso and suggest that it may provide iron for the developing zzso
