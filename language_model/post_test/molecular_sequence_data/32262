Clinical zzso of the gastric pathogen zzso zzso display a high level of genetic zzso and zzso featuring a zzso rather than zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to survive the stomach acid is due, in part, to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso to carbon dioxide and zzso which can neutralize zzso 

The degree of variation in zzso was explored at the DNA zzso zzso activity and protein expression zzso To this end, zzso activity was measured from 73 zzso clinical zzso and six zzso strains of zzso zzso The zzso gene from 21 of the strains was cloned into genetically stable zzso coli and the zzso activities zzso zzso activity was found to substantially vary zzso in both different zzso zzso strains and in the zzso coli zzso Western zzso analysis revealed a positive correlation between activity and amount of protein expressed in most zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso strains featured altered zzso activity upon in zzso zzso zzso alignments of the 21 zzso genes plus strain zzso revealed extensive zzso in the promoter region and 3' end of the zzso coding zzso zzso acid zzso which was zzso in the zzso clinical strain zzso was critical for zzso zzso 

These studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso exhibits extensive zzso and zzso variation which may be used to understand mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso
