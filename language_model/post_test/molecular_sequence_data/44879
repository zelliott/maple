zzso AIDS typically follows transmission of human zzso virus type 1 zzso from infected mothers to their zzso The possibility that infected zzso cells serve as a zzso for zzso zzso transmission was investigated in a rabbit infection zzso Administration of zzso human T cells to pregnant rabbits was followed by evaluation of zzso from newborn to zzso years of zzso zzso was detected in 11 of 19 zzso delivered offspring born to mothers given infected cells during zzso zzso zzso or zzso organ zzso similar to those seen in human pediatric zzso occurred in some zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso gene sequences in offspring indicated that vertical transmission can be zzso by T zzso zzso These results along with features of rabbit biology, including zzso zzso short zzso and delivery of zzso suggest that the rabbit model is advantageous for studies of zzso zzso zzso
