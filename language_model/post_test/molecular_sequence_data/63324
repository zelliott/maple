Many zzso zzso bacteria use a complex zzso machine, known as the type 3 zzso system zzso to transfer zzso proteins into host zzso The zzso is composed of a zzso bulb, a zzso body spanning the inner and outer bacterial zzso and an zzso zzso zzso is regulated by both zzso and inner membrane proteins that must respond to specific signals in order to ensure that zzso proteins are not zzso before contact with a zzso zzso This negative regulation is zzso in part, by a family of proteins that are thought to physically block the entrance to the zzso apparatus until an appropriate signal is received following host cell zzso Despite weak sequence zzso between proteins of this family, the crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso we present here confirm the conservation of domain zzso with the zzso from zzso zzso Interestingly, comparison of the zzso and zzso structures reveals a significant structural change that results in substantial domain zzso and opening of one face of the zzso The conservation of a zzso charged patch on this face suggests it may have a role in binding other components of the zzso
