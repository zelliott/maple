zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is emerging as an opportunistic zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which is zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been reported to have a sexual zzso We have employed genetic approaches to demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso and has a sexual cycle involving mating between zzso and zzso cells under zzso deprivation zzso By zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor that regulates zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA and protein sequences to other zzso zzso and transformation experiments with zzso markers from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provide evidence that the zzso zzso encodes zzso instead of zzso in zzso zzso as is also the case in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was disrupted by zzso transformation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were sterile but had no zzso in zzso zzso Our findings reveal both zzso and divergent roles for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in regulating differentiation of this emerging zzso zzso
