A full-length zzso clone representing the large zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library prepared from developing grain of zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso The zzso zzso insert contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that the zzso end is 10 zzso shorter than the zzso The deduced protein contains 522 zzso acids zzso zzso and includes a putative transit zzso of 62 zzso acids zzso zzso The similarity of the deduced protein to the small zzso of zzso and to other zzso genes from plants and zzso is zzso Northern zzso shows that the zzso genes zzso the small zzso in the wheat zzso and the zzso genes zzso the large zzso in the wheat zzso are zzso expressed in the wheat zzso zzso from both gene sets accumulate to high levels in the zzso during grain development with the majority of the expression in the zzso rather than the zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso activity is detected in developing grains prior to 10 d post zzso only the zzso genes are active at this time (the zzso genes are not expressed until 10 d post zzso The possibility that the zzso expressed during early grain development is a zzso of small zzso is zzso The zzso and zzso genes are arranged as zzso sets of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso genes are located on the long arms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso about 80 zzso from the zzso The zzso genes have been mapped to a position just zzso to the zzso on the long arms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
