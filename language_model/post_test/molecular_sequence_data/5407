zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Rich in zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with several zzso events during early zzso In this study, changes in the zzso distribution of zzso transcripts and the protein during chicken retinal development were documented by in zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso transcripts were first detected within the zzso neural zzso at embryonic day zzso 5 zzso followed short thereafter zzso by appearance of zzso zzso was enriched within the inner zzso layer zzso by E10 and within the outer zzso layer zzso by zzso several days after these layers became zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transcripts were first observed within the zzso cell layer zzso at zzso prior to zzso of zzso within the nerve fiber layer, seen first at zzso zzso protein was first detected within the developing retinal zzso zzso zzso at E10 and increased significantly at zzso cells ceased to zzso and continued zzso Of special note was the restriction of zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were similarly distributed in the adult zzso but at lower levels than in the period just prior to zzso In the adult zzso zzso was retained in the nerve fiber layer and present in the inner nuclear layer zzso and outer nuclear layer zzso but lost from the zzso and zzso These changes in expression pattern with time indicate that zzso is zzso regulated and therefore may have important zzso in both zzso development of the zzso and functioning of the mature zzso
