zzso have long been used as models to study the basic mechanisms of human zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso a New World monkey that can be zzso bred in captivity and infected with various human zzso The basic zzso parameters of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and markers for zzso subsets, have already been zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso specific for the detection and zzso of zzso monkey zzso are required to zzso the zzso and zzso changes that occur during experimental infection of these animals with zzso We therefore zzso zzso and characterized the zzso zzso various zzso monkey zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and gamma zzso We found zzso zzso between the zzso sequence of the zzso monkey zzso genes and published sequences of equivalent human and zzso zzso zzso The aligned sequences of zzso for zzso several New and Old World primates and human are zzso and a zzso analysis of published sequences of selected zzso in other species and those of zzso primates is zzso In addition, we adapted a previously described zzso reverse zzso competitive zzso chain reaction technique to measure the zzso expression of those zzso in zzso zzso The primer and competitor plasmids that allowed zzso are zzso We showed that the zzso is sensitive and zzso
