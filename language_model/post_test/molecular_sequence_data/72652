Previous studies have shown that the presentation of some bacterial zzso by major zzso complex zzso class II molecules is strongly influenced by class zzso zzso For example, presentation of the toxic shock syndrome zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells (which expresses zzso that is either empty or associated with zzso zzso zzso can be strongly enhanced by some, but not other, zzso zzso Here we investigate the contribution of zzso peptides in the presentation of zzso to T zzso The data show that overlapping peptides expressing the same core zzso zzso but with various N and C zzso can differ profoundly in their ability to promote zzso presentation to T zzso Analysis of altered and truncated peptides indicates that zzso at the zzso end of the zzso have a dramatic effect on zzso zzso This effect does not involve a zzso interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso but appears to depend on the length of the zzso zzso These data are consistent with zzso studies suggesting that zzso may interact with the zzso zzso of zzso class zzso zzso We also examined the capacity of naturally processed peptides to promote zzso binding using a zzso blocking zzso The data demonstrated that a naturally processed zzso is dominated by peptides that do not promote strong zzso binding to zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso binding to zzso class II molecules is controlled by the zzso zzso of the associated zzso and that many naturally processed zzso II complexes do not present zzso to T zzso Thus, the zzso dependence of zzso binding to class II molecules may significantly reduce the capacity of zzso to stimulate T zzso
