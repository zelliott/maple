zzso analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated three distinct groups of tumors with zzso zzso zzso which include zzso deletion of the zzso locus zzso and zzso in the remaining zzso zzso deletion of the zzso locus but no zzso zzso in the remaining zzso and zzso deletions not including the zzso locus but zzso in one of the zzso Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis demonstrated zzso loss of genes zzso to zzso markers zzso in group C zzso The loss of zzso of genes on zzso 17 without zzso zzso zzso zzso or deletion zzso zzso in the zzso gene implies the presence of a second tumor zzso gene in the zzso region of zzso the zzso functional zzso of which may play a role, either alone or in conjunction with zzso in the initiation and/or progression of zzso zzso
