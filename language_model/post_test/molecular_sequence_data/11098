A gene zzso a zzso viral structural protein has been identified and zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene has a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso 624 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso which appeared to be initiated from a zzso zzso motif of zzso late zzso was detected at 12 zzso reached a maximum at 48 h and declined at 72 h zzso zzso Part of the zzso was cloned in frame into a zzso expression zzso zzso and the fusion protein was used to generate zzso in zzso It was zzso with the aid of the zzso zzso that this viral protein was zzso at 24 h zzso in infected zzso The protein appeared as an 82 zzso band in zzso virus and as an 82 zzso band and a 72 zzso band in zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed that this zzso had high zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso protein had zzso similarities to the zzso protein of zzso but not to the zzso of zzso
