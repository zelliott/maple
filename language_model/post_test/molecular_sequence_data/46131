zzso zzso zzso zzso are small zzso able to penetrate biological zzso and deliver various types of cargo both in zzso and in zzso Because use of zzso originating from viral origins resulted in zzso effects, zzso originating from zzso origins are zzso Here, we report that a zzso acid zzso zzso derived from the zzso of human zzso controlled tumor protein zzso functions as a zzso This zzso was zzso through zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso and did not enter zzso and zzso zzso fused to zzso when injected into mice, was efficiently delivered to liver, zzso zzso heart, and lungs of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso expression in cells and also improved immune response to zzso administered zzso expressing the triple repeat of G zzso of respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso might overcome the limitations of zzso zzso and serve as an efficient vehicle for drug zzso
