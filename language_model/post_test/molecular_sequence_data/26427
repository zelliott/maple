The zzso spinal zzso region of zzso fish zzso in a zzso organ, the zzso Two peptides have been zzso to zzso from an extract of the zzso of a zzso fish, the zzso The primary structure of one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso indicates identity with zzso zzso By zzso with other zzso the zzso zzso is probably zzso A second zzso was present in the extract in a concentration that was approximately zzso with that of zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of this zzso indicated a total of approximately 65 zzso The zzso acid sequence of a zzso produced by zzso with zzso was established zzso zzso zzso zzso This sequence shows partial zzso to carp zzso zzso as deduced from the zzso sequence of a cloned zzso It is concluded that the second zzso probably represents the zzso zzso zzso of zzso I which, it has previously been suggested, may function as a zzso zzso zzso analogous to the zzso
