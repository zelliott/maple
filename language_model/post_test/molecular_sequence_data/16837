zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso to give a single protein band on zzso gels with a molecular mass of approximately 68 zzso However, active zzso exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 390 zzso by gel zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso of six identical zzso Based on zzso acid compositions of several zzso the zzso gene was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was cloned and expressed in active form in zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso with a zzso tag at the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso was studied at various zzso of zzso or zzso At a zzso concentration of zzso zzso an equilibrium mixture containing equal amounts of zzso and zzso zzso of each) was reached during an incubation of about 6 zzso whereas at 2 zzso zzso it took about 22 h to reach the same zzso However, when zzso was the zzso at either zzso or 2 zzso only about zzso of the zzso was converted to zzso in zzso 12 zzso indicating that zzso is the preferred zzso These zzso also produced up to zzso free zzso The zzso for zzso was approximately 10 zzso whereas for zzso it was approximately 90 zzso While zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso at 20 and zzso respectively, as compared to zzso The zzso has a pH optimum of about 7 and is inhibited in a competitive manner by zzso zzso zzso is converted to zzso even in the presence of a zzso or more excess of zzso zzso and zzso produces zzso in excess zzso zzso suggesting the possibility of separate binding sites for zzso and zzso The zzso mechanism may involve zzso of the incoming zzso and transfer of a zzso to an zzso zzso as zzso incubated with zzso and either zzso zzso or zzso results in formation of zzso zzso also zzso production of a zzso zzso from zzso and zzso suggesting that this zzso may be valuable in zzso synthetic zzso
