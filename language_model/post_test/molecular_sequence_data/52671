The production of some zzso by zzso acid bacteria is regulated by induction peptides zzso that are zzso by a dedicated zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso for zzso A production by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso gene zzso associated with the genetic locus for zzso B production in zzso zzso zzso zzso were fused to the signal zzso of the zzso zzso A from zzso zzso zzso to access the general zzso zzso The culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing either of these zzso were used to induce zzso production by zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso fusion product induced zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso fusion product did not induce zzso production by zzso zzso zzso This represents a relatively simple method of confirming the role of zzso zzso The transformation of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene under expression of the zzso promoter from zzso zzso resulted in zzso production of zzso by either the dedicated transport apparatus or the general zzso zzso
