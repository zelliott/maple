With the aim of finding genes involved in the floral transition of woody species four zzso box genes containing zzso from apple zzso zzso have been zzso Three genes were isolated from zzso tissue of apple, but were zzso of known genes that specify floral organ zzso zzso is an zzso B class zzso box zzso and was mainly expressed in petals and zzso as demonstrated by Northern zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso They differed slightly in expression patterns on Northern zzso with zzso zzso levels equally high in zzso and zzso but zzso preferably expressed in zzso zzso is likely to be the apple zzso of one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso closely resembled the zzso zzso zzso It has been shown with zzso that the three floral apple zzso box genes are expressed in zzso zzso of adult as well as juvenile trees, albeit at low zzso zzso is an zzso gene that is expressed at similar levels in leaves, zzso zzso and floral zzso and that may be involved in the transition from the juvenile to the adult zzso
