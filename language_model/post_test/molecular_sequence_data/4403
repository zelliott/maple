A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso in the course of a search for zzso genes in this zzso There is apparently only one copy of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and its sequence is most similar to that of other zzso zzso zzso grows in the soil as a zzso or zzso A brief pulse of blue light, or zzso zzso zzso zzso which is accompanied by altered patterns of abundance of specific zzso zzso development is also accompanied by changes in gene zzso The abundance of zzso zzso decreased strongly during zzso and was lowest in samples consisting o mature zzso and zzso When zzso zzso was grown in the presence of cell walls of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso level was much lower than in similar cultures grown on zzso The repression of zzso which is usually considered a zzso expressed zzso may be part of the switch to zzso or to the simulated zzso zzso The implications of these findings for the use of zzso promoters to zzso high zzso expression are zzso
