A sequence motif complementary to the nuclear zzso signal zzso has been localized in zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso were generated in two different ways: by zzso with a zzso zzso and by isolation of the zzso zzso from an immune serum against native zzso using a zzso zzso The sequence specificity of the isolated zzso was confirmed by a zzso performed on overlapping zzso deduced from the sequence of the zzso of the zzso zzso Compared to the zzso induced by the zzso zzso this zzso fraction showed a much higher affinity for native zzso The attachment site of the zzso portion of the zzso to the zzso was mapped by electron zzso in conjunction with image zzso The zzso was found to bind to the periphery of the two outer zzso of the zzso complex formed by the zzso
