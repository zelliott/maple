A novel family of zzso A zzso binding proteins was identified by using the biologically active, zzso zzso probe zzso zzso In addition to zzso proteins with molecular masses of 43 zzso and approximately zzso zzso were labeled in zzso extracts and bovine calf zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein zzso from calf zzso and subsequent Western analysis of zzso zzso material from zzso extracts identified the zzso component as zzso zzso zzso a fluorescent analogue of zzso was prepared and used to measure the binding zzso of zzso derivatives to zzso by means of a new zzso displacement zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind to bovine zzso at zzso relevant zzso with zzso zzso of 60 zzso 33 and zzso zzso 380 zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso of heat shock zzso 70 zzso zzso is structurally related to zzso the zzso zzso zzso was tested and found to be zzso by the zzso A zzso zzso The binding constant for zzso zzso to zzso was determined and is 53 zzso 48 zzso These results indicate that zzso and the zzso heat shock protein family contain a structurally related domain for binding of zzso zzso zzso
