The zzso protein of zzso coli was successfully used in zzso Achilles' zzso zzso zzso technique zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and leads to the generation of very rare restriction sites in large DNA zzso The first step of this procedure is zzso of DNA in the presence of zzso when the overlapping zzso sites are protected from zzso and in the second step the DNA is cut by the zzso restriction zzso The aim of the present study is to develop a very exact and zzso procedure to obtain only a few zzso cuts with the zzso DNA, depending on the variety of all zzso This technique zzso zzso zzso rare zzso employs the restriction zzso and only one auxiliary protein zzso The advantage of the zzso procedure is that no zzso is required (as opposed to the zzso zzso Using the zzso approach, the effects of various zzso zzso were evaluated on zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using DNA of zzso zzso or the entire zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso At low zzso zzso only a few cut sites were eliminated by zzso zzso but at high zzso zzso zzso were able to cut in only one or several specific zzso
