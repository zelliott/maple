zzso and zzso divergence and zzso relationships of zzso fish including two zzso and six species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso living in the Mediterranean Sea, were investigated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The mean zzso diversity was found to be zzso Average sequence divergence between species of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso between species of the zzso zzso For zzso zzso the lowest genetic divergence zzso was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the highest divergence zzso was detected between zzso zzso and zzso zzso High levels of zzso divergence were detected between species of two families, and the maximum value was found to be zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso methods zzso and zzso identified two major zzso In the NJ tree zzso zzso was the sister group to zzso zzso zzso zzso was more divergent from these zzso Another lineage contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso tree is similar to that of the NJ zzso The pattern and degree of zzso differentiation was not zzso with the genetic zzso The zzso distances of zzso data revealed very high zzso divergence between the two zzso The highest zzso divergence was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the lowest was detected between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present genetic and zzso data support the present zzso status of the zzso zzso
