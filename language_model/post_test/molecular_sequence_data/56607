We zzso zzso of the DNA region immediately downstream of the origin of replication in the zzso zzso zzso This region comprises two zzso open reading frames zzso zzso zzso putative zzso that are zzso to each other and with zzso zzso typical of the zzso zzso family of zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso end mapping analyses indicated that both zzso were transcribed in the late phase of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping showed the presence of a transcript starting 31 zzso zzso before the zzso start zzso of zzso and two temporally regulated transcripts starting 59 and 89 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso of zzso Two abundant zzso species of 225 and 415 zzso were also identified as overlapping zzso transcripts zzso complementary to the 3' end of zzso zzso with identical zzso ends but different 3' zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments in zzso coli showed that the zzso zzso zzso complex was capable of initiating zzso synthesis at the same sites as observed in zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso but was not able to transcribe zzso In zzso with this, sequences at zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso ends resemble zzso 70 consensus promoters in the case of zzso and zzso but not in the case of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is controlled by different types of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
