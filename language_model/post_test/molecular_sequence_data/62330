While the zzso sequence and gene content are available for an increasing number of organisms, zzso zzso remain poorly zzso The dual role of the zzso zzso confounds the identification of novel zzso zzso Here, we describe a comparative zzso approach that relies on the zzso prediction of genes with zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent comparison of predictions from different zzso wherein conservation in regions zzso the zzso zzso suggests zzso coding zzso Application of this method to human and zzso zzso identified a novel zzso family, named zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso form also occurred in other fish, chicken, sea urchin, green algae and zzso In contrast, zzso worms and land plants contained zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso incorporation into chicken zzso and characterized the zzso expression pattern in zzso zzso Our data indicate a scattered evolutionary distribution of zzso in zzso and suggest that, contrary to the picture emerging from data available so far, other zzso zzso probably zzso
