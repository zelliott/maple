In the interest of cloning and analyzing the genes responsible for two very different diseases, the zzso syndrome zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso we constructed a high-resolution restriction map of zzso zzso zzso covering zzso zzso of zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis, we assigned all tested zzso and zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso We have previously reported exact physical locations of these zzso zzso which all disrupt one gene we mapped to this zzso the zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso in the assembly of various zzso regulatory complexes and is thus necessary for zzso in a broad range of zzso zzso We report here the zzso physical zzso zzso and full zzso zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso
