Two zzso clones named zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso expression library using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients allergic to zzso zzso analysis showed open reading frames of 176 and 138 zzso zzso Both clones contain a putative signal zzso giving two mature processed proteins named Par zzso zzso of zzso D and Par zzso zzso of zzso zzso These proteins represent zzso forms of the major zzso zzso Par zzso zzso zzso zzso previously zzso The Par zzso zzso shared zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso while the Par zzso zzso shared zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso clones were expressed in zzso coli, and since the three zzso proteins shared a very high degree of sequence identity and comparable binding to the zzso zzso we decided to analyze in more detail the zzso properties of only one zzso the zzso Par zzso zzso The zzso activity determined by the zzso release zzso ranged between 9 and zzso depending on the allergic patient zzso while it blocked approximately zzso of all the zzso zzso zzso as detected after zzso and zzso zzso
