The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein composed of two types zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of a low affinity zzso of the alpha 2 zzso with the alpha 1 and beta zzso indicated that zzso assembled from alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso contain variable zzso ratios, whereas zzso zzso have an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of different zzso zzso zzso revealed that this difference in assembly behavior is zzso by the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between the alpha and beta zzso identified combinations of sequence motifs determining zzso zzso
