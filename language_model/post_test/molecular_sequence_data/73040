zzso zzso Q or zzso is a zzso zzso that functions in the electron transport chain in the plasma membrane of zzso and in the inner zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fall into eight zzso groups zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso group lack Q and as a result are zzso and fail to grow on zzso carbon zzso A nuclear zzso designated zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library based on its ability to restore growth of a representative zzso zzso on media containing zzso as the sole carbon zzso The DNA segment responsible for the zzso contained an open reading frame zzso zzso number zzso with zzso sequence identity over 262 zzso acids to zzso which is required for a zzso step in the Q and zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso coding sequences contain sequence motifs common to a wide variety of zzso zzso A gene fusion expressing a zzso form of zzso retains function, as zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso fusion protein is located in zzso The synthesis of two zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso These zzso have been used to develop in zzso zzso zzso with isolated zzso zzso These studies show that zzso is required for the zzso step that converts zzso zzso to zzso
