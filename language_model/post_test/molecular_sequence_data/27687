A zzso zzso zzso was isolated using zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The clone has a length of zzso zzso and codes for the complete zzso protein which was reported to be associated with the zzso region of the zzso zzso and ascribes protection against zzso during zzso An expression zzso prepared in the zzso zzso was used to obtain a fusion protein against which rabbit zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso react specifically with the zzso protein of 22 zzso zzso in zzso during zzso which is localized in the zzso zzso with the in zzso translated product using zzso zzso from heat-treated cells as well as with the hybrid release translation product of the zzso zzso The clone was zzso It contains a zzso region consisting of 85 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a zzso 3' region of 600 zzso Northern zzso indicates a length of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso Analysis of similarity between the derived zzso acid sequence of this protein and other zzso proteins demonstrates that this protein belongs to the zzso plant zzso protein family and also shows similarities with animal zzso proteins including the presence of a short region possessing similarity with bovine zzso as reported for other zzso zzso The molecular mass of the protein as determined from the sequence is zzso zzso Despite its zzso in the zzso zzso it does not seem to include a transit zzso zzso in agreement with previous zzso The sequence contains only a short zzso region compatible with its previously reported zzso as a zzso zzso zzso
