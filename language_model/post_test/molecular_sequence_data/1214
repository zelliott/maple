Several genes that contain the zzso zzso and zzso domain have been linked with human zzso We describe here a new zzso gene designated as zzso zzso A zzso zzso was isolated based on its zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso The gene encodes an open reading frame of 630 zzso acids and contains a zzso domain in the zzso region followed by 16 zinc finger zzso zzso hybrid analysis mapped zzso to human zzso zzso a region thought to harbor tumor zzso genes for breast, zzso liver, zzso zzso and other zzso The gene has a zzso island promoter and is silenced in human breast, zzso and liver zzso A zzso zzso expressing zzso caused zzso arrest and zzso upon infection of tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso may play a role in zzso
