A recent model for zzso zzso in zzso zzso proposes that zzso is zzso through zzso zzso pores into a host cell zzso Madden, zzso Ruiz, and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso This model also assumes that the zzso zzso and zzso O zzso genes that code for these products are organized in an zzso structure expressed from a single promoter only zzso We expand this model by showing that zzso possesses its own autonomous promoter, which is located 155 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso Under experimental conditions in which zzso zzso is grown in zzso zzso the strength of the zzso promoter, as measured by the activity of a zzso reporter zzso resulted in low but highly zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso gene that closely resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts a negative effect on the expression of the zzso zzso
