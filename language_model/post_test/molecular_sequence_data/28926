zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso an zzso domain zzso mediates bone zzso protein 6 zzso induction of bone zzso formation in fetal rat zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated the complementary DNA zzso for the human zzso of zzso from an adult human heart zzso library and showed that when zzso it is zzso in the same culture zzso The recently revised zzso sequence of zzso the protein product of which binds to the insulin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso now matches the zzso sequence of human zzso zzso A zzso 223 zzso acid zzso zzso protein has identical effects as the full-length zzso despite the deletion of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of human zzso have been zzso Human zzso has a zzso pair zzso deletion between zzso 325 and zzso and a zzso zzso at zzso zzso The resulting derived protein contains 423 AA with the zzso zzso intact and does not induce bone formation when zzso in zzso zzso Human zzso has the same 17 zzso zzso at zzso zzso resulting in a shift in the reading frame that causes a stop zzso to occur at zzso zzso The resulting 153 AA protein does not have the zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso bone formation in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso are not required for zzso to induce bone zzso In addition, a small region zzso zzso of the zzso protein may be required for bone zzso
