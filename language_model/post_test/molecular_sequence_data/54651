Four species of zzso zzso zzso occur in the Caribbean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study analyses the zzso of these species to assess possible colonization events from Central America to the islands and subsequent population expansions during glacial periods driven by both zzso climate and larger emerged land zzso 

zzso size data were obtained for zzso zzso for 314 individuals from 24 zzso covering the distribution range of zzso zzso in the Caribbean zzso 

In total, 113 zzso zzso were zzso The highest genetic diversity was found in populations of zzso zzso Overall, Caribbean zzso populations fit the isolation by distance zzso zzso zzso structure was found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso network and a zzso analysis of population structure zzso indicated different Central American origins for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with Central America populations in northern and zzso zzso zzso expansion times for zzso clusters were close to three glacial zzso 

Central America contains ancestral zzso zzso zzso expansion has played a major role in the distribution of genetic diversity in zzso zzso zzso zzso Two colonization events gave rise to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variation in the eastern species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso evolved independently from that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lineage sorting between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso expansion times for zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the eastern lineages zzso to glacial zzso whereas those for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the beginning of the temperature decrease that led to Marine zzso Stage zzso
