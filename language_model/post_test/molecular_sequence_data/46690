We have solved the high-resolution X-ray structure of zzso bound to two different zzso zzso representing alternative zzso zzso These structures reveal an zzso zzso network of zzso interactions within all zzso zzso explain both binding zzso and identify a novel zzso zzso loop structure in one of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling alters the zzso zzso selecting a different zzso motif and different zzso than the zzso zzso Many zzso zzso contacts involve a zzso zzso alpha zzso containing a putative nuclear export zzso implicating this segment in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso structure and those within I zzso B alpha and zzso reveals a zzso zzso recognized by the zzso nuclear export zzso
