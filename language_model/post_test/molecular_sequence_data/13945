Shortly after infection of two zzso monkeys zzso zzso either with a zzso challenge stock or with the same virus that had been zzso in another zzso monkey for 11 months, zzso genes were cloned from their peripheral blood zzso cells and subsequently expressed by zzso zzso zzso The molecular weights and zzso of the thus produced envelope zzso were largely identical to those of the native zzso The envelope zzso derived from the in zzso zzso virus proved to be poorly recognized by virus zzso zzso zzso directed against one of the seven zzso sites for which zzso zzso were zzso zzso studies in rats showed that this protein was also less efficient in inducing zzso against this zzso site, and that it induced significantly lower levels of virus zzso zzso than the other zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso incorporated into immune stimulating complexes zzso was compared to that of the same protein presented with zzso A or zzso
