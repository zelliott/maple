The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a representative zzso zzso that is responsible for the conversion of zzso to oxygen and hydrogen zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned from many species and employed as useful zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analyzed its zzso properties, and investigated zzso expression patterns after exposure to known zzso zzso The full-length zzso of the zzso magna zzso sequence consisted of 703 zzso zzso zzso 178 zzso zzso showing zzso zzso that were required for metal binding and several common zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed that it shared high identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated that zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso The variation of zzso zzso expression was zzso by real-time zzso and the results indicated that the expression was zzso after zzso exposure to copper, zzso zzso and low dissolved zzso This study shows that the zzso zzso could be successfully employed as a zzso of zzso stress, which is a common mode of toxicity for many other aquatic hazardous zzso
