zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is a key negative regulator of the tumor zzso zzso Here, we report the determination of the solution structure of the C4 zinc finger domain of zzso using zzso zzso The zzso C4 zinc finger domain has a fold consisting of a zzso zzso followed by four zzso which shares significant structural similarity to the zinc ribbon protein zzso Family based sequence analysis identified two putative binding sites, one of which resembles an zzso binding zzso
