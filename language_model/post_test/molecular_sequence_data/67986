zzso extension analyses and a zzso cloning strategy were used to identify and characterize zzso zzso sequences on the zzso stripe virus zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso the major zzso protein zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis by primer extension showed that the zzso zzso transcripts had zzso zzso beyond the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso particles zzso lacked the additional zzso zzso zzso clones representing the zzso region of the zzso transcripts were constructed, and the zzso sequences of the zzso regions were determined for 16 zzso Each was found to have a distinct zzso zzso sequence immediately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Eleven of 16 clones had the correct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while five showed minor variations at or near the zzso most zzso zzso zzso These characteristics show strong similarities to other viral zzso transcripts which are zzso by cap zzso
