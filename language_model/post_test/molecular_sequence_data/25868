DNA sequence analysis, zzso and zzso zzso deletion analysis, expression under zzso zzso gene 10 promoter control, zzso zzso and zzso tests were used to study the function of DNA located in the zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The characterized region of the zzso includes five genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding for apparently integral inner membrane proteins which are required for zzso zzso The results presented here and previously show that the zzso zzso contains at least 11 zzso zzso zzso
