A zzso clone producing a protein that binds zzso has been isolated from a mouse zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and identified as coding for zzso By deleting part of the zzso the zzso binding domain was zzso The site is situated on repeat 11 of zzso probably on its extra zzso This part of the sequence exhibits great similarity to other zzso binding zzso Analysis of the sequence and spatial structure of zzso revealed a domain which is quite complementary to the sequence identified on zzso These results provide a new insight into the structure of zzso and consequently into the structure of proteins of the zzso zzso A model for the general folding of these molecules is proposed, involving a simple zzso zzso The structure was further zzso by analysis of charge distribution in the vicinity of the zzso binding zzso The folding we propose is in good agreement with zzso experiments and explains observations in diseases resulting from zzso of human zzso
