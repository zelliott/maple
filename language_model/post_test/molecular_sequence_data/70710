zzso zzso zzso is a newly developed drug as a zzso factor zzso zzso The disposition of zzso was investigated in plasma from 28 healthy Japanese volunteers after a single zzso administration of zzso Three of 28 subjects were zzso as poor zzso zzso zzso zzso from three extensive zzso or three zzso of zzso were analyzed by Southern zzso analysis with zzso zzso as a zzso zzso from three zzso zzso with zzso and zzso showed novel restriction zzso length zzso zzso one type without zzso and zzso fragments and a weak density of a zzso zzso zzso and the other type without zzso and zzso restriction fragments zzso as compared with three extensive zzso zzso The zzso restriction fragments specific to three zzso in zzso and zzso were identified as zzso Using zzso chain zzso analyses of the gene from the three zzso we found that the zzso 1, zzso 8, and zzso 9 in zzso were zzso A new zzso characterized by zzso and zzso was found to be due to the entire gene deletion of the three zzso and was associated with the decreased metabolism of zzso This study demonstrates a new zzso zzso in the human zzso gene responsible for the poor zzso zzso of zzso
