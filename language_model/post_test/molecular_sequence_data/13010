An analysis of two essential genes of infectious zzso virus zzso zzso D zzso and the immediate early zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso was performed with the equivalent gene zzso from several zzso zzso acid zzso sequence analysis revealed that these zzso genes shared limited zzso to other zzso zzso and were distinct from the two other avian zzso zzso disease virus zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso group viruses are clearly separate from the avian zzso The zzso acid sequences of these zzso genes will be presented with comparisons to the zzso from other zzso zzso contributing further evidence of the evolution of this group of viruses from a common zzso and that zzso could be an ancient example of the zzso
