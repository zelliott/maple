According to their cellular zzso use, zzso virus zzso strains can be separated into two zzso zzso and zzso A long zzso zzso zzso was generated from the zzso zzso encompassing the four short consensus repeat zzso zzso of zzso linked via a flexible zzso hinge to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso tail of zzso This zzso zzso was zzso for zzso binding but deficient in zzso zzso zzso fusion and virus zzso possibly due to the extended distance between the zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso and the cell zzso When zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso this zzso zzso exerted a dominant negative effect and inhibited both zzso fusion and entry of zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso A soluble zzso zzso exhibited similar zzso and zzso fusion zzso properties only against zzso zzso This suggests that the long zzso zzso acts by zzso incoming zzso prior to its binding to the shorter functional zzso or zzso zzso
