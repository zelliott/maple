Conventional methods of detecting zzso chain reaction zzso products require equipment and expertise which may not be available in diagnostic zzso laboratories, especially in developing zzso To this end we have examined other methods of product zzso including zzso incorporation during zzso amplification, and reverse zzso where the zzso product is used as the probe in a scaled down zzso with a fixed capture probe consisting of a zzso entirely internal to the sequence of the zzso zzso These techniques have shown sensitivities of 20 zzso of zzso zzso DNA, which zzso to approximately five zzso
