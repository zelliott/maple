zzso metabolism in zzso zzso occurs within a zzso a zzso zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso shell is constructed from thousands of zzso protein complexes made from seven different types of protein zzso Here, the structure of the bacterial zzso protein zzso which has a tandem structural repeat within the zzso and forms zzso with zzso zzso is zzso This zzso assembly forms a flat approximately zzso shaped disc with a central pore that is suitable for a zzso zzso The essentially cubic shaped zzso cluster zzso to the zzso symmetry zzso zzso with one free iron, the role of which could be to supply electrons to an associated zzso zzso zzso
