zzso zzso zzso is a peripheral membrane protein in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Previously, we have mapped its primary zzso zzso motif within a zzso acid segment at its zzso Here, we have characterized this zzso mechanism in more detail, and our results indicate that this segment zzso zzso residency in a zzso manner, and without any apparent recycling of the zzso between the zzso apparatus and the zzso In addition, we show that a rather long zzso region, rather than a specific zzso sequence per se, is required for efficient retention of a reporter protein in the zzso zzso the minimal retention motif was found to require the last 32 zzso zzso zzso and sequential substitution of all five charged zzso within this critical segment zzso only marginally with the retention or association of the zzso with the zzso zzso Moreover, our zzso and zzso analyses suggested that this critical zzso segment forms an extended loop within zzso zzso domain, and that this loop is exposed and readily accessible for zzso zzso our results define a novel zzso retention mechanism in the zzso
