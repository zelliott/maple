zzso zzso is a member of zzso gene zzso which is highly expressed on the surface of zzso cells and at moderate levels on zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso like zzso cells, express multiple zzso of zzso However, the identity and zzso role of these zzso during zzso remains largely zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso expression is dramatically up regulated upon zzso zzso zzso zzso or transforming growth factor zzso differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The level of zzso expression did not significantly change during zzso of zzso T cells by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analysis, we show that the expression of zzso zzso changes in a zzso and lineage specific manner during cellular differentiation and zzso We identified a number of novel zzso zzso previously not detected in the zzso These results demonstrate that regulated expression of zzso and its zzso zzso occurs during differentiation and/or zzso of zzso zzso Thus, different zzso zzso may play important roles in generation of zzso cells and their potential interactions with vascular zzso
