zzso of a new species of rapidly growing, zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from human zzso The growth zzso acid zzso and zzso acids of the zzso were consistent with those of zzso zzso The zzso were identified as members of a new species by performing a zzso analysis and zzso zzso experiments, and by comparing the sequences of several zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis in which zzso zzso and zzso sequences were used identified zzso zzso as a novel distinct species and placed zzso zzso between members of the zzso zzso complex and the zzso rapidly growing zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso value of zzso sequence analysis in the zzso zzso is similar to the well-established value of zzso zzso sequence zzso
