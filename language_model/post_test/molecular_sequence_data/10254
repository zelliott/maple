zzso studies in chickens and zzso interference experiments have indicated that avian zzso virus zzso may zzso a cellular zzso related to the zzso for zzso and zzso Recently, we cloned zzso a tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso that serves as a cellular zzso for zzso and zzso To determine whether the cellular zzso for zzso is a zzso zzso a zzso library was made from turkey zzso zzso zzso which are susceptible to zzso infection, but not to infection by zzso and zzso The zzso library was screened with a zzso labeled zzso zzso probe, and clones that zzso with the probe were zzso A zzso zzso clone was identified that zzso zzso to zzso infection, but not to zzso infection, when expressed in zzso human zzso zzso The functional zzso clone is predicted to zzso a 368 zzso acid protein with significant zzso acid similarity to zzso Like zzso the zzso protein is predicted to have two zzso zzso zzso zzso and a putative death domain similar to those of zzso I and zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments demonstrated specific binding between the zzso zzso protein and an zzso composed of the surface zzso envelope protein of zzso E zzso virus fused to the constant region of a rabbit zzso These two activities of the zzso zzso zzso specific binding to zzso zzso and permitting entry only of zzso have zzso identified this protein as a cellular zzso specific for zzso E zzso
