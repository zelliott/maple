Here we describe the results of experimental infections of captive big brown bats zzso zzso with three newly isolated bat zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was moderate zzso zzso There was no evidence of transmission to zzso cage zzso zzso periods for zzso virus infection were significantly shorter zzso zzso zzso than for either zzso or zzso virus zzso In turn, zzso of viral zzso by zzso zzso suggests that the dynamics of zzso virus infection may differ from those of zzso virus zzso Although infectious virus and viral zzso were detected in the brain of every rabid animal, dissemination to zzso zzso was zzso zzso of viral zzso in brain of zzso zzso bats was significantly correlated with the number of other zzso positive by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no such relationship was observed for zzso virus infection (where viral zzso was consistently detected in all zzso other than zzso zzso virus was isolated sporadically from zzso zzso and both infectious virus and viral zzso were obtained from oral zzso The detection of viral zzso in oral zzso suggests that viral shedding in saliva occurred zzso days before the onset of clinical zzso
