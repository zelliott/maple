The differentiation of the zzso from its zzso zzso culminates in the production of the zzso proteins and the zzso of membrane processes that zzso the zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso and its alternatively spliced zzso zzso the major protein constituents of central nervous system zzso are characterized by a significant reduction in the number of mature zzso resulting in severe zzso zzso and early zzso The canine shaking pup carries such a zzso a single base change that zzso a zzso for a zzso near the first zzso region of zzso and zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso as evidence by a zzso pattern at the zzso locus characteristic of immature zzso The spliced transcript expressed earliest in development, zzso continues to be zzso in shaking pup zzso The disruption of the normal maturation schedule in these zzso zzso disorders suggests that zzso or zzso plays a fundamental role in zzso zzso We propose that, while the more abundant zzso is the primary structural component of zzso zzso may be critical to zzso zzso
