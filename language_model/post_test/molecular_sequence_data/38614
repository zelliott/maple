zzso storage of zzso zzso is a prerequisite for maintaining constant levels of zzso hormones in zzso Storage of zzso within the zzso zzso is achieved by zzso and by the formation of zzso zzso between zzso zzso In bovine zzso approximately zzso of the zzso are other than zzso bonds zzso Cell zzso 180, zzso We have now shown that zzso zzso contains a large number of zzso zzso and that only traces of these can be found in the soluble form of zzso Because such zzso bridges are generated usually by the action of a zzso it is reasonable to propose that the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso is under the control of this zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso for zzso in zzso moreover, the presence of zzso was demonstrated by zzso and by zzso in freshly isolated bovine zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso but not in compartments of the zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso for zzso was found by Northern zzso zzso of the cloned gene failed to reveal a zzso zzso which supports the notion that the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso Apparently, the zzso reaches the zzso of the zzso by an as yet unknown zzso to catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
