The two zzso of the human zzso type 4 zzso are rarely sought in testing for acute respiratory illness zzso and this may be zzso our understanding of its zzso This study presents a novel duplex real-time zzso zzso targeting the P gene that can detect and differentiate the two zzso in a single zzso zzso synthetic zzso positive controls were prepared and used to determine an zzso sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction with an zzso dynamic zzso The zzso were validated using zzso clinical specimens mostly zzso zzso collected from children during zzso These included specimens previously determined to be positive for all commonly considered respiratory zzso The novel zzso did not zzso with any other zzso Fourteen zzso zzso ten detected in the absence of any zzso (four with zzso were identified in 2008 and their zzso confirmed by conventional zzso and sequencing of P gene zzso Most zzso were in children two years of age or zzso Our zzso proved suitably sensitive and specific for inclusion in future studies seeking to better understand the role zzso and other respiratory viruses in children with zzso
