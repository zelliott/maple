zzso transfers a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso thus forming zzso zzso and zzso This reaction defines the ultimate step in the Kennedy zzso for the genesis of de zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso location of zzso identifies both the site from which de zzso zzso zzso is transported to other zzso and the site from which it is assembled with proteins and other lipids for zzso from the cell during the generation of lung zzso zzso and zzso Most zzso zzso studies observed the majority of zzso activity in the zzso zzso although the method of zzso zzso was found to zzso affect these results with activity alternately dispersed within zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results with zzso or electron zzso studies would resolve the issue of the site of zzso zzso However, zzso have yet to be generated to zzso since its integral zzso nature has prevented its zzso from any source and a zzso zzso zzso has also yet to be zzso However, zzso genes have recently been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso has allowed for an in depth molecular examination resulting in the identification of the zzso zzso In addition, this analysis has generated the predicted zzso acid data necessary to produce zzso to pursue the site of zzso synthesis in this zzso as well as to provide information that should allow for the isolation of zzso zzso zzso
