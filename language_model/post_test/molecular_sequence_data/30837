zzso with zzso zzso was used previously to identify a regulatory locus necessary for expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso and zzso Silverman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso insertions in this regulatory locus were used to construct a zzso probe which was used in this study to detect zzso in a zzso library containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this DNA zzso expression of the genes zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso which were positioned in trans on a compatible zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and analysis of the DNA sequence of the cloned DNA indicated that regulatory function resided in a single gene of about zzso named zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and in the fish zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled by zzso mechanisms involving the zzso of small signal molecules called zzso but similarity of the two zzso systems at the molecular level was not apparent in this zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso product of zzso zzso which indicates a structural relationship to some zzso zzso is not similar to the sequence of the protein that regulates expression of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli, already achieved with zzso genes cloned from zzso zzso was not accomplished with the isolation of zzso from zzso zzso suggesting a requirement for an additional regulatory zzso
