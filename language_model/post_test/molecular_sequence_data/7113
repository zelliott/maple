Purple sulfur bacteria store sulfur as zzso zzso enclosed by a protein zzso The proteins associated with sulfur zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated by extraction into 50% zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acid and 10 zzso zzso The extracted proteins were separated by zzso zzso revealing three major proteins from zzso zzso and two from zzso zzso All of these proteins have similar, rather unusual zzso acid compositions, being rich in zzso and aromatic zzso zzso particularly zzso The molecular masses of the zzso zzso proteins were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso while those from zzso zzso were found to be zzso and zzso Da by laser zzso zzso mass zzso The larger zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso probably by zzso but small amounts of the zzso form zzso zzso zzso were also isolated by zzso zzso sequencing showed that the two larger zzso zzso proteins are zzso to each other and to the large zzso zzso zzso The zzso Da zzso zzso and zzso Da zzso zzso proteins are also zzso indicating that sulfur zzso proteins are zzso between different species of purple sulfur zzso
