The binding of the zzso drug zzso has been studied with nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso This study involves two parts, the zzso of the zzso binding site of the drug to DNA and a detailed investigation of the zzso interactions of zzso with a DNA zzso through analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was prepared, and an zzso zzso was released upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso shows that the drug binds to zzso of zzso by reaction of its zzso zzso The reaction zzso and product formed were determined by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso An zzso duplex, zzso was zzso and used in the interaction study of zzso and the zzso The duplex and the zzso complex were both analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative intensity of the zzso observed between the drug zzso and the zzso duplex shows zzso that the drug is located in the minor groove, zzso attached to zzso of zzso 6 and positioned from the zzso end in relation to strand A zzso A mechanism for drug binding and stabilization can be zzso from the zzso data and zzso zzso
