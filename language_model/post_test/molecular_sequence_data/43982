zzso zzso was identified in the zzso fish zzso as a new member of the zzso gene zzso zzso binds specifically the zzso zzso In this study zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso zzso cell line, and in insect cells via a zzso zzso It was zzso to zzso and characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso from both expression systems was zzso processed at one of two zzso zzso motifs and was found to be zzso It supported the survival of embryonic chick sensory zzso zzso survival was observed at 100 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso embryonic zzso root zzso zzso of zzso into the medium did not zzso the activity of zzso in survival zzso However, when a sensory zzso zzso was cultured in a collagen gel zzso zzso adjacent to a zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso outgrowth directed towards the zzso was zzso This indicated that zzso was slowly released from the zzso zzso generating a concentration zzso of zzso instrumental for zzso guidance in zzso Thus the interaction of zzso with zzso might not be required for the zzso of the cellular zzso for zzso on responsive cells but rather may serve to control, in zzso the distribution of zzso
