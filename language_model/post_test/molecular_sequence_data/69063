zzso zzso zzso zzso grown under red light zzso showed a normal zzso with green, fully expanded zzso When the zzso grown under red light were zzso with zzso white light, zzso synthesis was induced in the zzso zzso especially when a zzso light supplement was zzso The zzso of zzso was closely associated with the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso These genes include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso which had been enriched for the accumulated zzso one white zzso zzso was identified as being a zzso gene by comparison with database zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso this zzso had with other zzso was zzso This was with zzso from zzso zzso zzso Thus it represents a new zzso family, which has been named zzso The zzso of this gene was localized in the zzso zzso of eggplant zzso which had been white zzso The transcript was accumulated by changing the light source, as in the case of other zzso zzso zzso In zzso producing zzso plants, the zzso corresponding to the eggplant zzso and zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso were most abundant during the mid stage of flower bud development, but could not be detected in leaf zzso These results suggest that this zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso
