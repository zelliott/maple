zzso is a paired domain zzso factor that plays a critical role in zzso All zzso of zzso identified to date have been associated with zzso form of tooth zzso The present report describes an unusual novel zzso in zzso identified in a family with severe zzso zzso This zzso deletion combined with 24 zzso zzso (including a zzso zzso zzso is localized in the second zzso beyond the highly zzso paired box zzso and might result either in a premature termination of translation at zzso 210 or in an zzso zzso leading to a zzso and premature termination of translation at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed no zzso transcript in cultured zzso of one of the affected individuals indicating that the novel zzso might result in rapid degradation of the zzso transcript leading to zzso of zzso Our results support the view that zzso in zzso constitute a zzso factor in zzso zzso
