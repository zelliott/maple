zzso formation in the core region of the zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be important for zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso structural interactions that are also important for zzso activity, as previously observed for the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso In addition, the contributions of backbone zzso zzso groups in the zzso to zzso zzso were investigated zzso using zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the stem 2 zzso and it was proposed that one or more zzso groups from the stem 2 sequences at or near the triple zzso participate in zzso zzso Based on these studies and investigations of the structural and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso region, we have examined the structural and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso native gel zzso and circular zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso geometry zzso in the backbone sugar zzso zzso show a correlation between zzso stability and zzso activity, and are consistent with the identification of the zzso zzso zzso as a potential contributor to zzso zzso
