As a zzso zzso has a segmented DNA zzso on zzso of host zzso It contains several genes in each segment that presumably play critical roles in regulating zzso processes of target insect zzso by the zzso A zzso protein 1 zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but its expression and zzso function in zzso zzso zzso by the viral host zzso zzso is not zzso This zzso zzso 189 zzso acids with a putative signal zzso (20 zzso was persistently expressed in zzso zzso zzso with gradual decrease at the late zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in the fat zzso and zzso but not in the zzso Its zzso function was analyzed by inducing transient expression of a zzso segment containing zzso and its promoter, which caused significant reduction in zzso zzso and delayed zzso zzso When the treated larvae were zzso with zzso zzso of zzso the expression of zzso zzso other genes zzso in the zzso segment was zzso These zzso larvae significantly recovered the zzso capacity and zzso development zzso This study reports that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso by zzso and its zzso function is to alter the host immune and zzso zzso
