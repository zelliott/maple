A new approach to evaluate protein structure zzso zzso zzso has been zzso This approach uses four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and local structure zzso The zzso packing function takes into account not only zzso distance but also zzso contact and zzso zzso defining the functions were statistically derived from 101 proteins with known zzso zzso The functions are combined to give a score zzso the zzso zzso The ability to identify the native structure of a protein among a large number of incorrect structures was zzso For 69 out of the 70 proteins zzso the native structures were successfully zzso zzso the zzso packing function showed clear improvement over our previous zzso The only unsuccessful case was observed for zzso zzso containing four zzso such prosthetic groups were ignored in the zzso In addition to the above functions, two procedures for removing zzso regions and zzso zzso interactions were also zzso A sequence for which zzso regions were predicted was considered incompatible with a structure irrespective of the zzso zzso A method to calculate the zzso interaction energy was developed and used for the detection of zzso zzso interactions between zzso of a sequence threaded onto a zzso These procedures greatly help to remove false zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
