In the zzso region of the bovine pancreatic zzso gene a sequence has been identified which specifically binds one or more factors present in nuclear protein extracts prepared from bovine zzso The binding site, as delineated by zzso analysis, is located in a region extending from positions zzso to zzso relative to the zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso This region contains consensus sequences for known control zzso zzso The observed pattern of zzso interactions is likely to be zzso as it could not be detected with nuclear extracts prepared from zzso or bovine zzso zzso zzso
