We have developed a rapid and sensitive method to screen the zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso for translation terminating zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso applied to white blood cell zzso This technique was termed the protein zzso test zzso Here we demonstrate the detection of a point zzso in a zzso patient and his mother, a zzso The zzso can also be used for carrier detection when no patient material is available, or in the case of spontaneous zzso We developed a protocol to screen the total coding region of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso could be of diagnostic value in any disease where premature zzso form a substantial part of the total zzso zzso
