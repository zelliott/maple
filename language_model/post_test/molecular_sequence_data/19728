zzso and zzso zzso receptors have been identified and characterized in both zzso and intact rat zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiment performed with zzso selective zzso zzso revealed a single binding site with a K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in intact cell revealed a K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso binding experiments revealed a single binding site population of receptors with K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in intact cells, and K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in plasma zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors were detected by zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso by real time zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were also detected by zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, selective zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso and zzso zzso this zzso activity in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso cells zzso express zzso and zzso receptors functionally coupled to zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and suggest these cells as a model to study the role of zzso receptors in zzso zzso
