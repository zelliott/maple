Members of the zzso gene family are proposed to function in both normal development and differentiation as well as in zzso zzso To understand the function of zzso proteins in these two zzso we present here a zzso characterization of seven zzso family zzso For these studies, zzso cells, a neuroendocrine cell line previously shown to efficiently process and zzso zzso was zzso with expression zzso zzso zzso family zzso All of the newly characterized zzso proteins are zzso zzso proteins that are tightly associated with the cell surface or zzso zzso We have also identified native zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and they exhibit the same zzso characteristics as the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso family members function in cell to cell signaling in a fashion similar to zzso
