We used zzso difference analysis to identify zzso zzso deletions selected during tumor progression in the mouse zzso and zzso tumor zzso We describe a deletion targeting zzso a member of the zzso gene family zzso regulators of small zzso zzso specifically activates zzso zzso enhancing the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in a subset of human cancer cell zzso a zzso zzso zzso identified in human prostate and zzso zzso encodes a protein that is defective in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso gene zzso is rescued by zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells with a deletion of the zzso gene suppresses growth in soft zzso and tumor invasion in zzso zzso therefore encodes a zzso family member that regulates zzso junctions and is disrupted during zzso
