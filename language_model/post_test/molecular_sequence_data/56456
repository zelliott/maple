zzso zzso zzso one of the most extensively studied human zzso zzso represents a potential target for passive as well as active zzso We describe here the first zzso zzso expressing the human zzso zzso Eight zzso clones were isolated which expressed products of varying molecular zzso one zzso termed zzso was shown to contain multiple zzso zzso by zzso to a panel of zzso zzso zzso When zzso protein isolated from this clone was zzso zzso species ranging from zzso 50,000 to zzso zzso were zzso zzso of Southern zzso analysis carried out on zzso DNA were consistent with the hypothesis that these products result from the stable expression of zzso which have zzso within the repeated zzso of zzso Other zzso zzso expressing products zzso different portions of the zzso gene were also zzso One, termed zzso was shown to be a zzso between the first 87 bases of zzso I and III of the zzso zzso A zzso termed zzso contained only the zzso domain of the zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso expressing the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso As shown here, commercially available preparations of zzso which are derived from tumor zzso or cell line zzso may contain zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Thus, the zzso zzso molecules described should have numerous uses including validation of the use of zzso zzso as standards in zzso serum zzso the characterization of immune responses to zzso the use as zzso and the study of structure function zzso
