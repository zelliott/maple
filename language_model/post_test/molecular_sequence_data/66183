We studied the profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone receptors zzso in Pacific zzso tuna zzso zzso during embryonic and zzso zzso Both zzso and T4 were detected in zzso just before zzso and it was found that the levels of both were increased in zzso zzso The zzso zzso were increased in both size and number in zzso fish compared with zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone was generated by zzso Two zzso zzso clones were also partially identified and analyzed by real-time zzso in this zzso The zzso zzso levels in zzso were determined, and these were found to be lower than those in zzso zzso zzso we considered that zzso hormones function during early zzso development as well as during embryonic zzso Moreover, there was a peak in the zzso zzso level during zzso zzso as seen during metamorphosis in Japanese zzso and Japanese zzso zzso It is possible that zzso hormones control the early development of zzso fish through zzso as they do for zzso and zzso
