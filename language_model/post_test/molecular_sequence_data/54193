The zzso storage of raw milk throughout the dairy chain prior to heat treatment creates selective conditions for growth of zzso zzso These bacteria, mainly belonging to the zzso zzso are capable of producing zzso zzso zzso and zzso which can cause zzso and structural defects in pasteurized and zzso milk zzso To map the influence of zzso storage on the growth of these zzso milk samples were taken after the first milking turn and incubated laboratory scale at temperatures simulating optimal and zzso zzso storage zzso The outgrowth of zzso members was monitored over time by means of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso were identified by a zzso zzso These zzso revealed that outgrowth of zzso members occurred from the beginning of the dairy chain zzso zzso under both optimal and zzso storage zzso An even greater risk for zzso as indicated by a vast increase of about 2 log zzso per zzso raw milk, existed downstream in the chain, especially when raw milk was stored under zzso zzso This difference in zzso outgrowth between optimal and zzso storage was already statistically significant within the farm zzso The zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Those zzso show an important zzso potential as determined on zzso media for zzso and zzso
