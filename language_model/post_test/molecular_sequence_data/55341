zzso zzso represent an important component of the human gut zzso with different beneficial or harmful zzso some species are zzso or zzso whereas others are opportunistic or zzso The diversity of zzso inhabiting humans remains relatively unexplored because of either the low abundance of these organisms in human gut or because they have received limited attention from a zzso zzso 

In this study, a single zzso sample from a healthy African male was studied using both zzso methods and extended molecular methods targeting the zzso zzso and ITS zzso Our results revealed that very few zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be isolated using zzso zzso In contrast, a relatively a high number of zzso species could be identified in this zzso sample when zzso methods based on various primer sets were zzso A total of 27 species from one sample were found among the zzso analyzed zzso The clone libraries were dominated by zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to 16 different zzso In addition, zzso sequences out of zzso zzso corresponded to 9 different species of plants; 59 sequences zzso belonged to other zzso in the gut, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and only 15 zzso zzso were related to human zzso zzso zzso 

Our results revealed a complex zzso community in the zzso gut, with zzso being the most abundant species in the stool zzso zzso investigations are needed to assess the zzso of these results and to understand their roles in human health and zzso
