zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays high zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in the zzso binding site reveals that the side chain of zzso zzso into the zzso binding site and possibly interacts with zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso resulted in an zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in zzso activity zzso zzso per zzso and an incremental Gibbs free energy zzso of zzso zzso lower than that of the zzso zzso Two other zzso acid zzso that possibly interact with zzso are zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso generated a zzso double zzso that has low zzso activity zzso zzso per zzso and an incremental Gibbs free energy of zzso zzso greater than the zzso single zzso The zzso zzso with an additional zzso zzso lost zzso of the zzso activity zzso zzso per zzso The zzso values of the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso are nearly zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a low zzso activity zzso zzso per zzso The zzso of this reaction can be increased zzso zzso by substituting zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso double zzso is nearly identical with that of the zzso zzso Another double zzso zzso has a zzso that is zzso lower and a zzso that is zzso higher than that of the zzso zzso These results, taken together, illustrate the interactions of zzso and zzso on zzso with zzso
