zzso chain reaction has been applied to the amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including zzso zzso and viral zzso However, zzso chain reaction amplification from zzso templates produced by reverse zzso has generally been restricted to products of less than 10 zzso In this paper, we report a system to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 zzso from human coronavirus zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the integrity of the zzso template and the prevention of false zzso events during reverse zzso are the critical parameters to achieve the synthesis of long zzso The zzso of the zzso chain reaction conditions enabled us to improve the specificity and yield of product but they were not zzso Finally, we have shown that the same reverse zzso zzso chain reaction technology can be used for the amplification of extended regions of the zzso zzso a cellular zzso of relatively low zzso
