zzso peptides zzso are a large group of zzso containing a common zzso zzso they have been identified in zzso and zzso We have isolated the zzso that encodes three zzso in the tobacco zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso The larger zzso are the partially processed precursors of zzso a zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso The presence of all three zzso in different zzso suggests differential zzso of typical zzso processing sites and zzso processing sites zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the brain, nerve cord, and zzso and the zzso levels in the nervous system are zzso regulated during zzso In zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso zzso to a variety of cell types within the central nervous system zzso a peripheral zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso cells, which suggests diverse zzso Distribution of the zzso zzso within the central nervous system is zzso and the zzso profile suggests that the zzso gene products may have zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso gene has provided insights into its regulation and zzso distribution that will enhance our understanding of how these zzso zzso different zzso systems and ultimately zzso
