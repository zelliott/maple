The core protein of zzso c virus zzso is a structural protein with potent zzso zzso activities zzso by its zzso zzso domain zzso which is thought to play a key role in zzso zzso To further characterize the core zzso properties, we studied the interactions between core D1 and the zzso zzso zzso zzso region required for zzso zzso To this end, we monitored the real-time zzso zzso of native and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso Stem zzso II zzso from X with their respective complementary zzso Core D1 and peptides consisting of the core basic zzso were found to promote both zzso reactions and partly switch the zzso interaction pathway, which zzso in the absence of zzso towards a zzso involving the stem zzso The zzso properties of the core D1 peptides were found to be zzso through interaction of their basic clusters with the zzso zzso groups, in line with the absence of high affinity site for core on zzso zzso zzso The core ability to facilitate the zzso between different zzso structures may explain how this protein regulates zzso structural transitions during zzso zzso
