In the zzso the zzso zzso zzso metabolism of maternal cortisol and zzso by the zzso is an important component in the sequence of events regulating the function of the fetal zzso zzso The present study was designed to isolate and sequence the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA was isolated from a zzso kidney zzso library using a human zzso zzso as a zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region showed extensive zzso zzso 95) to that published by others for human zzso particularly in zzso I and II zzso zzso and in the zzso promoter ( zzso zzso Using total zzso from adult zzso liver zzso with a 22 zzso zzso primer located at the 3' end of zzso I, parallel zzso sequencing reactions with the same primer confirmed that the zzso zzso gene has two zzso start sites 93 zzso apart and that both start sites are preceded by a zzso box but not a zzso zzso zzso protection zzso confirmed that both zzso start sites are zzso in liver and near term zzso zzso and that transcripts emanating from the downstream start site dominate in the zzso in contrast to the preferential zzso of the upstream start site in adult zzso
