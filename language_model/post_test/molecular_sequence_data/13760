Physical mapping of human zzso at a resolution of 100 zzso to 1 zzso will provide important zzso for gene identification and framework templates for ultimately determining the complete DNA zzso zzso site zzso content zzso coupled with large zzso cloning in zzso artificial zzso provides an efficient mechanism for producing zzso zzso maps of human zzso Previously, we produced a set of standardized zzso for human zzso 11 regionally localized by zzso in zzso zzso or zzso cell hybrid zzso In this paper, we used these as well as other zzso content, and identify 109 islands spanning an estimated 218 zzso on the zzso zzso Since about zzso of the islands contain markers ordered on zzso 11 by genetic or radiation hybrid analysis, this data set represents a zzso approximation of a physical map of human zzso zzso This set of zzso zzso and associated zzso will provide the material for the production of a continuous overlapping set of zzso as well for high-resolution physical mapping based upon sampled and complete DNA zzso
