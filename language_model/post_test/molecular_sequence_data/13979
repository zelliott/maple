This paper reports the solution zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso positioned opposite a zzso deletion site in a DNA zzso zzso The combined zzso and molecular mechanics zzso studies were undertaken on the zzso zzso embedded in the zzso sequence context in a duplex containing 12 zzso on the modified strand and 10 on the partner zzso with no bases opposite the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso acid were assigned following analysis of two-dimensional zzso data sets in zzso and zzso zzso The solution zzso of the zzso zzso duplex has been determined by incorporating zzso and zzso zzso distances defined by upper and lower bounds deduced from zzso zzso as restraints in molecular mechanics zzso in zzso angle zzso The zzso ring of zzso is zzso between intact zzso zzso and zzso base pairs with the zzso base of zzso in a zzso alignment displaced into the major zzso The zzso zzso zzso angle at zzso is supported by both carbon and zzso chemical shift data for the sugar zzso of the modified zzso zzso The zzso zzso base is also zzso out of the zzso into the major groove with the zzso rings of zzso and zzso stacking on each other in the zzso The long axis of the zzso zzso ring is parallel to the long axis of the zzso zzso base zzso The zzso site is wedge shaped with a pronounced zzso and zzso of the zzso base zzso The zzso base of zzso which is positioned in the major groove, is inclined relative to the zzso axis and stacks over the zzso zzso zzso in the solution zzso The zzso base displacement structure of the zzso zzso duplex exhibits several unusually shifted zzso zzso that can be readily accounted for by the ring current contributions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso aromatic rings of the zzso zzso We note similarities between the present zzso of zzso positioned opposite a zzso deletion site with our earlier zzso studies of zzso positioned opposite a zzso deletion site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso For both zzso the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso at the deletion site through base displacement of the modified zzso in a zzso alignment into the major groove and directed toward its zzso in the zzso These structures provide a molecular explanation of how transient strand zzso of the zzso segment can be zzso by a double zzso following zzso zzso
