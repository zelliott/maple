A zzso protein was found to be a major cell wall protein in zzso zzso cells cultured without shaking, but was not present in cells cultured with zzso The zzso acid sequence of this protein was identical to the sequence of zzso zzso has previously been identified as a gene induced by zzso cold shock or zzso and was believed to be a cell membrane protein but not a cell wall zzso However, we found that zzso zzso zzso from the cell wall and the zzso zzso reacted with zzso to zzso and contained zzso These results suggest that zzso is a major structural cell wall protein in the zzso zzso cells and is bound to the cell wall through zzso zzso zzso was transcribed only in the zzso culture and its zzso was regulated by the zzso zzso
