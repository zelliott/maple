In an attempt to clone and express proteins from the zzso virus zzso zzso library to be used as zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso format to test against the zzso found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients, we have isolated and characterized three zzso All three clones expressed the same zzso of different zzso which belong to the zzso terminal end of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso All three clones were found to be zzso and could be used in an zzso and zzso zzso against the zzso zzso with various degrees of sensitivity and zzso Because the clones varied in zzso this difference provides a simple system to determine where most of the zzso zzso lies on the zzso We designed an zzso zzso and a mathematical model to help map the segment of the zzso most zzso to 43 zzso zzso zzso were unexpected: zzso of the patients were most zzso to region zzso which was the smallest zzso among the three fragments zzso zzso zzso was only 33 zzso acids in zzso Only zzso and zzso of patients showed the most zzso region in segment zzso and zzso zzso This variation could be due to major zzso complex zzso The patients could be divided into three groups based on the zzso zzso in which each group responded to a different zzso segment in the zzso zzso The largest group responded to an zzso segment, which was only 33 zzso acids zzso This domain was coded for by the gene zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This segment of the protein would be suitable for further zzso mapping zzso
