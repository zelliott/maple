zzso the zzso identified with the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso human cell surface zzso complex composed of four different zzso protein species with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 500 zzso Here, we report the zzso and zzso analysis of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the identification of a common, full-length zzso with an open reading frame of zzso base zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 105 zzso found as an entry for an unnamed protein with unknown function in public data zzso A short sequence tag matching the zzso of this gene was independently discovered by serial analysis of gene expression profiling as a zzso marker, zzso zzso evaluation zzso zzso as an zzso protein composed of a signal zzso an zzso EMI domain, and a zzso zzso domain, separated from each other by a central zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and the two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso are exposed on the cell zzso The three smaller zzso show a similar pattern of zzso and zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso Because the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso show structural features shared by zzso and zzso two zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso and zzso it will be of interest to explore similar functions for zzso in human vascular zzso
