Three members of the zzso gene family, designated as zzso zzso and zzso have been described in many zzso A large body of evidence indicates that the zzso gene is essential for the development of most zzso zzso By contrast, the functions of zzso and zzso are less well zzso To further explore the relationship between the different zzso family members we have compared the expression of zzso and zzso during mouse zzso by Northern zzso and by in zzso zzso In accordance with the important role of zzso in the zzso system, we detect high levels of zzso expression in zzso zzso such as the fetal liver and the zzso Surprisingly, we find that high levels of zzso expression are not restricted to zzso zzso We show that zzso is strongly expressed in the neural zzso and in zzso of the respiratory zzso The zzso side analysis of zzso and zzso expression clearly shows that both genes are expressed in different, but overlapping sets of zzso Our results suggest that the function of zzso may not be restricted to zzso zzso
