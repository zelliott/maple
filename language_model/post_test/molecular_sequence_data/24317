zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso growth factor that acts on various zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to determine whether zzso altered the proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso We also observed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in cultured bovine zzso zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso cells obtained from cows in early stage of the zzso cycle zzso zzso were cultured in zzso zzso supplemented with zzso calf zzso The cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso for 2, 4, or 6 zzso zzso significantly increased the total DNA in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In another experiment, when the cells reached zzso the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and the cells were cultured for 24 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso is expressed only in zzso cells, and that zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays roles in the proliferation and the regulation of zzso function of bovine zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso
