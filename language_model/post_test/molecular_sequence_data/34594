The host genetic background to develop primary gastric zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso infection is zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso inflammation and appears to be involved in the evolution of zzso zzso We investigated four functional zzso zzso in the zzso gene for association with the development of primary gastric zzso zzso 

A total of 144 zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso controls and zzso healthy blood donors were zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso technology and zzso analysis was zzso 

There was no significant difference in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso T zzso was found in zzso of patients with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rare zzso T had a zzso increased risk to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with high-grade zzso were significantly more frequent carriers of the zzso T zzso than healthy blood donors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the T zzso zzso a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no associations found between any of the zzso and disease zzso 

In conclusion, our data provide further evidence for host genetic factors in the zzso of Caucasians to gastric zzso zzso Further studies are needed to zzso the zzso role of zzso in zzso
