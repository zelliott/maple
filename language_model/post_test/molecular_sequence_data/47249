zzso zzso is an zzso filament pointed end capping protein that maintains the length of the zzso zzso filaments in zzso zzso Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso skeletal zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the previously described chicken zzso and is the product of a different zzso zzso zzso sequences are highly zzso across zzso and constitute an independent group in the zzso zzso In zzso chicken zzso caps zzso and zzso filament pointed ends to the same extent as does chicken zzso However, zzso and zzso differ in their tissue zzso zzso zzso in fast skeletal muscle zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is found in heart and slow skeletal muscle zzso Additionally, their expression is zzso regulated during chicken breast muscle differentiation with zzso replacing zzso after zzso Finally, in skeletal muscle fibers that zzso both zzso and zzso they are recruited to different zzso zzso zzso structures within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All together, these observations support the hypothesis that zzso have acquired different zzso zzso that play distinct roles in zzso
