The zzso controlled protein zzso was discovered by the early induction of its rate of synthesis after zzso stimulation of mouse zzso zzso is expressed in almost all zzso zzso and it is highly zzso between animals, plants and zzso Based on its zzso acid zzso zzso cannot be attributed to any known protein family, and its cellular function remains to be zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso has properties of a zzso binding protein that associates with zzso in a cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that occurs in complexes of zzso zzso and part of zzso can be zzso from zzso cell extracts with zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments we find zzso associated with zzso during zzso zzso zzso and early M phase of the cell zzso At zzso zzso is also bound to the zzso zzso and it is detached from the zzso during zzso zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein interacts with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso in zzso The zzso binding domain of zzso was identified by zzso zzso it shows similarity to part of the zzso binding domain of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in cell growth zzso and in zzso of cell zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso levels leads to zzso zzso and to an increase in zzso mass and zzso
