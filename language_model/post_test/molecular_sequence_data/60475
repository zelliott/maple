zzso zzso zzso zzso is used as a restricting element to present several zzso zzso zzso peptides to zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso is selectively lost in primary melanoma zzso and more frequently in zzso Only zzso information is available about the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso in spite of its potentially negative impact on the clinical course of the disease and on the outcome of T zzso zzso zzso in this study we have shown that the selective zzso zzso loss in melanoma cells zzso is caused by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso because of a base substitution at the zzso zzso donor site of zzso 2 of the zzso zzso As a result, zzso transcripts are spliced to two zzso forms, one with zzso 2 skipping and the other with zzso 2 zzso The latter is not translated because of an early premature stop zzso in the retained zzso In contrast, the transcript with zzso 2 skipping is translated to a truncated zzso heavy chain without the zzso zzso Such a zzso is zzso in zzso but is not zzso in cells, probably because of the low steady state level of the corresponding zzso and the low translation zzso These results indicate that a single zzso event in an zzso class I gene is sufficient for loss of the corresponding zzso This may account, at least in part, for the high frequency of selective zzso class I zzso loss in melanoma zzso Our conclusion emphasizes the need to implement active specific zzso with a combination of peptides presented by various zzso class I zzso This strategy may counteract the ability of melanoma cells with selective zzso class I zzso loss to escape from immune zzso
