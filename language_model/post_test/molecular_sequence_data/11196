The zzso differentiation complex, located on human zzso band zzso contains at least 20 genes expressed during zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso spanning the zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso mapping and FISH confirmed the zzso of the zzso with the zzso restriction map zzso zzso et zzso 1993, zzso zzso However, the zzso clones revealed several additional restriction sites not previously detected in zzso DNA, presumably due to zzso zzso Making use of zzso selection, we have identified three novel zzso all of which map to the zzso zzso All three transcripts are expressed at high levels in normal and zzso skin, but not in cultured zzso or in a variety of cell lines and human zzso The molecular cloning of this region provides a valuable tool for identifying additional zzso differentiation genes and for zzso the relationship between zzso structure and gene expression during terminal zzso
