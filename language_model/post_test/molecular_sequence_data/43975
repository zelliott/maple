zzso zzso has been proposed as an evolutionary inheritance either from some zzso zzso or from a more closely related zzso To address this question, we studied the zzso expression of zzso the zzso gene of zzso the closest living zzso relative of the zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso is expressed along the zzso axis as zzso zzso each located in the zzso part of a nascent or newly formed zzso This pattern resembles the expression stripes of the zzso gene zzso which has a key role in establishing and maintaining the zzso in zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso Later, zzso zzso express zzso in zzso patterns - zzso in the embryonic zzso and zzso nerve zzso Nerve zzso expression occurs in a few cells approximately midway along the zzso axis and also in a conspicuous group of anterior cells in the cerebral zzso at a level previously identified as corresponding to the zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso expression at the zzso boundary, zzso expression in the cerebral zzso is relatively zzso Thus, it is uncertain whether the cerebral zzso expression marks the zzso end of the zzso zzso if it does, then zzso may have little or no zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in forming zzso suggests that the functions of zzso zzso in establishing and maintaining a zzso body plan may have arisen only once during animal zzso If so, the zzso and zzso probably shared a common segmented zzso
