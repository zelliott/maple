Although long-term use of zzso has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with zzso zzso zzso its long-term effect on the zzso of zzso zzso within zzso airways has not yet been zzso We therefore suggest that long-term use of zzso increases zzso resistance in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in naturally colonizing zzso group zzso zzso was zzso as well as zzso resistance gene zzso through sequence analysis, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso from 24 adult zzso patients, who were on oral zzso therapy for at least the previous 7 zzso 

Almost three-quarters of zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso whilst a further 15 zzso had reduced zzso leaving only 10 zzso zzso susceptible to zzso The majority zzso were not susceptible to zzso as demonstrated by possession of the zzso gene in zzso zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso genes simultaneously in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso resistance for zzso is common in zzso in adult zzso patients, with zzso being over three times more zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso in zzso patients may reduce zzso zzso in zzso zzso where these organisms may potentially act as a zzso of zzso resistance zzso for newly acquired and zzso zzso
