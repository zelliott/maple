The zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso have revealed detailed three-dimensional structure and zzso mechanisms of zzso DNA zzso yet their functions in maintaining their native zzso remain largely zzso To identify functions of the zzso DNA zzso zzso in replicating the zzso zzso under extreme conditions, we disrupted the zzso gene in zzso zzso and characterized the resulting zzso strains zzso zzso of zzso did not cause any obvious growth zzso sensitivity to any of several zzso agents, or change in overall rate of spontaneous zzso at a zzso target zzso Loss of zzso did, however, cause significant changes in the spectrum of spontaneous forward zzso in each of two zzso target genes of different zzso Relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited fewer zzso and other small zzso zzso but exhibited more zzso zzso that converted zzso base pairs to zzso base zzso These changes, which were confirmed to be statistically zzso indicate two distinct activities of the zzso zzso in zzso cells growing under nearly optimal culture conditions zzso and pH zzso The first activity promotes zzso events within simple repetitive zzso such as zzso runs or zzso repeats, and the second promotes zzso of C opposite a potentially zzso form of G, thereby avoiding zzso to zzso zzso
