A unique satellite DNA family was characterized in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that it contains two wide zzso of about 160 and 190 zzso respectively, that span zzso of the repeated zzso One feature of this satellite DNA is that it accounts for different amounts of zzso DNA in males and zzso The DNA zzso and zzso were determined by migration on PAGE and by computer zzso It has been correlated with the presence of zzso stretches repeated in phase with the zzso turn and with the presence of the zzso zzso zzso embedded in some of these zzso zzso zzso of the satellite DNA was also analyzed by Northern zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts spanning several satellite DNA units were found in zzso samples from zzso workers, and zzso These transcripts resulted from a specific zzso occurring on one DNA strand in the zzso or on both DNA strands in zzso The involvement of DNA zzso in the organization of the satellite DNA and the function of the satellite transcripts is zzso
