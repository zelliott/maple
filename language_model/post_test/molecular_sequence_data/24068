We present the statistical analysis of diversifying selective pressures on the zzso D zzso gene zzso zzso distinct zzso sequences from zzso I, II, and III were tested for positive selection using maximum likelihood methods based on models of zzso substitution that allow variable selective pressures across zzso Such methods have been shown to be sufficiently accurate and successful in detecting positive selection in a variety of viral and zzso zzso zzso About zzso of zzso sites in zzso were estimated to be under diversifying zzso zzso most of the zzso predicted to evolve under positive selection were located in the zzso domain and the zzso region with reported zzso zzso These sites are potential targets of the zzso immune zzso Identification of zzso mutating to escape immune recognition may help to distinguish the most virulent strains and aid vaccine zzso zzso interplay between positive selection and zzso on the gene is discussed but no significant evidence for zzso was zzso
