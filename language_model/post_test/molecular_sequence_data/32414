zzso zzso are found to contain zzso and variable amounts of zzso in zzso and are believed to be important for zzso zzso To date, structural information is available for the zzso and zzso forms, but not for the zzso or mixed metal zzso zzso binding to zzso has been investigated by circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso using two synthetic fragments representing the zzso and the zzso The zzso zzso data and thus the structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essentially the same as those already published for the corresponding zzso of native zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso provided clear evidence of stable zzso folds of the three zzso zzso and the four zzso zzso The solution structures of these two species are zzso different from the structures of the starting zzso zzso Further addition of zzso to the two single zzso led to the loss of defined domain zzso Upon mixing of the separately prepared zzso three and four zzso loaded zzso and zzso no interaction was seen between the two zzso There was neither any indication for a net transfer of zzso between the two zzso nor for the formation of one large single zzso cluster involving both zzso
