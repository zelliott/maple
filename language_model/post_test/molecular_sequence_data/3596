The vitamin zzso zzso protein S binds with high affinity to zzso protein zzso a regulator of zzso Despite the zzso importance of the complex, we have only a zzso view of the zzso site in protein zzso Based on zzso display experiments, protein S zzso zzso were suggested to form part of the binding zzso Several experimental approaches were now used to further zzso the structural requirements for protein S binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of protein S were found to inhibit the protein zzso interaction, whereas deletion of zzso zzso from the zzso caused complete loss of zzso In zzso protein zzso each of zzso zzso was zzso to Ala, and the protein S zzso were tested for binding to zzso The zzso zzso reduced binding to zzso approximately zzso and a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of this zzso was less zzso than the parent zzso A further decrease in binding was observed using a zzso zzso in which a site for zzso zzso was moved from position zzso to 456 zzso A zzso zzso zzso selective for free protein S reacted poorly with the zzso zzso but reacted efficiently with the other zzso A second zzso zzso 34, which partially inhibited the protein zzso interaction, reacted poorly with several of the Ala zzso suggesting that its zzso was located in the zzso zzso zzso display analysis of the zzso 34 zzso further identified this region as its zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso of protein S form part of a more complex binding site for zzso A recently developed three-dimensional model of the sex zzso zzso region of protein S was used to analyze available experimental zzso
