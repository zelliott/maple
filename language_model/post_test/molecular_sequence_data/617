The insect Toll signaling zzso is activated upon recognition of zzso bacteria and zzso resulting in the expression of zzso peptides via zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso cascade leading to the processing of zzso which generates the functional zzso of the Toll zzso Recently, we identified three zzso zzso zzso Toll zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, the identities of the downstream zzso zzso components of zzso protein 3 zzso a zzso for a major cell wall component zzso of zzso and their order of zzso have not been characterized zzso Here, we identified three zzso zzso that are required for Toll zzso by zzso in the larvae of a large zzso zzso zzso The first one is a modular zzso zzso functioning immediately downstream of zzso that zzso activates the second one, a zzso zzso zzso that in turn activates the third zzso zzso a zzso zzso The active form of zzso zzso then zzso zzso into the processed zzso as Toll zzso In addition, we show that injection of zzso into zzso larvae zzso production of two zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, which are also zzso by injection of the active form of zzso zzso zzso or processed zzso These results demonstrate a three-step zzso cascade essential for the Toll zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso larvae, which is shared with zzso zzso Toll zzso zzso
