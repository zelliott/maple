zzso repeat regions zzso and zzso are highly zzso peptides located in zzso of zzso envelope zzso They are important in the process of virus fusion and form zzso bundle structure zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso similar to those found in the fusion proteins of other enveloped zzso such as zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso show potent zzso for virus fusion in some members of zzso However, in other members, only zzso gives strong zzso whereas zzso does zzso Human respiratory zzso virus zzso is a member of zzso and its crystal structure of zzso and zzso zzso bundle was solved zzso Although zzso zzso zzso was reported, nevertheless the effect of zzso on virus fusion is not zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso were expressed as fusion protein separately in zzso coli system and their complex assembly and virus fusion zzso effect have been zzso It shows that both zzso and zzso (in the fusion form with zzso fusion zzso of zzso F protein give strong zzso on virus fusion zzso values are zzso and zzso zzso zzso and they form stable zzso bundle in zzso with both in the fusion protein zzso
