zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a major component of basement zzso and forms a highly stable zzso complex with zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso has been derived from sequencing of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame followed by a zzso region of zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso with an zzso Mr of zzso a zzso signal zzso two zzso zzso sites, and two potential zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence predicts that the zzso consists of two zzso zzso of 70 and 36 zzso separated by a zzso domain of 28 zzso The zzso zzso domain shows zzso to the zzso precursor and the low density zzso zzso zzso contains six zzso zzso repeat units and one copy of a zzso motif found in zzso The zzso cell recognition sequence is present in one of the zzso repeats, and a synthetic zzso from the putative zzso site of zzso was found to promote the attachment of mouse zzso tumor zzso
