An zzso gene zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the zzso fungus zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso revealed an zzso gene zzso a typical signal zzso an zzso zzso domain, two repeated regions linked by a short zzso zzso and a domain of unknown zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso domain showed zzso with the family 5 zzso While the zzso domain of zzso was not zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the repeated regions of zzso were very similar to the zzso domain of zzso This suggests that evolutionary zzso of zzso zzso might occur among bacteria and zzso within the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso was used for the characterization studies of the zzso zzso exhibited both zzso and zzso zzso Its pH optimum was 4 and the temperature optimum was 40 degrees zzso zzso analysis showed that the repeated sequences and zzso domain of zzso were not required for zzso zzso
