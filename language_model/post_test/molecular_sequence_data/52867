zzso zzso zzso was zzso 7, zzso from an extract of barley zzso zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso had high activity toward zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso with an optimum at pH zzso and zzso the zzso by a retaining zzso as shown by nuclear magnetic zzso zzso was a strong inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition revealed that all zzso in the zzso ring and zzso in the reducing ring of zzso formed important hydrogen bonds to the zzso in the transition state zzso Mass zzso of zzso fragments assigned the zzso protein to a barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that appears to zzso an zzso A corresponding sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library using a zzso zzso from a barley zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with zzso identity to the protein deduced from zzso The sequence contains two active site motifs of zzso zzso family zzso Three zzso of 86 to zzso zzso interrupt the coding zzso The four zzso vary from 218 to zzso zzso Gene expression analysis showed that zzso reached a maximum 48 h after the start of zzso
