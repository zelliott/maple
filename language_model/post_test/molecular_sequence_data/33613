Over the past decade, fluorescent proteins zzso have become ubiquitous tools in biological zzso Yet, little is known about the natural function or evolution of this zzso of proteins that originate from marine zzso Using molecular zzso analyses of 102 naturally occurring zzso fluorescent zzso green fluorescent zzso red fluorescent zzso as well as the zzso zzso protein sequences (including new zzso from zzso Island, zzso derived from organisms with known geographic origin, we show that zzso consist of two distinct and novel regions that have evolved under opposite and sharply divergent evolutionary zzso A central region is highly zzso and although it contains the zzso that form the zzso its evolution does not track with fluorescent color and zzso independently from the rest of the zzso By contrast, the regions enclosing this central region are under strong positive selection pressure to vary its sequence and yet segregate well with zzso color zzso We did not find a significant correlation between geographic location of the zzso from which the zzso was isolated and molecular evolution of the zzso These results define for the first time two distinct regions based on evolution for this highly compact zzso The findings have implications for more sophisticated zzso of this zzso as well as studies directed toward understanding the natural function of zzso
