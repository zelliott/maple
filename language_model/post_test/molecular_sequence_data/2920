The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that codes for the alpha zzso of the DNA zzso III zzso has been zzso It consists of zzso base pairs coding for zzso zzso acids (from the start to the stop zzso giving a molecular weight of zzso A zzso zzso that zzso resistance to the zzso drug zzso is due to a single base change at zzso zzso from zzso to zzso resulting in a change of the zzso zzso acid, zzso to zzso It is in the active site and located at the zzso part of the zzso The zzso acid composition in an zzso domain has zzso zzso to the zzso zzso coded by the zzso gene of zzso coli, which is a zzso zzso zzso supporting an earlier observation that this function is an integral part of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
