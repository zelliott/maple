zzso and zzso were originally described as zzso zzso proteins involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso however, recently both proteins have been shown to bind zzso in zzso in preference to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not their major zzso in zzso In the present study we showed by means of deletion and zzso analyses that zzso and zzso are recruited to zzso zzso through specific interaction with zzso not with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were still localized in the zzso portion of the zzso (where zzso zzso had zzso in nerve growth zzso zzso cells, the same as the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were present throughout the zzso We further showed that expression of the zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited high zzso zzso Y zzso by zzso zzso We also found that zzso and its binding partner, zzso have been highly zzso during evolution (from zzso to zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically interact with zzso but not with zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso functions as a zzso zzso across zzso Based on these findings, we propose that the zzso zzso binding domain of zzso and zzso be referred to as zzso zzso binding domain for zzso the same as the zzso protein zzso domain zzso of zzso
