A zzso that can be defined as zzso based on oxygen binding was isolated from zzso zzso The protein exists in zzso form and is separated into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on a zzso zzso From examinations of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assigned to the zzso and its zzso respectively, of the one zzso while zzso and zzso corresponded to those of the other zzso The complete zzso acid sequence was therefore determined of zzso I and zzso The I was composed of 121 zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso being zzso The II, on the other hand, consisted of 119 zzso acid zzso its sequence being exactly identical to that of the third zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the fraction zzso Although the zzso zzso cannot be ruled out completely, we have concluded that fraction II is a degradation product of the fraction I by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso is very unique and showed no notable degree of similarity with the other zzso zzso so far, but it was found to be zzso identical with zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso
