We previously described the isolation of an zzso zzso zzso that is predominantly expressed in zzso T cells and is capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In addition, the gene for zzso is induced by zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso library resulted in the identification of the human zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso is induced by zzso in the human T cell line, zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso by this gene shares zzso identity to zzso zzso and demonstrates a similar zzso value for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso The distribution and abundance of zzso and zzso in zzso human zzso were compared by Western zzso Unlike its zzso counterpart, the human zzso is abundantly expressed in numerous zzso and in many cases, is in zzso excess over zzso
