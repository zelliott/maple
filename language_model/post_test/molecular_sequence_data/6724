This paper describes genes from zzso and mouse with significant sequence similarities to a zzso gene that encodes the blood cell tumor zzso zzso The protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso share zzso and 51% zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso All three proteins consist of zzso zzso tandem repeats of approximately 42 zzso acids zzso Similar repeats occur in a zzso of proteins that includes the zzso zzso zzso All three proteins contain a consensus sequence for a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso in the zzso domain, which is not part of the repeat zzso zzso microscopic analysis of zzso cells stained with zzso against zzso reveals that this protein is zzso throughout the cell zzso zzso gene disruption shows that zzso is an essential zzso Despite their sequence similarities, zzso and mouse zzso are unable to rescue the zzso of an zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso cells depleted of zzso arrest in zzso with a zzso content of zzso zzso cells display abnormal structures and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso segregation of the zzso and the zzso and threads of zzso emanating from the bulk of nuclear zzso This zzso suggests that zzso is required for the normal function of zzso and the zzso pole bodies, as well as for nuclear zzso We suggest that zzso interacts with multiple components of the cell nucleus that are required for zzso and discuss its functional similarities to, and differences from zzso zzso
