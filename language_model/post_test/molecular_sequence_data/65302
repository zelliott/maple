An zzso to zzso zzso purple sulfur zzso designated strain zzso was isolated in pure culture from brackish water near zzso India, in a medium that contained 2 % zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso by means of a single polar zzso zzso zzso had no absolute salt requirement for growth but was able to tolerate up to 4 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso zzso a and the zzso lycopene of the zzso series were present as zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow zzso and zzso There was no vitamin requirement for growth of strain zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso clustered with species of the zzso zzso in the class zzso zzso zzso showed highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarity data and zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was sufficiently distinct from recognized zzso species to be described as representing a novel species of the zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
