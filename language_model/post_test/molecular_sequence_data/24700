Six members of a family with zzso had zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and, after sequencing the entire coding region and the zzso zzso boundaries of all three zzso zzso a single zzso zzso zzso was identified in the gamma zzso This novel zzso was not detected in normal family members or unrelated zzso The zzso zzso substitution occurs at a zzso zzso in the zzso domain, but molecules containing the new zzso were not present in circulating zzso The evidence for this was that zzso gamma chains had a normal mass of zzso Da compared to a control of zzso zzso and zzso zzso maps were entirely zzso The zzso predicts a mass increase of 12 Da in zzso zzso but on mass mapping only the normal zzso zzso was zzso at zzso zzso There was no new signal at zzso zzso that would indicate expression of zzso zzso Also the normal zzso zzso signal was at the same intensity in zzso from the zzso and zzso Crystal structures show a hydrogen bond from the zzso zzso to the main chain and this case suggests this bond is critical in maintaining the structure of the zzso zzso
