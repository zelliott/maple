In this study, the varying zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso zzso were employed to define the potential identity elements on zzso On this basis zzso was performed to zzso through in zzso zzso expression in zzso coli and in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for comparison with the zzso These comparisons served to establish zzso and the zzso as major identity zzso and zzso zzso and A9 as minor identity zzso While the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso coli require zzso to function, replacement of zzso by zzso favors the zzso from zzso This change points to the variation of the identity elements for the same zzso acid among different zzso The similarity in these elements between zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso however, suggests that identity elements on zzso like the active centers on zzso undergo evolutionary change at slower rates than less essential portions of the zzso
