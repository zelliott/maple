zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene by zzso or its zzso counterpart zzso requires two zzso zzso and zzso which do not directly bind to zzso zzso is a bridging zzso that connects zzso (or zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso is a positive zzso that activates zzso 

To zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso we isolated a zzso coding for the zzso Northern zzso analyses showed temporally restricted expression of zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts a zzso of 10 zzso whereas natural zzso is a zzso of 22 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the factor showed no zzso with proteins in the zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso interaction zzso demonstrated that zzso makes a direct contact with the zzso of zzso In a zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso activated zzso from various promoters as natural zzso zzso This zzso requires the zzso zzso When zzso zzso was added to the zzso cell nuclear extract in the presence of zzso and zzso bearing the zzso region of zzso it selectively activated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This selective zzso also requires the zzso zzso 

zzso activates zzso through its interaction with zzso Selective zzso zzso occurs when zzso is recruited to a promoter carrying the zzso binding site by zzso and zzso
