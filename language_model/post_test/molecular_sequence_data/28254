The gene coding for zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso of zzso zzso after analysis and zzso of zzso plasmids from the Clarke and zzso zzso The clone bearing the gene zzso zzso zzso by a factor zzso This means that the zzso represents more than zzso of the cellular total protein zzso zzso revealed that the zzso contains a unique open reading frame of zzso zzso flanked at its zzso and 3' ends respectively by 247 zzso and zzso zzso The length of the corresponding protein zzso zzso is well consistent with earlier Mr determination (about 70 zzso zzso extension analysis of the zzso zzso by reverse zzso located its zzso end respectively at 8 and 30 zzso downstream of a zzso and a zzso like element zzso and 60 zzso upstream of the unusual translation initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis located the zzso at 48 zzso downstream of the translation termination zzso zzso has a zzso usage pattern typical for highly expressed zzso coli zzso With the exception of the presence of a zzso sequence similar to the HIGH consensus element, zzso has no relevant sequence zzso with other zzso zzso
