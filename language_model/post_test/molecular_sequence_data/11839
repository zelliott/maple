zzso zzso a required zzso modification for the zzso of many zzso zzso sequential zzso action by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso first zzso conversion of a zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso and the zzso zzso then zzso breakdown of this zzso zzso to the zzso zzso plus zzso We have previously established that zzso and zzso exhibit tandem reaction zzso with zzso zzso and zzso being zzso toward, only zzso derivatives of absolute zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso and zzso exhibit dramatically different zzso zzso toward the zzso at the penultimate position (the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso results in complete conversion of these zzso to the corresponding zzso products, whereas the corresponding zzso compounds undergo zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is at least zzso higher than that of zzso and the same pattern holds for other zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso of zzso also holds for competitive zzso thus, the zzso of 45 zzso for zzso increases to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso In contrast, incubation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso results in facile zzso conversion of each of these compounds to their corresponding zzso zzso The simultaneous expression of high reaction zzso and low zzso zzso zzso in the course of zzso zzso was illustrated by a series of experiments in which zzso conversion of the zzso of zzso and zzso was monitored directly by zzso zzso parameters were determined for both zzso and potent competitive zzso of zzso and the results confirm that, in sharp contrast to zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso position has virtually no effect on binding or zzso These results illustrate a case where zzso zzso which must function zzso (and with tandem reaction zzso in a given zzso process, nevertheless exhibit sharply contrasting zzso zzso toward the binding of zzso and zzso
