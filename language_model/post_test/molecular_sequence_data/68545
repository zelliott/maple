zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso structural proteins requires the presence of the viral zzso protein zzso Rev is localized in the nucleus and binds specifically to the Rev response element zzso sequence in viral zzso Furthermore, the interaction of the Rev zzso domain with a cellular zzso is essential for Rev function in zzso Using zzso experiments and zzso zzso Analysis zzso we identify zzso initiation factor zzso zzso as a cellular factor binding specifically to the zzso Rev zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that a significant fraction of zzso zzso to the zzso We also provide evidence that Rev zzso is functionally zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we are able to block Rev function in zzso cells by zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso Thus, regulation of zzso gene expression by Rev involves the targeting of zzso zzso to components of the cellular translation initiation zzso
