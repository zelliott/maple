Rapid zzso in protein expression are commonly regulated by adjusting zzso In addition to zzso translation, which is zzso induced by zzso signaling via the zzso target of zzso zzso alternative modes of translation, such as internal zzso entry site zzso translation, are often enhanced under stress conditions, even if zzso translation is zzso Common stress stimuli comprise zzso zzso zzso but also inflammatory signals supplied by zzso immune zzso Yet, the impact of inflammatory zzso on translation in tumor cells still remains largely zzso In the present study, we aimed at identifying zzso zzso targets in tumor cells under inflammatory zzso Using zzso profiling and zzso analysis, we identified zzso zzso D3 zzso to be zzso zzso in breast tumor cells zzso with zzso medium of activated zzso zzso zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we identified and validated an zzso within the zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso which enhances translation of zzso upon CM zzso Furthermore, zzso translation of zzso by CM was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso of zzso zzso to induce its zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that zzso expression is zzso regulated via an zzso element, which is responsive to an inflammatory zzso Considering the negative feedback impact of zzso on the vitamin D responses, the identification of a novel, zzso mechanism of zzso regulation might open new possibilities to overcome the current limitations of vitamin D as tumor therapeutic zzso
