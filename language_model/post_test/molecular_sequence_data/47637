Comparative analysis by differential zzso display zzso of the expression patterns of potato plants induced and zzso to zzso led to the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso that is strongly zzso in the leaves of zzso zzso Leaf expression of this transcript was shown to be zzso with increased levels of zzso and protein being detected during the light zzso zzso analysis revealed near complete identity to potato zzso a zzso protein induced by drought stress, and strong zzso to the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso from pepper fruit, and zzso from cucumber zzso By using an zzso against pepper zzso we were able to demonstrate a zzso location of the zzso protein in association with the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso complexes showed a specific association of the protein with the zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso plants with reduced levels of zzso of zzso showed a stunted growth and decreased zzso yield and exhibited reduced values of zzso zzso of zzso a zzso Altogether, these results indicate a preferential association of the zzso protein with the light harvesting complex of zzso II zzso antenna zzso complexes, and suggest a functional role of this protein in photosynthesis, by modulating zzso efficiency and dissipation of excess absorbed light energy within the antenna zzso
