Many zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso multiple targets by zzso secondary zzso zzso (or zzso from a primary zzso zzso To begin to identify molecular regulators of zzso branch initiation or extension, we studied the growth of single sensory zzso in an in zzso collagen zzso system and identified an activity in extracts of embryonic spinal zzso and of zzso and adult brain that promotes the zzso and formation of extensive branches by these zzso zzso zzso of the activity from calf brain extracts led to the identification of an zzso zzso of zzso as the main active component and to the discovery of a distinct activity that zzso its zzso These results indicate that zzso proteins may function as positive regulators of zzso collateral formation during the establishment or zzso of neural zzso
