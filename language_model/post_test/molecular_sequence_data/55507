The spinal muscular zzso zzso zzso survival motor zzso zzso functions in the zzso of small nuclear zzso zzso zzso has also been implicated in zzso zzso however, it remains unclear which of these is important for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso zzso and show significant locomotion defects as well as reductions in zzso zzso zzso Despite these zzso we found no appreciable defects in the zzso of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso expression of low levels of either zzso or an zzso zzso form of zzso rescued the zzso zzso and locomotor zzso however, zzso levels were not zzso Thus, the zzso zzso function of zzso is not a major contributor to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings have major implications for zzso zzso because they show that zzso role in zzso zzso can be zzso from the zzso viability and locomotor zzso
