A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso identified by zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein gene sequences from zzso coli, was cloned and zzso The zzso encodes five zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso the four 50 S zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso portion of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The five zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein genes form a complex zzso zzso zzso appear to be initiated from an upstream promoter, zzso located in front of the zzso gene and from three internal zzso zzso is located immediately in front of the zzso zzso zzso is near the beginning of the zzso zzso space, and zzso is at the end of the zzso gene zzso The zzso sequences are excised from the leader regions of the zzso and zzso zzso Three putative but potentially important regulatory sequences were identified within this zzso an zzso zzso control site, a zzso zzso and a strong zzso zzso The strong zzso located zzso to the zzso gene zzso a fifth promoter, P zzso which is used to initiate transcripts of the downstream zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein exhibits zzso zzso acid sequence identity when aligned to the zzso coli zzso the alignment is interrupted by a large zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso protein after zzso zzso
