The zzso proteins are an emerging group of proteins with little known functional zzso In the present study, we report the first characterization of the zzso human zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso sequences are included in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso which we have termed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zinc zzso All these zzso sequences contain similarities to zzso zzso including the consensus sequence in zzso domain IV, which is essential for zinc zzso However, the new zzso zzso can be separated from other zzso zzso by the presence of a highly zzso potential zzso motif zzso in zzso domain zzso Here we report the location of zzso on zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and its ability to increase the zzso free zinc as measured with the zzso fluorescent zzso Newport Green, in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is in contrast with the zinc influx ability of another zzso zzso zzso which was due to its plasma membrane zzso Therefore we have added to the functionality of zzso proteins by reporting their ability to increase zzso zzso whether they are located on the plasma membrane or on zzso zzso This result, in combination with the crucial role that zinc plays in cell growth, emphasizes the importance of this new zzso zzso including the zzso zzso in the control of zzso zinc zzso aberrations of which can lead to diseases such as cancer, zzso disorders and neurological zzso
