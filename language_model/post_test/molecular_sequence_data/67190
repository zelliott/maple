zzso organisms exhibit a green color due to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso IX zzso zzso comprises three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso IX, the last common intermediate precursor in both zzso and zzso zzso to produce zzso IX zzso zzso zzso in higher plants results in zzso zzso zzso To date, 10 zzso zzso zzso have been isolated in rice, but the corresponding genes have not yet been zzso Rice zzso and zzso genes were mapped to zzso 3 and isolated by zzso zzso A zzso zzso occurred in a highly zzso zzso acid of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analyses have revealed that the zzso are poorly zzso resulting in the underdevelopment of zzso In the zzso fed with zzso in darkness, zzso levels in the zzso and zzso zzso decreased up to zzso and zzso of that in zzso respectively, indicating that the zzso activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso analysis indicated that the nuclear genes zzso the three zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are expressed about zzso higher than those in zzso but are not altered in the zzso zzso This result indicates that the zzso zzso zzso in negative feedback regulation of zzso in the expression of nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso
