The zzso gated sodium channel zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso action zzso along zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso by interacting with its zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso along with functional zzso The zzso motif of zzso adopts an zzso zzso in its interaction with the zzso of zzso zzso uses different zzso to interact with zzso motif depending on the presence or absence of zzso Three zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the key common interacting zzso in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso showed a reduced rate of zzso zzso in zzso experiments in zzso Compared with other zzso complexes, our results reveal a different mode of interaction for zzso and provides structural insight into the zzso zzso of zzso
