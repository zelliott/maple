The zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso that regulates their activity, and is also widely expressed on zzso zzso as a zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is strongly zzso by a dual zzso element zzso which is recognized by two zzso zzso and another unknown zzso Here we identify mouse zzso as the second zzso of the zzso zzso shares 50% zzso acid identity with zzso and contains zzso structural zzso Mouse zzso bound specifically to the rat zzso adjacent to, and partially zzso the zzso binding zzso By zzso zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso complexes were distinguished from zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were detected throughout mouse brain and peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso using a specific zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso protein levels and decreased zzso bound to the zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso but increased zzso promoter activity and zzso protein zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso is the second component that, with zzso mediates dual repression of the zzso zzso gene at the zzso
