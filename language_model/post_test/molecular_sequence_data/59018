The zzso zzso is a widely distributed integral membrane protein that is responsible for pH regulation in zzso zzso We have cloned and analyzed the zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso A clone from a mouse zzso library contained the zzso promoter region and the zzso zzso It also contained the first 121 zzso acids of the coding region of the zzso zzso A zzso site occurred after zzso acid zzso at the same region as in the human zzso zzso The deduced zzso terminal coding sequence was 76 and zzso identical to the human and rat zzso sequences zzso The zzso region was highly zzso to that of other species and two zzso contained in the human zzso zzso were present in the mouse zzso The results show that the deduced protein sequence of the mouse zzso gene has a high level of zzso with other species and that the zzso site of the first zzso is zzso These results suggest that the first large zzso may play an important role in the zzso gene zzso
