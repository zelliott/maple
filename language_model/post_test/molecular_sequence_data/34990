The zzso family zzso is a highly divergent group that contains plant zzso zzso zzso zzso and insect zzso It is zzso separated into 7 zzso Although molecular zzso relationships among 6 of the zzso have been zzso the zzso position of the zzso zzso which is composed of zzso of insects, remains zzso Here, a new zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the body cavities of burying zzso zzso zzso with a zzso prevalence (5 out of zzso The zzso position of the zzso within the family zzso was determined using zzso and molecular data for the new zzso The zzso sequences suggested that the new species belongs to zzso 3 of zzso which mostly consists of predators and insect zzso Although molecular sequences from other zzso species were not available, the zzso appears to be zzso The new species is characterized by the absence of a functional zzso and zzso and by the presence of 3 pairs of male zzso zzso a loosely coiled male body, and a zzso male zzso Compared with the original description of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has significant zzso differences, possibly because of zzso during the original description of zzso zzso Excluding these questionable characters, zzso zzso of functional zzso and zzso and number of male zzso zzso the new species is distinguished from zzso zzso by minor zzso characters and zzso zzso
