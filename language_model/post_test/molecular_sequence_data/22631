zzso the ultimate zzso protein in bacterial zzso zzso repair is capable of binding a vast array of structurally unrelated zzso A zzso structure in the protein plays an important role in zzso zzso In this paper we have monitored DNA zzso zzso in the zzso complex, using the fluorescent zzso analogue zzso We show that binding of zzso to a DNA zzso with cholesterol damage moves the base adjacent to the zzso at the 3' side into an zzso zzso This zzso base is not accessible for zzso zzso suggesting that it zzso into a pocket of the zzso zzso Also the base opposite this flipped base is zzso from the DNA zzso The degree of zzso exposure of both zzso varies with the type of zzso zzso bound by zzso Fluorescence of the base adjacent to the damage is higher when zzso is in the zzso zzso but zzso this zzso complex is less zzso In the zzso form the zzso complex is very stable and in this zzso the base in the zzso strand is more zzso zzso zzso zzso is specifically involved in base flipping in the zzso zzso We present evidence that this zzso change in the zzso strand is important for 3' incision by zzso
