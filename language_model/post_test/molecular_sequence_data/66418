The characterization of zzso zzso protein complexes, which goes beyond identification of protein zzso is a challenging zzso Here we describe and apply a comprehensive method that combines a mild affinity zzso procedure with a zzso mass zzso approach for the in-depth characterization of the zzso complex from zzso zzso expressed at zzso relevant zzso The zzso is an ensemble of primarily 3' zzso zzso zzso and plays a major role in zzso zzso The complex has been reported to consist of 11 proteins in molecular mass ranging from 20 to 120 zzso By using native zzso mass zzso we measured accurate masses zzso 400 zzso of several zzso zzso Combination of these data with zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso using a linear zzso trap coupled to a zzso mass zzso and intact protein zzso mass zzso provided us with the identity of the different zzso components and zzso including the zzso zzso We zzso that the observed complexes provide information about strongly and zzso interacting zzso zzso In our analysis we also identified for the first time zzso sites in seven different zzso zzso The zzso site in the zzso zzso is fully zzso in the human zzso of zzso which is the only previously reported zzso site in any of the human zzso zzso The described zzso mass zzso procedure is generic and thus zzso to many different types of cellular molecular zzso even if they are expressed at zzso zzso
