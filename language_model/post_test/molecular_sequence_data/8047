zzso processing zzso zzso are responsible for the maturation of seed zzso These processing zzso belong to a novel group of zzso zzso with molecular masses of 37 to 39 zzso We isolated two genes of zzso from a zzso library of zzso The gene products were designated zzso and zzso and they were zzso identical in terms of zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were also zzso and zzso identical to that of zzso bean zzso zzso The gene for zzso had 7 zzso while that of zzso had 8 zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso leaves, zzso leaves and stems of zzso while zzso is predominantly expressed in the flowers and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso is expressed in the zzso This result strongly suggests that the isolated genes zzso zzso of zzso that are specific to zzso zzso
