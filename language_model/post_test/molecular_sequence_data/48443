The zzso species zzso zzso zzso is important for research into the origin and evolution of zzso flowers due to its zzso position in the zzso zzso In this study, four zzso transcripts were isolated from zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analyses indicated that they possess high zzso to zzso zzso zzso which have been shown previously to be involved in zzso and zzso development in zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analyses showed zzso expression mainly in the second zzso zzso and zzso expression in whorls 1 and 3 zzso and zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso premature translation termination zzso were caused by an zzso in the zzso domain of zzso and by a deletion in the 7th zzso of zzso zzso analyses suggested that the zzso zzso zzso lineage had undergone gene zzso and zzso zzso in expression patterns during zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on comparative zzso and zzso zzso we concluded that zzso has likely contributed to the persistence of two functional zzso zzso that two other copies may have become zzso and that these zzso zzso and zzso events may have contributed to the evolution of the unusual floral zzso of zzso zzso
