The southern house zzso zzso zzso has one of the most acute and eclectic zzso systems of all zzso species zzso zzso Here, we used zzso sequencing to identify zzso genes expressed predominantly in zzso zzso main zzso zzso Less than 50% of the trimmed reads generated by high-quality libraries aligned to a transcript, but approximately zzso of them aligned to the zzso zzso expression analysis, which was validated by quantitative real-time zzso on a subset of zzso showed that approximately half of the 48 zzso protein genes were enriched in zzso with the other half being predominantly expressed in zzso Similar patterns were observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sensory zzso membrane zzso zzso for as many as 43 zzso receptors were enriched in female zzso thus making the zzso zzso family the largest of zzso zzso zzso second only to zzso zzso zzso zzso As many as 177 OR genes have been identified, including 36 unique zzso The unique OR genes differed from previously zzso zzso in internal zzso zzso zzso and extended N or C zzso One of the previously unknown transcripts was validated by cloning and functional zzso When challenged with a large panel of zzso relevant compounds, zzso responded in a zzso manner to zzso zzso which was demonstrated to repel zzso zzso and zzso to zzso a known insect zzso This zzso study led to identification of key molecular components and a repellent for the southern house zzso
