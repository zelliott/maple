zzso vaccine zzso must induce expression of major zzso zzso class II proteins and the zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells zzso However, some zzso elicit production of zzso resulting in adverse inflammatory zzso Development of agents that selectively increase zzso class II and zzso expression without triggering unwanted zzso production requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing the production and degradation of zzso class II and zzso in zzso Here, we investigate how zzso an zzso protein expressed on the surface of mature zzso promotes zzso class II and zzso zzso Using mice with an zzso zzso eliminating the zzso zzso region of zzso we found that the TM domain of zzso enhances zzso class II and zzso expression by blocking zzso class II association with the zzso zzso zzso The TM region of zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation of zzso class II and zzso in zzso zzso this zzso zzso for boosting zzso class II and zzso expression on zzso may provide an opportunity to enhance the zzso of zzso
