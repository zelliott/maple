Treatment of cultures of spontaneously immortalized human zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso them to zzso zzso While the zzso zzso product zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were highly toxic to the cultures at moderate concentration (1 zzso the potency of each agent was increased zzso or zzso zzso in the presence of zzso A toxicity increase was also evident in the zzso stimulation by zzso of protein and DNA zzso formed by zzso In contrast, the cells were insensitive to toxicity from zzso DNA damage zzso by zzso was capable of producing zzso effects, as judged by the induction of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso strongly zzso expression of zzso and zzso in the cells, zzso important for zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of zzso cultures as a model for studying zzso responses to zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso
