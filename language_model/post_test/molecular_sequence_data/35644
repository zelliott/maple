In zzso coli, iron zzso by means of the zzso zzso requires two zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso which are essential components of a zzso transport zzso Such components are typically difficult to zzso Here we report observation of the zzso and zzso gene products in zzso zzso they appeared as diffuse bands at positions consistent with smaller sizes than those predicted by sequence zzso zzso zzso was suggested by the lack of a zzso product from the zzso message in the absence of translation of the upstream zzso zzso The orientation of zzso in the membrane was predicted based on their similarities in sequence and zzso to zzso
