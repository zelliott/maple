In its role as a global response regulator, zzso controls the zzso of a diverse group of genes at different times in the zzso zzso cell zzso To understand the differential regulation of zzso zzso we compared the expression of two of these zzso the zzso zzso gene and the zzso DNA zzso zzso Despite their similar promoter architecture, these genes are transcribed at different times in the cell zzso zzso is activated earlier than zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately P) bound to the zzso recognition sequence in both promoters but had a zzso to zzso greater affinity for zzso This difference in affinity zzso with zzso changes in the cellular levels of zzso zzso a unique zzso repeat element in zzso significantly reduced promoter activity but not the timing of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso repeat does not play a major role in the zzso control of zzso zzso Our data indicate that differences in the affinity of zzso approximately P for zzso and zzso zzso in part, the zzso expression of these zzso However, the timing of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso was altered in cells expressing a stable zzso zzso indicating that changes in zzso approximately P levels alone cannot govern the cell cycle zzso of these zzso We propose that changes in the cellular concentration of zzso approximately P and its interaction with accessory proteins influence the zzso expression of zzso zzso and other key cell cycle genes and ultimately the regulation of the cell zzso
