The individual properties and zzso organization of zzso zzso and of two of its zzso forms zzso I and zzso zzso were studied in zzso zzso The formation of the first zzso ring in zzso I eliminates one negative charge and leads to a decrease of the molecular area at all surface zzso The zzso zzso energy and collapse pressure are higher in zzso I compared to those in the parent zzso The surface potential per unit of molecular surface density and the zzso molecular zzso moment are increased in zzso I with respect to those in zzso at comparable values of molecular zzso In zzso I the molecular parameters suggest an zzso chain oriented similarly to that of zzso On the average, this is perpendicular to the surface, and the zzso polar zzso zzso moment points away from the zzso In zzso II the negative charges are zzso resulting in considerably larger molecular areas than for zzso and zzso I at all zzso The zzso zzso energy of zzso II is also greatly diminished and the collapse pressure is further increased compared to those of zzso zzso However, the surface potential per unit molecular surface density and the zzso molecular zzso moment of zzso II are higher than in zzso zzso I at similar values of molecular zzso This is probably due to a positive polar zzso zzso moment contribution induced by the additional zzso ring in zzso zzso These changes result from a distorted zzso of the zzso chain zzso to the presence of fused zzso rings which require a greater zzso spacing compared to zzso and zzso zzso
