The D1 protein of zzso II is zzso in precursor with a zzso zzso Interestingly, there is quite a range in chain length of the extension, which roughly depends upon the class of zzso In zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the extension consists of 16 zzso acid zzso seven zzso longer than its counterpart in higher zzso In this study, we examined the D1 processing in zzso zzso zzso by zzso experiments and detected a zzso intermediate of this zzso This finding suggests that the zzso extension in this zzso is excised with a sequential zzso zzso which differs markedly from the manner observed in higher zzso
