A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, designated strain zzso was isolated from the tidal flat zzso of the Yellow Sea in South zzso zzso of this strain was performed on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso sharing the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso with zzso marina zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow zzso at 30 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso As an zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly identified from this strain, while zzso zzso was also present as a minor zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The most abundant cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
