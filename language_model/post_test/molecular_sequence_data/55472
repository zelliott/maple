zzso acid zzso backbone and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso for over 40 zzso with zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso type, zzso of the zzso and zzso type, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acid zzso with readily zzso zzso or zzso zzso atoms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent facile backbone zzso to form dominant zzso or zzso zzso These backbone zzso are thought to be triggered by a zzso zzso atom transfer to the zzso zzso zzso radical site followed by zzso zzso of the adjacent zzso bond, forming zzso zzso that spontaneously zzso by loss of zzso zzso acid zzso that do not have readily zzso zzso atoms zzso zzso do not undergo the zzso zzso zzso zzso The backbone zzso compete with zzso zzso in zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to be triggered by zzso atom transfers that activate the zzso or zzso bonds for zzso that dominate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from peptides containing zzso zzso zzso Met, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also participate in zzso atom transfers that trigger other zzso zzso
