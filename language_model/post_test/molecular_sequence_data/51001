zzso zzso zzso a precursor of the zzso protein zzso into the culture zzso where it is activated by zzso removal of a zzso zzso zzso can be achieved by a variety of zzso zzso as well as by zzso released by the bacteria zzso zzso toxin binds with high affinity to the zzso protein zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso is followed by zzso and the formation of zzso channels, leading to cell zzso Using chemical modification and zzso zzso we have identified regions of the zzso which are important in transfer across the outer membrane of the bacteria, and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso A preliminary electron density map of zzso zzso indicates that the protein is organized into three zzso Analysis of two-dimensional zzso of zzso suggests that the zzso form of the protein is zzso
