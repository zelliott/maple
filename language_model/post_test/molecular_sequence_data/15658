zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and some strains efficiently produce zzso acid under zzso zzso In an effort to understand zzso zzso metabolism under zzso zzso growth of the type strain zzso zzso was investigated in batch cultures and a zzso analysis was zzso A transient zzso of organic acids was observed and we focused our attention on zzso zzso zzso synthesis was due to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Features of zzso activity and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso gene was shown to be regulated at the zzso level by zzso a zzso zzso zzso also acting on most zzso system zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed the identification of the zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso and analysis of zzso expression in a zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso as a highly efficient negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso also affected zzso zzso
