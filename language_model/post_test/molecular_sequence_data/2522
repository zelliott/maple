We have compiled sequences of precursor proteins for 50 zzso proteins for which the mature zzso zzso has been determined by zzso acid sequence zzso Included in this set are 8 precursors that have leader peptides that are zzso in two places by zzso zzso zzso When these eight leader peptides are aligned and zzso a highly zzso zzso acid motif is identified as being common to this class of leader zzso This motif includes an zzso at position zzso a zzso zzso at position zzso and zzso zzso or zzso at position -5 relative to the mature zzso zzso The initial zzso of these peptides by zzso processing zzso occurs within the zzso between zzso at -9 and zzso such that zzso at position zzso is at position zzso relative to the zzso zzso The rest of the motif is within the zzso removed by subsequent zzso zzso by zzso zzso An additional 14 leader peptides in this collection (all of those that contain an zzso at zzso conform to this zzso Assuming that these 14 precursors are matured in two steps, we compared the internal zzso sites at position zzso with the ends of the other 30 leader peptides in the zzso We find that zzso of zzso processing zzso zzso sites follow an zzso at position zzso relative to zzso
