zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be involved in zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso This study reveals a probable function of the single known beta zzso zzso site zzso zzso and provides suitable tools for its zzso The zzso for 15 zzso zzso zzso against the zzso side of the zzso beta zzso were precisely mapped using zzso 100 synthetic peptides attached on zzso zzso Eleven zzso bound to a very zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso beta zzso which contains the beta zzso and to the corresponding sequence of human zzso The contribution of each zzso zzso to zzso binding was then studied by zzso zzso having single zzso zzso Overall, each of the zzso beta zzso including beta zzso proved critical for zzso zzso Two of our four zzso known to block the zzso channel were found to bind at zzso or close zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso selectively reduced binding of some zzso zzso including the channel blocking zzso We conclude that zzso probably plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso of this role should be facilitated by the identified zzso zzso
