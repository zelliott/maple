zzso zzso is an zzso lethal human zzso zzso suffer from a number of neurological disorders, as well as very high cancer zzso zzso may also have a higher than normal risk of cancer, particularly for the zzso The gene responsible for the disease zzso has been zzso but its role in mechanisms of the disease remain zzso Cellular zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso instability, suggest that a zzso in the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso may be the primary zzso however, overall levels of zzso rejoining appear zzso We used the shuttle zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso to compare the integrity of zzso rejoining in one normal and two zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were zzso higher in zzso cells, and the zzso spectrum was zzso The majority of the zzso found in all three cell lines were deletions zzso The DNA sequence analysis indicated that 17 of the 17 plasmids with deletion zzso in normal cells occurred between short zzso sequences zzso one of the repeats plus the intervening zzso implicating illegitimate zzso in zzso zzso The combined data from both zzso cell lines showed that 21 of 24 deletions did not involve zzso zzso implicating a zzso in the illegitimate zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso gene product may either directly participate in illegitimate zzso or zzso the zzso Regardless, this zzso is likely to be important to a zzso understanding of this lethal zzso
