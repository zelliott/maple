To test the hypothesis that zzso acid is a zzso for cellular zzso acid binding protein II zzso zzso human zzso II was expressed as a zzso fusion protein zzso zzso and a single affinity zzso step used to extract it from bacterial zzso zzso II bound all zzso acid with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso acid bound zzso These studies suggest that zzso acid is not a zzso for zzso zzso Their ease of zzso makes zzso fusion proteins useful tools for zzso binding studies with different zzso
