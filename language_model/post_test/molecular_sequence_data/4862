zzso between zzso regulatory elements is an important mechanism of zzso This work compares the zzso interaction in the housefly zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso and partially zzso a zzso zzso yet the zzso promoter zzso of zzso zzso is unexpectedly zzso from zzso zzso Introduced into zzso zzso this promoter drives a normal zzso pattern during the zzso zzso stage but is expressed zzso at the anterior pole of the zzso at later zzso We also report differences in the early expression of zzso in zzso We suggest that conservation of the zzso function of zzso in different sized zzso of higher zzso requires zzso of zzso and its target binding zzso
