The structure of the zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor Tu zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analog zzso was determined by zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso in placing the zzso acids in their correct order when zzso zzso is translated into a protein sequence on the zzso The zzso component binds to one side of the zzso zzso of zzso involving all three zzso of zzso zzso sites for the zzso zzso end and the zzso zzso end are located at domain zzso whereas the T stem interacts with the surface of the zzso domain zzso The binding involves many zzso zzso in zzso The overall shape of the zzso complex is similar to that of the zzso factor, zzso and this suggests a novel mechanism involving zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
