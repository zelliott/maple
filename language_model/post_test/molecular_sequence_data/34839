zzso zzso proteins exist in the zzso bound to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These zzso complexes contain all of the information needed for accurate membrane zzso We have shown that zzso contain a zzso activity that is required for zzso delivery, and we named that activity zzso displacement factor zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso activity was membrane associated and had a mass of approximately 25 zzso We therefore used a candidate gene approach and were able to show that pure zzso protein displays zzso zzso In this chapter, we review key aspects of zzso analysis: our zzso and the method by which we purify zzso in active zzso
