The impact of an extensive, uniform and zzso protein surface on the behavior of the surrounding zzso is zzso In particular, focus is placed on the possible enhancement of the structure of water at the zzso one model for the zzso zzso zzso residence times and zzso distribution functions are analyzed around three types of atomic sites zzso zzso and positively charged zzso in 1 zzso molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso zzso in water, in methanol and in zzso For comparison, water residence times at positively and zzso charged sites are obtained from a simulation of a highly charged zzso zzso from the protein zzso in zzso In the simulations the structure of water is not enhanced at the zzso protein surface, but instead is disrupted and devoid of zzso correlation beyond the first zzso zzso Comparing zzso of different zzso no clear trend toward the most polar zzso being more ordered is zzso In addition, comparison of the water residence times at zzso zzso positively charged, or zzso charged sites on the surface of zzso or zzso does not reveal pronounced or zzso zzso It is zzso however, that the local environment may considerably affect zzso residence zzso The implications of this work for the interpretation of the zzso effect are zzso
