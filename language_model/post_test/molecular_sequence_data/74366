zzso modifications zzso zzso structure and zzso A zzso zzso zzso library based on the first 21 zzso of zzso zzso was designed for systematic examination of proteins that interpret a zzso zzso The zzso library represented all permutations of most known modifications within the zzso tail of zzso zzso To determine its utility in a protein binding zzso the zzso library was screened with an zzso directed against zzso 1 of zzso Among the hits, 59 of 60 sequences were zzso at S1, while 30 of 30 of those selected from the zzso were zzso A zzso version of the library was then used to determine the binding specificity of the double zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Global linear zzso fitting of modifications from the identified peptides (40 hits and 34 zzso indicated that zzso of zzso was the primary zzso for zzso but that zzso and zzso of neighboring sites attenuated the zzso To validate the zzso screen, zzso zzso zzso was performed with 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from 1 zzso to 1 zzso and zzso the screening zzso The general approach should be useful for probing the specificity of any zzso zzso
