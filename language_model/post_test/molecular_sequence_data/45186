The accessory gene regulator zzso zzso a candidate system for the regulation of the production of zzso factors in zzso zzso has been zzso Using zzso zzso walking, we have obtained the first complete sequence zzso zzso of the accessory gene regulator zzso gene in this zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene has identified five open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The translated zzso contained zzso acid motifs characteristic of the response regulator and zzso protein zzso signal zzso of the classic zzso regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso zzso products amplified from DNA from 20 different zzso has facilitated detection of genetic variation in the putative zzso zzso zzso within the zzso gene of zzso zzso revealing the presence of at least three zzso specificity groups within this zzso zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso was supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso also revealed that the zzso zzso of the zzso system, zzso was regulated in an zzso manner in zzso zzso and demonstrated positive correlation with the zzso gene expression patterns of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was also dependent on self zzso zzso zzso self and zzso peptides were zzso on the basis of the novel zzso produced by zzso zzso which lack the zzso necessary to form the zzso ring in analogous peptides from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these synthetic zzso peptides indicated that self peptides led to zzso of zzso in support of the assumption that zzso of the zzso gene is initiated by zzso and zzso factors generated during bacterial zzso
