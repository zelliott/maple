zzso zzso 1 zzso a key zzso in the conversion of steroids into their respective zzso zzso plays a key role in some zzso zzso and is abundant in the liver, although it is also widely distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso is a zzso zzso factor involved in the progression of zzso zzso In the present paper, we report the zzso effect of zzso on human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso D or zzso blocked the zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso indicating that the increased level of zzso zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso and was dependent on de zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of the zzso gene by zzso analysis showed that the zzso to zzso region functioned as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that induction of zzso by zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso gene zzso site at zzso In addition, zzso of zzso was sufficient to zzso zzso promoter activity, and zzso of zzso with zzso small interfering zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence that zzso stimulates zzso expression through zzso of the zzso factor zzso thus suggesting the possibility that regulation of steroid metabolism by zzso represents a mechanism for high risk of zzso zzso in zzso
