We mapped expressed zzso sequences zzso corresponding to two human zzso heavy chain zzso beta heavy chain of the outer zzso arm and heavy chain zzso zzso zzso by using zzso cell hybrids and radiation hybrid zzso The zzso for the beta heavy chain of the outer zzso arm mapped to zzso region zzso and the zzso for zzso mapped to zzso Two zzso for zzso forms of deafness, zzso and zzso have previously been mapped to these two zzso zzso Including the gene for the zzso light chain, zzso we have mapped three different zzso genes near zzso for different forms of zzso zzso The hypothesis that zzso in some zzso genes are associated with zzso deafness should now be zzso
