An inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement was isolated from the zzso of sheep zzso Fast protein liquid zzso zzso and affinity zzso procedures for this sheep zzso protein zzso both yielded a pure protein with an apparent zzso of 19,000 under reducing and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein with zzso and zzso reduced the apparent zzso to 18,000 and 15,000 respectively, while treatment with zzso or zzso zzso C zzso did not affect the apparent zzso zzso was zzso on zzso and zzso but not on zzso and could partially be removed by zzso zzso zzso of the pure protein markedly reduced and zzso treatment abolished its zzso A zzso zzso zzso raised against sheep zzso protein zzso enhanced the zzso of sheep zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso inhibited complement after the stage of zzso zzso zzso protein sequence was obtained and was shown to be similar to that of human zzso All these features suggest that zzso is the sheep equivalent of human zzso Human zzso has been reported to be species selective in that it zzso complement from relatively few zzso However, zzso efficiently inhibited zzso of guinea-pig zzso by complement from a wide range of species tested indicating that it is a potent and zzso inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement zzso
