zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins resemble zzso zzso zzso but lack the defining zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein has been genetically implicated in zzso zzso DNA repair in zzso zzso We show that zzso forms a specific zzso complex with the zzso zzso and is required for the zzso assembly of zzso chains linked through zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain is zzso sensitive, and single, zzso and triple zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes display a comparable zzso These findings support a model in which an zzso complex assembles novel zzso chains for signaling in DNA repair, and they suggest that zzso proteins may act to increase diversity and selectivity in zzso zzso
