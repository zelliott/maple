zzso studies have identified associations between zzso in the zzso regulatory zzso zzso gene and a variety of human zzso zzso Its functional role in disease zzso however, remains zzso as studies in zzso mice have reached disparate conclusions regarding the importance of this zzso factor in type I zzso production and zzso zzso We identified a spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso exchange factor zzso of zzso 2 zzso that has arisen in at least a subset of circulating zzso mice and inadvertently been bred to zzso zzso expression of zzso but not zzso rescued defects in zzso zzso cell and zzso development, and zzso mice lacking the zzso in zzso exhibited normal zzso zzso cell and zzso development, largely intact type I zzso responses, and relatively normal zzso responses to viral zzso Thus, confirmation of the normal zzso zzso in circulating zzso mice is warranted, and our data may partly explain conflicting results in this zzso
