zzso carriers zzso form a highly zzso family involved in zzso transport across the inner zzso membrane in zzso In zzso zzso carriers, zzso form the most complex zzso with four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and several zzso zzso Here, we report the tissue distribution and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which displays unanticipated new zzso zzso proteins show higher zzso acid substitution rates than its closest zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression is restricted to male germ cells and regulated during zzso but unexpectedly its zzso is not limited to zzso zzso In mature zzso zzso is detected in the zzso sheath but in previous differentiation stages appears associated to zzso zzso which zzso with specific markers of the zzso body zzso in zzso round zzso and zzso cement zzso in zzso The origin of this zzso distribution was further investigated by transient expression in cell zzso zzso to male germ cells, in addition to zzso and zzso distribution, a fraction of zzso zzso cells display zzso zzso which exhibit zzso features as the zzso Our results indicate that different regions of zzso hinder its import into zzso and this apparently zzso the formation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This mechanism could be also operational in male germ cells and explain the incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso
