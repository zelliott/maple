zzso and cellular mechanisms underlying the sustained metal tolerance of zzso zzso are largely zzso Some of the main mechanisms involved in metal zzso appear to involve the zzso of metal zzso in the zzso with zzso compounds, such as zzso zzso or zzso We used an improved zzso liquid zzso method for the simultaneous measurement of zzso compounds from zzso and its derivatives zzso zzso to zzso compounds zzso We found that zzso and zzso contents increased when the zzso fungus zzso zzso was exposed to zzso An additional compound with a zzso molecular mass, most probably related to a zzso increased drastically in zzso exposed to zzso The relative lack of zzso and the presence of a putative zzso suggest that zzso zzso may use a different means to tolerate heavy metals, such as zzso than do their plant zzso
