To study the zzso of cerebral zzso zzso zzso organ cultures of canine zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso to 200 zzso Fluorescence zzso showed focal and zzso zzso beta binding to blood vessels affected by zzso at zzso zzso as low as 10 zzso The new A beta deposits appeared to be zzso and were localized to the middle and outer layers of zzso zzso zzso beta partially zzso with zzso E zzso as revealed by zzso zzso suggesting that A beta in zzso binds to zzso Young dogs or old dogs without zzso showed no deposition of zzso zzso Our results indicate that after initiation of zzso pathology, zzso zzso of soluble A beta are sufficient to sustain its further deposition and therefore the progression of zzso
