We described previously the isolation, by genetic selection, of a zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso that zzso zzso with zzso The single zzso acid change responsible for the zzso zzso was identified at zzso acid 235 in the translated zzso zzso The zzso called zzso has an zzso change, and studies with the zzso zzso gene product show it may zzso a number of presumably different zzso We have carried out extensive zzso searches that show zzso coli zzso zzso shares regions of zzso with other zzso zzso although little apparent similarity at the site of the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso motif implicated in zzso zzso formation, there are regions of zzso of zzso zzso with other zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso These include short stretches of zzso in sequences acting as a zzso zzso as well as zzso of some zzso zzso to a recently identified motif in zzso zzso our results show that zzso coli zzso zzso may share with other zzso zzso regions responsible for zzso zzso while other regions of the zzso of which the zzso zzso may be a zzso are responsible for zzso zzso
