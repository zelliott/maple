zzso improbable features in the model of the birch zzso structure zzso v zzso zzso entry zzso are faithfully reproduced in electron density generated with the deposited structure factors, but these structure factors themselves exhibit properties that are characteristic of data calculated from a simple model and are inconsistent with the data and error model obtained through experimental zzso The refinement of the zzso model against these structure factors leads to an zzso structure different from the deposited model with an zzso small R value zzso The abnormal refinement is compared with normal refinement of an zzso zzso structure of zzso v zzso zzso entry zzso A variety of zzso tools, including the application of zzso zzso zzso plots and zzso analysis are discussed as promising aids in zzso The examination of the zzso v zzso structure also cautions against the practice of indicating poorly defined protein chain zzso through zero zzso The recommendation to preserve zzso images is zzso
