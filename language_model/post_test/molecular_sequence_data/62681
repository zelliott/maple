zzso can switch the functional states of zzso zzso proteins by stretching them while exerting mechanical zzso Using steered molecular zzso we investigated how the mechanical stability of zzso zzso from the cell zzso protein zzso is affected by natural variations in their zzso acid zzso Despite remarkably similar zzso structures, zzso zzso share low sequence zzso zzso the sequence zzso for the same zzso module across multiple species is notably higher, suggesting that sequence zzso is functionally zzso Our studies find that the mechanical stability of zzso zzso can be tuned through zzso of just a few key zzso acids by altering access of water molecules to hydrogen bonds that break early in the unfolding zzso Furthermore, the zzso hierarchy of mechanical unfolding can be changed by environmental conditions, such as pH for zzso or by forming complexes with other zzso such as zzso binding to zzso
