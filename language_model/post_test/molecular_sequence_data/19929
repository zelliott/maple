The zzso zzso velvet zzso gene encodes a global regulator of gene expression controlling sexual development as well as secondary zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the major producer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two different disruption strains as well as the corresponding zzso were generated as a prelude to detailed functional zzso Northern zzso and quantitative real-time zzso clearly indicate that the zzso zzso zzso controls the zzso expression of six zzso C zzso zzso The most drastic reduction in expression is seen for zzso zzso the zzso zzso After 120 h of growth, the zzso transcript level is below zzso in both disruption strains compared to the wild zzso These zzso expression data are consistent with results from a comparative and zzso zzso liquid zzso analysis of zzso C zzso Compared to the recipient, both disruption strains have a zzso C zzso that is reduced by zzso In addition to its role in zzso C zzso zzso is involved in the zzso dependent zzso zzso In both disruption zzso zzso fragmentation is already observed after 48 h of growth, whereas in the recipient strain, zzso are not even detected before 96 h of zzso Finally, the two zzso strains show zzso of zzso tips on zzso zzso zzso Our findings will be significant for zzso processes that require a defined stage of cellular differentiation for optimal production of secondary zzso
