We have recently cloned and characterized a novel zinc zzso finger zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso has zzso activity and protects cells from zzso induced by metal zzso and zzso zzso During the course of zzso zzso we identified two forms of deletions of zzso zzso in colon and zzso zzso cell zzso The first form zzso consists of a 7 zzso deletion that results in a zzso and zzso the zzso finger zzso The second zzso consists of an zzso 48 zzso deletion that zzso 16 zzso acids in the protein but retains the zzso finger zzso zzso studies using stable zzso lines reveal that, like zzso zzso zzso retains zzso activity, whereas zzso shows no such zzso The results indicate that the zzso zinc zzso finger domain is required for zzso activity of zzso
