zzso zzso is recognized as an important pathogen in the lung infections of patients with zzso zzso An zzso zzso activity has been associated with increased resistance to zzso antibiotics in clinical zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we report the revised sequence of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and show that it belongs to the molecular class A zzso and exhibits a high degree of similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the DNA region directly upstream of the zzso coding sequence revealed an open reading frame zzso the zzso of which was oriented opposite to that of zzso and whose initiation was 130 zzso away from that of zzso Two potential zzso sites and two overlapping zzso and zzso promoter sequences were identified in the zzso zzso The predicted translation product of zzso was a zzso of 301 zzso acids with an estimated molecular size of zzso zzso The deduced zzso of zzso showed a high degree of similarity with zzso zzso zzso of class A and C zzso with identities of 59 and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso was predicted to include a zzso zzso which may bind the zzso motif identified in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was shown to be dependent upon the presence of zzso zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso coli zzso zzso resulted in a high zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the regulation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is similar to that observed in other class A and class C zzso that are under the control of a zzso transcribed zzso zzso
