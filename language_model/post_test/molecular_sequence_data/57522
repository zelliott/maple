We report the cloning of a highly zzso zzso gene on the human sex zzso A zzso clone was selected by zzso with a zzso clone from the zzso zzso zzso It encodes a previously characterized member of the zzso zzso family and plays a fundamental role in cellular energy zzso This zzso zzso is located approximately 1,300 zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso gene zzso and escapes zzso Interestingly, a zzso of zzso zzso maps to zzso and is subject to zzso These genes provide the first evidence of two closely related zzso zzso which show striking differences in their zzso zzso
