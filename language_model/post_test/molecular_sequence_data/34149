The removal of the neural tube in zzso zzso allows the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is normally zzso but the zzso limb zzso without nerves and becomes zzso after zzso The molecular basis for these tissue interactions is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously shown to rescue zzso of zzso limbs and to act as a growth factor for cultured limb zzso cells, is expressed throughout the zzso limb zzso and is zzso by zzso In an zzso zzso the level of AG protein remains high in the zzso throughout development and zzso but decreases after zzso following transplantation to a normal zzso zzso zzso also shows a fivefold difference in zzso zzso cells, which express AG zzso The persistently high expression of AG in the zzso cells of an zzso limb ensures that zzso is independent of the zzso These findings provide an explanation for this classical problem, and identify regulation of the zzso niche by zzso as a distinctive zzso mechanism that zzso the nerve dependence of limb zzso The absence of this regulation during zzso limb development might suggest that it evolved in relation to limb zzso
