We have characterized the structure of the human zzso gene for the 25 zzso zzso growth factor binding protein zzso as a first step toward understanding both the factors which regulate zzso zzso and also the evolution of the zzso growth factor binding zzso The zzso gene is present in the human zzso as a single copy which spans zzso zzso and contains four zzso zzso extension zzso the zzso cap site 165 base pairs zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the putative promoter region for zzso demonstrates characteristics consistent with those of many zzso zzso these include a consensus zzso box beginning 28 zzso zzso to the cap site and a consensus zzso promoter element beginning 72 zzso upstream from the cap zzso
