To characterize drug binding to the human zzso related gene zzso channel, a zzso approach zzso zzso experiments and a zzso study was zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso of the zzso channel that were assembled into a zzso with zzso diagonal zzso The binding affinities of three drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to a set of zzso channels were examined zzso to assess the involved zzso their number, and relative zzso zzso and 1 zzso with zzso zzso on adjacent zzso while zzso zzso with zzso zzso on zzso but not on zzso zzso zzso was involved in the binding of all three drugs, and zzso was found to be only involved in zzso and zzso The zzso models demonstrated that zzso and zzso interactions rather than zzso interaction play a key role in drug binding to the zzso zzso
