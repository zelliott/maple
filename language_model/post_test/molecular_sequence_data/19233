The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a chronic zzso disorder zzso characterized by fusion of various zzso partner genes to the 3' part of the zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso gene at zzso resulting in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity contained within zzso zzso is associated with a high risk of transformation to acute zzso leukemia zzso but the mechanisms underlying the disease progression are zzso In the present study, we have investigated a case of zzso harboring a zzso zzso as well as a zzso at the time of zzso zzso FISH and zzso analyses revealed that the zzso leads to a fusion gene consisting of the zzso part of zzso zzso zzso fused to repetitive sequences of a gene with unknown function on zzso 9, adding 70 zzso acids to zzso zzso zzso The zzso hence results in a zzso of zzso No point zzso were found in the other zzso zzso The most likely functional outcome of the zzso was zzso of zzso which thus may be one mechanism by which zzso zzso to zzso
