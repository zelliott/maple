zzso preparations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contain alpha and beta zzso which share zzso primary structures and a common zzso zzso with other members of the zzso zzso channel zzso Here, a beta zzso zzso was shown to zzso the zzso binding sites localized on alpha zzso from membrane extracts of both rat spinal zzso and zzso cells zzso with alpha and beta zzso Further, zzso of alpha zzso zzso by zzso a zzso blocker of zzso flow, was reduced 50- to zzso for zzso zzso receptors generated by zzso zzso zzso identified zzso within the second predicted zzso segment zzso of the beta zzso as major zzso of zzso zzso These data zzso the zzso segment in blocker binding to and lining of the zzso zzso zzso
