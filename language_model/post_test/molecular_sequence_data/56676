The zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso proteins were analyzed for their effect on zzso pairing of zzso circular DNA and zzso linear duplex DNA zzso As shown by other workers, joint zzso formation by zzso was inhibited by zzso coli zzso DNA binding protein zzso when it was added to zzso DNA before zzso This zzso effect was overcome by the addition of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso Both the rate and extent of joint zzso formation were restored to the zzso level observed when zzso was added after zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins had no effect on the conversion of joint molecules to final products and only appeared to stimulate an early step in the pairing zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso was not seen without zzso or when zzso was added after zzso zzso protein by itself inhibited reactions in zzso containing zzso and zzso and this zzso was overcome by the addition of zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso and possibly zzso help zzso overcome zzso by zzso and zzso zzso complexes as zzso
