A bacterial strain able to grow in pure culture with zzso as sole added carbon and energy source was isolated from zzso soil after successive enrichment cultures in a zzso growth zzso Initially, growth occurred in the form of a zzso at the interface between the zzso and zzso liquid zzso However, after a certain time, a transition occurred in the enrichment cultures, with growth occurring in suspension and a zzso increase in the rate of zzso zzso The strain responsible for zzso degradation in these cultures, named zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso sequencing as a novel zzso the closest relative in the databases being zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Both these strains clustered with members of the zzso zzso and zzso but could not be zzso assigned to either zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized in terms of its growth on zzso and other zzso and the zzso of zzso degradation and zzso zzso were zzso At an initial zzso concentration of zzso g zzso silicone oil, and an zzso phase ratio of zzso zzso was 50% zzso after 5 days incubation and zzso zzso after 35 zzso The protein content of cultures reached a maximum value of zzso zzso zzso zzso phase, corresponding to 92 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was 50% zzso after zzso weeks zzso zzso of the zzso was incorporated into cell biomass and zzso was found in the zzso culture zzso zzso zzso zzso also grew on zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was the preferred zzso with a doubling time of zzso zzso
