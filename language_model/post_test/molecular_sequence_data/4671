zzso nuclear import is a central event in genetic transformation of plant cells by zzso Presumably, the zzso transport intermediate is a zzso DNA zzso associated with two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso which most likely mediate the transport zzso While zzso zzso coats the transported zzso DNA, zzso is zzso attached to its zzso zzso To better understand the mechanism of zzso action, a cellular zzso for zzso was identified and its zzso gene cloned from zzso The identified zzso designated zzso specifically bound zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso interaction was absolutely dependent on the zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal sequence of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso to zzso and animal nuclear zzso zzso proteins belonging to the zzso alpha zzso Indeed, zzso efficiently rescued a zzso zzso defective for nuclear zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically zzso transport of zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
