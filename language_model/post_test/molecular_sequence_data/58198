The zzso gene products of zzso zzso leukemia virus are required for binding and entry of the virus into the target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed throughout the zzso gene of zzso zzso leukemia zzso Twenty of the zzso were located in the surface protein zzso and the remaining thirteen were located in the zzso protein zzso The viability of the viruses containing these zzso gene zzso was determined by performing transient zzso and screening for the release of reverse zzso Eleven viable zzso were isolated, nine in zzso and two in zzso Three of the viable zzso were temperature zzso Four of the viable zzso were clustered in the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso gene products of zzso cell lines which produced viable virus were zzso Our results indicated two regions of zzso important for the stability of the zzso zzso and one region important for the interaction of the zzso gene products with the viral zzso
