zzso zzso heavy chain class switch zzso has been studied at the DNA level in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso A switch zzso region of about 5 zzso has been identified in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain locus in zzso S zzso contains 23 repeats approximately 150 zzso zzso Each repeat consists of internal shorter repeats and zzso zzso such as zzso which they share with zzso switch zzso A deletion of the zzso gene and the joining of the S regions of zzso and zzso occurs in B cells expressing zzso one of the two zzso zzso in zzso S zzso shows no sequence zzso with S zzso and is characterized by 16 and 121 zzso repeats and a high frequency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso S regions are AT rich and not zzso rich like zzso S zzso zzso occurs, most of the time, at positions zzso where a zzso DNA folding program predicts the transition from a stem to a loop zzso This feature is zzso in most zzso switch junctions which points to the general existence and involvement of zzso at one step of the determination of the zzso zzso The zzso nature of the switch regions is therefore linked to its structure rather than to its base zzso the repetitive occurrence of zzso being essential at creating many zzso
