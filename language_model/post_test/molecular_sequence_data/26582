zzso zzso and plants have zzso pathways for the zzso of nitrogen present in zzso zzso In zzso pneumoniae, the genes responsible for the zzso of zzso ring nitrogen are distributed in three separated zzso We characterized the gene cluster involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso to zzso The functional assignments of zzso as an zzso zzso and of zzso as a regulator involved in the control of zzso zzso were assessed zzso Gene zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso family that mediates the regulation of this system by zzso In this study, the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter and to the zzso zzso region containing the divergent promoter for these genes was evidenced by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso released the zzso zzso from its target operators whereas other zzso intermediate zzso such as zzso and zzso failed to induce complex zzso zzso alignment of the four zzso identified operators identified zzso as the consensus motif recognized by the zzso zzso
