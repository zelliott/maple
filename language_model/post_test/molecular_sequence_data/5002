We have previously shown that a synthetic zzso zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso of human alpha zzso II adopted an zzso structure and formed a stable zzso zzso in solution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we studied two zzso zzso and zzso which are related to zzso but which have a double substitution zzso zzso and a deletion of the 15 zzso zzso zzso The peptides were studied for their ability to form zzso structures, coiled zzso and to inhibit zzso II zzso In combining circular zzso zzso with zzso prediction for zzso structures, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso like its parent zzso zzso adopts an zzso structure and can zzso into zzso while zzso is completely devoid of such zzso zzso only the zzso and zzso peptides act as good zzso of zzso II in various in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso has a stronger zzso potential and behaves as a much more potent inhibitor (5 zzso versus 200 zzso compared to the zzso zzso All these data strongly suggest that the greater zzso effect demonstrated by the zzso zzso is related to its higher ability to form a stable zzso zzso which in turn better recognizes its zzso zzso segment in zzso zzso Finally, we propose that the zzso and the zzso peptides could interfere with the zzso activity of zzso II in zzso its zzso or zzso zzso Such peptides may serve as useful models for developing simpler and more specific zzso of zzso zzso
