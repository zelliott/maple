Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been isolated from an zzso zzso strain that grows on zzso or zzso as sole carbon and energy zzso Designated as zzso and zzso they zzso proteins composed of 314 and zzso zzso zzso whose deduced sequences indicate that they have approximately zzso identity, whereas their zzso and zzso regions have no sequences in zzso This may explain their different zzso and pH zzso zzso zzso raised against an zzso zzso zzso or the whole zzso protein were used to establish their zzso and differential expression patterns upon bacterial growth in zzso or zzso The zzso protein zzso was induced by both zzso and zzso though with different zzso whereas the zzso product zzso was zzso produced at low levels that increased only during growth in the presence of zzso
