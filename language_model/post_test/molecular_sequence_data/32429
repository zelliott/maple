The nuclear zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the alternative zzso and is induced when the standard zzso respiratory chain of zzso is zzso To study elements of the zzso responsible for alternative zzso zzso we generated a series of zzso in the region upstream from the zzso structural gene and transformed the zzso into an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso on media containing zzso A, which zzso the zzso electron transport chain so that only cells expressing alternative zzso will zzso Using this functional in zzso zzso we identified an alternative zzso induction motif zzso that is required for efficient expression of zzso The zzso sequence consists of two zzso repeats separated by 7 zzso and is similar to sequences known to be bound by members of the zzso zzso cluster family of zzso zzso The zzso motif appears to be zzso in other species found in the order zzso
