In several zzso the genes for the major DNA binding protein zzso a putative assembly zzso the zzso B zzso and the viral DNA zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso two members of this gene block, pol zzso Clark, zzso and zzso 1991, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1992, zzso zzso 66, zzso have been zzso Here the two other zzso genes are zzso the gene zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a putative assembly zzso Like in human zzso zzso the genes order is zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is expressed first in the early phase, whereas the zzso zzso zzso is a late zzso The open reading frame of the zzso gene has the capacity of zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is translated into a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of the predicted proteins of zzso with the respective proteins of zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso reveals a striking zzso ranging from zzso zzso 50% zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso sequence and from zzso zzso 51% zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso These results establish the close relationship of the two zzso and underline the usefulness of the zzso model for studies on the biology of the zzso zzso
