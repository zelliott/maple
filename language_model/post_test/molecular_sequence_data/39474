The zzso zzso encompasses the zzso zzso between zzso zzso in domain IV of the zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso The interaction of two local zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso has been studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso a neutral zzso exhibits stronger interaction with zzso than zzso a charged zzso zzso average chemical shifts, zzso show that zzso affects zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso slightly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso near the zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods confirmed the stability of the zzso binding and the existence of two binding sites for zzso Even considering that the approach of studying the zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso has an inherently limited zzso our data strongly support the existence of multiple LA binding sites in the zzso zzso as suggested in the zzso In addition, we consider that LA can bind to the zzso zzso with diverse binding modes and strength since this zzso is part of the zzso for the zzso gate zzso zzso for devising new functional studies, aiming to better understand zzso channel functionality as well as the various zzso of LA pharmacological activity are proposed in this zzso
