The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned in zzso coli and zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso of 544 zzso acids and was preceded by the incomplete zzso zzso lacking its zzso The sequence of the derived zzso acids was zzso identical to that of zzso zzso zzso identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso identical to that of zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso protected zzso zzso from irreversible zzso at a high temperature and the addition of zzso was essential for zzso of the zzso The addition of zzso coli zzso increased recovery of the zzso activity, indicating that zzso zzso could function in coordination with zzso coli zzso
