zzso zzso zzso chains interact with various growth and differentiation factors and zzso and the most interactions occur on the specific regions of the chains with certain zzso sequences and zzso zzso Here we generated a library of zzso by zzso methods by using zzso HS zzso and HS zzso and we have made a systematic investigation of the specific binding structures for various zzso growth zzso An zzso zzso zzso was prepared by partial zzso zzso from completely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared by zzso transferring one to three zzso groups and one to three zzso groups per zzso respectively, to zzso Another zzso containing 3 units of zzso was prepared also from zzso This zzso library was subjected to affinity zzso for interactions with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor, bone zzso protein 6, and vascular zzso growth factor, zzso Based upon differences in the affinity to those zzso the growth factors could be classified roughly into five groups: group 1 needed zzso but not zzso zzso group 2 needed zzso but not zzso zzso group 3 had the affinity to both zzso and zzso but preferred zzso zzso zzso growth zzso group 4 required both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and group 5 hardly bound to any zzso zzso bone zzso protein 6, and vascular zzso growth zzso The approach using the zzso library may be useful to define specific structures required for binding to various zzso zzso zzso with the high affinity to zzso and zzso had the activity to release them, respectively, from their complexes with zzso Thus, the library may provide new zzso to specifically regulate zzso of the growth factors to zzso
