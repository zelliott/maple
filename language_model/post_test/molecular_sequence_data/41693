zzso exposure to zzso zzso is known to cause altered immune functions and increased zzso to zzso disease in zzso In the current study, we investigated the effect of prenatal exposure to zzso on zzso differentiation involving zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure caused zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso To examine the mechanism underlying zzso regulation of zzso and zzso we performed zzso zzso using T cells zzso with zzso reporter zzso containing full-length zzso or zzso zzso There was significant zzso induction in the presence of zzso or zzso promoters after zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated the presence of several zzso motifs on both zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso factors were zzso zzso zzso element zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso and zzso zzso motifs on the zzso promoter, as well as zzso zzso and zzso motifs on the zzso promoter, showed binding affinity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to verify the binding affinity of zzso motifs of zzso or zzso promoters with zzso zzso There was shift in mobility of zzso zzso or zzso of both zzso and zzso in the presence of nuclear proteins from zzso cells, and the shift was specific to zzso because these zzso failed to shift their mobility in the presence of nuclear proteins from zzso zzso Together, the current study demonstrates that prenatal exposure to zzso triggers significant zzso in zzso molecules expressed on zzso which may affect zzso differentiation and cause long-term effects on the immune zzso
