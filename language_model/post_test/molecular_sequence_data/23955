We have cloned and expressed the zzso gene of the zzso zzso system and have zzso the resulting controller zzso protein to zzso The protein sequence shows a zzso motif typical of that found in many zzso zzso zzso is found to form a zzso of zzso zzso zzso equilibrium experiments show that the zzso zzso into zzso at low zzso with a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso I and zzso III zzso were used to determine the zzso zzso site, which is found approximately 30 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The intact zzso binds zzso to a 35 zzso zzso of DNA containing the zzso binding site with a zzso constant of 5-6 zzso as judged both by gel zzso analysis and by surface zzso zzso although in practice the affinity for DNA is dominated by protein zzso as DNA binding by the zzso is zzso The location of the zzso upstream of both zzso and zzso suggests that zzso may act as a positive regulator of the expression of both zzso and could act as a molecular switch that is critically dependent on the zzso for the zzso zzso Moreover, the structure and location of the zzso binding site with respect to the putative zzso box preceding the zzso suggests a possible mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso
