zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have suggested that both the alpha and gamma zzso but not the beta zzso contribute to the zzso binding zzso We took advantage of the different pharmacological properties zzso by the inclusion of different gamma zzso in the zzso zzso to identify zzso acids zzso and zzso as key zzso of the zzso binding zzso zzso was required for high affinity binding of the zzso site zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso This zzso acid was, however, required for zzso zzso by zzso as well as other zzso site zzso In contrast, zzso was required for high affinity binding of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso and did not affect zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso and zzso into the appropriate positions of zzso was not sufficient to zzso high affinity for the zzso site zzso zzso These data show that zzso and zzso are necessary for high affinity binding of a number of zzso site zzso Although most previous studies have focused on the contribution of the alpha zzso we demonstrated a critical role for the gamma zzso at the zzso binding site, indicating that this zzso site is located at the interface of these two zzso Furthermore, zzso is zzso to zzso which has been previously shown to be a key zzso of the zzso binding site, suggesting a conservation of motifs between different zzso binding sites on the zzso zzso
