By zzso zzso cloning we have identified a novel constituent of chicken cartilage termed zzso This constituent is zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso whose expression is restricted to zzso zzso The predicted protein is composed of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 49 zzso It contains a single von zzso factor zzso domain, four zzso growth zzso repeats and an zzso region which may induce the formation of zzso via a zzso The primary structure is similar to that of zzso which is also expressed in a zzso zzso This similarity suggests that the genes for the two proteins may have evolved from a common zzso by gene zzso
