The severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus encodes several zzso zzso that are unusual for zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso that zzso zzso 3' of zzso We solved the structure of a zzso inactive zzso version of zzso which was zzso as a zzso The structure contains zzso flexibility in the active site of each zzso zzso in the active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed zzso to cleave at zzso whereas zzso of zzso 345 rendered zzso able to cleave at zzso as well as zzso zzso that targeted the zzso involved in zzso interactions generally resulted in the formation of zzso inactive zzso The zzso zzso were mapped by a method linking zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso substitution of several zzso in the zzso portion of zzso did not affect zzso formation but decreased the affinity of zzso binding and reduced zzso zzso This suggests a model for zzso zzso interaction with zzso
