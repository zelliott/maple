zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso protein implicated in a variety of biological events including zzso and zzso Further, this protein has the ability to form a complex with several cellular proteins which are important for cell proliferation including the zzso factor, zzso zzso has a modular structure highlighted by alternating three basic aromatic class I and two zzso zzso class II repeats in the central region of the zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso suppresses proliferation of a variety of transformed and tumor cells including human zzso By utilizing various deletion zzso of zzso in colony formation zzso we identified the region spanning the first class II repeat zzso zzso and the second class I repeat zzso zzso of zzso which participate in growth zzso action of zzso zzso from protein zzso experiments using the synthetic peptides representing zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in fusion with the zzso rich domain of zzso zzso revealed cellular zzso and nuclear appearance of the zzso fusion zzso after 2 h and its detection in zzso up to 24 h after zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited 41 and zzso decrease, respectively, in zzso zzso these results illustrate the efficacy of zzso in suppressing zzso cell growth and provide evidence for the potential use of this protein and its zzso in blocking proliferation of tumor zzso
