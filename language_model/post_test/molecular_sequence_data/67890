In zzso and in zzso results are presented demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso from the zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso is a principal zzso scavenger of zzso in this zzso This zzso contains the characteristic zzso zzso active zzso No other zzso domain has been zzso for zzso zzso However, we found that zzso zzso also zzso a zzso site whose zzso and zzso properties resemble those in so-called zzso zzso comparisons of the wild type and engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that three of the zzso zzso zzso to those in zzso sites of zzso zzso whereas the fourth zzso zzso zzso has no counterpart in zzso zzso or in any other known zzso zzso zzso modeling is consistent with iron zzso of the zzso zzso zzso across zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was isolated with only a small percentage of zzso zzso However, quantitative formation of stable zzso sites was readily achieved by exposing the zzso protein to an iron salt, a zzso reducing agent and zzso The zzso status and iron occupancy of the zzso zzso zzso sites could, thus, reflect zzso zzso status, particularly during periods of zzso zzso
