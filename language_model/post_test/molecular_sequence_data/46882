zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso family and behave as cell zzso zzso The mouse zzso contains two very similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the human and rat zzso contain only one zzso zzso A zzso zzso was previously identified as an alternative zzso for the mouse coronavirus mouse zzso zzso This zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain and a zzso tail of five zzso zzso In this report, we have examined whether the zzso gene can express other zzso in different mouse zzso We found only one other zzso which has a long zzso tail of 73 zzso zzso The long zzso of the zzso protein is highly similar to that of the zzso zzso The zzso protein is expressed in low amounts in kidney and in a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso specific to zzso detected a zzso zzso which is expressed at the cell surface of these zzso zzso was found by zzso in smooth muscle layers of the zzso the zzso in gut zzso cells and in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies showed that, in contrast with zzso the zzso zzso was not directly involved in zzso zzso However, this protein is found in the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso and in cells involved in immune zzso This suggests that the zzso protein represents a distinctive member of the zzso family; its unusual expression patterns in mouse zzso and the unique functions it may be fulfilling may provide novel clues about the multiple functions zzso by a common zzso protein in humans and zzso
