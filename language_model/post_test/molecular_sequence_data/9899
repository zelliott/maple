A conditional zzso zzso for zzso was generated in mice through a one step zzso cell selection procedure by zzso the zzso promoter and zzso 1 and 2 with zzso zzso The zzso cells were used to create zzso mice, which were then used to produce mice zzso for the zzso conditional zzso or zzso zzso Although the zzso cassette was retained in the promoter, the zzso mice produced levels of zzso transcripts similar to that seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso to transgenic lines of mice expressing the zzso gene under control of the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso in all zzso examined from mice that inherited the zzso had underwent complete zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso even in those mice that did not inherit the zzso zzso indicating the zzso occurs at an early stage of development prior to germ cell zzso Thus the zzso mice can be used for ubiquitous gene zzso in zzso The data also suggest a novel simplified strategy for using the zzso system in zzso in which a single zzso cell and line of mice can be used to create mice carrying either a zzso or conditional zzso zzso
