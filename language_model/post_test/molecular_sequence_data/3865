zzso proteins are potential zzso zzso zzso that are essential for DNA transfer in bacterial zzso They are thought to mediate interactions between the zzso zzso and the mating pair formation zzso zzso zzso proteins also function as essential components of type IV zzso systems of several bacterial pathogens such as zzso zzso Here we present the zzso characterization of three members of the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These proteins were found to have a pronounced tendency to form zzso and were shown to bind DNA without sequence zzso Standard zzso zzso indicated that these zzso proteins do not possess zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance was used to demonstrate an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that zzso is a zzso protein with zzso N and C zzso and a short zzso domain close to the N zzso We predict that zzso inner membrane protein zzso forms a zzso A model suggesting that the zzso binds to the zzso pore via zzso and zzso interactions is zzso
