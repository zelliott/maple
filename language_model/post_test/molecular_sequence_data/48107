Recent studies from our laboratory have found that a root zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is present on the root surface, binds zzso zzso factor and has zzso zzso To assess the broader significance of this zzso zzso zzso we have cloned a second related zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as related zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from zzso zzso a zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso were aligned with one another and with the sequences of other zzso from plants, animals, zzso and zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso has closely related zzso only in other zzso while zzso is more closely related to zzso sequences from zzso zzso We also show that the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso binding zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso may represent a special class of zzso that arose by gene zzso and subsequent zzso
