In the present study, the zzso properties of the nitrogen fixation gene cluster of zzso zzso a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The cluster consisted of zzso genes in the same orientation in the order zzso ( 1 ) , zzso ( 2 ) , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as detected zzso An open reading frame zzso preceding these genes was revealed by further zzso The zzso was zzso with downstream zzso genes in a single zzso transcript, the zzso start site zzso was located upstream of the zzso and a putative promoter was identified 10 zzso preceding the zzso Unlike most zzso which have a zzso zzso promoter, the promoter was similar to the zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso had no zzso zzso in DNA databases, and the highest level of identity zzso at zzso acid zzso was found with zzso a positive regulatory gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to the regulatory mechanism of the hut zzso in zzso zzso it is conceivable that the zzso product interacts with the zzso structure located downstream of the zzso during zzso condition and prevents zzso zzso thus, the zzso continues into the zzso structural zzso
