The zzso family zzso factors zzso and zzso are expressed in developing zzso zzso We show that enforced expression of full-length zzso in zzso zzso results in a profound suppression of immature zzso zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso This effect arises from zzso or zzso repression of zzso zzso and is independent of positively selecting zzso zzso is able to repress zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in mature zzso T zzso zzso zzso repression is independent of association with the zzso zzso or zzso Two zzso are required for complete zzso zzso zzso These are contained within zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter region contains the nuclear zzso targeting zzso which is highly zzso among zzso family zzso factors across zzso The presence of the nuclear zzso targeting sequence is required for zzso zzso repression, suggesting that zzso zzso factors are stabilized on the zzso zzso via association with the nuclear zzso
