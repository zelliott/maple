Many proteins contain zzso regions under zzso conditions and lack specific three-dimensional zzso These are referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein of approximately 80 zzso acids and has a molecular mass of approximately zzso It is enriched in charged zzso acids and has a small number of zzso zzso It has a high proportion of zzso zzso but has at least two zzso four) zzso zzso forming one (or zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions that zzso some zzso However, zzso behaves like an zzso It appears to be universally distributed in zzso zzso organisms and has recently been detected in a zzso The best studied role of zzso is its regulation of the Calvin cycle responsible for CO2 zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with two key Calvin cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso of this complex, induced by the zzso state of zzso allows the Calvin cycle to be inactive in the dark and active in the zzso zzso is zzso and interacts with other zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso It also plays other roles in plant metabolism such as protecting zzso from zzso and scavenging metal zzso such as copper and nickel, and it is also linked to stress zzso Thus zzso seems to be involved in many functions in zzso cells and behaves like a jack of all trades as well as being a master of the Calvin zzso
