Toward the prevention of zzso we have used zzso zzso zzso platform to identify gene targets involved in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso library of unique hairpin zzso with zzso zzso binding sequences to cleave unique zzso zzso thereby decreasing translation of the zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso cell line a cell based survival selection zzso was designed with zzso or zzso as an induction signal for zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso zzso library, and then exposed to 20 zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso to induce cell zzso Surviving cells were zzso their DNA isolated, and the zzso rescued by zzso for zzso into fresh zzso After several rounds of selection and zzso rescue we have identified individual zzso that protect zzso cells from zzso induced zzso Three of the cellular targets of these zzso sequence tags have been zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso screens have also been used to gain insight into the pathways involved by identifying additional players involved in these zzso These target genes may also serve as therapeutic targets for development of drugs for zzso and Parkinson's zzso
