zzso translation initiation factor 5 zzso zzso zzso of zzso bound to a 40 S zzso initiation complex with the subsequent joining of a 60 S zzso zzso to form an 80 S initiation zzso The zzso gene that encodes zzso designated zzso has been isolated and expressed in zzso coli to yield a zzso active zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene that maps on zzso zzso XVI and is essential for cell zzso The gene contains an zzso open reading frame that encodes a protein of calculated zzso zzso in close agreement with the apparent molecular weight of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the gene reveals several interesting zzso First, the presence of two zzso zzso start sites located 51 base pairs apart suggests the possibility that two zzso differing by an zzso extension of 17 zzso zzso could be generated from the zzso gene via differential zzso zzso This would explain the presence, in zzso cell zzso of two forms of zzso differing in molecular weight by about zzso Second, the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso contains sequence motifs characteristic of proteins of the zzso zzso
