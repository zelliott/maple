A zzso motif within the M protein of zzso zzso virus zzso functions as a zzso domain zzso however, zzso activity has yet to be associated with a downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso and/or zzso motif were recovered by reverse zzso and examined for growth zzso plaque size, and budding efficiency by electron zzso zzso indicate that unlike the zzso zzso the zzso motif alone does not possess zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and zzso sequences into the zzso region of M protein rescued budding of a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
