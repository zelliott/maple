zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has three zzso proteins in its predicted zzso signal zzso zzso zzso proteins contain both zzso and zzso zzso To determine the function of these zzso we developed a zzso diffusion method that would zzso bacterial direction change without needing to define particular zzso to deal with the many zzso that swimming zzso zzso zzso We then zzso zzso that had each zzso gene deleted individually and found that the zzso of each zzso differed substantially from zzso and the other zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed smooth swimming zzso consistent with decreased cellular zzso similar to a zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso had the opposite effect and the zzso cells appeared to change direction zzso Additional analysis showed that the zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso as compared to the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was less extreme compared to that seen in the zzso diffusion model, suggesting that the zzso zzso are able to partially compensate for their defects under some zzso Each zzso zzso zzso had defects in mouse colonization that ranged from severe to modest, consistent with a role in zzso These studies thus show that the zzso zzso zzso proteins each differently affect swimming zzso
