The high mobility group zzso proteins are zzso zzso proteins that participate in diverse nuclear activities including zzso structure and gene zzso We previously studied the zzso of the zzso zzso protein and its role in zzso regulation during zzso zzso zzso Here, we extended our study and showed that a strong binding of zzso to zzso DNA requires at least three zzso zzso two motifs showed a significant reduction whereas a single motif was not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso sites situated between zzso and zzso were strongly zzso by a zzso zzso no in zzso zzso is evident for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced its binding to zzso DNA in zzso The zzso zzso protein fused to zzso was localized in the nucleus of transgenic zzso plants tending to concentrate within the zzso zzso to the zzso was zzso by the zzso portion of the protein containing the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso on its zzso zzso domain by the human zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso function and that its role may be regulated zzso by zzso and zzso
