The zzso zzso zzso Earle zzso more than 300 small zzso zzso worldwide, predominantly described from the Northern zzso The zzso of species and zzso units zzso has been based on zzso and, to some extent, ecological zzso In this study we have analyzed nuclear zzso zzso and ITS sequences to reveal zzso zzso and the zzso placement of zzso among the zzso zzso zzso from 36 northern zzso zzso species and 19 other zzso zzso were zzso some of them obtained from zzso Our results, received from zzso and distance methods, strongly suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso analysis shows that zzso is composed of three or four separate zzso main zzso In addition, a few species cluster together with other zzso zzso The same groups are recognized in the ITS tree and they zzso roughly to previously recognized zzso or sections in zzso With high support our zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a zzso zzso and that zzso and one of the zzso lineages zzso are sister zzso The analyses further indicate that the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso could be referred to a strongly zzso family zzso which zzso largely to the family as circumscribed by zzso zzso Our results affirm that zzso characters often are highly zzso in the zzso At the present stage formal zzso consequences or zzso changes are not zzso
