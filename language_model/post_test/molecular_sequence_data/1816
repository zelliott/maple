The zzso zzso channel is currently one of the few membrane proteins where functional roles have been mapped onto specific segments of zzso Although high-resolution structures of the zzso portions of three bacterial zzso channels, the zzso domain and the zzso zzso are available, their relative spatial arrangement in zzso channels remains a matter of ongoing zzso zzso microscopic images of the six zzso zzso zzso channel have been reconstructed at up to 18 A resolution, revealing that the zzso domain zzso and is suspended below the zzso zzso However, the resolution of these images is insufficient to reveal the location of the third piece of the puzzle, the zzso ball zzso We have used the zzso interactions observed in a series of zzso channels to establish that an assembled zzso domain restricts access to the zzso face of the channel, suggesting that the zzso zzso and zzso may be confined in the space between the zzso domain and the zzso portion of the zzso
