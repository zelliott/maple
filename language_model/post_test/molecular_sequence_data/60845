The expression of zzso coding for zzso releasing hormone zzso was estimated in the rat brain in two animal models of zzso seizures, evoked by systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (12 zzso zzso As shown by an in zzso zzso study, after zzso both zzso and zzso zzso profoundly increased the zzso zzso level in the zzso zzso After zzso the zzso zzso level was back to control zzso zzso rats showed an elevated level of zzso in the zzso zzso frontal and zzso zzso after 24 and zzso whereas in the zzso and zzso the zzso level was raised after zzso zzso In the zzso zzso levels was lowered after 3 and zzso and returned to the control after zzso zzso zzso also elevated the zzso level after zzso in the majority of the above structures, except for the zzso and zzso where no changes were found at any time zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso decreased the zzso value of zzso receptors in the zzso and zzso after 3 and zzso respectively, and had no effect on the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso lowered the zzso of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso only, and decreased zzso values in the zzso zzso and frontal zzso These data showed that zzso and zzso zzso enhanced likewise zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on the other hand, they differed with respect to zzso and zzso changes in zzso tissue levels and zzso zzso These differences may have functional significance in zzso control mechanism of the seizure activity in these two models of zzso zzso
