zzso is a crucial zzso factor for the development and function of zzso regulatory T cells zzso which play a key role in preventing zzso diseases and maintaining zzso tolerance in zzso However, the knowledge of zzso and its regulation in zzso is zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso was cloned from Nile zzso and zzso The full length zzso of Nile zzso zzso contained a zzso of 104 zzso a zzso of 239 zzso and an open reading frame of zzso zzso The putative zzso contained a zzso zinc finger domain, a zzso head domain and a zzso zzso domain with a consensus of zzso which are typical motifs of a zzso The highest zzso expression of zzso was observed in the zzso with moderate expression in the head zzso zzso zzso liver and zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso and zzso led to a significant increase of zzso zzso expression at 6 and zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation with zzso had no effect during the sampling zzso After injecting zzso cells of live zzso zzso into adult female Nile zzso the zzso expression of zzso significantly increased in the zzso and zzso at zzso while unchanged in the zzso In all the zzso zzso a clearly zzso of zzso expression was detected at zzso after the second zzso These results suggest that zzso might be involved into zzso zzso and immune responses as reported in zzso Meanwhile, the correlation between the expression profile of zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso concentration was investigated by real-time zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso could regulate the expression of zzso in the zzso and kidney but not in the zzso This work will help future investigations into zzso cells and extend our understanding of interactions between sex hormones and immune related molecules in zzso
