As many zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in various tumors, a new type of zzso smart delivery system zzso zzso that could be zzso by zzso was previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso drug zzso zzso 2006, 7 zzso zzso zzso we designed zzso fluorescent zzso by introducing a zzso component zzso zzso zzso to the core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that these zzso could detect zzso activity by optical imaging in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso 2007, 18 zzso zzso Here, we further extend our studies to the structural responses of these zzso precursors zzso In the presence of a model zzso the zzso zzso fragments were released from the zzso that contributed to zzso zzso zzso the remaining zzso zzso were mechanically driven to transform into zzso networking of zzso size zzso These unique zzso changes, together with the optical property, may have considerable biomedical applications as diagnostic sensors for specific zzso or dual systemic and functional delivery zzso to target zzso zzso
