zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso critical for energy metabolism and induction of zzso zzso whose exact role in normal zzso remains zzso Upon reduction with zzso zzso zzso zzso and forms tight, zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso that are proposed to be functionally zzso To obtain a deeper insight into zzso relations and zzso mechanism of this vitally important zzso we determined the X-ray structures of oxidized and zzso forms of naturally folded zzso zzso zzso Our structures reveal that zzso with the zzso zzso is stabilized by zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of multiple aromatic zzso in the zzso domain, likely serving as an electron zzso zzso and zzso an extensive zzso network involving zzso a key zzso that zzso a zzso switch to directly interact with and zzso orient the zzso for charge zzso Via the zzso zzso zzso changes in the active site are transmitted to the surface, promoting zzso zzso and restricting access to a primary nuclear zzso signal through which the zzso form is transported to the zzso zzso findings agree with zzso data and support the hypothesis that both normal and zzso functions of zzso are controlled by zzso
