Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso and some of these genes have been used for the identification of bacteria by zzso chain reaction zzso Using 6 strains of zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso the relationship was examined between the presence of five zzso genes and actual zzso to mice in terms of 50% lethal dose zzso bacterial viability in the organ of infected mice and the zzso growth in cultured zzso None of the five genes could be amplified by zzso in all the zzso zzso strains and they were actually zzso to zzso All zzso zzso strains were shown to be virulent and to have intact zzso genes except for the strain zzso This particular strain was revealed to be zzso and defective in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso It was suggested that zzso detection of genes zzso zzso or zzso may not be sufficient to detect virulent strains of zzso zzso It appeared that the ability to produce zzso O zzso which is zzso by zzso was critical for the expression of zzso regardless of the amount of zzso zzso
