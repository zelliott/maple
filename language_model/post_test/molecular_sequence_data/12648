A 500 zzso molecular dynamics simulation of zzso coli zzso zzso in the presence of explicit water molecules has been carried out to aid in the interpretation of zzso zzso backbone model free parameters and X-ray zzso values of the free zzso Both experimental techniques have revealed unusual structural and dynamic features of the zzso Atomic fluctuations zzso and zzso motions of the backbone zzso bonds zzso zzso zzso from the simulation are compared with results obtained from zzso zzso agreement is obtained between the zzso and X-ray zzso whereas the agreement between the zzso and zzso generalized order parameters is as good as quantitative for most zzso zzso for significant zzso the physical basis and the plausible biological consequences of the observed protein dynamics are zzso
