zzso zzso zzso channels are inhibited by multiple zzso hormones via the protein zzso C zzso zzso However, the molecular zzso for zzso zzso remain zzso To identify the zzso sites, zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso Following channel zzso by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso currents but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso had similar zzso Using zzso zzso two critical protein zzso for the zzso channel zzso were zzso The zzso N zzso of zzso was necessary for channel zzso Because there was no zzso zzso site in the zzso region, our results suggest its potential involvement in channel zzso The zzso C zzso of zzso was crucial where there are several consensus zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso moderately but zzso Combined zzso of these zzso had greater zzso The channel zzso was almost completely abolished when 5 of them were jointly zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that 4 of the zzso zzso were necessary for the zzso zzso incorporation into the zzso zzso zzso Thus, a motif containing four zzso repeats is identified in the zzso zzso underlying the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The presence of the zzso motif in zzso but not in its close relative zzso suggests that the vascular zzso channel may have undergone evolutionary zzso allowing it to be regulated by a variety of zzso hormones and zzso
