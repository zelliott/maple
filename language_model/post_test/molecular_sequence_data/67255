zzso zzso zzso is a newly identified second form of zzso responsible for zzso synthesis in the brain and has been increasingly implicated as a contributor to the zzso of various psychiatric zzso In this study, we have identified the constellation of zzso in zzso monkey zzso and investigated zzso association as well as gene expression effects of specific zzso zzso DNA was obtained from 247 zzso zzso among which 24 had been previously examined for plasma cortisol level, zzso suppression, and combined zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso junctions and approximately 2 zzso of the zzso region zzso of zzso were identified by zzso We identified 17 single zzso zzso zzso including two that are zzso of zzso change zzso and zzso respectively), two zzso repeats, one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso axis activity, especially zzso which was zzso correlated with plasma cortisol level in the morning only zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso showed that the zzso zzso and zzso had a profound effect on in zzso gene zzso zzso these investigations revealed that zzso in zzso of zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso axis function, presumably by affecting levels of zzso zzso
