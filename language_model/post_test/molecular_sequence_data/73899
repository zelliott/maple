The recent identification of genes zzso zzso zzso has opened new possibilities for the development of cancer vaccines designed to cause the rejection of established zzso To develop a zzso animal model for evaluating zzso vaccines in cancer therapy, the zzso zzso of the human melanoma zzso zzso and zzso which were specifically recognized by zzso zzso from patients with melanoma, were cloned and zzso from a zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso The open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso acids with zzso and zzso identity to the respective human zzso zzso of the DNA sequences of the zzso zzso zzso derived from normal zzso the immortalized zzso zzso line zzso and the zzso melanoma, showed all to be zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses confirmed that both genes zzso products that were zzso lineage zzso Mice zzso with zzso zzso or zzso using zzso zzso virus failed to produce any zzso zzso responses or protective immunity against zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of mice with human zzso using zzso zzso zzso T cells specific for zzso but these T cells also cross reacted with zzso tumor in zzso and induced significant but weak protection against zzso zzso zzso with human and mouse zzso together zzso type 2 zzso plus zzso zzso virus zzso or zzso with human zzso zzso and boosting with zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not significantly enhance the protective response against zzso zzso These results may suggest that zzso with zzso tumor zzso rather than self, may be more effective as an zzso zzso in designing zzso cancer zzso
