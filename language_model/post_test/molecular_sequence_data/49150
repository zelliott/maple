zzso is produced zzso by the zzso zzso and is a zzso representation of zzso It regulates neuroendocrine target zzso through zzso zzso of which zzso is the zzso zzso These receptors are zzso expressed in several fetal and zzso zzso suggesting distinct roles for zzso in development and that specific zzso cues define time windows for zzso zzso We have investigated zzso gene expression in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso is confined to the zzso zzso region of the adult zzso but in zzso extends into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso This accounts for the well documented transient sensitivity of rat zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of an upstream zzso of the rat zzso gene revealed multiple putative response elements for the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in the anterior zzso from zzso zzso zzso A zzso expression zzso zzso zzso expression of both zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso factors that zzso with zzso to zzso zzso genes did not zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso factor, early growth response zzso which is induced by zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso gene expression was zzso higher in zzso zzso mice, which do not zzso zzso than in their zzso zzso These data suggest that establishment of a mature zzso zzso input drives the zzso decline in zzso zzso gene zzso
