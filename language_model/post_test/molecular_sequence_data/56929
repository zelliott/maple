More than two hundred characterized zzso zzso zzso appear to result exclusively from sequence exchanges involving the zzso gene zzso and a closely related zzso zzso Gene zzso events have also been reported in many other human gene zzso but in the absence of a de zzso zzso the alternative explanation of a multiple zzso is zzso We now report a de zzso pathological zzso at the zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis suggests that the zzso arose by a zzso event involving exchange of up to 390 zzso between maternal zzso and zzso zzso This putative de zzso gene conversion event appears to be the first characterized in zzso
