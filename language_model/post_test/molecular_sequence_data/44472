zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as a member of the insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that acquires transforming capability when truncated and fused to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso lymphoma, but further insights into its normal structure and function are zzso Here, we characterize a full-length normal human zzso zzso and its product, and determine the pattern of expression of its zzso zzso in embryonic and adult zzso as a first step toward the functional assessment of the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso identified an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid zzso protein of predicted mass approximately 177 zzso that is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso the two exhibiting 57% zzso identity and zzso similarity over their region of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the approximately 177 zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso emerging in its mature form as a 200 zzso single chain zzso Surface labeling studies indicated that the 200 zzso zzso is exposed at the cell zzso consistent with the prediction that zzso serves as the zzso for an unidentified zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed zzso expression beginning on embryonic day 11 and zzso into the zzso and adult periods of zzso zzso transcripts were confined to the nervous system and included several zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and acoustic zzso zzso the anterior horns of the spinal zzso in the region of the developing motor zzso the sympathetic zzso and the zzso cells of the zzso Thus, zzso is a novel orphan zzso zzso zzso that appears to play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous zzso
