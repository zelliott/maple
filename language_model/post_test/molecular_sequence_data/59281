A zzso zzso a chicken zzso II zzso from adrenal zzso was isolated to serve as a molecular tool to study the role of zzso in avian embryonic zzso This zzso sharing a high zzso with another avian zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with zzso sequence identity with the zzso type 1 zzso zzso expression has revealed pharmacological properties distinct from zzso receptors and a functional zzso leading to the increase in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in classical target zzso for zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso and, interestingly, in zzso cells where it may mediate the peculiar zzso effect of zzso in the zzso
