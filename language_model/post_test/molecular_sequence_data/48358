zzso analysis of zzso samples taken from individuals of zzso zzso reared in aquaculture in zzso Australia, and those sampled from the wild revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and molecular analyses were performed to confirm the presence of this disease and discovered a zzso zzso associated with this condition, and the criteria set by zzso and zzso zzso were used to establish disease zzso Three distinct zzso zzso zzso were zzso from 16 fish, and zzso analyses of the nearly full-length zzso zzso sequences generated for this bacterial agent indicated that they were nearly identical novel members of the order zzso This new zzso formed a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of sequence divergence over the zzso zzso region relative to all other members of the order zzso a new zzso and species are proposed here for the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
