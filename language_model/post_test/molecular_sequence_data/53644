The zzso zzso family 4, zzso D, zzso 3 zzso is shown to have zzso and KIM zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso These zzso the target zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso of either or both of these zzso sites prevented zzso from being zzso with zzso zzso the ability of zzso growth factor to inhibit zzso through zzso action in zzso zzso cells, and attenuated the ability of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso The two zzso zzso blocks of zzso called upstream zzso regions 1 and 2 zzso and zzso that characterize zzso long zzso are proposed to amplify the small, inherent zzso effect that zzso zzso exerts on the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to this, the lone intact zzso region found in zzso directs zzso zzso zzso to cause the zzso of this short zzso From the analysis of zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso and zzso provide a regulatory signal integration module that serves to orchestrate the functional consequences of zzso zzso The zzso gene thus encodes a series of zzso that are either inhibited or activated by zzso zzso and thereby offers the potential for zzso zzso either to increase or decrease zzso levels in cellular zzso
