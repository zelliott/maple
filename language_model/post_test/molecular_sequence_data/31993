In this study, the complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined and zzso The circular zzso are zzso zzso long for zzso zzso and zzso zzso long for zzso zzso with a total zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso contain 37 zzso and their gene orders are similar to those of other zzso All zzso genes zzso are initiated by zzso zzso except for zzso which is started with the zzso zzso all zzso terminate in the typical stop zzso zzso except for zzso zzso and zzso which end with a single zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear the most zzso Both of the zzso zzso regions harbor the motif zzso followed by a zzso zzso stretch, with zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso element next to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso element next to the zzso zzso The zzso trees of the 17 representative butterfly species, including the two species of this study, were reconstructed with the maximum likelihood and zzso zzso methods, based on the 13 zzso zzso sequence zzso The results of the zzso analyses strongly supported the relationships of zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso which was markedly different from the traditional zzso view of the zzso and zzso considered to be sisters of each zzso
