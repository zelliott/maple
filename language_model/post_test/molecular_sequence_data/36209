Mouse zzso protein 4 zzso is a protein that zzso with zzso in zzso It is zzso by a zzso gene that expresses multiple transcripts in most cell types zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso This report describes the identification of two distinct zzso regions zzso for zzso zzso The zzso of the transcripts are identical up to the site of zzso of the shorter zzso The longer transcript contains an additional zzso zzso after the first zzso zzso Both zzso tails follow the zzso zzso site zzso zzso These data show that two different zzso arise as a result of alternative zzso site zzso Northern blots of zzso from different zzso zzso with coding sequence show zzso to the common zzso and zzso zzso whereas blots zzso with sequence unique to the longer zzso show zzso only to the zzso zzso Both transcripts are found within the same cell zzso In addition, muscle contains additional transcripts of 8 and 9 zzso of which only the zzso transcript zzso to the longer zzso zzso
