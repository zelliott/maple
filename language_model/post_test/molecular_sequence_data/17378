In zzso zzso the induction of zzso and zzso structures, and zzso of the zzso rhythm are controlled by blue zzso zzso zzso a fungus used in biological control, zzso in a synchronized manner following a brief pulse of blue zzso Due to its apparent zzso this response was chosen for pursuing zzso zzso Two genes were zzso zzso regulators 1 and 2 zzso and zzso similar to the zzso zzso white-collar 1 and 2, zzso The zzso protein has all the characteristics of a zzso zzso whereas the structure of the deduced zzso protein suggests that it interacts with zzso through zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso of the corresponding genes demonstrated that they are essential for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also shown to be essential for the zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso Mechanical injury of zzso was found to trigger zzso of zzso zzso a response not described zzso This response was not altered in the zzso A novel effect of both red and blue light on zzso growth was found involving another light zzso which is compensated by the zzso zzso
