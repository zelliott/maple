Competition dialysis is a powerful new tool for the discovery of zzso that bind to zzso acids with zzso or zzso The method is based on firm zzso principles and is simple to zzso In the competition dialysis experiment, an array of zzso acid structures and sequences is zzso against a common test zzso zzso After zzso the amount of zzso bound to each structure or sequence is determined by zzso or zzso zzso Since all structures and sequences are in equilibrium with the same free zzso zzso the amount bound is directly zzso to the zzso binding zzso Competition dialysis thus provides a direct and quantitative measure of zzso and zzso identifies which of the samples within the array are preferred by a particular zzso We describe here the third generation zzso of the method, in which competition dialysis was adapted for use in a zzso plate zzso In this format, we have been able to greatly expand the array of zzso acid structures zzso and now can routinely study the interactions of a zzso of interest with 46 different structures and zzso
