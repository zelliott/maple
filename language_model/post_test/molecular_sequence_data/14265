zzso zzso are zzso water channels zzso expressed in zzso zzso They play prominent roles in maintaining cellular fluid zzso Although expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been reported in the central nervous system, it is zzso that is predominately zzso Its importance in fluid regulation in cerebral zzso conditions has been highlighted in several studies, and we have also shown that zzso regulation of zzso by zzso could prove to be useful in zzso volume reduction in middle cerebral artery zzso rat zzso There is evidence for the existence of two zzso transcripts zzso and zzso in the brain arising from two alternative zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso exhibits greater water zzso in this study, we explored the possibility of zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso software, we identified 34 zzso predicted to target the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were highly expressed in zzso could regulate the promoter zzso Of these, zzso was identified as a strong zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso could zzso the zzso zzso transcript and its protein to bring about a reduction in cerebral zzso and promote zzso
