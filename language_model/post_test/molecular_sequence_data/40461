Since many drugs are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using these zzso are valuable in drug zzso In this work, the zzso by zzso and zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso was investigated through zzso and molecular dynamics zzso simulations and by experimental methods using rat liver zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The target proteins were initially built by zzso zzso and the resulting three-dimensional structures were refined by MD to obtain zzso snapshots of each zzso zzso These snapshots were used to dock compounds A and B as well as the reference compound zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso produces a toxic intermediate zzso zzso upon interaction of its zzso group with the zzso iron of zzso However, neither A nor B presented this kind of interaction within any snapshot with zzso On the other hand, when zzso A and B were zzso on zzso their zzso group was located near the zzso iron on the snapshot at zzso zzso Furthermore, B maintained the same position on all snapshots of this zzso zzso theoretical results suggests that A and B do not generate toxic zzso These data were supported by zzso analysis showing only one zzso from A and B, which was identified by zzso as the zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that neither test compound is zzso
