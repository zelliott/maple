The hypothesis that similar zzso zzso in aquatic zzso are a result of zzso evolution was tested using molecular sequence zzso zzso analyses were performed on partial sequences of zzso zzso of seven species of zzso one species of zzso and one species of zzso zzso has zzso zzso with long arms, whereas zzso and zzso have typically zzso zzso zzso with short zzso zzso in a zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso and both produce dark, minute zzso in culture whereas zzso has zzso zzso and does not produce zzso in zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso in zzso All three zzso have zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso species are placed in two distinct zzso one within zzso the other within zzso zzso zzso is placed with zzso species within zzso zzso and zzso zzso are placed within zzso No zzso character was entirely zzso with the molecular derived zzso This suggests that for the group of species zzso zzso shape is not a reliable indicator of zzso but more likely the result of zzso evolution in response to the aquatic zzso
