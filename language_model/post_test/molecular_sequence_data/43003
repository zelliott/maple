The zzso gene promoter is a zzso zzso zzso promoter which contains potential binding sites for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown that zzso positively activates the zzso zzso Since both the zzso and zzso genes are widely zzso it is possible that zzso is one of the main regulators of zzso gene zzso This is supported by the correlation between the distribution and zzso regulation of zzso and zzso gene zzso in that both genes appear to be zzso during normal zzso In a model of human zzso zzso we have demonstrated increased expression of the zzso zzso which may result from loss of repression of the zzso promoter by another zzso zzso the zzso tumor zzso gene zzso Future studies will define whether other disease states in which the zzso gene is highly expressed are also associated with loss of negative regulation of the zzso promoter by zzso or other tumor zzso gene zzso
