As one of the major cellular zzso zzso plays diverse roles in supporting and regulating zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso function itself is regulated by its various zzso zzso To define zzso zzso in zzso functions and the mechanisms for regulating this function, the human zzso zzso was characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso most prominent association is its previously described interaction with zzso a primary zzso capable of recognizing and binding zzso zzso zzso Additionally, novel human proteins discovered in this study reveal that several newly described zzso associations in zzso are zzso in the human zzso Additionally, other new zzso zzso imply that a great deal of zzso function may be directed to the zzso regulation, or exploitation of the zzso zzso network, particularly the zzso zzso
