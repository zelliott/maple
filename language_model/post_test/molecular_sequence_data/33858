Although most zzso reproduce sexually, a small number of fishes, zzso and zzso are known in which reproduction is zzso zzso without zzso zzso In fishes, these so-called zzso lineages usually comprise only females and zzso zzso males of a related sexual species to reproduce via zzso or zzso Here, we examine patterns of zzso and zzso DNA zzso variation in a widespread group of freshwater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate a long-standing proposal that this group includes zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso of most carp zzso in tributaries of the zzso River belongs to one of two deeply divided zzso zzso zzso b zzso and that nuclear variation divides the same individuals into four distinct zzso Group 1 exhibits the zzso proportions of a random mating population and has a zzso sex zzso Two other groups are extremely zzso zzso male, zzso zzso exhibit excess zzso at most zzso and share at least one zzso per locus with group zzso We propose that these two groups represent zzso zzso lineages and that both zzso zzso group 1 as sexual zzso Interestingly, the fourth distinct group appears to represent hybrid offspring of the two putative zzso zzso The propagation of zzso zzso zzso by both males and females and the ability of these clones to unite and form sexually mature zzso hybrid offspring may represent a novel mechanism that contributes to the dynamics of coexistence between zzso lineages and their sexual zzso
