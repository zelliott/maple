The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso loop is essential for zzso binding and principally determines zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso virus zzso we previously made an extensive panel of zzso deletions and identified zzso within zzso that could zzso mediate zzso and zzso zzso A deletion of zzso 9 to 12 on the zzso side of the zzso stem zzso zzso zzso while leaving zzso zzso zzso This zzso also resulted in complete resistance to several zzso zzso zzso Here, we extend these studies to further characterize a zzso of this zzso zzso adapted for growth in zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso point zzso revealed that, relative to parental zzso zzso zzso was more dependent on the zzso zzso a region that contacts the zzso bridging sheet and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso showed that, compared to parental zzso zzso was more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso zzso showed that zzso could use zzso zzso for zzso These studies indicate that increased dependence on the zzso zzso represents a mechanism by which zzso envelopes acquire resistance to zzso zzso and may have more general implications for mechanisms of drug resistance that arise in zzso In addition, envelopes such as zzso may be useful for developing new entry zzso that target the interaction of zzso and the zzso zzso
