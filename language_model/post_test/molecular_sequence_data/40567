The regulation of zzso zzso is an essential and critical point in gene zzso In this study, we describe a novel zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gene from disk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time in zzso It was identified by zzso screening of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso consists of a 945 zzso coding region that encodes a putative protein containing 315 zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of a characteristic zzso zzso factor domain and a highly zzso basic zzso zzso zzso signature similar to known zzso zzso The zzso shares 46, 43 and, zzso zzso acid identities with fish zzso zzso human and insect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real time zzso analysis confirmed that zzso gene expression is zzso in all selected zzso zzso was zzso in zzso after bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso challenge; and, zzso in zzso and zzso by viral zzso zzso virus zzso zzso Shell damage and tissue injury also increased the zzso level of zzso in mantle together with other zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso All results considered, identification and gene expression data demonstrate that zzso zzso is an important regulator in innate immune response against bacteria and virus, as well as in the inflammatory response during tissue zzso In addition, stimulation of zzso under different external stimuli could be useful to understand the zzso biology and its downstream target zzso especially in zzso zzso
