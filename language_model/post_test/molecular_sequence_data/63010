The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that mediates the zzso and toxic effects of its zzso zzso In recent years it has become evident that in the absence of zzso the zzso promotes cell cycle progression and that its zzso by zzso zzso results in interactions with the zzso protein zzso that lead to zzso of the cell cycle, zzso arrest, diminished capacity for DNA replication and zzso of cell zzso zzso the zzso has zzso opposed zzso and zzso functions that have yet to be zzso at the molecular zzso Work from our own and from other laboratories suggests that the zzso may function as a tumor zzso gene that becomes silenced in the process of tumor zzso To develop preliminary support for a more thorough examination of this hypothesis we characterized the expression levels of various tumor zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso genes and the zzso gene in liver tumor samples from mice with a zzso RB zzso and their zzso zzso In tumors arising in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas in zzso tumors, only zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was significantly zzso in tumors from both sets of mice, supporting the concept that zzso zzso may be associated with cancer zzso
