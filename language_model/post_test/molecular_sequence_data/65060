An efficient zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso was initially applied to the zzso mechanism investigation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso system, an internal standard similar in structure and zzso efficiency to the product was chosen in the zzso zzso and a single point zzso factor was determined and used to zzso the product zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso was rapidly determined by fitting the zzso kinetic data into a zzso zzso analysis zzso The initial rate zzso analysis and product zzso study described support a hybrid zzso zzso zzso mechanism of zzso with formation of a zzso zzso zzso This zzso intermediate was further isolated and detected via zzso zzso and zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso To our knowledge, these are the first zzso data reported for the bacterial zzso zzso which demonstrated the power of mass zzso in zzso the reaction zzso and zzso mechanism of promising zzso zzso
