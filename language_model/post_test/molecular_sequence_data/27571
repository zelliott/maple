Two peptides are specified when the zzso DNA strand is read in the zzso to zzso or the 3' to zzso direction, and both peptides form strong complexes with the natural zzso as found by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that strong zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso the assumed basis of these zzso is obtained only if the zzso resulting from reading in the 3' to zzso direction is aligned parallel to the natural zzso or if the zzso derived by opposite reading of the DNA is aligned zzso to zzso zzso is abolished in other zzso including all staggered zzso In the appropriate alignments of the zzso the zzso acid zzso opposite one another are specified by a pair of complementary zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso have indeed shown that complementary pairs of zzso specify zzso acids of opposite zzso A model is proposed to explain how zzso zzso can lead to interaction between zzso We propose that in the interacting peptides zzso zzso of both chains are oriented toward the zzso zzso while the zzso ones form the zzso between the two zzso Tight packing is made possible by the stipulation that whenever a zzso zzso turns toward the zzso phase, a space is liberated which can accommodate a zzso zzso from the opposing zzso This zzso zzso can lead to strong interactions between portions of peptides consisting of zzso complementary zzso
