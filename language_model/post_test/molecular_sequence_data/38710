A soybean protein was zzso from mature dry zzso zzso sequencing of the nine internal peptides derived from this zzso blocked protein showed that it has a significant similarity to the soluble zzso zzso known to zzso A zzso series of zzso zzso with sequences corresponding to an internal region of eight zzso zzso was zzso as a probe mixture for detection of a putative zzso zzso zzso in a developing zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained was found to have an zzso frame zzso the seed zzso zzso precursor consisting of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that 25 zzso zzso upstream from the second zzso zzso to a transit zzso zzso an zzso coli expression system, the putative mature zzso zzso protein was zzso and zzso to zzso This zzso protein was confirmed to exhibit its zzso converting activity using zzso oxide as zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso oxide are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1500 zzso zzso zzso equilibrium experiments showed that the active form of this zzso zzso is zzso in zzso Using the above zzso as a probe, a zzso zzso clone was selected and the sequence of a zzso zzso from this clone was found to cover the entire coding region together with zzso and zzso regions of the soybean zzso zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso interrupted by two short zzso was identical to the corresponding regions of the zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that this zzso zzso gene was expressed strongly at a very early stage (13 days after zzso and then the level of expression gradually decreased and almost ceased at a very late stage zzso days after zzso of seed development, whereas its expression was markedly zzso by zzso zzso In stems zzso zzso the zzso zzso transcript was detected at significant levels and was also zzso in response to zzso On the other hand, it is hardly expressed in leaves, even though they were treated with the zzso Overall, the results obtained may indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at the maximum level in an early stage of seed zzso Later, oil bodies are formed and subsequently zzso fatty zzso naturally occurring zzso accumulate within those zzso The zzso induction of this zzso zzso transcript in some zzso in response to zzso also indicates that this zzso zzso may play a crucial role in self-defense systems of zzso
