zzso known as zzso usually plays roles as a regulatory inhibitor of complement, but it also exhibits activities independent of its function as a complement zzso This study reported the identification and characterization of an zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which is similar to known zzso in terms of both zzso acid sequence and zzso structure as well as zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso was zzso expressed in early zzso and expressed in a zzso manner, with most abundant expression in the zzso We further showed that zzso zzso zzso was capable of binding to both the zzso and zzso bacteria as well as the microbial signature molecules zzso and zzso In addition we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso displayed slight zzso activity capable of zzso the growth of zzso coli and zzso zzso All these data indicate that zzso zzso can not only binds to the bacteria and their signature molecules zzso and zzso but can also inhibit their growth, a novel role assigned to zzso
