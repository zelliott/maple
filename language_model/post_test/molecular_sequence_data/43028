The glass gene encodes a zzso zzso protein required for the development of zzso zzso cells and which appears to regulate a number of genes specifically expressed in zzso We have generated zzso zzso to Glass and used them to examine Glass distribution during zzso Glass is expressed in all cell types of the developing eye and in all other zzso that contain zzso cells in zzso including a small number of cells in the zzso We altered the normal pattern of glass expression by placing the gene under the control of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells are restricted in their response to Glass zzso In an effort to discover the mechanism of this zzso we examined the expression of a number of reporter gene zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells are unable to express certain reporter zzso in response to Glass expression because another zzso factor zzso Glass activity in zzso zzso
