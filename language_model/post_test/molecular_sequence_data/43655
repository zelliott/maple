Using a set of overlapping peptides of the human zzso zzso we have performed an accurate mapping of the zzso zzso sites, recognized by a panel of 19 zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The results show that most of the zzso recognize zzso localized in the zzso domain of the zzso Several zzso reacted with peptides which zzso to the zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso of zzso None of these zzso reacted with peptides in the central zzso domain of zzso zzso
