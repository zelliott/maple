In flies, zzso zzso zzso duplexes typically contain zzso and begin with zzso so they bind zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso duplexes are perfectly paired and begin with zzso promoting their loading into zzso A subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso born as mismatched duplexes that often begin with zzso These would be predicted to load into zzso yet accumulate at zzso bound to zzso In zzso such zzso duplexes assemble into zzso In zzso they encounter complementary target zzso that trigger their tailing and zzso causing zzso zzso to be zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are zzso modified at their 3' ends, protecting them from tailing and zzso zzso the zzso distribution of zzso reflects not only their initial sorting between zzso and zzso according to their duplex structure, zzso and first zzso but also the targeted destruction of the zzso small zzso after their loading into an zzso zzso
