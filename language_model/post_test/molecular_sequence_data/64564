We performed a zzso search for novel zzso zzso for zzso proteins based on the zzso mapping coordinates of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso sequences from two novel human genes were identified and subsequently used for full length transcript zzso zzso and zzso belong to two novel zzso coding for small zzso that we found to be highly zzso among zzso The zzso zzso displays a zzso zzso zzso that places it zzso closer to the zzso zzso zzso proteins are more closely related to the Ras branch of zzso All zzso newly identified here exhibit an zzso zzso in place of the highly zzso zzso of the G domain, suggesting that the universal switch mechanism of small zzso may be structurally different in this zzso We determined by Northern zzso that zzso is transcribed in several human zzso and that it is zzso in prostate tumors as measured by quantitative real-time zzso These results highlight a previously zzso zzso of zzso genes that may have a tumor zzso role in prostate zzso
