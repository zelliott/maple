The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso spike can be divided into two zzso a zzso zzso structure and a terminal zzso zzso The latter contains all the zzso recognition sites of the zzso as well as its zzso recognition and zzso zzso active zzso These two activities of the protein can be separated by zzso zzso functional zzso studies and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso of several zzso zzso in the stalk of the zzso disease virus zzso protein markedly decrease its zzso activity without a significant effect on zzso zzso Thus, zzso in the zzso distant from the zzso active site in the zzso domain, can also separate attachment and zzso These results add to an increasing body of evidence that the zzso activity of this protein is dependent on an intact stalk zzso
