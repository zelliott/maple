The complete zzso acid and DNA sequences of the human zzso zzso are zzso The DNA sequence encodes a protein of zzso zzso which is unique in that it lacks the terminal zzso tail segment found in all other zzso When the human zzso zzso zzso acid sequence is compared to the corresponding bovine zzso the overall identity is zzso The zzso regions are zzso identical and the head regions are zzso zzso This similarity is also evident in the DNA sequence of the coding region, the zzso upstream zzso and the 3' zzso zzso The high degree of zzso identity between bovine and human zzso zzso suggests that there is strong evolutionary pressure to conserve the structure of this zzso This in turn suggests an important and universal role for this intermediate filament zzso in all zzso
