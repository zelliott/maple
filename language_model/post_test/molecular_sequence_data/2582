The zzso sequence of the small nuclear inclusion protein zzso zzso of plum pox zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso activity was expressed in zzso coli cells harboring plasmids with a zzso zzso insert approximately zzso zzso zzso Free zzso zzso protein was detected in these cells, but it was not produced when a zzso was introduced in the zzso zzso insert which induced a zzso to Pro substitution at the large nuclear inclusion protein zzso protein zzso By zzso analysis, the zzso protein was determined to be responsible for the zzso zzso A zzso to zzso substitution at the presumed zzso zzso which inhibited zzso processing at the zzso end of the zzso had no effect on zzso zzso at the zzso protein zzso In contrast with the high efficiency of zzso processing at the zzso protein zzso site, processing at the ends of the zzso zzso was not complete, suggesting that the zzso zzso like that of other zzso contains zzso sites with different zzso
