zzso is active in zzso against the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and is used clinically to treat acute cases of human zzso In pursuit of the mechanism of action of zzso against zzso zzso and to understand how resistance might zzso drug-resistant zzso were generated and zzso The previously zzso zzso b gene of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from wild type and resistant strains as this was a likely candidate for the target of the drug and thus a source of zzso zzso are present within the zzso b gene of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and represent zzso in two different regions of the zzso pocket zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interferes with electron transport at the zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso A structural model for how this zzso is binding within the zzso domain is zzso Further analysis of the zzso b gene suggested that the protein may differ from other zzso by terminating within the zzso zzso zzso b becomes the first complete zzso gene and zzso protein to be described for zzso zzso
