The zzso gene has been identified as a zzso sequence in the zzso zzso of the zzso An unexpected finding concerns the zzso zzso extension which is known to be poorly zzso at the sequence level, even between closely related plant zzso We have shown that the zzso of zzso from the pea and other species belonging to the zzso tribe of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso share a sequence similarity which extends to long zzso untranslated transcript zzso The reason for the observed conservation is not clear but may simply reflect the close zzso relationship of species from the zzso zzso The result of editing analysis indicates the occurrence of fully and partially edited transcripts of zzso in the pea zzso The majority of the editing sites are targeted to the last zzso domain of the pea zzso important in zzso zzso and interactions with other zzso of zzso zzso
