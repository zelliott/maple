We have studied the zzso regulation of the beta 3 zzso gene by the steroid hormone zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A series of hybrid zzso with different fragments of the beta 3 zzso gene driving the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso The promoter activity was zzso after transient expression in zzso cells, in the presence and the absence of zzso zzso with zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start site and 360 zzso from the first large zzso allowed the hormonal regulation, zzso a repression in the absence of zzso and a zzso in the presence of the zzso This 360 zzso zzso contains several enhancers and zzso zzso The regulation of the expression of the beta 3 zzso gene results from the combined activity of all the positive and negative regulatory sequences of the first zzso and a dialogue with the promoter zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso zzso has been established and we have identified several zzso zzso responsive zzso consensus zzso
