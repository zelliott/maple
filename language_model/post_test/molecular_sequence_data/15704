The dominant zzso zzso zzso is an excellent study group for assessing the evolution and functional importance of zzso adaptations to zzso The availability of zzso zzso in a wide range of latitudes zzso and zzso provides a tool to enable identification of zzso and zzso characteristics gained and lost during evolutionary zzso zzso zzso belonging to the most zzso families are a crucial source for understanding the evolution of zzso in zzso zzso zzso This paper focuses on the structure, function and evolution of the zzso system of zzso zzso a zzso zzso fish of the family zzso probably derived from ancestral species that evolved in the Antarctic region and later migrated to lower zzso Unlike most zzso zzso but similar to many other zzso zzso zzso zzso has two major zzso having the beta chain in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of the two zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso show strong zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso with marked zzso and Root zzso In zzso and zzso oxygen affinity and zzso zzso are slightly higher than in most zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show similar zzso rates, but also show significant dynamic differences that are likely to have functional zzso zzso dynamic simulations of zzso zzso zzso were performed on the zzso protein in order to obtain a better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso
