zzso species possess zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso This report describes the expression and gene structure of the largest zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso which is responsible for the synthesis of zzso The zzso largest zzso gene was present as a single copy gene on zzso zzso Three zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso A comparison of zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso largest zzso identified zzso zzso acid positions and zzso zzso acid zzso Novel zzso acid insertions were found between zzso zzso regions A and B zzso zzso D and zzso zzso zzso zzso and E zzso zzso and F and G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found within regions zzso zzso and zzso A novel zzso repeat domain, a domain with zzso to the zzso domain of zzso upstream binding factor zzso and 4 highly zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso motifs were found within a zzso acid zzso of enlarged region zzso The novel zzso zzso repeat contained a zzso zzso zzso which was also identified in the zzso repeat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso largest zzso as well as within a highly zzso zzso repeat from zzso zzso zzso The results of this molecular analysis indicate that zzso and zzso mechanisms regulate the activity of zzso zzso zzso
