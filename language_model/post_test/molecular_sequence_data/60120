In capping cellular zzso a zzso zzso intermediate leads to formation of zzso at the zzso end of the zzso which is modified by zzso zzso by zzso Here we show that isolated zzso from tobacco mosaic virus zzso plant or insect cells expressing zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso the formation of a zzso zzso complex in the presence of zzso The zzso group from zzso was incorporated into zzso suggesting that the complex consisted of zzso Thus, zzso and zzso despite their evolutionary distance, share the same zzso capping zzso
