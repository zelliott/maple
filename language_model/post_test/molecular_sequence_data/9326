The use of zzso acid bacteria zzso in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing zzso In the present study, 47 zzso strains were isolated from farmed zzso ( zzso zzso ) and were zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso and randomly amplified zzso DNA - zzso chain reaction zzso Their zzso effect was tested in zzso against a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso Most of the strains isolated were zzso belonging to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso An zzso zzso strain was also zzso The survey of their zzso zzso showed that all zzso were sensitive to zzso and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal zzso Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and zzso zzso More than zzso (32 zzso of the zzso inhibited the growth of the majority of zzso and zzso bacteria tested, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso zzso species isolated from zzso that could potentially inhibit the zzso bacteria found in food zzso
