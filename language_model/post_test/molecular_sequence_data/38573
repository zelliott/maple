Two types of zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso activity were isolated from the moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso displayed zzso activity in the zzso and were unable to use any of the carbon sources tested, including starch and its zzso product zzso The type II zzso was affected in the gene responsible for the synthesis of the zzso zzso This gene zzso was isolated by functional zzso of zzso II and zzso The deduced protein zzso showed a high degree of zzso to a proposed family of zzso consisting of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insects and zzso zzso contained the four highly zzso regions in zzso as well as a high content of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was functional in the moderate zzso zzso zzso and, when cloned in a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is believed to be the first zzso gene isolated from a moderate zzso a group of zzso of great zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicating that members of the zzso zzso are good candidates for use as cell factories to produce zzso zzso zzso
