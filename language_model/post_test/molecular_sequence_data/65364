zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso to zzso of the cases of acute zzso zzso At zzso zzso of zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso target zzso blocking differentiation of the zzso At high zzso of zzso it zzso the zzso of target zzso forcing terminal zzso The study of zzso target genes that mediate this differentiation has identified several genes that are important for proliferation and differentiation control in normal and zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso fusion protein not only interferes with the zzso of regular zzso target zzso We show that the zzso and zzso promoters are activated by zzso but, unexpectedly, not by zzso zzso Our data support a model in which the zzso fusion protein regulates a novel class of target genes by interaction with the zzso and zzso zzso factors, without directly binding to the DNA, defining a zzso for the zzso
