Among the new generations of zzso drugs, zzso zzso and its zzso have unusually potent activity when compared with the parent zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to form a zzso zzso to DNA, although the exact mode of interactions remains zzso To establish the structural basis of this zzso we carried out X-ray zzso analyses of the complexes between four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two DNA zzso zzso and zzso Their crystal data are similar to other zzso complexes with space group zzso zzso b approximately 28 A, c approximately 53 zzso The refined structures at approximately zzso A resolution revealed that two drug molecules bind to the duplex with the zzso zzso between the zzso steps with their zzso in the minor zzso The zzso zzso is flexible and may adopt different zzso dependent on the sequence zzso The zzso atoms of the two zzso groups in the zzso complexes are in van der zzso zzso The structural results suggest possible zzso mechanism of zzso It is worth pointing out that by linking two zzso or zzso at the zzso positions a new type of zzso derivatives may be zzso which may bind to a zzso sequence with some zzso
