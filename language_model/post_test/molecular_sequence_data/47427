The gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso by zzso zzso based on a consensus zzso zzso zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso zzso is able to complement a zzso zzso with a disrupted zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso protein has a predicted zzso acid zzso signal sequence and the zzso zzso consensus zzso retention signal zzso The mature protein shows strong conservation relative to other zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter has two possible unfolded protein response zzso elements and it was shown by treatments with zzso and zzso that the gene is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso fragment, in zzso increases zzso zzso probably by inducing the zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso is also regulated by the carbon source, being lowest in zzso media and highest on carbon sources that induce the genes zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of this regulation was studied by examining zzso zzso levels under conditions where the zzso zzso are induced by zzso as well as in the strain zzso which is zzso for the zzso zzso gene zzso The results suggest that neither zzso induction nor zzso repression by the zzso protein affect the zzso promoter zzso
