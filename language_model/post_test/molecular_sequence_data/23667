Two groups of unknown bacteria, which zzso resemble members of the zzso zzso group but zzso display zzso zzso zzso gene sequence divergence from their nearest zzso described species, zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso the unidentified bacteria displayed a relatively close association with each zzso However, a zzso zzso gene sequence divergence of approximately zzso between the two unknown bacteria, as well as distinguishable zzso zzso demonstrates that these organisms are zzso and zzso zzso and each group may represent a previously unknown zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that the two novel organisms were indeed distinct from each zzso The previously described species closest to both of them is zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso but they can be differentiated easily from zzso zzso by virtue of not utilizing zzso zzso pairing studies also documented the zzso of the unknown species and zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso findings, two new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso content of the DNA is zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso The type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
