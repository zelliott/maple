The accumulated knowledge on the binding of zzso zzso and its zzso and the results of zzso studies have been reviewed and are used zzso to derive a binding site model for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso except at its molecular zzso Most of its skeletal flexibility resides in the zzso and it probably binds in a low-energy zzso The zzso OH group in the zzso contributes about zzso zzso to the binding free energy and probably acts primarily as a hydrogen bond zzso The 17 zzso group in the zzso contributes approximately zzso zzso to the binding and probably acts as a hydrogen bond zzso either directly or via a water zzso There also seems to be a degree of flexibility in the region of the zzso that encompasses the zzso The aromatic ring contributes about zzso zzso probably through weak polar interactions with zzso zzso that contact the zzso of the zzso The zzso seems to surround the zzso so that all four rings contribute significantly to zzso Small zzso zzso enhance binding affinity at positions 4, 12 zzso 14, and 16 zzso zzso larger zzso zzso are tolerated at positions 7 zzso 11 zzso and 17 zzso In general, the zzso is intolerant of polar zzso Based on zzso zzso bearing zzso groups, zzso zzso might be present in the binding site in the area of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso might be located near zzso Models that represent the limits of zzso of the zzso binding site, the position of zzso pockets, and space occupied by the zzso are zzso The various elements in this model for the binding of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso are consistent with evidence emerging from the crystal structures of related nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso
