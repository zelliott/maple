The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso type zzso was isolated previously from a Kenyan soda lake, Lake zzso Most cells of strain zzso occurred in irregular zzso and the colonies were zzso The polar lipids of this zzso were composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is characteristic of zzso zzso was not zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene revealed that the closest relative of strain zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso an extremely zzso zzso However, strain zzso did not exhibit a significant level of DNA zzso to zzso zzso zzso which represents the only previously described species in the zzso zzso We describe a new species for strain zzso for which we propose the name zzso zzso
