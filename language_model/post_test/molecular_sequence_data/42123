Several studies have shown that zzso zzso reduces the release of zzso zzso from cultured zzso zzso Moreover, the main zzso zzso zzso activity in these cells is a zzso zzso that is also inhibited by zzso We have investigated further the role of the zzso zzso in the conversion of big zzso to zzso zzso was measured using a zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the production of zzso from zzso precursors was determined using cultured bovine zzso zzso cells zzso and the human zzso cell line zzso zzso The zzso of zzso accumulating in the medium over 24 h from zzso were lowered by zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso In contrast, with zzso zzso cells, the same zzso of zzso increased by five- to zzso the amount of zzso present in the medium after zzso zzso In other experiments, incubation of big zzso (1 zzso with intact zzso or zzso zzso cells resulted in the generation of zzso and with both cell types this was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with both cell types having a zzso zzso that is readily accessible to zzso big zzso and is therefore probably located on the plasma zzso Furthermore, another zzso zzso may play a part in the zzso zzso formation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
