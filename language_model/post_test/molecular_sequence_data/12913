The zzso zzso zzso is essential for the production of mature zzso As such, it has become a target for the development of zzso zzso Multiple passages of virus in cell culture in the presence of zzso zzso have resulted in the selection of zzso with decreased sensitivity to zzso of the zzso The most common zzso observed is a single zzso acid change at position zzso This particular position has been well characterized by several laboratories as being important for the zzso of the virus to zzso of zzso zzso zzso which result in the substitution of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso at position 82 of the zzso have been associated with decreased sensitivity to several zzso zzso We describe here a clinical strain of zzso that contains an zzso at position 82 of the zzso instead of the usual zzso This strain is unique in that it was isolated from a patient that was zzso zzso and in the past, zzso at position 82 of the zzso have only been found after treatment of patients or cell culture with zzso zzso Moreover, this virus remains sensitive to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso symmetrical zzso zzso
