A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at around pH zzso and 30 degrees C and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the cluster zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with which it shared highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso The zzso properties of strain zzso were consistent with those of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso Major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited levels of zzso zzso of zzso % to the type strains of zzso related zzso species and could be differentiated from these species based on differences in zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
