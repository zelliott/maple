The zzso G zzso C and A zzso T zzso DNA duplex has been the single most important milestone in modem molecular zzso However, it is possible that other types of stable DNA structures besides the double zzso might exist, since only about zzso of the human zzso is transcribed and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA structures occur in the extensive tandem repeated sequences at the zzso of zzso zzso of stable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type have been implicated at the control regions of certain human zzso We review and discuss the various types of DNA duplex structures containing stable sheared zzso and compare their structural characteristics with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso structural motifs are found in the highly zzso sequences at the replication origins of several zzso DNA viruses and in the zzso regions of human zzso and may be involved in important biological functions, such as viral DNA replication and zzso zzso
