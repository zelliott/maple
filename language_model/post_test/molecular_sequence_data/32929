The zzso activity of human zzso as a zzso zzso is high towards short zzso but very low in zzso protein folding zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which are members of the zzso family, are highly active as folding zzso They contain an extra zzso or IF domain near the zzso zzso active zzso The zzso of this domain did not affect the zzso zzso activity of zzso from zzso coli towards short zzso zzso but abolished its zzso activity in zzso protein folding zzso The zzso zzso of the IF domain of zzso into human zzso increased its folding activity zzso and generated a folding catalyst that is more active than zzso zzso The IF domain binds to zzso protein chains and thus functions as a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso site and a separate zzso site with an adapted affinity for zzso protein chains are the key elements for a productive zzso between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso folding in the zzso mechanisms of zzso and other zzso zzso such as trigger factor and zzso
