zzso zzso zzso plus zzso is a zzso G zzso zzso responsible for the capture of a zzso in retinal zzso zzso A large number of zzso in the zzso gene associated with zzso dominant zzso zzso have been zzso The naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso in the English zzso dog leads to a progressive retinal zzso that closely resembles human zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Using genetic approaches and zzso zzso we explored the properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from affected zzso dog zzso we found that the zzso abolished zzso at zzso whereas zzso at zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso localized normally to the rod outer zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso lost its zzso faster as measured by the zzso of zzso II and that it was less resistant to heat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso poorly and zzso zzso with the G protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso affected mainly the zzso at the zzso zzso side of zzso which is possibly responsible for protecting the zzso from the access of bulk zzso The zzso zzso may represent a novel molecular mechanism of zzso where the zzso form of the zzso zzso exerts a zzso effect by losing its structural zzso
