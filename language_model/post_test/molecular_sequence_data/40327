A new 15 zzso zzso type zzso inhibitor zzso zzso from fava beans zzso zzso zzso Egypt 1) was isolated using liquid zzso Though it exhibited substantial zzso in zzso zzso acid sequence to other zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but hardly any activity against zzso It demonstrated zzso activity toward the zzso fungus zzso zzso with an zzso of 20 zzso The mechanism of its zzso action toward zzso zzso included zzso induction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso growth zzso by zzso deposition at zzso tips, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was dependent on the ambient zzso strength as increasing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso diminished the zzso The zzso action of zzso was confined to zzso but not exerted on human and rabbit zzso This study sheds light on the mode of zzso growth zzso activity of zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso the scope of its potential zzso
