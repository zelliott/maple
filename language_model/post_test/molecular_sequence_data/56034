Gene zzso have been widely used in zzso expression systems as a technique to stabilize the zzso product against zzso increase the zzso initiation efficiency or to serve as an affinity handle for the zzso of the zzso A further advantage is the potential to generate an authentic zzso zzso of the foreign protein when this is vital for its biological activity, such as for the ability of human zzso protein zzso to mediate zzso of zzso zzso We report here the construction and utility of a zzso fusion protein system for production of the otherwise short-lived zzso as a zzso extension to zzso in zzso A hybrid gene containing the zzso zzso coding region fused zzso to the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso was constructed and expressed under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso and finally characterized by zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso acid composition analysis, demonstrating that the fusion protein was zzso correctly and zzso in zzso by an zzso zzso zzso to generate authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso cell zzso to the same extent as zzso amounts of zzso human zzso zzso and zzso Thus, this expression cloning strategy permits the production of authentic, biologically active zzso zzso and the procedure can easily be adapted to make zzso zzso for further studies of its zzso activities and biological zzso
