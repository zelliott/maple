The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics and evolution of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso zzso following the use of a modified live zzso zzso zzso A zzso farm with coexistence of types 1 and 2 and no history of zzso vaccination was zzso zzso with a type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso All zzso were vaccinated at monthly intervals for two consecutive months and then every third zzso zzso were vaccinated once at zzso of age and weaned to nursery facilities at zzso of zzso zzso samples were collected monthly before and after vaccination from four population groups, including replacement zzso and zzso nursery and finishing zzso and zzso by zzso After a year of blood collection, amplified products were zzso resulting in 277 complete zzso gene sequences from 145 type 1 and 132 type 2 zzso Prior to and following zzso both type 1 and type 2 zzso were isolated and found to coexist in an individual zzso Each zzso evolved separately without influencing the strain development of the zzso Although the substitution rates of both zzso were relatively similar, zzso vaccination appears to increase the zzso of type 2 zzso resulting in the emergence of three novel type 2 zzso clusters in the zzso including an zzso zzso which disappeared within the month following zzso zzso Two additional clusters included one related to the zzso vaccine and one related to the endemic cluster of the zzso
