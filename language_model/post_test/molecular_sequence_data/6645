Because of their potential usefulness as natural food zzso increased interest has focused on zzso from zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within a 35 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and it is active against zzso zzso Using reverse genetic zzso an 8 zzso zzso zzso has been cloned that contains the zzso zzso structural zzso zzso which encodes a precursor of the zzso with a 24 zzso acid zzso extension ending with a zzso motif upstream of the zzso site, which is typical of class II zzso Four other putative genes are associated with zzso within two divergent putative zzso In addition to zzso the first putative zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso similar to that zzso by zzso in the zzso A zzso whose function remains to be zzso The second putative zzso contains three zzso two of which, zzso and zzso zzso proteins that resemble zzso zzso and accessory factors, zzso For three other class II zzso systems zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso these proteins have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso independently of the general zzso zzso zzso The last putative gene zzso does not resemble any previously characterized zzso zzso concerning the zzso expression of the cloned zzso in zzso zzso zzso suggest that the maturation and zzso functions dedicated to zzso F (another class II zzso are efficient for zzso zzso as zzso This characteristic may be of great interest in the development of industrial zzso starters producing multiple zzso zzso
