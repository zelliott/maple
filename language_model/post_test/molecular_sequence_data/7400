Two zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso an zzso protein from zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The number of zzso genes was estimated to be more than four copies per zzso by zzso Southern zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were located zzso within 12 zzso in the same zzso These two genes zzso identical zzso zzso though 15 zzso zzso were different in the coding region and the zzso size zzso About zzso of the zzso spanning 800 zzso in the zzso region zzso were identical between the two zzso This zzso region contained characteristic sequences such as a repetitive element of zzso zzso zzso an zzso response element zzso zzso and two putative zzso zzso response elements zzso zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed that the fat body contains at least three different nuclear proteins zzso by bacteria which bind to the zzso suggesting that these proteins may be involved in zzso expression triggered by zzso
