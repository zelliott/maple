zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso sequences have so far been isolated from a broad range of zzso but not from zzso zzso We constructed a zzso library from zzso of Norway spruce zzso zzso and identified zzso coding for zzso A full-length zzso zzso was zzso It consists of zzso zzso and has an open reading frame zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed a higher similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso species zzso than to the zzso and C4 forms zzso The putative motif zzso for zzso zzso which is zzso in all zzso zzso zzso so far, is also present in this zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of spruce zzso DNA under zzso conditions using the zzso zzso as a zzso probe showed a complex zzso pattern, indicating the presence of additional zzso sequences in the zzso of the zzso In contrast, the probe zzso to only a few bands under zzso zzso Whereas this zzso gene is highly expressed in roots of zzso a low-level expression can be detected in zzso and adult zzso A molecular zzso of plant zzso including the spruce zzso sequence revealed that the spruce zzso sequence is clustered with zzso and zzso zzso form zzso including the only zzso C4 form characterized so zzso
