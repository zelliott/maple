We have examined the zzso processing of G alpha zzso expressed zzso in rat zzso and zzso zzso hybrid cells, and after zzso of zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso of alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso 11 and alpha 12 has been detected by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of alpha o occurs zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso suggesting possible dynamic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif has been zzso zzso zzso of alpha o has been used to zzso the site of modification as a zzso zzso next to the zzso zzso zzso in a novel zzso modification motif zzso The zzso alpha o zzso is still zzso but shows reduced membrane zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may regulate G alpha zzso and zzso
