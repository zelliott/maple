Using four cell lines including zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, two fluorescent agents, zzso and zzso zzso were compared as indicators in a functional zzso of zzso zzso were incubated with 4 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso for 45 zzso and then the zzso zzso of the agent was measured using a flow zzso zzso (20 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso was added just before the fluorescent zzso zzso patterns were also studied 60 zzso after incubation with or without zzso and zzso Increased zzso zzso and a delayed zzso pattern of zzso by zzso and zzso were demonstrated in zzso resistant zzso and zzso cells, indicating that zzso is another good indicator of zzso However, a similar, but lower, increase in zzso and a delayed zzso pattern of zzso by zzso and zzso were also demonstrated even in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso was not affected by zzso and zzso To further study the zzso dependency of zzso another cell line, zzso expressing minimum zzso zzso was zzso Increased zzso and a delayed zzso pattern of zzso but not zzso with zzso or zzso were again demonstrated in zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso of zzso may be zzso influenced by zzso and zzso at very low levels of zzso zzso while the influx and zzso patterns of zzso may be specifically affected by zzso zzso
