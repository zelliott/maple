The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso have zzso defects in zzso response, including decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso and altered expression of some zzso zzso We isolated the zzso gene by using a zzso cloning approach and found that it encodes a member of the basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso The previously characterized zzso zzso encodes a protein that lacks the DNA binding and zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression provide evidence for zzso regulation, zzso by other zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso of seed and zzso zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso plants indicates that zzso regulates a subset of late zzso genes during both zzso zzso
