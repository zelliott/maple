The DNA binding activity of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso B can be controlled by a variety of zzso mechanisms, including interactions with inhibitor proteins and by its zzso zzso The zzso B family of zzso factors bind to zzso B motif sequences found in promoter and zzso regions of a wide range of cellular and viral zzso zzso zzso B family proteins are held in the zzso in an zzso zzso binding form by zzso I zzso B inhibitor zzso When the cell is activated by one of a wide range of zzso typically those associated with the cellular response to pathogens or stress, zzso degradation of I zzso B inhibitor proteins allows active zzso B to zzso to the nucleus where it activates zzso of responsive zzso The initial trigger for I zzso B degradation is a zzso zzso zzso by an as yet unidentified zzso which appears to target I zzso B for the zzso addition of multiple copies of the zzso zzso This modification subsequently allows the zzso degradation of the zzso I zzso B by the cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was recently shown that increased I zzso zzso expression in the zzso leads to I zzso zzso accumulating in the nuclear zzso removing zzso zzso B, and reducing zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes could then be actively zzso to the zzso allowing the cell to respond to further zzso
