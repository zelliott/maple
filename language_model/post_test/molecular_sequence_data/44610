To determine the worldwide frequency of a common zzso zzso zzso because of two point zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso 

zzso study on zzso status zzso and zzso in serum (or zzso samples from Finland zzso and zzso Estonia, Poland, Sweden, The Netherlands, United zzso Italy, South Africa zzso zzso China, Japan, and the United States zzso and zzso 

Academic research zzso 

Ambulatory adult men and women zzso zzso zzso with minor illnesses and no known zzso zzso 

A single blood sample was collected from each zzso 

The zzso status was determined by two zzso zzso using zzso zzso One zzso 1) only recognizes the zzso zzso the other zzso 2) recognizes equally zzso and zzso zzso The ratio of zzso 1 to zzso 2 indicates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso One population zzso was studied by DNA analysis using zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso 

The carrier frequency of the zzso zzso beta zzso varied from zzso in zzso Hispanics to zzso in zzso of northern zzso The zzso zzso beta zzso tended to be more common in populations from Northern Europe as compared with those from zzso 

The high frequency of the zzso beta zzso worldwide makes it an important zzso factor when obtaining disproportionately low zzso levels with some zzso zzso The zzso zzso may contribute to some zzso of the zzso zzso
