zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and one of the earliest zzso zzso The zzso zzso via asexual zzso zzso and lacks all natural means of lateral gene zzso A system is developed here for long-term expression of a foreign gene in this zzso by exploiting zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso a zzso zzso virus that zzso many zzso zzso An in zzso transcript of the cloned zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso region flanked by zzso and 3' fragments of zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells peaked on day 2 at levels 6 orders of magnitude above zzso zzso of this foreign gene remained at zzso of its peak level after 30 days in the absence of selective zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as zzso zzso and packaged into zzso zzso The zzso zzso were partially zzso from the zzso helper virus by zzso equilibrium zzso zzso and used to zzso zzso zzso At zzso of infection of 100 or higher, these zzso zzso were able to initiate new rounds of expression of zzso activity in the zzso zzso Thus, the engineered zzso can be successfully used to introduce and efficiently express a zzso gene in this zzso zzso
