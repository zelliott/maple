During over a decade of study on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 2003, we discovered that the presence of an zzso instead of zzso zzso within the zzso backbone significantly changed the secondary structure of the native zzso In addition, the target zzso was subsequently generated by an zzso zzso zzso migration zzso These findings led to the development of a novel method, called zzso zzso zzso for the synthesis of peptides containing difficult zzso Further application of the method to Alzheimer's zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso could be effectively zzso and stored without spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso could then be obtained from the zzso under zzso experimental zzso We named the zzso zzso as zzso zzso because of its zzso and easy one-way zzso to the parent zzso zzso Application of the click zzso has provided a new basis for the investigation of the biological functions of zzso by zzso zzso of its zzso The zzso zzso method has further evolved as a general method for peptides synthesis with our recent developments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso segment zzso zzso zzso units have enabled routine use of the zzso zzso method by avoiding the often difficult zzso reaction on zzso zzso segment zzso zzso has been achieved by employing zzso possessing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of long zzso by zzso segment zzso has thus become possible at zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso zzso As the zzso zzso method becomes more widely zzso we have composed this review to facilitate its application for the production of peptides and zzso
