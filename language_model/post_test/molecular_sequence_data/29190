zzso protein zzso of infectious zzso disease virus zzso is a zzso which separates zzso and zzso from the zzso We studied the importance of zzso and zzso acid on zzso at the zzso junction and zzso the role of the proposed zzso zzso and zzso zzso site using five different zzso on zzso Our results suggest that the replacement of zzso by zzso in zzso motifs in zzso II zzso influences zzso zzso processing by zzso and also indicate the presence of an alternative zzso zzso zzso on D zzso prevented the zzso at the zzso zzso but we have found that independently of the importance of those zzso in zzso D has an important role as part of the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso zzso completely abolished zzso zzso zzso on zzso induced a partial zzso processing when it was replaced by zzso and the replacement of zzso by zzso at zzso induced a prominent change in zzso zzso These results permit us to conclude that zzso zzso has the ability to act according to structural and topographical changes during zzso and zzso processes and allow multiple hit sites, which serve to increase zzso
