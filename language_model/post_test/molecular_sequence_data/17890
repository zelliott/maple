In our studies of zzso we have shown zzso that a single zzso zzso can bind to multiple zzso by different mechanisms, involving zzso and zzso sites, which are regulated differently by zzso zzso Also we showed from the primary sequence of zzso that it is only zzso related to the other zzso alpha zzso In our studies of zzso we have shown that a single zzso may have at least three functional forms, depending on the cell type where zzso In addition, we have expressed functional zzso in zzso cells, resulting in both Coll and zzso binding functions in zzso and increased tumor cell zzso in zzso in nude zzso
