zzso zzso and blood pressure regulation are zzso in part, on interactions between zzso zzso zzso hormones and zzso zzso receptors zzso The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for clearance of zzso hormones from the zzso and displays a zzso for all zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso in contrast to other zzso which are more restricted in their zzso In order to zzso the structural zzso for the binding specificity and zzso of zzso with zzso hormones, we have determined the crystal structures of the complexes of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and with brain zzso zzso zzso A structural comparison of these complexes, with the previous structure of the zzso complex, reveals that zzso uses a zzso inflexible surface to bind three different, highly flexible, zzso zzso The complex structures support a mechanism of rigid zzso rather than zzso plasticity by the zzso While zzso and zzso appear to adopt similar zzso zzso the zzso structure zzso yet shares sets of common zzso contacts with the other zzso The zzso versus selective hormone recognition properties of different zzso appears to derive largely from two cavities on the zzso surfaces, pocket I and pocket II, that serve as zzso sites for hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso
