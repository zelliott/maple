To investigate the zzso zzso properties of the individual zzso motifs of protein zzso D zzso the zzso peptides containing each zzso motif of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso binding to zzso was affected drastically by incubation temperature while that to zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso binding to both zzso C1 peptides gave zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that the two zzso motifs of zzso are functionally equivalent like those of zzso
