The rat bone zzso protein zzso zzso gene was isolated from a rat zzso library and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso whose expression is regulated by zzso D3 zzso The zzso gene consists of 4 zzso separated by 3 zzso and spans almost 1 zzso of zzso The zzso region of the gene contains zzso and zzso elements common to zzso zzso An analysis of approximately 600 zzso of zzso sequence of this gene revealed sequences zzso to regulatory elements for zzso metal zzso and zzso The latter is especially significant since recent evidence suggests that the rat zzso gene can be regulated by zzso This region of the gene also contains numerous pairs of zzso repeat sequences zzso zzso The sequence of the rat zzso gene was compared to that of the recently published human zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso 5, 1885, zzso The coding regions of these two genes share zzso sequence identity, and several regions of the zzso sequences are also well zzso zzso of the sequence of the rat zzso gene will allow studies of its regulation by zzso zzso and other zzso zzso factors, and identification of the regulatory sequence elements zzso
