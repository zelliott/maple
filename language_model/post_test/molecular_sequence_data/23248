It is the forces between the microscopic constituents of materials which to a large extent determine the zzso zzso For example, it is the differences in bonding between the carbon atoms which determines the different physical properties of carbon and zzso The same is true in zzso zzso In zzso systems, there are three common types of long-range interactions between zzso van der zzso forces, electrical double layer forces and zzso zzso In this paper, examples as to how these forces can be modified and even manipulated will be zzso To convincingly demonstrate these effects, it is necessary to measure these interaction zzso We have achieved this by using the principles of atomic force zzso zzso The principle is simple, a small zzso zzso zzso is attached onto a small weak zzso zzso The interaction between this particle and another particle or a surface is measured by monitoring the zzso of the spring as the two particles are moved zzso In this paper, I shall give examples of direct zzso of van der zzso electrical double layer and zzso forces and show how they can be modified and how these modifications affect the properties of bulk zzso Similar principles are involved in the interactions of biological zzso However, nature is much zzso than man such that many of the zzso on cell surfaces are able to specifically zzso only one other zzso An example of this zzso interaction, zzso zzso toxin interacting with the zzso zzso will also be zzso Finally, the zzso of cells to surfaces of different surface zzso has been zzso this is of significance in many fields ranging from zzso of zzso zzso on the one hand to the zzso of surgical implants on the zzso
