Complicated zzso are produced in the separation of zzso labeled zzso zzso labeling of zzso groups on zzso zzso results in the production of zzso reaction products, where zzso is the number of alpha and zzso zzso groups in the zzso A single label is attached to the zzso by first taking the zzso through one cycle of the zzso degradation zzso All zzso groups are converted to the zzso zzso and the zzso step exposes one zzso group at the zzso of the zzso the fluorescent label is attached to the zzso
