Type II zzso zzso systems are expressed from zzso zzso that zzso a zzso protein toxin and its zzso protein zzso These gene zzso are often present in multiple copies on bacterial zzso where they have been reported to regulate stress adaptation and persistence during zzso zzso We have identified a novel type II zzso cassette in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso that consists of the toxin zzso zzso and its antitoxin, zzso zzso is zzso and forms a zzso zzso complex with zzso which zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds its own promoter via zzso and zzso its zzso its zzso is strongly induced in zzso zzso by various zzso encountered by the bacterial cell during infection of a zzso zzso Although highly divergent at the primary sequence level, an atomic resolution zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso reveals a secondary zzso related to the zzso family of type II zzso zzso However, overall zzso structural zzso to other zzso family toxins is zzso A functional characterization of zzso by zzso zzso demonstrates a correspondence between its in zzso activity as a zzso and control of zzso in zzso We further present an analysis of the zzso and variable features of structure required for zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso toxin zzso This structural investigation informs a model of the zzso as an zzso flexible scaffold that has been selected to bind structurally disparate zzso and exhibit distinct toxin activities including zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso
