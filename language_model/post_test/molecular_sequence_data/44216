The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso contains several cryptic plasmids of zzso zzso and about 50 or 100 zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso has been analyzed and is reported zzso This zzso contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso Six open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides of larger than 90 zzso acid zzso were located on both strands of zzso zzso B codes for a potential replication protein containing zzso zzso zzso for which there are three zzso proteins zzso by other zzso zzso zzso C encodes a zzso of 93 zzso acids which shares zzso with products of two zzso found in the protein zzso zzso of the products of zzso A, D, zzso and F could not be found in the protein zzso zzso of a zzso DNA intermediate during replication of zzso indicates that this zzso may also replicate by a rolling circle zzso as has been reported for zzso and zzso from the same strain of zzso zzso zzso
