The mouse zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene is expressed primarily in zzso Various promoter motifs that participate in restricted gene expression have been zzso To define mechanisms of regulation further, we determined the DNA sequence of 12 zzso zzso this zzso We show that two zzso zzso and zzso that have characteristics of zzso zzso including ubiquitous zzso closely flank zzso We found the zzso structure and the organization of the gene locus to be zzso between the mouse and the human zzso suggestive of functional zzso zzso I hypersensitivity zzso comparing expressing and zzso cells indicate that the zzso structure surrounding zzso is not greatly altered for zzso The zzso expression of zzso located between two zzso zzso provides a distinctive model for restricted zzso regulation from a zzso zzso
