To investigate DNA replication zzso across the nuclear zzso of budding zzso deep sequencing was used to establish the pattern of zzso replication errors generated by an zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 16 zzso identified zzso zzso generated over 33 generations by zzso Pol zzso in a mismatch repair defective zzso zzso of sequences zzso these zzso identified zzso motifs for Pol zzso replication zzso The zzso were distributed evenly across all 16 zzso The vast majority were transitions that occurred with a strand bias that varied in a predictable manner relative to known functional origins of zzso This strand bias strongly supports the idea that Pol zzso is primarily a lagging strand zzso during replication across the entire nuclear zzso
