zzso among zzso zzso strains in gastric zzso adherence is zzso to contribute to pathogen fitness in the zzso diverse human zzso zzso zzso adherence to zzso and Lewis b zzso blood group zzso in the human stomach is zzso by the blood group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Swedish and zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso exhibit zzso zzso but here we show that the zzso gene is present in each of 10 zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso identified occasional bacterial cells with a zzso zzso in populations of zzso zzso Thus, zzso seemed to be a zzso zzso To model zzso transition into the zzso zzso mode, zzso clones were isolated from zzso strains by panning with zzso beads and zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that a zzso zzso of strain zzso regained zzso binding by zzso of the formerly silent zzso gene into the expressed and partially zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with an affinity similar to that of zzso zzso zzso but its expression level was lower and was subject to phase variation through zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with strain zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso contributes to bacterial fitness and results in some clones having potential for periodic zzso and zzso of zzso appropriate for intensity of the host response to zzso
