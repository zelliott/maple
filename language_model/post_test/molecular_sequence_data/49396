zzso are the important plant cell zzso where photosynthesis takes zzso Throughout this process, reaction center proteins are zzso and subsequently replenished by zzso gene zzso In addition to well defined zzso mechanisms at the zzso and protein level, the zzso of zzso DNA into zzso precursors has been a focal point of studies in this zzso Evidence has become available for a central role of a zzso protein zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso because of its association with the zzso zzso zzso The recent cloning of the zzso gene has resulted in a full-length zzso for a protein related to the zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso yet with an additional zzso transit zzso The corresponding zzso termed zzso was shown to be associated with the major zzso zzso zzso zzso Both authentic zzso and zzso zzso have comparable general properties in zzso and both are subject to regulation by the zzso zzso zzso Based on the physical and functional zzso it is anticipated that the cloned protein can help clarify the functional role of the zzso zzso in zzso including the identification of interaction partners at the interface between zzso zzso signaling and gene zzso
