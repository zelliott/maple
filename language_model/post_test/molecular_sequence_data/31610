zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso and zzso in protein quality control in the zzso zzso zzso Most of our zzso knowledge came from zzso studies, but our understanding of plant zzso is zzso Many plants contain more than two zzso that form two distinct groups: zzso and zzso Previous studies on plant zzso were focused on their zzso function, but recent studies revealed a crucial role for the zzso zzso in zzso retention of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in complete folding of a plant immunity zzso zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular basis of the functional zzso of the zzso We have recently shown that the zzso domain of zzso which is rich in basic zzso is essential for retaining zzso in the zzso however, its role in assisting zzso folding has not been zzso Here, we used an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso background as a genetic system to investigate the functional importance of two basic zzso clusters in the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that a highly zzso basic zzso zzso zzso is essential but a less zzso basic zzso zzso is zzso for the quality control function of zzso that retains zzso in the zzso and zzso the complete folding of zzso
