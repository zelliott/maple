zzso infectious anemia virus zzso encodes a zzso gene which is closely related to the zzso zzso by the human and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso clones revealed that the zzso message is composed of three zzso the first two zzso zzso and the third may zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso translation is initiated at a zzso zzso in the first zzso of the message, perhaps allowing an additional level of gene zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso combined with functional analyses of zzso zzso in zzso cells, have provided some unique insights into the domain structure of this zzso zzso zzso has a zzso basic domain, a highly zzso 16 zzso acid core domain, but not the zzso region, that is present in the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso Thus zzso encodes a relatively simple version of this kind of zzso
