zzso are important secondary zzso in many zzso and their zzso pattern determines their color, stability, and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and may also require zzso zzso We report the identification of genes zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso regulation in zzso zzso of the genes zzso and zzso was demonstrated by zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso which altered flower color and zzso composition as zzso zzso was expressed in grapes before zzso when zzso zzso are made, and all three genes were expressed after zzso when zzso zzso are zzso In berry skin, expression of all three genes was low at the onset of zzso zzso but increased after zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in seeds but not zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso expression was correlated with expression of both zzso and zzso in the different grape zzso In contrast to red grapes, where zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed during zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in white grapes during zzso was extremely low, suggesting a difference in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in grapes is coordinated with the zzso of the respective zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso the regulation of zzso zzso could be used to modify zzso composition of zzso
