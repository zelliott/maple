zzso zzso zzso activity zzso from zzso of tall and dwarf varieties of pea zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso using zzso seed zzso as donor zzso and an zzso as zzso zzso zzso I and II showed little zzso during the period 15 to 21 d after zzso zzso activity remained relatively constant and was unaffected by zzso zzso acid zzso A single application of zzso to the dwarf zzso resulted in a small enhancement of zzso in zzso III between d 17 and 21 and caused a small increase in zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso applications of zzso caused zzso V to zzso between d 20 and 26, to the same extent as in the tall zzso and zzso led to greatly elevated zzso activity zzso per unit fresh weight, per unit of zzso zzso and per zzso Thus, zzso activity correlated with zzso length in pea zzso the possibility that this represents a zzso relationship is zzso
