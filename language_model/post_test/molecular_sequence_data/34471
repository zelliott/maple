zzso zzso recognition during zzso zzso zzso is zzso directly by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and indirectly by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To dissect the complexity and functional roles of zzso zzso recognition in zzso zzso potential zzso zzso receptors were zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso and zzso families displayed strong affinities for zzso zzso chains (the major zzso zzso indicating that they are involved in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso uses distinct zzso as primary zzso zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso knockout or zzso interference zzso zzso of potential zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that only the zzso zzso gave clear zzso The zzso zzso showed decreased zzso zzso increased zzso core complexes, and zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso Surprisingly, the observed zzso zzso were rescued by a zzso zzso defective in zzso recognition, indicating that the zzso of zzso in zzso but not zzso recognition function is responsible for the zzso zzso Our results suggest that redundant recognition pathways likely are used in zzso to target zzso zzso for zzso degradation and that their specific roles in zzso require further zzso
