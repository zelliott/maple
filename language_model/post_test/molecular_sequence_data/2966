zzso factors of the zzso class possess a single cut domain and a divergent zzso They regulate gene networks by controlling the expression of other zzso factors and they play an important role in cell differentiation and zzso We identified earlier in zzso zzso zzso the founding member of the class, and zzso zzso We have now characterized in the mouse a third zzso member, which we call zzso Its gene is located on zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso displays 51% zzso acid identity with zzso and 50% with zzso zzso has a zzso specificity similar to that of zzso and it is a zzso of gene zzso zzso zzso is found in brain, stomach, and upper zzso in the adult and embryonic zzso Our earlier work on zzso and the expression patterns of the three zzso zzso genes suggest that they all participate to the control of organ development from the zzso and zzso zzso
