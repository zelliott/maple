zzso side chains are often involved in zzso and zzso acid zzso Due to a number of factors, resonance assignment and detection of zzso involving the zzso side chains via standard zzso techniques can be zzso We present here an approach to characterization of the interaction between a zzso zzso and four zzso zzso that line the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Previously published zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cell 77, zzso zzso data provide a partial description of this interaction, including contacts between the zzso region of zzso 59 and the zzso zzso aromatic zzso Further characterization has now been accomplished by using zzso and zzso zzso relaxation studies of zzso N zzso and C zzso zzso respectively, and zzso exchange rates of zzso H zzso zzso zzso between the chemical shifts of the zzso zzso groups of the free zzso domain in zzso and zzso buffers or in complex with zzso have provided insight into specific interactions with the zzso and the aromatic ring of the zzso The resulting data are consistent with the most stable hydrogen bonds to zzso donated by the zzso 39 zzso and the two zzso 37 zzso groups and with zzso aromatic ring interactions involving the zzso 39 and possibly the zzso 18 zzso zzso
