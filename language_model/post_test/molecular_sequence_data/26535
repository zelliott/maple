The Tibetan zzso zzso zzso is a zzso species that lives at an altitude of zzso m above sea level on the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that is abundantly expressed in zzso skeletal and cardiac zzso Numerous studies have implicated that zzso regulates zzso expression to allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxic zzso Few studies have yet looked at the effect of zzso on the adaptation to severe environmental stress on zzso To investigate how the Tibetan zzso zzso has adapted to a high altitude environment at the molecular level, we cloned and analyzed the zzso gene from zzso compared the expression of zzso zzso and protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle between zzso and low altitude zzso The results indicated that the full-length zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso with a 111 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso a zzso zzso 3' zzso and a 465 zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of 154 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence and the deduced zzso acid sequence were highly zzso with that of other zzso When comparing the zzso sequence from zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso variations were observed at zzso 21 zzso and 78 zzso and these variations lead to changes in the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso But these zzso acid zzso are unlikely to effect the ability of binding oxygen because their location is less important, which is revealed by the secondary structure and zzso structure of zzso zzso elaborated by zzso zzso However, the results of zzso expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles showed that they were both significantly higher than that in plain sheep not only in zzso but also protein zzso We speculated that the higher expression of zzso in zzso cardiac and skeletal muscles improves their ability to obtain and store oxygen under hypoxic zzso This study indicated that zzso didn't improve the ability of carrying oxygen by changing the molecular structure of zzso but through increasing the expression of zzso in cardiac and skeletal zzso
