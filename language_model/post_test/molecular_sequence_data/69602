We have characterized the zzso zzso from both rabbit zzso zzso and bovine zzso The zzso complex contains eight zzso zzso zzso acid sequence data reveal that one of these is zzso zzso 1 zzso while the other seven are zzso zzso implicating the existence of a zzso family of zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso ring complex from bovine zzso can facilitate the folding of both zzso and zzso although, as in the case of zzso from zzso zzso two zzso are required for the generation of properly folded zzso An additional zzso of zzso may associate with the zzso depending on the zzso procedure zzso We propose that a highly zzso region in these zzso and in other zzso of the zzso zzso family zzso in zzso zzso
