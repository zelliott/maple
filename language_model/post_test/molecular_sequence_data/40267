The zzso protein of the influenza A virus zzso contributes to viral zzso by a mechanism that is not well zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso and to be targeted by the zzso T cell zzso In this study, we examined the downstream effects of zzso protein during zzso infection by measuring expression of the cellular genes in response to infection with zzso zzso and zzso knockout viruses in human lung zzso zzso zzso virus infection resulted in a significant induction of genes involved in innate zzso zzso out the zzso gene strongly decreased the magnitude of expression of cellular genes implicated in zzso response and zzso class I zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso innate immune zzso Biological network analysis revealed the zzso zzso as a link between zzso and zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso and zzso gene reporter zzso we determined that zzso mediates an zzso of zzso expression that is dependent on zzso but not on zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses knocked out for the zzso and/or the zzso viral protein 1 (the viral zzso of the zzso zzso genes provide further evidence that zzso increases zzso expression and that zzso viral protein 1 strongly zzso the effect of zzso on the innate zzso Finally, we compared the effect of zzso zzso taken from several zzso strains on zzso expression and found that zzso zzso induction is significantly influenced by its zzso acid zzso demonstrating its importance in the host cell response triggered by zzso zzso
