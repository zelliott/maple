A common method for the zzso of zzso zzso is the use of mercurial zzso zzso of zzso zzso by soluble zzso takes place as a three-step mechanism with a final zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso In this study zzso bound mercury in the form of mercurial zzso was chosen to probe zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not zzso since the final zzso zzso with removal of the zzso motif could not take zzso An intermediate form of the zzso was bound to the zzso Its zzso sequence determination proved zzso of the zzso zzso bond leaving the zzso of the zzso domain for zzso attachment to the mercurial zzso This gives further evidence of a zzso mechanism involving zzso
