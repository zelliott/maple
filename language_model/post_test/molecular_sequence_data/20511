Despite extensive characterization of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso properties of the isolated zzso remain zzso In light of recent reports, we proposed that the zzso form of zzso can activate G proteins and be subject to zzso zzso A zzso zzso fused to yellow fluorescent protein zzso was constructed and expressed in insect zzso zzso binds zzso with high zzso displays zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso and is zzso regulated by coupled zzso protein zzso both in insect cell zzso and as zzso protein zzso into a zzso zzso in the form of high density zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso labeled zzso indicates that the zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, zzso imaging of a zzso zzso zzso zzso illustrates a novel method for studying G zzso zzso binding and suggests that one zzso of zzso binds per zzso zzso Together these data support the notion that zzso of the zzso zzso is not required for zzso and zzso binding and that the zzso zzso is the minimal functional unit in regard to G protein zzso and strong zzso regulation of zzso binding by G zzso
