Recently, we identified zzso 1 zzso as a zzso gene for schizophrenia in the zzso population, by a combined linkage and association zzso Here, we report the first study evaluating the relevance of zzso to schizophrenia in a population outside zzso zzso representing a core zzso zzso found in zzso at the zzso end of the zzso gene were zzso in zzso unrelated Scottish patients and zzso unrelated Scottish control zzso This zzso consisted of five zzso markers and two zzso which all appear to be in strong linkage zzso For the Scottish patients and control subjects, zzso zzso were estimated by maximum likelihood, using the zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso among the Scottish patients was significantly greater than that among the control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso The estimated risk ratio was zzso which is in keeping with our report of unrelated zzso patients zzso Three of the seven markers in the zzso gave zzso P values ranging from zzso to zzso for the zzso contributing to the zzso zzso This direct replication of zzso association in a second population further implicates zzso as a factor that contributes to the zzso of zzso
