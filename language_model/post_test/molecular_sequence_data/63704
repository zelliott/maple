A survey of amplified zzso length zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso variation was conducted to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso a key species of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso with a zzso distribution in the Eastern European zzso The zzso experienced a different glacial history from the zzso local glaciers were present only in the highest zzso while zzso zzso extended over larger areas related to their present distribution in this zzso We asked: zzso whether in the zzso a zzso plant exhibits a complex zzso structure or rather signatures of recent zzso and zzso whether the zzso part of the zzso distribution in the zzso resulted from a recent colonization from the zzso or from a restricted expansion from separate Eastern Alpine zzso Our study revealed a clear zzso pattern in zzso supported by zzso groups of distinct zzso zzso zzso genetic differentiation was observed between the zzso and the zzso indicating a long-term isolation between populations from these two mountain zzso Further genetic division within the zzso suggests that current zzso distribution is composed of several groups which have been isolated from each other for a long zzso One genetic break separates Western from Southeastern zzso material, which is in line with a classical zzso zzso A further, strongly supported genetic group was identified at the southwestern edge of the zzso zzso In the Eastern zzso genetic traces of glacial survival in separate zzso areas in the zzso northern part and the zzso central part were zzso
