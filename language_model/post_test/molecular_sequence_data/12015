zzso plasmids of the zzso family replicate by a rolling circle zzso requiring the activities of a zzso zzso zzso The initiation event involves zzso zzso bond zzso by zzso within the replication origin, zzso In zzso the zzso proteins also display zzso zzso activity specific for this zzso zzso Although the single site of bond zzso zzso II, is zzso among all members of the zzso family, the zzso zzso proteins are able to discriminate between family members in zzso initiating replication only from the zzso zzso The basis of such specificity is believed to be due to a zzso binding interaction between zzso and a DNA sequence adjacent to the site of zzso bond zzso Using the zzso protein specified by zzso zzso we present data for the physical parameters of zzso complex zzso zzso of the relative strengths of the zzso interactions for different but related zzso target zzso measured by gel mobility shift experiments, has yielded data that are in zzso with the known specificity of the protein in zzso zzso competition experiments demonstrate that this interaction is indeed attributable to the specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods show that a zzso zzso zzso of zzso makes a specific interaction with the zzso III region of its zzso replication zzso Analysis of zzso rates indicates that the interaction between zzso III and the zzso zzso of the protein is required before a productive interaction, namely the zzso bond zzso at the zzso II, can zzso
