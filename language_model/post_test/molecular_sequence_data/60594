Recent work has demonstrated the existence of regulatory zzso channel zzso that are zzso silent but capable of forming zzso with other zzso zzso to modify their zzso We have investigated the molecular zzso of the zzso effects of zzso a silent zzso channel zzso specific of zzso This zzso zzso on zzso channels a marked zzso of zzso zzso and closing zzso We constructed zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins and analyzed the zzso currents resulting from the zzso of the zzso with zzso The data indicate that a region of 59 zzso acids in the N zzso adjacent to the first zzso segment, is the major structural element responsible for the regulatory function of zzso The sequence of this domain of zzso is highly divergent compared with the same region in the other channels of the zzso zzso Replacement of the regulatory zzso of zzso by the equivalent of zzso leads to loss of zzso function, whereas gain of zzso function is observed when the zzso zzso is transferred to zzso Thus, this study identifies a zzso domain involved in zzso channel gating and in the zzso of this channel by a regulatory zzso
