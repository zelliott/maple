The zzso family of zzso factors regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle zzso DNA zzso repair, and zzso and a variety of other cellular zzso Although zzso proteins are often redundant in function, specificity of binding and activity can zzso For example, zzso but not other zzso family members, was shown previously to bind the zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso This promoter region lacks a consensus zzso binding site, suggesting that zzso may be recruited to the DNA in a unique zzso To further investigate this zzso zzso we have employed a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using various deletions and zzso of the promoter region, we localized the zzso binding site and demonstrated that it was required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The identified site was similar to the zzso consensus zzso site but differed from the consensus at a crucial zzso To address whether zzso directly bound to this zzso site, we demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso of the site, making it more similar to the consensus element, did not improve the ability of zzso to bind the zzso Rather, zzso could no longer bind to the zzso promoter that contained the consensus zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso regulation of the zzso promoter requires both zzso interactions and zzso interaction between zzso and a factor that binds adjacent to the zzso zzso
