The mechanisms that zzso zzso of zzso receptors are investigated using human zzso zzso both wild type and receptors that contain the slow channel zzso syndrome zzso zzso The method uses the program zzso which fits the rate zzso in a specified mechanism directly to a sequence of observed open and shut times by zzso the likelihood of the sequence with exact correction for missed zzso A mechanism with two different binding sites was zzso The rate zzso that apply to the zzso zzso zzso shutting and total zzso zzso were estimated zzso being insensitive to the exact assumptions made during fitting, as expected from simulation zzso They are sufficient to predict the main zzso properties of the zzso The zzso zzso causes an approximately zzso reduction in zzso rate from zzso zzso and a smaller increase in opening rate and mean open zzso These are sufficient to explain the approximately zzso slowing of zzso of miniature synaptic currents seen in zzso The distinction between the two binding sites was less zzso the estimates of rate zzso being dependent to some extent on zzso zzso whether an extra short-lived shut state was included or whether the zzso was zzso The results suggest that the two binding sites differ by roughly zzso in the affinity of the shut zzso for zzso in the wild type, and that in the zzso zzso the lower affinity is increased so the sites become more zzso
