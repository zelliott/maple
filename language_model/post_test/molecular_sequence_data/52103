We have developed a rapid and simple approach for the molecular characterization of zzso zzso by a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction of zzso zzso and direct sequencing of the zzso This method can selectively amplify the alpha zzso or alpha zzso gene or the zzso gene zzso The zzso acid substitution of zzso zzso is due to a zzso zzso at zzso 74 of the alpha zzso zzso that of zzso zzso to a zzso substitution at zzso 56 of the zzso zzso and that of zzso Kaohsiung (or New York) to a zzso substitution at zzso 113 of the zzso zzso The amplified segment zzso the sequence from upstream of the initial zzso behind the Cap site to downstream of the terminal zzso before the zzso addition zzso zzso all zzso zzso should be able to be characterized by this zzso
