zzso zzso are zzso small zzso playing an important regulatory function in plant development and stress zzso Among them, some are zzso zzso in plant and others are only expressed in certain species, tissue or zzso zzso zzso is among the most important greenhouse species in the world, but only a limited number of zzso from cucumber have been identified and the experimental validation of the related zzso targets is still zzso In this study, two independent small zzso libraries from cucumber leaves and roots were constructed, respectively, and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence similarity and hairpin structure zzso a total of 29 known zzso families and 2 novel zzso families containing a total of 64 zzso were zzso zzso analysis revealed that some of the cucumber zzso were zzso expressed in certain zzso With the recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso approach, 21 target zzso of known zzso were identified for the first time in zzso These targets were associated with development, zzso oxygen species zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso Our study provides an overview of zzso expression profile and interaction between zzso and target, which will help further understanding of the important roles of zzso in cucumber zzso
