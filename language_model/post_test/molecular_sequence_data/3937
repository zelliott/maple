The zzso protein is a key regulator of zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso While genetic evidence has shown that it is required for zzso of zzso of zzso genes located on a zzso zzso in this zzso zzso evidence that zzso is a zzso protein has been zzso Although zzso shows extensive zzso to proteins involved in zzso zzso it does not resemble any known conventional zzso zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso binds to the promoter regions of the zzso genes in zzso We also show that zzso forms zzso and higher zzso structures both in zzso and in zzso and that this property is independent of DNA zzso The zzso activity of zzso is distributed over two zzso a zzso zzso motif and a zzso domain likely to form triple coiled zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso which is required for DNA zzso The zzso domain of the protein is also required for DNA binding and zzso gene zzso The possibility that zzso requires a zzso for specific interaction with target promoters in zzso is zzso
