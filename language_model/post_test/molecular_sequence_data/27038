Development and deployment of an effective malaria vaccine would complement existing malaria control zzso A blood stage malaria vaccine candidate, zzso Surface zzso zzso produced as a long synthetic zzso has been shown to be safe in zzso and zzso zzso A phase zzso zzso study was conducted to assess the zzso safety and zzso in children aged 12 to 24 months in zzso Tanzania zzso zzso zzso 

This was a zzso randomized, controlled, dose escalation phase zzso trial, in which children were given one of two different doses of the zzso zzso (15 zzso or 30 zzso or a control vaccine zzso zzso Children were randomly allocated either to the zzso candidate malaria vaccine or the control vaccine administered at a schedule of 0, 1, and 2 zzso zzso with lower and higher doses was staggered for safety reasons starting with the lower zzso The primary zzso was safety and zzso within 28 days zzso Blood samples were obtained at different time points to measure zzso zzso zzso are presented up to 84 days zzso 

A total of 45 children were zzso 15 in each of the two zzso dose groups and 15 in the zzso B zzso There were no important differences in zzso between the two zzso groups and zzso zzso Grade 3 adverse events were zzso only five were detected throughout the study, all of which were transient and resolved without zzso No serious adverse event reported was considered to be related to zzso zzso Both zzso dose regimens zzso strong zzso zzso responses zzso zzso and zzso the zzso involved in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso The zzso reached are similar to those from African adults having reached a state of zzso Furthermore, vaccination induced zzso in all zzso 

The zzso malaria vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated and zzso in children aged zzso months living in a malaria endemic zzso Given the zzso safety and its induction of zzso zzso responses, its efficacy against zzso zzso infection and disease needs to be evaluated in Phase 2 zzso
