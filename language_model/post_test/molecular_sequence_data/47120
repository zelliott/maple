zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and the distribution of alternative transcripts in various zzso zzso was investigated using zzso and zzso It was demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso zzso were represented by two transcripts corresponding to the reported zzso zzso and zzso The acute effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso levels was zzso Seven hours after zzso administration of either 6 zzso of zzso zzso zzso body weight or zzso no significant increase in the levels of either of the two transcripts could be zzso The presence of zzso receptors in the zzso liver was demonstrated in binding zzso using zzso zzso zzso and liver membrane zzso An analysis of a zzso zzso zzso sequence encompassing the three zzso that zzso the E domain suggested that the pattern of zzso site zzso is determined by the degree of zzso of the zzso signals to the consensus zzso site zzso
