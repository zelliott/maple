To zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in humans, we analyzed the zzso gene zzso which is reported to be the zzso gene for HC in the Syrian zzso zzso We performed zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence analyses on the zzso in 102 patients with zzso zzso was detected in zzso 2 of the zzso but not in the other zzso The direct sequencing analysis of zzso 2 revealed a zzso substitution at zzso zzso 84 zzso with no zzso acid zzso zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso of zzso between the patients with HC and the control zzso Patients with HC were classified into 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and familial zzso The zzso frequency of zzso zzso in each of these groups was compared with that of the control zzso The zzso HC group showed a significantly greater frequency of the zzso T than in the control group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No other significant differences were zzso Thus, zzso acid zzso in zzso may not be a common cause of HC in Japanese zzso
