zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is responsible for the induction of zzso and oral warts and plays a critical role in the development of human cervical and zzso zzso We have employed a canine model to develop a systemic vaccine that completely protects against zzso induced oral zzso zzso The major zzso zzso zzso of canine oral zzso zzso was expressed in zzso insect cells in native zzso zzso zzso which zzso into zzso zzso was zzso on zzso zzso and injected zzso into the foot pad of zzso zzso animals developed circulating zzso against zzso and became completely resistant to experimental challenge with zzso zzso zzso was strictly dependent upon native zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso protection was achieved with as little as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso appeared useful for zzso the host immune zzso zzso zzso passively transferred from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso protection from experimental infection with zzso Our results indicate the feasibility of developing a human vaccine to prevent zzso zzso which can progress to zzso
