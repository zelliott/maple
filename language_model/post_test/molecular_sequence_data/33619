Recent genetic studies have challenged the traditional view that the ancestors of British zzso people spread from central Europe during the Iron Age and have suggested a much earlier origin for them as part of the human zzso of Britain at the end of the last zzso Here we propose that small zzso provide an analogue to help resolve this zzso Previous studies have shown that common zzso zzso zzso with particular zzso characteristics and water zzso zzso zzso of a specific zzso zzso DNA lineage have peripheral zzso zzso with striking similarities to that of zzso zzso We show that zzso lineages of three other small zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso field zzso zzso zzso and pygmy shrew zzso zzso also form a zzso zzso We argue that these small zzso most reasonably zzso Britain in a zzso process following the last glacial maximum zzso with zzso driven partial replacement of the first colonists by the second zzso leaving a peripheral geographical distribution for the first zzso We suggest that these natural zzso fringes provide insight into the same phenomenon in humans and support its origin in processes following the end of the zzso
