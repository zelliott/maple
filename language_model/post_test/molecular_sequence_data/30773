A zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso hormone zzso zzso has been isolated from a human fetal skeletal muscle zzso This zzso contains zzso consecutive base pairs identical to a region of a human zzso zzso zzso but the respective long open reading frames zzso this zzso sequence in opposite zzso Thus, human zzso alpha zzso is derived from zzso zzso of the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in human skeletal muscle by Northern zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso reveals zzso identity in the putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso does not bind zzso hormone zzso as has also been found for its rat zzso Interestingly, the human and rat zzso alpha zzso are dissimilar at their zzso ends, corresponding to the first zzso that we have identified in the rat zzso The conservation of the zzso transcribed regions of zzso zzso and zzso alpha in human and rat suggests that this unusual zzso arrangement has an important function, perhaps related to the regulation of gene zzso
