Most zzso genes of zzso which are required for zzso of the zzso are expressed in response to plant zzso The induction of zzso is markedly enhanced by specific zzso zzso generated by both types of compound are zzso into zzso cells via the functions of the zzso zzso sensor zzso A putative zzso zzso known as zzso also functions at a step of the enhancement of zzso induction by zzso To investigate the signal zzso of the enhancement by the zzso we first isolated a zzso zzso of zzso with a base substitution zzso that caused a single zzso acid change in the zzso zzso The zzso exhibited no enhancement of zzso induction by sugar and had severely attenuated zzso on zzso zzso We then isolated two zzso zzso that restored sugar enhancement on the background of this zzso zzso One zzso zzso which exhibited a higher level of sugar enhancement, restored the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were localized in the zzso zzso These results provide genetic evidence for the physical interaction between zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso space of zzso which enhances the zzso signal generated by zzso We also discuss the molecular architecture of the zzso to which the zzso gene zzso
