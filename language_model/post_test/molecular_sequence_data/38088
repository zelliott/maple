The zzso zzso was used to map DNA zzso sites induced by zzso B at zzso resolution in zzso DNA zzso from cultured human colon zzso zzso B, one of the zzso group of zzso zzso is characterized as zzso with the added ability to zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso formed in zzso DNA were zzso into DNA strand breaks by hot zzso treatment, and fragments containing zzso breaks were then amplified in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites observed in zzso 9 of the zzso gene revealed that the most high zzso sites for zzso B were found to be zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the DNA zzso sites in naked zzso zzso DNA also showed that zzso B preferred zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, it can be concluded that the sequence selective DNA zzso formation induced by the zzso zzso zzso B, in zzso DNA is similar to that observed in naked zzso zzso
