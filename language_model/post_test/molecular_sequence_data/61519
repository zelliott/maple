zzso glacial events during the zzso fragmented and displaced populations throughout the northern zzso Different models of the effects of these zzso events predict distinct zzso and population genetic outcomes for zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso promoting zzso genetic differentiation and zzso influencing genetic diversity was tested within a zzso framework using the zzso zzso zzso The spatial focus for the study was zzso which spans eastern zzso and northwestern North America, and was a zzso crossroads and potential high arctic zzso during zzso Variation in zzso DNA zzso b and control zzso 214 zzso and nuclear DNA zzso zzso 63 zzso was investigated across the zzso zzso Close genetic relationships among populations on either side of the zzso Strait are consistent with a history of periodic land connections between North America and zzso A genetic zzso observed in western zzso between members of a Central Asian zzso and a zzso zzso is geographically zzso with glacial advances and with zzso zzso identified in other zzso Divergent island populations in southern Alaska were probably initially isolated by glacial zzso but subsequent differentiation has resulted from zzso Tests of the genetic effects of zzso colonization were largely consistent with expansion accompanied by founder effect zzso which yields reduced diversity in populations from recently zzso zzso Evidence that populations in the zzso zzso share a history of expansion from a zzso ancestral population suggests that zzso was zzso by a small founder population from central Asia, which subsequently expanded in zzso
