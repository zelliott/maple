zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are classified into 3 groups based on their sequence similarity and zzso recognition zzso Recently, we identified a zzso zzso zzso which is about zzso zzso from the 3 zzso zzso However, both the zzso zzso selectivity and the pharmacological profile of zzso as zzso with zzso zzso and a few compounds, look similar to those of zzso zzso zzso In the present study we carefully examined the pharmacological profile of zzso and compared it to those of the rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso representative of zzso II and III zzso The pharmacological profile of zzso was found to be similar to that of zzso and only very small differences could be identified at the level of their zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that the binding sites of these two receptors are zzso To further document this idea, a zzso model of the zzso binding domain was constructed based on the low sequence similarity with zzso zzso acid binding zzso and was used to identify the zzso that possibly constitute the zzso recognition zzso Interestingly, this putative binding pocket was found to be very well zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that there has been a strong selective pressure during evolution to maintain the zzso recognition selectivity of zzso
