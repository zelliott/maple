Organic zzso zzso 1 zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso studies have shown its critical role in the zzso zzso of a variety of organic zzso including several clinically important zzso In addition, zzso is also involved in the pharmacological effect of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to these functional zzso the regulatory mechanism of zzso expression is poorly zzso It was recently demonstrated that the expression of zzso was markedly reduced in the zzso of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso evidence for the involvement of zzso and further analyses are required to illustrate the zzso regulation of zzso genes in more zzso zzso analysis of the potential zzso factor binding sites revealed that the zzso was zzso in the zzso region of human and mouse zzso zzso The zzso expression of mouse organic zzso zzso 1 was drastically reduced in zzso mice compared with that in zzso mice, which was consistent with a previous report zzso et zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso alone or both zzso and zzso enhanced the activity of human and mouse zzso promoters in the zzso zzso whereas zzso alone was not zzso zzso in the zzso significantly reduced this zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso found in the human zzso promoter was demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso These results provide convincing evidence for the involvement of zzso in the zzso expression of human and mouse zzso in the zzso
