A novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from activated sludge collected from a zzso wastewater treatment zzso The strain was able to degrade about 85 % of 100 zzso zzso zzso within 5 days of zzso Growth occurred in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso 1 % zzso zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso internal membrane structures and zzso growth were not zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso 10 zzso and the major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso zzso : zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparison revealed that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso and was related most closely to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso The combination of zzso analysis, zzso characteristics and zzso data supports the suggestion that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, based on the characterization data obtained in this study, it is proposed that zzso zzso should be reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
