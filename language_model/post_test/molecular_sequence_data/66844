zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is enhanced by zzso changes from the zzso closed form to the zzso zzso open form of the zzso inserted zzso domain as shown by work with zzso I zzso However, affinity zzso of zzso on the cell surface by zzso zzso such as zzso has yet to be demonstrated by zzso zzso We characterize a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso that has been developed by zzso display that selectively targets the zzso open zzso of the zzso I zzso zzso discriminates among zzso zzso and zzso states of zzso Furthermore, zzso functions as a zzso zzso that binds only upon zzso and requires zzso for zzso Compared with the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a tighter binding to the open I domain and a zzso slower off zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates affinity increases on a subset zzso zzso of zzso cell surface zzso molecules upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with global zzso changes of zzso to the extended zzso zzso increase zzso by zzso is transient and zzso 2 to 5 zzso after zzso
