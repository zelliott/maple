The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is characterized by its high zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, as opposed to the majority of zzso zzso this zzso requires metallic zzso for its zzso rather than for its zzso These features make zzso zzso attractive as a template for industrial zzso Based on previously solved crystal structures and sequence zzso we identified zzso acids that are zzso important for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to the suggested essential zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso coli, are presumed to be the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso of these zzso resulted in totally inactive zzso thus demonstrating their critical role in the zzso zzso A zzso model of zzso zzso was constructed, and its analysis highlighted another set of zzso which may be crucial for the recognition and processing of zzso zzso these zzso were subjected to zzso zzso The replacement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids with zzso seriously affected the zzso activities, and suggestions about the roles of these zzso in the zzso mechanism are zzso The zzso zzso strongly increased the zzso affinity for zzso and decreased the affinity for zzso compared to that of the zzso zzso showing the implication of this zzso acid in zzso zzso
