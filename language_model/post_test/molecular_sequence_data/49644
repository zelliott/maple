The initial interaction of zzso zzso zzso with host cells occurs through direct binding of the major zzso protein zzso with cell membrane molecules containing terminal zzso zzso however, these zzso zzso molecules have not yet been zzso Analysis of the zzso protein primary sequences of all zzso strains revealed the presence of zzso zzso motifs in the DE and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and at the N zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso of the zzso zzso strain in mouse Swiss zzso zzso is significantly reduced only in the presence of natural zzso zzso carrying an zzso motif or zzso directed against the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells increases viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso prior to or after virus zzso blocks this increased zzso without affecting virus binding to zzso Taken together, these data indicate that expression of zzso zzso enhances zzso to zzso probably by acting as one of the zzso zzso
