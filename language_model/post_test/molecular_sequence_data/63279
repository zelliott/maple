The complete zzso zzso sequence of an Indian isolate of Lily zzso virus zzso was determined by sequencing 11 overlapping zzso fragments of different zzso The zzso consisted of zzso zzso excluding the zzso zzso tail and contained six open reading frames zzso coding protein for zzso 220 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso (106 zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso from zzso to 3' zzso zzso was analyzed with other previously characterized full zzso of zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Triple gene block proteins zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso (16 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence revealed that Indian isolate is closely related to The Netherlands zzso zzso The overall zzso of the present zzso isolate shares zzso zzso sequence zzso with the previously characterized zzso The zzso analysis, sequence alignment studies, and zzso detection program zzso analysis provided evidence for the occurrence of zzso between the present isolate zzso as major parent and The Netherlands zzso zzso and Chinese isolate zzso as minor parents in two different independent zzso zzso Based on the zzso analysis, it is suggested that the 3' end of the present isolate is involved in zzso with Chinese isolate zzso and gave rise to the Korean zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of complete zzso sequence from India and also the first evidence of zzso zzso in zzso
