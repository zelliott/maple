Today, zzso still relies mainly on zzso followed by zzso for detection and identification of zzso which might characterize a certain state of disease, indicate toxicity or even predict zzso We zzso the classical zzso approach for the evaluation of early protein zzso which are zzso for chemically induced zzso in zzso We were able to identify statistically significantly zzso proteins in zzso exposed rat liver zzso Based on literature data, biological relevance in the early molecular process of zzso could be suggested for most of these potential zzso However, in order to ensure reliable results and to create the zzso necessary for integration in routine zzso studies in the future, these protein expression patterns need to be zzso using independent technology zzso In the current study, we evaluated the usefulness of zzso zzso technology zzso zzso Framingham, zzso a recently introduced zzso protein zzso method, for zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso the regulation of 26 zzso derived protein zzso could be zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed highly comparable fold changes using both zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis delivered further potential zzso with biological relevance to the processes of zzso zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B1 zzso zzso Our results show both the usefulness of zzso zzso technology for zzso zzso as well as for identification of further potential marker zzso which are indicative for liver zzso
