The zzso zzso zzso gene was identified by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the coding region of zzso comprises 411 zzso and specifies a protein of 136 zzso acid zzso with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso A defined zzso zzso zzso zzso completely lacked zzso activity and exhibited zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso coli zzso zzso genes were cloned into a zzso expression zzso to allow gene analysis in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso The enhanced expression of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the formation of two distinct proteins in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso leading to the assumption that the zzso gene product is zzso processed into two zzso By increased expression of zzso in zzso zzso the activity of zzso was zzso increased, whereas the zzso gene resulted only in a zzso zzso The similar experiment performed in zzso coli revealed that zzso achieved a zzso increase and that zzso achieved a zzso increase of zzso zzso The effect of the zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso coli was studied with a view to zzso zzso Only by expression of the zzso gene was sufficient zzso produced to abolish its limiting effect on zzso zzso In cultures expressing the zzso zzso the zzso zzso production was still dependent on external zzso zzso The enhanced expression of zzso in zzso coli yielded the highest amount of zzso in the culture zzso with a specific productivity of 140 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
