We investigated genetic variation in asexual zzso members of the water flea zzso zzso complex from a set of 12 zzso high-altitude zzso We used nuclear zzso markers to study genetic relationships among all encountered zzso zzso and combined this with a zzso approach using DNA sequence data of three zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene sequence divergence showed the presence of three very distinct zzso that likely represent cryptic zzso zzso Our zzso results suggest that the zzso zzso group, a complex of predominantly North American species that has diversified rapidly since the zzso has its origin in South America, as specific tests of zzso indicated that all three South American lineages are ancestral to the North American members of this species zzso A comparison between variation of nuclear and zzso markers revealed that closely related zzso nuclear zzso sometimes belonged to very divergent zzso zzso while zzso related nuclear zzso often belonged to the same zzso zzso This zzso suggests that these South American water zzso originated through zzso zzso between different endemic, sexually zzso parental zzso It is also likely that zzso of the investigated lineages resulted from this zzso Nevertheless, no putative zzso parental lineages were found in the studied zzso
