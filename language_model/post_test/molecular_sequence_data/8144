A locus responsible for zzso zzso spinal muscular zzso zzso on zzso zzso has been mapped to a critical zzso zzso by markers zzso and zzso By a modification of the zzso method, we have isolated three zzso CA repeats from two zzso of the zzso zzso Two of them zzso and zzso map within the zzso critical region, and the other zzso is zzso to zzso zzso analysis in Spanish zzso families with zzso markers showed that in our families the disease is linked to this region and confirmed that the novel markers are tightly linked to the zzso zzso The most likely order of markers was zzso zzso zzso with odds against alternative orders zzso zzso zzso distances are in agreement with those previously zzso However, the zzso fraction between zzso and zzso is remarkably greater than expected from the physical distance, suggesting a hot spot for zzso in this zzso Our results from zzso and zzso analyses show that the zzso locus must lie between zzso and zzso and lend further support to the current location of the zzso zzso
