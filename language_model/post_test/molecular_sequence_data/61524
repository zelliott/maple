Since the pathways of zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso considerable knowledge has been gained about the zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso reactions and the factors that regulate zzso zzso In the last few decades, in part due to advances in technology and the wide availability of zzso and zzso acid zzso we have made enormous strides in our understanding of these zzso at the molecular zzso In many cases, sequence information obtained from zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso has provided the means to search the zzso and expressed sequence tag databases for zzso zzso and most of the genes have now been zzso Surprisingly, multiple zzso appear to catalyze the same chemical zzso suggesting that each zzso may play a distinct functional role in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This review focuses on the de zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, the zzso that are involved, their zzso locations, how they are zzso and their putative individual roles in zzso zzso
