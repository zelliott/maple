Modern zzso are the historic consequence of an ongoing evolutionary exploration of a sequence zzso These extant sequences belong to a special subset of the sequence space that is comprised only of those primary sequences that can zzso perform the biological zzso required of the particular zzso If it were possible to readily identify all such valid zzso zzso predictions could be made about the relative likelihood of various evolutionary pathways available to an zzso zzso an experimental system which can assess whether a particular sequence is likely to have zzso as a zzso zzso zzso is zzso A total of ten naturally occurring and hence known to be zzso sequences and two point zzso of unknown zzso were used to test the usefulness of the zzso Nine of the ten valid sequences tested positive whereas both zzso tested as clearly zzso The tenth valid sequence gave results that would be interpreted as reflecting a borderline status were the answer not zzso These results demonstrate that it is possible to zzso determine which sequences in local regions of the sequence space are potentially valid zzso zzso This approach will allow direct study of the constraints governing zzso evolution and allow inquiry into how the last common zzso of extant life apparently came to have very complex zzso zzso that subsequently were very zzso
