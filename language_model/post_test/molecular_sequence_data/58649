zzso of translation of a subset of zzso zzso results from internal zzso zzso This process is exemplified by zzso virus zzso which contains an internal zzso entry site zzso within its zzso zzso region that is approximately zzso long and consists of a series of zzso designated zzso We have previously identified a cellular zzso zzso that binds specifically to this zzso and that is implicated in its function as the zzso zzso protein zzso We have now mapped zzso binding sites directly on the zzso elements of zzso and the related zzso disease virus zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemical zzso zzso bound to six sites on the zzso zzso site 1 zzso is upstream of domain zzso site 2 is the zzso zzso of domain H zzso zzso and zzso site 3 zzso is the zzso loop of domain zzso site 4 is the zzso zzso and adjacent internal zzso loop of domain K, site 5 zzso is the zzso loop of domain K, and site 6 zzso is downstream of domain zzso zzso bound to sites on the zzso zzso that zzso precisely to zzso sites 3, 5, and zzso These sites have the consensus sequence zzso and form two groups that are located near to the zzso and 3' borders of these zzso zzso Their position, and the effects of zzso of them on zzso function are consistent with zzso role in zzso initiation being to bind to multiple sites in the zzso thereby stabilizing a specific active zzso
