Upon nitrogen zzso some zzso zzso differentiate zzso cells specialized for zzso zzso a highly oxygen sensitive zzso zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms responsible for a zzso environment in zzso and respiratory terminal zzso are the key zzso of the respiratory zzso We used zzso zzso strain zzso zzso because it is one of the few zzso zzso zzso zzso amenable to genetic zzso Using zzso with zzso zzso we found four gene zzso for respiratory terminal zzso three of which code for putative zzso c zzso and one whose genes are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso c zzso zzso was the only zzso whose zzso tested by zzso was evidently zzso in zzso and therefore zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by Northern and primer extension zzso zzso were constructed lacking zzso (a previously characterized zzso c zzso zzso or both, which all grew zzso In zzso zzso c zzso and respiratory activities were determined in all zzso allowing for the first time to estimate the relative contributions to total zzso of the different respiratory electron transport branches under different external zzso Especially adding zzso to the growth medium led to a dramatic enhancement of in zzso zzso c zzso and in zzso respiratory activity without significantly influencing gene zzso
