A zzso zzso resistant bacterial strain was isolated from a geothermal field located in the area surrounding zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene analysis and zzso comparisons the strain was identified as zzso zzso zzso of the strain, designated zzso were zzso 2-3 zzso long and reacted zzso to Gram zzso despite its zzso zzso as a Gram positive zzso zzso A1 is a zzso zzso zzso and grows zzso at pH zzso and 55 zzso An zzso zzso of 80 zzso was determined for strain zzso and the close relative zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similar levels of zzso zzso These observations were consistent with the presence of zzso zzso genes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, strain A1 growth was not inhibited by 5 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso the highest tested zzso This is the first description of zzso resistance in a zzso strain and supports the hypothesis that members of the zzso may have a role in the zzso cycling of zzso
