We report that the zzso zzso zzso can be metabolically labeled with zzso acid in human zzso Analysis of alkaline zzso products from labeled protein demonstrated that the zzso associated with zzso was zzso bound zzso zzso zzso acid was zzso by zzso treatment at neutral pH and by reducing agents, indicating that zzso occurred through a zzso zzso Both zzso acid and zzso acid were detected by gas zzso zzso analysis of alkaline zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso eliminated zzso zzso acid labeling of zzso in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso domain of zzso is zzso at zzso through a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso may regulate zzso trafficking or other functions of zzso
