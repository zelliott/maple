The influence of zzso on a hot spring zzso mat community was investigated by physically removing the top zzso zzso which included the entire zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso populations were monitored by zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Some previously absent zzso populations zzso the disturbed areas, while some populations which were present before the zzso remained absent for up to 40 zzso Changes in zzso activity were measured by oxygen zzso analyses and by zzso incorporation into zzso molecular zzso These investigations indicated substantial differences between the disturbed and undisturbed mats, including an unexplained zzso oxygen consumption in the freshly exposed zzso increased carbon zzso by zzso into zzso zzso zzso vertical photosynthesis profiles, and delayed recovery of zzso relative to zzso
