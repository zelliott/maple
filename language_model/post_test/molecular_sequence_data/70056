We have found that zzso cells adhere much more strongly than zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso without zzso to bacterial expression proteins corresponding to the tenth zzso type III zzso domain of zzso which contains the zzso A larger zzso zzso containing this domain and the three zzso zzso zzso gave strong zzso and zzso Two widely separated zzso of zzso gave zzso The third zzso domain, zzso which contains an zzso sequence in human and chicken zzso gave very strong zzso and spreading of zzso cells when tested as an isolated zzso zzso segments containing zzso and the adjacent zzso gave weaker zzso probably because the zzso sequence is partially zzso zzso to this domain required zzso zzso was exquisitely sensitive to soluble zzso zzso and was blocked by zzso to the zzso alpha v beta zzso The second zzso zzso domain was the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to but did not spread on this zzso This zzso required zzso zzso and was also sensitive to zzso zzso so it may be zzso by an zzso zzso We have explored a range of conditions for preparing the zzso zzso and our results may resolve the controversy over whether zzso can act as a zzso zzso zzso When coated for short times zzso zzso on zzso zzso had no zzso activity, in contrast to zzso and the expression zzso which gave strong zzso under these zzso When coated for longer times zzso zzso on zzso the zzso zzso supported good zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso zzso coated on zzso gave substantially stronger zzso than on zzso but still required long coating times for zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to native zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso The cell zzso activity demonstrates the presence on zzso cells of zzso zzso which may play a supportive role in zzso in the structure of blood vessels, or in binding zzso to the cell surface to elicit or enhance a zzso zzso
