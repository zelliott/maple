The zzso zzso protein of influenza B virus contains a single zzso zzso at its zzso site and the zzso precursor is not zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso by tissue culture zzso zzso To investigate if an zzso protein could be obtained that could be zzso by an zzso cellular zzso the zzso for zzso of influenza zzso virus was subjected to zzso zzso Three zzso zzso proteins were constructed, through substitution or zzso of zzso zzso that have 4, 5, or 6 basic zzso at their zzso zzso Chemical zzso studies indicated that all three zzso zzso site zzso could zzso to a zzso species, like zzso zzso The three zzso zzso site zzso proteins were efficiently transported to the cell surface and bound zzso in zzso zzso The zzso were zzso at a low level to zzso and zzso by an zzso host cell zzso and zzso could be increased somewhat by addition of zzso zzso The zzso activities of the zzso zzso site zzso were assessed in comparison to the zzso zzso protein by determining their zzso formation ability and by using an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso mixing zzso While the fusion activity of the zzso zzso protein was dependent on zzso zzso to activate zzso the three zzso zzso site zzso proteins were able to induce fusion in the absence of zzso when zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso mixing zzso but were unable to induce zzso formation in either the presence or absence of zzso zzso Our results suggest that while the presence of a zzso zzso zzso sequence at the influenza B virus zzso boundary does enable some zzso molecules to be zzso zzso it alone is not sufficient for efficient zzso
