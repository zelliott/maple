Marine zzso are the most abundant single group of zzso in the ocean, but their physiology and role in marine zzso cycles are zzso Recently, a member of this zzso was isolated from a sea aquarium and shown to be capable of zzso tentatively suggesting that zzso may play a role in the oceanic nitrogen zzso We enriched a zzso from North Sea water and showed that its zzso and not that of bacteria, zzso with ammonium zzso to zzso A time series study in the North Sea revealed that the abundance of the gene zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with a decline in ammonium zzso and with the abundance of zzso zzso the zzso zzso abundance was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of bacterial zzso which are commonly thought to mediate the zzso of ammonium to zzso in marine zzso Analysis of Atlantic waters of the upper 1,000 zzso where most of the ammonium zzso and zzso takes place, showed that zzso zzso copy numbers are also 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than those of bacterial zzso Our data thus suggest a major role for zzso in oceanic zzso
