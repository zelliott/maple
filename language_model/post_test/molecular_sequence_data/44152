zzso zzso bind selectively to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and are involved in protein zzso protein targeting to zzso and protein zzso after zzso The zzso zzso of zzso coli is known to interact zzso with positively charged zzso peptides in an extended zzso zzso we show in the present study that zzso has a low affinity for zzso zzso In the presence of its zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso interacts more efficiently with zzso zzso This suggests that zzso triggers a zzso change in zzso which improves its interaction with these zzso The ability of the zzso zzso machine to interact with zzso peptides (which represent the most frequent secondary structure in zzso should be an important part of its role in protein folding and zzso
