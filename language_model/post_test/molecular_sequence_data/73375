zzso genes zzso proteins which play an important role in the immune response, and variation in their expression levels may be of functional zzso zzso To date, zzso class II gene promoter zzso has been analyzed almost exclusively in zzso virus zzso zzso zzso While previous studies have established important zzso with regard to the mechanisms in zzso gene zzso the role of zzso promoter zzso in the variation of zzso expression levels, if any, is still zzso We analyzed the effects of a previously described zzso in the promoter and zzso untranslated region of the zzso locus in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from nine healthy zzso individuals using the zzso protection zzso The zzso protection analyses showed that the location of zzso initiation is not zzso The zzso zzso show a zzso difference in zzso and a corresponding fivefold difference in zzso levels in zzso These data show that the zzso promoter zzso is associated with differential gene expression of this zzso The difference in zzso levels is directly affected by this zzso promoter zzso The additional difference in zzso levels is the result of zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter zzso may explain the previously observed variation in zzso class II zzso gene expression levels among different healthy zzso zzso
