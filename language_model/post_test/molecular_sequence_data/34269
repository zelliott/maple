zzso is a zzso zzso 4 zzso with zzso properties that belongs to a family of zzso regulator genes potentially altered in zzso zzso in zzso were found in a whole zzso analysis of zzso cancer but have not been confirmed by a separate zzso 

We analyzed zzso of coding region and promoter zzso in zzso using 126 cases of zzso zzso We found two zzso of zzso and DNA sequencing revealed zzso and other zzso affecting both zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells and 19 of zzso zzso primary zzso samples zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were more common in cases with zzso instability zzso both in zzso cell lines and primary zzso The largest zzso of zzso is transcribed from a zzso zzso promoter that has highly zzso with a zzso on zzso 22 zzso Using an zzso which measured both zzso simultaneously we found prominent age related zzso in normal colon (from zzso in individuals less than 25 years old to zzso in individuals older than 70, zzso zzso and frequent zzso zzso in both zzso cell lines and primary zzso We next studied the two zzso separately and found that age and cancer related zzso was solely a property of the zzso zzso island and that the zzso zzso was zzso 

We found that zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso cells and primary tumor that were more common in cases with zzso zzso Moreover, we have shown zzso zzso promoter of zzso gene has no DNA zzso in zzso cells but also primary tumor and normal zzso and this region has a highly zzso of zzso gene zzso that was age relate DNA zzso
