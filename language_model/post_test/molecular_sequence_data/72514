The zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso is a zzso factor for zzso zzso zzso Based on known zzso gene organization, we zzso that zzso a putative minor zzso of the zzso zzso functions as an zzso responsible for zzso while zzso serves as the major structural zzso for the zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, an zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso and verified by zzso and Southern zzso The zzso zzso was found to be negative for zzso while zzso strain zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso Western blots with zzso raised against an zzso zzso fusion protein showed that zzso was present in the zzso preparations of both the zzso strain and the zzso zzso but absent in that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was significantly less virulent in a zzso mouse model of ascending urinary tract zzso Western blots with zzso to whole zzso zzso showed that zzso protein was also missing from the zzso preparation of the zzso zzso Using zzso electron zzso we found that the normal zzso structure was absent in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is essential for initiation of normal zzso zzso In the zzso strain, zzso protein was localized to the tips of the zzso or at the surface of the cell when zzso raised against zzso zzso was zzso Given the tip zzso zzso may be required for initiation of assembly of zzso zzso but does not appear to be the zzso zzso
