Although widely found in the zzso of zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso has been identified in only a small number of bacterial zzso One species is the freshwater zzso zzso zzso which also contains an zzso with iron as the metal zzso zzso To investigate the function of this zzso and its structural relationship to the zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso By zzso to zzso zzso gels, zzso was mapped near zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Through analysis of zzso the two zzso of zzso zzso were shown to be differently zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso In its natural habitat, zzso zzso is frequently associated with zzso algae zzso The oxygen evolved by these zzso algae may create an zzso zzso stress against which the zzso zzso may defend more effectively than the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignments of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and with zzso of zzso zzso (the only other zzso from which zzso has been isolated and zzso suggest similar zzso structures for bacterial and zzso zzso but reveal four novel zzso in zzso zzso zzso a zzso critical to zzso zzso bonding replaced by zzso a zzso zzso of zinc replaced by zzso and zzso of two other previously zzso zzso that stabilize zinc or both copper and zzso These zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso may have implications for its zzso and zzso
