In this study we typed zzso zzso by a new zzso typing zzso method, which involved one zzso reaction and four sequencing reactions covering zzso 2 and zzso zzso This method allowed complete identification of all known zzso zzso and revealed the presence of a new zzso named zzso We also introduced sequencing of zzso 4 for some samples in order to discriminate the zzso pairs that are identical in zzso 2 and 3, thus improving zzso zzso Finally, we compared the results obtained by zzso with data obtained by zzso typing and the amplification zzso zzso system zzso Together, our results suggest that the zzso here described provides an optimal zzso typing technique that may be useful in selecting zzso pairs in bone zzso transplantation between unrelated zzso
