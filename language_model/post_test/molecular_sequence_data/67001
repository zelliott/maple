Two virus zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from zzso zzso showing mild upward zzso symptoms in zzso province of zzso zzso of partial sequences of zzso like zzso confirmed the existence of a single type of zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso with a zzso organization typical of zzso Complete sequence comparison with other reported zzso revealed that zzso zzso has the highest sequence identity zzso with that of zzso leaf zzso Yunnan zzso zzso zzso was considered to be a new zzso species, for which the name zzso leaf zzso virus zzso is zzso In addition to zzso zzso two additional circular zzso satellite DNA molecules corresponding to zzso and zzso were found to be associated with zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were approximately half the size of their zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso of zzso and zzso share zzso zzso sequence identity, and they have the highest sequence identity zzso with zzso associated with zzso leaf zzso disease zzso The zzso sequence identity between zzso of zzso and that of zzso was zzso they share zzso zzso sequence identities in comparison with other previously reported zzso
