An zzso zzso transcript ( zzso zzso an zzso plant zzso zzso zzso analog was identified and zzso The zzso protein shows similarity to zzso a functionally undefined protein from citrus that is induced in response to blight zzso zzso shows significant sequence identity to zzso found in the cell wall loosening zzso but has tested negative for cell wall loosening zzso We have thus undertaken to establish the evolutionary and functional relationships of zzso molecules within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso related molecules such as zzso We show that zzso molecules are related to zzso and fall in two zzso one includes zzso and the other zzso Members of both groups share distinct sequence motifs zzso and zzso but do not contain the zzso and zzso rich zzso putative zzso domain typical of zzso or bacterial zzso and zzso We argue that both zzso molecules and zzso have evolved from zzso zzso molecules that zzso the cell zzso zzso we have previously demonstrated that zzso act on zzso that is plant cells without cell walls as well as zzso indicating that these novel proteins specifically interact with the plasma zzso It follows that the cell wall cannot be an obligatory zzso for zzso Thus, both zzso function and domain structure point to these molecules having a systemic role in zzso and zzso zzso
