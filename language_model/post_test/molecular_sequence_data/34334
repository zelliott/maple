Most zzso have three zzso genes with identical zzso structures and a high degree of sequence identity that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, we and others identified a fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a distinct zzso structure and a lower degree of sequence zzso zzso was expressed selectively in zzso and zzso in adult zzso and was indeed essential for mouse zzso but it was absent in birds, fish and zzso Since zzso is zzso in zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso zzso gene may compensate for the loss of zzso gene expression during male zzso in zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso is zzso in green zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that it is expressed in the zzso zzso Further, a zzso DNA zzso of putative zzso gene was identified in zzso regions of avian zzso indicating that zzso was present in the common zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest an even more ancient origin of the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso are presumed male zzso zzso like zzso copy numbers of the zzso as well as its neighboring gene were similar between male and female zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso gene is either zzso or located in the zzso region of the sex zzso in contrast to the case to zzso These results imply the conservation of zzso is not likely simply driven by the sex zzso zzso of the zzso gene and its subsequent zzso during male zzso Taken together with the fact that zzso protein has a uniquely zzso structure when compared to other zzso zzso 2 and 3, there may be a specific advantage for zzso and zzso to express zzso in their male germ zzso
