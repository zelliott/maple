zzso of zzso information on an increasing but still limited number of plants offers the possibility of identifying zzso or related zzso in species with major economical impact and complex zzso In this paper we exploit the recently described zzso primer design and zzso strategy for targeted isolation of zzso in large gene zzso 

The method was tested with two different zzso The first was to analyze the evolution of the zzso family of zzso zzso genes involved in zzso of zzso compounds and zzso in a broad range of plant zzso The second was to isolate an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the complexity of the zzso family in zzso zzso of the zzso family or closely related sequences were found in all vascular zzso No related sequence was found in zzso Neither extensive zzso of the zzso genes nor an zzso of zzso were found in zzso The zzso zzso was however found to be highly variable in zzso 

Our data are in agreement with the implication of zzso in zzso and the evolution of zzso of zzso precursors with vascular zzso High conservation of the zzso family strongly argues in zzso of an essential function in plant zzso zzso high zzso and diversification of the zzso gene family in wheat suggests its involvement in zzso response and provides a valuable pool of genes for zzso zzso This work demonstrates the high potential of the zzso strategy for the exploration of large gene families in zzso
