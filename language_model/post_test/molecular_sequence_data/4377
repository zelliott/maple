In the zzso region of the zzso of the zzso zzso two zzso zzso exist at the 18th and 27th zzso Hen zzso has zzso zzso and we prepared three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The stability of the zzso zzso zzso supported the existence of a hydrogen bond between the side chain of zzso and the zzso group at the zzso position in the zzso while the stability of the zzso zzso supported the presence of the capping box between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was observed between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of each zzso contributed to stabilizing the zzso in zzso zzso through hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso zzso This is the first evidence that two neighboring negative charges at the zzso of the zzso both increased the stability of the zzso
