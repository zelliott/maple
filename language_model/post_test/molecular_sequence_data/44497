We report the structural and functional features of the zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso the first zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso region, was zzso and mapped to zzso zzso The zzso promoter region is rich in G + C, lacks zzso or zzso boxes, and shows multiple zzso start sites, the major one 106 zzso upstream the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of two regions positively regulated by zzso zzso The zzso region zzso the strongest zzso zzso to the human ME as well as to a zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso beta zzso binds to an zzso zzso zzso response element zzso at position zzso in a manner that is prevented by zzso Nuclear extracts or in zzso zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso shifted the zzso retarded band to zzso complexes, which are unaffected by zzso In the absence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso the ME promoter activity, most probably, through binding of zzso zzso to the zzso Thus, zzso seems to control ME zzso by inducing the zzso of zzso zzso and the functional zzso of zzso zzso
