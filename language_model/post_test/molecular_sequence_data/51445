zzso zzso cells transformed by different activated zzso genes showed different patterns of zzso gene zzso indicating the existence of least two pathways for zzso zzso transformation from zzso zzso zzso In cells transformed by activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso high zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso L zzso zzso levels in these same cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells transformed by zzso zzso zzso sequences showed low levels of zzso zzso and a lack of zzso zzso of zzso zzso but did show high zzso levels of the zzso for zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Based on their differences in zzso zzso these two zzso are designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated the differences in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso transformation and zzso zzso induction are due to changes in zzso zzso Based on the observation of the two zzso zzso for zzso expressions, we asked whether zzso and zzso can substitute for each other in the promotion of experimental zzso zzso of in zzso zzso inhibited cells in nude mice showed an zzso of lung colonization by zzso only in the zzso zzso and by zzso only in the zzso zzso The data thus show the existence of two distinct activated zzso zzso zzso induced in the same parental cell line and that zzso or zzso zzso expressions alternatively facilitate the zzso of cells with one zzso zzso and not with the zzso
