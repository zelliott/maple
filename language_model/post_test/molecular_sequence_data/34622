zzso syndrome is associated with zzso in the DNA zzso zzso zzso Homo sapiens zzso The function of zzso is unknown although zzso studies suggest a role in DNA ends stability and zzso Unlike other zzso family members, zzso possesses an zzso domain with zzso activity, which is zzso by interaction with the zzso zzso While this interaction is intriguing, we do not know whether it is important for zzso zzso Although flies, zzso zzso and plants do not have zzso zzso zzso with an intrinsic zzso activity, they possess proteins having zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso encodes multiple zzso and a single protein with zzso to the zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso has properties that are similar to zzso zzso binds to and is zzso by zzso Interestingly, stimulation by zzso is zzso as zzso does not stimulate zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso fails to enhance the zzso activity of zzso Thus, in spite of the differences in structural organization, the functional interaction between zzso zzso and zzso has been preserved through evolutionary radiation of species, emphasizing the importance of this interaction in cell zzso
