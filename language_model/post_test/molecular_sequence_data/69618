The zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso was evaluated and compared with another zzso zzso zzso and with the well-known zzso zzso The zzso variation of the test was satisfying both in the normal range zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso range of oral zzso zzso zzso zzso These values were somewhat higher than those of the zzso test zzso and zzso and those of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso variation zzso amounted to zzso in the normal range and in the zzso oral zzso range to zzso The respective values for the zzso test were somewhat lower zzso and zzso those of the zzso in the normal range were also lower zzso and in the zzso range they were much higher zzso The zzso of correlation of the zzso zzso test in the zzso range were highest when comparing them with those for the zzso test zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and somewhat lower in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The results of the three methods paralleled also in the starting phase of oral zzso zzso Storage at 4 degrees C and at 25 degrees C showed good stability of the zzso zzso zzso for up to zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is well suited for the measurement with a zzso fast zzso which is attractive on behalf of the usually large series of request for zzso time zzso when monitoring oral zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
