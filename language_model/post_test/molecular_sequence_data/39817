The zzso zzso zzso complex is responsible for the development of a diverse immune system by catalyzing zzso zzso of zzso zzso and T cell zzso zzso genes at specific zzso signal sequences zzso This zzso complex has also been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at cryptic zzso zzso outside the immune system zzso in zzso zzso We describe here two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso at the zzso locus in human zzso These are zzso insertions in which DNA fragments are inserted at zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso sites in the zzso locus at zzso In the first, a zzso signal ended segment from zzso zzso is inserted at a zzso zzso in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso In the second, a DNA zzso from zzso is integrated between the coding ends generated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification of these in zzso zzso zzso zzso insertions at zzso zzso in the zzso gene supports the accumulating evidence that zzso zzso can mediate zzso zzso in humans with potential zzso zzso
