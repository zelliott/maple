zzso zzso populations in the Western zzso have experienced a severe decline during the last two centuries that has led to the near extinction of the species in zzso In this study we zzso the sequence variation at the zzso control region throughout the species range to zzso its recent evolutionary history and to evaluate the current genetic status of the zzso This study became possible through the extensive use of museum specimens to study populations now zzso zzso analysis revealed the existence of two divergent zzso zzso lineage A occurring mainly in Western European populations and lineage B in zzso Eastern European and Central Asian zzso The relative zzso of zzso belonging to each lineage in the different populations show a steep zzso zzso distribution with zzso mixture of the two lineages in the zzso and Greece zzso A zzso signature for population growth was found for lineage B, but not for lineage zzso zzso the zzso B zzso in western populations and zzso A zzso in eastern populations are recently zzso as revealed by their peripheral location in zzso zzso zzso This zzso pattern suggests zzso differentiation of the two lineages in separate Mediterranean and African or Asian glacial zzso followed by range expansion from the latter leading to two secondary contact zzso zones in Central Europe and North zzso High levels of zzso differentiation were observed, although these were not correlated with geographical zzso Due to the marked genetic structure, extinction of Central European populations in the last century zzso in the loss of a major portion of the genetic diversity of the zzso We also found direct evidence for the effect of drift altering the genetic composition of the remnant zzso population after the demographic bottleneck of the last zzso Our results argue for the management of the species as a single population, given the apparent ecological zzso of extant stocks, and support the ongoing zzso of mixed ancestry birds in the zzso and planned zzso in Southern zzso
