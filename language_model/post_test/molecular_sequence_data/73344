zzso binding proteins have been described both for Gram positive and Gram negative zzso In the present work we describe the zzso and characterization of a zzso binding protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in order to zzso zzso zzso The zzso was subjected to affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and subsequently processed by zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of the protein by zzso displayed a single band with a molecular mass of about zzso both prior to and after zzso The zzso protein stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a factor of approximately zzso mainly due to a decrease in zzso zzso were raised in rabbits and used in quantitative and qualitative zzso However, using a zzso we failed to demonstrate the presence of the zzso protein on the surface of intact zzso The corresponding gene was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library prepared from zzso DNA from the same zzso zzso strain, using an zzso probe based on the zzso zzso acid zzso An open reading frame corresponding to zzso zzso acid was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the translated gene demonstrates zzso identity with the recently published sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein revealed a high zzso zzso
