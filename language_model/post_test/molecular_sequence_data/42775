To develop a sensitive and specific zzso chain reaction zzso based system for detecting zzso variation in zzso zzso To apply this system to zzso zzso zzso wax embedded brain tissue from patients with and without progressive zzso zzso zzso 

A pair of zzso zzso and zzso were designed to be complementary to the early and late regions of zzso and BK zzso zzso A third primer zzso internal to zzso and zzso was designed to be specific for zzso zzso The specificity of zzso was investigated by amplifying plasmids with BK or zzso virus zzso zzso was estimated by zzso of a zzso containing zzso virus zzso Seven brains from patients with zzso zzso and 30 from patients without zzso zzso were amplified using zzso and zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso of the beta zzso gene was used as an amplification zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso was common for zzso and BK zzso but with zzso and zzso it was specific for zzso zzso The sensitivity of the system was 25 copies of zzso zzso per 10 zzso of zzso zzso Five out of seven zzso and 28 of the 30 zzso amplified for beta zzso but only the zzso gave a signal with zzso zzso zzso of the length of the regulatory region of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was consistent with the presence of multiple strains of zzso 

Variation in the regulatory region of zzso virus can be specifically and sensitively detected from routinely zzso zzso wax embedded brain zzso Variation in the regulatory region is common in zzso derived zzso zzso but zzso virus was not zzso in zzso zzso
