The primary structure and physical chemical properties were determined of a zzso expressed and zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso carried a DNA sequence isolated from zzso zzso zzso the zzso During zzso of the zzso coli cells, zzso of the zzso was released to the growth zzso The zzso was zzso and exhibited a single band with a molecular weight about zzso zzso on zzso similar to zzso isolated from zzso zzso The zzso acid composition and the zzso acid sequence determined directly confirmed the primary structure of 245 zzso acids predicted from the DNA zzso and, in addition, the two zzso bridges were zzso Several physical chemical properties were zzso The ability of the zzso to cross the outer membrane is proposed to depend upon the formation of the proper structures during the folding zzso
