The zzso sequence of gene zzso the putative zzso product of which is zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso has been zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains 3 zzso zzso appears to code for the precursor of a zzso protein which we have designated zzso The zzso precursor is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso including 22 zzso of signal zzso 23 zzso of zzso zzso five repeating units of 13 to 14 zzso and 22 zzso of zzso zzso The signal sequence of this precursor is identical with that of the zzso zzso The zzso 61 zzso sequence of zzso has zzso of zzso with the whole sequence of zzso zzso zzso when deletion of 4 zzso is taken into zzso zzso is 55 zzso longer than zzso
