Since the recent discovery that the zzso modification and transport machinery can be used to produce and modify peptides unrelated to zzso specific questions arose concerning the specificity of the modification zzso involved and the limits of their zzso with respect to the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso leader zzso has been zzso to fulfill a recognition and binding function required for these zzso Here, we investigated whether the relative positions of the modifiable zzso in the zzso zzso with respect to the leader zzso could influence the efficiency of their zzso We conducted a systematic study on the zzso of one to four zzso in front of either ring A or ring D to change the zzso zzso of modifiable zzso resulting in altered distance and zzso of the modifiable zzso relative to the zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso Ala zzso had only a modest influence on the modification efficiency, demonstrating that the zzso of these zzso relative to the leader zzso is not a critical factor in determining zzso However, in all cases, but especially with the zzso zzso the zzso activities of the fully modified zzso species were zzso
