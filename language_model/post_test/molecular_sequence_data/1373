The zzso role of the skeletal zzso zzso 3, zzso is presently unknown, but defects in its gene cause limb zzso muscular zzso type zzso This zzso zzso zzso resembles the large zzso of zzso but with three unique additional zzso an zzso region zzso and two insertions zzso and zzso The latter two insertions have been linked to the chronic instability of the whole zzso both in zzso and in zzso We have shown previously that the core of zzso zzso zzso zzso I and II, and zzso is stable as a zzso protein in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso in its zzso Here we show that zzso cannot zzso an zzso zzso before zzso but is increasingly able to do so when zzso proceeds for several zzso This gain in activity is caused by zzso of zzso during zzso because a deletion zzso lacking the zzso region zzso zzso shows the same zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have almost no zzso effect on zzso zzso by zzso soon after calcium addition but cause complete zzso when zzso zzso for several zzso As zzso zzso there is release of the internal zzso zzso but the two portions of the core remain tightly zzso Modeling of zzso suggests that zzso contains an zzso zzso flanked by extended zzso The latter are the targets of zzso and limited zzso by zzso zzso The presence and location of the zzso in zzso zzso were confirmed by circular zzso and by the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso Within zzso zzso caused premature zzso of the zzso zzso is an zzso of a loop in domain II near the active site, and it acts as an internal zzso zzso blocking the active site of zzso from zzso and zzso
