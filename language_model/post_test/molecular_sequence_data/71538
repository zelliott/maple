We have previously reported the identification of a gene from zzso zzso zzso which on the basis of its zzso sequence zzso a protein product of 38 zzso This zzso zzso protein designated as zzso exhibits zzso with the zzso protein of zzso the zzso protein of zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso proteins from various zzso zzso coli zzso In this communication, we show the close sequence and structural similarities of the zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and describe the results of our studies on the characterization of the zzso gene promoter and its expression in zzso coli and zzso zzso was present exclusively in the species belonging to the zzso tuberculosis complex as revealed by Southern zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso of zzso zzso
