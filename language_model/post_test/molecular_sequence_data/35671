Three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso with altered apparent zzso constant of transport zzso were cloned and zzso One of the zzso had extensive zzso replacement, whereas the other two had a single zzso To evaluate the contribution of the different zzso acid replacements to the zzso of the complex zzso simpler zzso were created by zzso zzso All the zzso acid replacements found in the segment from zzso acids 371 to 377 inclusive, contribute to the determination of the zzso According to the model zzso this segment lies on the cell zzso In particular, zzso acids at position 374 and 377 zzso the affinity of the zzso towards its zzso In the zzso when zzso is present at both of these positions, the lowest zzso values are zzso
