zzso the zzso which maintains the ends of linear zzso in zzso cells is found in zzso embryonic stem zzso however, its activity is zzso during in zzso zzso Previous work has indicated that this is due to the zzso zzso of zzso reverse zzso unit zzso of zzso To investigate the factors that cause the zzso repression of zzso we defined a 300 zzso region which is essential for its zzso and performed site directed zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso This analysis indicated that zzso zzso and zzso bind to the zzso and zzso respectively, within the promoter and help activate the zzso of zzso zzso We also identified a novel binding zzso found repeated within the zzso core region, which when zzso caused increased zzso zzso zzso one hybrid screening combined with zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that the nuclear protein zzso binds to this site and its zzso leads to the zzso of zzso during zzso This suggests that regulation of zzso zzso is a complex process which depends on a quantitative balance between zzso factors that cause zzso or repression of this zzso zzso of zzso in zzso embryonic stem cells results in reduction in zzso activity and zzso length as well as reduced zzso capacity and limited ability to contribute to the development of zzso cells upon zzso
