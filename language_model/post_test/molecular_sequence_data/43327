zzso are released during zzso zzso in zzso and have been detected in zzso in syndromes of zzso zzso They have been reported to express both zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, their functional significance has remained zzso To address the zzso of cellular zzso by zzso zzso we examined their effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of human zzso by diverse stimuli zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and the calcium zzso zzso 1 zzso results in shedding of zzso zzso of these zzso but not membrane zzso from resting zzso with zzso evokes a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso movement, and zzso zzso zzso These effects zzso to the zzso acid fraction of the zzso and are zzso by zzso acid isolated from zzso However, zzso zzso requires prior metabolism of zzso zzso acid to zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso or the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso (5 zzso prevents zzso zzso by zzso However, zzso zzso fail to evoke an zzso zzso response directly, via either of the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was used to demonstrate zzso metabolism of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso can also induce expression of zzso and zzso zzso production, but not expression of zzso in human zzso zzso These effects are prevented by zzso with zzso D (12 zzso or zzso (5 zzso zzso of zzso is again induced by the zzso zzso zzso which it may then use to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso a stable zzso zzso evoke human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso albeit with zzso that differ from the response to zzso zzso These studies indicate a novel mechanism of zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso may be amplified or modulated by concentrated delivery of zzso acid to adjacent zzso and zzso zzso
