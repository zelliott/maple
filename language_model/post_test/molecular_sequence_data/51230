Tomato leaves infected by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso contain several types of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, we reported the zzso and zzso characterization of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso of a basic zzso 33 zzso zzso and the isolation and characterization of zzso clones zzso the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a basic 35 zzso zzso different from the zzso 33 zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that tomato zzso proteins are not zzso by large gene families, as is the case in zzso The number of genes corresponding to each protein was estimated to vary between one and zzso A northern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso for the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulate to similar levels in compatible and incompatible zzso zzso zzso although the maximum level of expression is reached much faster in the incompatible zzso On the other hand, the zzso for the basic 35 zzso zzso is induced rapidly to high levels in both zzso but declines in time to background levels only in the incompatible zzso The relevance of this difference in relation to plant zzso is zzso
