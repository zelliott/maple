zzso studies on zzso and zzso peptides often require large quantities of zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of peptides often present challenges on these zzso zzso expression is an attractive alternative because of its low cost, the ability to zzso label the zzso and access to sequences exceeding approximately 50 zzso However, expression systems that seek to zzso zzso peptides suffer from low yields, difficult zzso and isolation zzso We present a general strategy for expressing and zzso zzso peptides in zzso coli by fusion to a zzso that drives the expression of attached peptides into bacterial inclusion zzso This scheme zzso toxicity during bacterial growth and enables the processing and handling of the peptides in zzso zzso zzso metal affinity zzso reverse phase zzso and zzso zzso zzso are used to isolate the zzso followed by further reverse phase zzso which yields zzso quantities of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that driving the peptides into inclusion bodies using fusion to zzso is a general strategy for their expression and isolation, as exemplified by the production of 11 peptides zzso
