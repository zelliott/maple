zzso zzso is known for its ability to differentiate from swimmer to zzso cells, a process crucial for the zzso of these bacteria during urinary tract zzso Among the many zzso factors produced during zzso cell differentiation is an zzso zzso A zzso containing a large zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA was obtained by measuring zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and native zzso were zzso to over zzso zzso from culture zzso by use of zzso affinity zzso and found to be zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited by a zzso of these zzso The zzso possesses zzso specificity for both serum and zzso forms of zzso A1 zzso and zzso as well as zzso and, unlike classic zzso zzso zzso to completion both human and mouse zzso Following zzso a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was identified by zzso zzso with zzso Four open reading frames were identified within this zzso region by limited zzso sequence analysis of DNA zzso the zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso structural gene zzso were zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso and may be part of an zzso zzso genes zzso an zzso ABC zzso in addition to the zzso The relevance of the zzso to zzso cell differentiation and zzso is zzso
