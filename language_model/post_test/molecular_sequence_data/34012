zzso and economic DNA zzso that can work as logic components are necessary for the development of DNA computers with high speed and outstanding data storage zzso A new molecular zzso beacon zzso and a series of zzso zzso logic gates based on the formation and zzso of zzso zzso were established in this zzso These logic gates zzso zzso zzso zzso OR and zzso were realized by the interaction between the special designed zzso zzso and the short input single strand complementary zzso We were able to recognize the logic output signals effortlessly by our naked zzso It is a simple, economic and safe approach for the design of complex multiple input DNA logic molecular zzso
