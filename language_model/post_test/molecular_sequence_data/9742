The zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells is a highly zzso zzso possessing binding ability for zzso zzso factor zzso Two distinct zzso binding zzso of zzso were isolated from zzso zzso of the zzso by affinity separation on immobilized zzso One of these zzso consists of zzso acid zzso zzso and contains both the third zzso motif and the second zzso cluster zzso The second domain is close to the second zzso domain zzso acid zzso zzso Each of these two zzso can bind zzso zzso zzso linkages present in the first domain are necessary for zzso zzso probably because of preservation of the native zzso To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of zzso containing the second zzso domain zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso This domain was zzso to zzso through a zzso zzso zzso Several synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso were able to bind immobilized zzso zzso acid substitution and zzso analysis indicated that zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso are intimately involved in zzso zzso These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso in binding zzso
