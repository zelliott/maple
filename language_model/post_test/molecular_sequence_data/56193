A model of the zzso zzso zzso has been constructed on the basis of the putative three-dimensional structural similarity between zzso and zzso coupled zzso The zzso zzso zzso model takes into account zzso and zzso zzso acids and information from zzso zzso studies and from zzso zzso The resulting model was used in conjunction with an indirect model which describes a proposed active zzso zzso of zzso and a number of related zzso A zzso volume was constructed by zzso these zzso zzso and calculating their combined van der zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso excluded volume was used to define the zzso binding site, which consists of nine zzso acids and which binds zzso primarily through interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The model is flexible since the zzso of the nine zzso acids may change in response to the zzso zzso The combination of indirect and zzso approaches is particularly attractive since it zzso more experimental data than a purely zzso model and since a zzso model might be more realistic and general in terms of zzso than indirect zzso zzso of the zzso was performed by zzso attractive interactions and minimizing repulsive zzso In addition to the zzso used to define the binding site, structurally different zzso are also zzso by the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso model is able to reproduce zzso determined zzso
