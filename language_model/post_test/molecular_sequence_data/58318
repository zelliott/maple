The fungus zzso zzso is a potent zzso of various plant zzso zzso We have studied the molecular regulation of zzso in the zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from various stages of zzso were used in zzso zzso zzso zzso with two promoter fragments of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso This gene was chosen as a model because its expression is triggered during zzso interaction zzso zzso Gutierrez, zzso Jimenez, zzso van zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 91, zzso All zzso extracts formed zzso weight zzso complexes, but those obtained from zzso activated for zzso attack formed a complex with greater zzso Competition experiments, using zzso containing functional and zzso consensus sites for binding of the carbon zzso zzso zzso provided evidence that the complex from zzso zzso involves the binding of zzso to both fragments of the zzso zzso The presence of two and three consensus sites for binding of zzso in the two zzso promoter fragments used is consistent with these zzso In contrast, the formation of the zzso complex from zzso zzso is unaffected by the addition of the competing zzso and hence does not involve zzso zzso of equal amounts of protein of zzso extracts from zzso zzso converted the zzso zzso complex into the zzso zzso The addition of the zzso zzso zzso protein to zzso zzso extracts produced the same zzso These findings suggest that zzso expression in zzso zzso is regulated by zzso binding of zzso to two single sites in the zzso promoter, zzso binding of a zzso zzso complex to the zzso promoter in vicinity of the zzso binding sites, and zzso functional zzso of zzso upon zzso interaction to enable the formation of the zzso zzso zzso
