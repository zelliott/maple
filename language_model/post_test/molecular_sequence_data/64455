zzso zzso zzso zzso is a large modular zzso that zzso the zzso zzso as a zzso donor or zzso in three separate zzso Each zzso transfer occurs at a different zzso domain and requires a different arrangement of zzso In the zzso cycle, the zzso domain carries zzso to the homocysteine zzso domain to form zzso and returns zzso to the folate zzso domain for zzso by zzso zzso Here, we describe crystal structures of a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso that bind zzso and zzso These zzso zzso are zzso zzso barrels packed tightly against one another with their barrel axes zzso The properties of the domain interface suggest that the two barrels remain associated during zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are bound at the C zzso of their respective barrels in zzso that position them for reaction with zzso but the two active sites are separated by approximately 50 zzso To complete the zzso cycle, the zzso domain must travel back and forth between these distant active zzso
