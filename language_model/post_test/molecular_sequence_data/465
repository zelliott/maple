Muscle contraction and relaxation is regulated by transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso is released from stores in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to initiate formation of the zzso transient by zzso of a class of zzso release channels referred to as zzso receptors zzso and is pumped back into the zzso zzso by zzso zzso to terminate the zzso zzso zzso in the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with 2 skeletal muscle disorders, zzso zzso zzso and central core disease zzso The evaluation of proposed mechanisms by which zzso zzso cause zzso and zzso is hindered by the lack of high-resolution structural zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso 210 zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso structure is similar to that of the zzso domain of type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso but lacks most of the long zzso segment of the zzso domain in zzso The zzso zzso fold, found in both zzso and zzso is likely to play a critical role in regulatory mechanisms in this channel zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso loop was identified between strands 8 and 9 in a highly basic region of zzso zzso studies showed that 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not adversely affect the global stability or fold of zzso supporting previously described mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
