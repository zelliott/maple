Our previous studies of the zzso regulation of the human zzso gene indicated that negative regulatory elements are present in the sequence just upstream from the zzso zzso The role of the zzso to zzso region in regulation of zzso gene zzso is further zzso 

zzso zzso experiments into various cells were performed with zzso reporter plasmids carrying zzso upstream zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso was carried out with a nuclear extract prepared from the human gastric cancer zzso zzso 

It is shown that the zzso to zzso region is involved in the negative regulation of zzso gene zzso in all cell lines zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso cells with a reporter zzso carrying zzso N box at zzso to zzso demonstrate that the N box is a negative regulatory element in the zzso to zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that the N box binds with a nuclear factor from zzso zzso 

These results indicate that repression of zzso from the zzso zzso promoter is partially dependent upon the N zzso zzso reduced binding of the protein with the N box might play a direct role in zzso gene zzso
