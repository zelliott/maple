In insects, the boundary between the embryonic head and zzso is formed by the zzso zzso a fused structure composed of portions of the zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that promote development of this unusual structure remain a zzso In zzso zzso in the zzso genes Sex combs reduced and zzso have been reported to cause abnormal zzso zzso formation, but the significance of these abnormalities is not zzso We have identified three zzso zzso classes of zzso the zzso zzso (red flour zzso zzso of Sex combs reduced, each of which has a different effect on zzso zzso zzso By using zzso expression to monitor zzso zzso development in these zzso we demonstrate that zzso promotes the fusion and subsequent zzso extension of the zzso and zzso zzso stripes zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic analysis of these zzso indicates that the N zzso of zzso is important for the fusion step, but is zzso for zzso stripe zzso Thus, we find that specific regions of zzso are required for discrete steps in zzso zzso zzso
