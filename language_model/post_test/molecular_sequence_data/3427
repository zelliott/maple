Recently, the zzso zzso which is known as a key component in bacterial cell division, was reported to be involved in zzso division in zzso In zzso and animals, however, zzso zzso depends on the zzso proteins zzso and zzso respectively, whereas in green plants, no potential zzso division genes have been zzso zzso searches of the nuclear and zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso did not find any obvious zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso division of higher plants depends on a zzso zzso we cloned a zzso for zzso an zzso zzso of zzso and tested its zzso zzso and its zzso effect on zzso zzso The fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and zzso was observed as zzso structures localized at the tips and at the zzso sites of zzso in live plant zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso showed a significant fusion, zzso and/or zzso of zzso We propose that zzso division in higher plants is conducted by zzso proteins similar to zzso in zzso The zzso points of loss of zzso zzso and the functional acquisition of zzso proteins in zzso division are zzso
