All fully zzso zzso zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have previously been from zzso This study reports the sequencing and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso pine zzso zzso has the smallest zzso so far published zzso zzso and has a zzso content of only zzso It contains 89 potential open reading zzso 43 with zzso zzso 6 identified by zzso zzso and 1 with zzso to a zzso structural zzso Average zzso acid identity of zzso ranged from zzso with zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso set of zzso genes has dropped to 29, since zzso lacks an F protein zzso zzso zzso contains 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso including that for DNA binding zzso late expression factor 11 zzso zzso zzso derived virus envelope zzso zzso zzso and zzso but lacks 21 others, including zzso zzso immediate early zzso zzso zzso zzso few zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso growth factor, and zzso The lack of identified zzso zzso may be due to difficulties in zzso differences in zzso zzso or other genes performing similar zzso Gene parity plots showed limited zzso of zzso with other zzso and zzso analysis indicates that zzso may have existed before the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The creation of two new zzso zzso to fit zzso and zzso zzso may be zzso
