zzso zzso elements is crucial to understanding gene zzso which highlights the importance of the zzso detection of overrepresented zzso factor binding sites zzso in zzso or zzso zzso However, this is a challenging problem, especially when considering higher zzso zzso 

We have developed a method, named zzso that searches for locally overrepresented zzso in a set of zzso zzso which are modeled by profiles provided by a database of position weight zzso The novelty of the method is that it takes advantage of spatial conservation in the sequence and supports multiple zzso The efficiency of the underlying zzso and its zzso to noise allow weak regulatory signals to be detected in large zzso data zzso 

zzso provides an efficient way to predict zzso overrepresentation in related zzso Promising results were obtained in a variety of examples in human, zzso and rat zzso The software is publicly available at zzso
