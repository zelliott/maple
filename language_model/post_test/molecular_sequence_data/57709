The zzso locus of zzso encodes the structural gene for the zzso salvage zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso activity is zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso is zzso and dosage compensated in zzso zzso as shown zzso The zzso genes of both zzso species contain a DNA sequence associated with nuclear zzso attachment sites and these zzso sequences specifically bind to nuclear zzso in zzso zzso promoter sequences positioned upstream of the predicted zzso start site in the two zzso genes have a similar structure of direct repeats with an overlapping zzso zzso but the DNA sequence of these motifs is not zzso between the two zzso Biological features in zzso of zzso as well as natural zzso suggest that dosage compensation of this gene in zzso zzso is due to a general control mechanism on zzso genes rather than a zzso zzso
