We have employed synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to the zzso zzso regions of zzso as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso surfaces in flowing whole blood, using a zzso zzso chamber at wall zzso rates of 300 zzso and 1,300 zzso zzso caused substantial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso at both zzso rates, although it was least effective at blocking zzso zzso to zzso at 300 zzso zzso was a weaker zzso and produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso and zzso to zzso at both zzso zzso These results support the identification of an zzso zzso most likely the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the primary zzso responsible for zzso adhesive interactions under flow conditions, and indicate that zzso zzso to surface bound zzso is stabilized by zzso zzso zzso
