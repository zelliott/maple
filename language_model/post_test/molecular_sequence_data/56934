zzso The capacity of zzso human zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to inhibit human zzso zzso zzso and zzso G zzso zzso was investigated and compared with a zzso truncated form zzso domain, zzso called 1/2 zzso zzso Both compounds were efficient when tested against zzso activities of zzso zzso and Cat G indicating that the zzso and Cat zzso sites were preserved in the truncated zzso zzso and 1/2 zzso also affected zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Cat G zzso zzso 112 zzso 13 zzso for zzso and 280 zzso 12 zzso for 1/2 zzso zzso The effects of zzso and 1/2 zzso were then tested against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso interaction zzso by zzso and Cat G released from zzso In this experimental system, addition of zzso or 1/2 zzso before zzso zzso led to the zzso of the resulting zzso zzso As was the case for Cat G zzso activity and Cat zzso zzso zzso zzso was more efficient than 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 69 zzso vs zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso The ratio of the zzso against zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso Cat zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for 1/2 zzso This difference may be due to the smaller size of the truncated form which could allow this zzso to diffuse more easily between zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, 1/2 zzso could be a promising candidate in the treatment of pathological states linked to inflammation in which participation of zzso and Cat G has been zzso
