zzso is a protein zzso that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso arrests cells in zzso with short zzso whereas deletion of zzso did not alter the cell cycle but did eliminate the zzso delay observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso but not zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso consistent with the inability of zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso These results suggest that specific zzso zzso target zzso for distinct regulatory controls which may be important for ensuring proper zzso function during the cell zzso
