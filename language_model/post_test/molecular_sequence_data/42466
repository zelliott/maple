It has been suggested that the two zzso regions around zzso 70 and zzso 170 in zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso c zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso c in the electron transfer reaction and that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso complex III, enhances this zzso In order to determine the roles of the zzso regions of zzso zzso more precisely, we introduced several zzso in the two zzso regions and examined their effects on the ability of modified zzso zzso to complement the zzso zzso of zzso cells lacking only zzso zzso or both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the deletion of the first zzso region zzso zzso was still functional in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the deletion of the second zzso region zzso zzso caused a decrease in the zzso ability, but this is probably due to failure in its zzso maturation and/or correct assembly into complex zzso zzso zzso zzso with altered charge distribution in the zzso regions zzso or zzso made the zzso zzso cells zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso with the deletion of the first zzso region zzso zzso or altered charge distribution in the second region zzso did not restore the zzso zzso of the cells lacking not only zzso zzso but also the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
