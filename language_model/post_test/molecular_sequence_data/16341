The structural gene for zzso initiation factor zzso zzso from zzso zzso was identified by zzso with DNA zzso derived from the corresponding gene of zzso zzso The entire zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence shows that zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso displays extensive zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the region zzso three-quarters of the zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso The region zzso one-quarter of the zzso from the zzso on the other hand, does not display any significant zzso
