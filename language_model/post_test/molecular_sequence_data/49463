Errors introduced during zzso amplification set a selectivity limit for zzso analysis and molecular zzso detection methods since zzso zzso invariably get confused with genuine zzso Here we present zzso a new form of zzso that completely separates genuine zzso from zzso zzso zzso operates by converting a DNA sequence to a hairpin following zzso of zzso caps to DNA zzso We developed conditions that allow a DNA hairpin to be efficiently zzso so that, during DNA zzso the zzso copies both DNA strands in a single zzso zzso when a zzso occurs it forms a mismatch following DNA amplification, and is distinguished from genuine zzso that remain fully zzso zzso DNA can subsequently be isolated using one of many approaches, such as zzso or zzso zzso We present feasibility for the main technical steps involved in this new strategy, conversion of a sequence to a hairpin that can be zzso from human zzso DNA, exponential amplification from zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso and separation of zzso from zzso zzso using zzso The present zzso opens up the possibility for a radical elimination of zzso errors from amplified DNA and a major improvement in zzso zzso
