The zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso the rate of protein synthesis by zzso the zzso phase of translation by zzso the zzso zzso factor 2 zzso via zzso zzso is known to be activated by calcium and zzso whereas the zzso and zzso pathways are suggested to zzso regulate zzso zzso Despite its pivotal role in translation regulation and potential role in tumor survival, the structure, function, and regulation of zzso have not been described in zzso This zzso may result from the difficulty of obtaining the zzso zzso in a form suitable for zzso zzso Here we report the zzso and characterization of zzso human zzso expressed in the zzso coli strain zzso zzso zzso zzso steps utilizing zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso columns accomplished zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso of the expressed zzso with zzso zzso yielded 9 zzso of zzso zzso per liter of zzso Light scattering shows that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso In zzso kinetic analysis confirmed that zzso human zzso is able to zzso wheat germ zzso with kinetic parameters comparable to the zzso zzso
