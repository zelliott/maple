While for most human solid tumors genetic zzso of few distinct genetic regions have been found, studies on zzso cell zzso zzso have shown the prevalence of several abnormalities including zzso of the three zzso zzso GAP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the human zzso of zzso zzso and zzso (the human zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, during the last decade, a new zzso protein zzso B zzso has been characterized and found to be zzso in certain human zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso its recruitment to the cell membrane zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We investigated whether zzso of this mandatory domain are present in a subset of human zzso skin zzso 

zzso of 19 human skin tumors including 13 zzso 4 zzso cell zzso zzso including 1 zzso and 2 zzso of different size and tumor stage were used for reverse zzso and subsequent zzso amplification of the zzso domain of zzso 

zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso products did not reveal any zzso of the zzso domain of zzso 

In human zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso do not play a major role during the zzso of these zzso
