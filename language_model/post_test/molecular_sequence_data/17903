Within the cellular framework operate a number of zzso acting zzso systems of varying complexity and spatial zzso In some cases they are found as zzso or even zzso zzso where each single zzso chain carries two or more zzso zzso To mimic these zzso a number of different zzso zzso have been prepared by zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso were genetically zzso Different physical and chemical properties of the hybrid proteins have been investigated, such as protein stability, zzso zzso zzso regions and zzso channeling in zzso and in zzso Important fields of application for artificial zzso zzso can be found in zzso analysis, protein zzso and zzso zzso
