We have recently reported that the Na pump zzso has zzso zzso which were sensitive to zzso by an zzso specific for zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso We now describe experiments that characterize the zzso and further substantiate our previous zzso zzso milk zzso has been used in conjunction with zzso zzso to label zzso zzso on the zzso The Na pump zzso contains some zzso zzso however, the bulk zzso zzso of the zzso was found in zzso sensitive to zzso F degradation but not to alkaline zzso zzso zzso produced degradation of the zzso and the zzso zzso carbohydrates remained bound to peptides and were released by subsequent zzso zzso F zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso were analyzed by liquid zzso and had zzso volumes identical to a zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso was zzso added, we propose that the zzso zzso on the zzso of the Na pump are composed of a single sugar zzso which is probably zzso
