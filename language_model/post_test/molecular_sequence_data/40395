zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of a patient with pulmonary zzso zzso of the strain were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rods and formed zzso to white colonies on zzso soy zzso at zzso and zzso The zzso of the strain is not zzso The strain contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the major fatty acids and zzso zzso zzso and several unknown lipids in the polar zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the isolate belongs to the zzso zzso sharing the highest levels of sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and that it occupied a distinct position within this zzso Combined zzso and zzso data supported the conclusion that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
