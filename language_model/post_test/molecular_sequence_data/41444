We have developed a zzso zzso probe that targets cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso for imaging zzso brain tumors in live zzso A zzso specific for the zzso was modified with various lengths of zzso zzso zzso zzso units and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The lead compound, compound 2, with one unit of zzso displayed good binding zzso zzso and cellular zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso The in zzso studies have shown that the probe was able to selectively label zzso zzso brain zzso In zzso image analyses of zzso binding to the tumors using zzso molecular zzso revealed that the compound could distinguish between tumors expressing different levels of zzso The data presented here represent the first demonstration of differential zzso of tumors expressing zzso in live animals by a targeted zzso zzso probe using a molecular imaging zzso
