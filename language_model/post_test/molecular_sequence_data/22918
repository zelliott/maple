Development of zzso is common in patients with zzso zzso zzso however, the underlying mechanism is largely zzso Many zzso drugs exert their therapeutic action by generating zzso oxygen zzso which might be countered by the cancer cell through induction of zzso protein 2 zzso zzso has been shown to be able to protect tumor cells from the zzso actions of zzso zzso Because zzso is seldom completely cured by current chemotherapy regimens, we hypothesized that increased expression of zzso zzso this zzso The primary initial interest of our research was to evaluate the level of zzso zzso in zzso 

The level of zzso zzso was determined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso comparing expression in zzso specimens and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was achieved by radioactive zzso zzso sequencing was performed using automated zzso 

Interestingly, we failed to observe induction of zzso zzso in zzso tumor specimens and zzso primary cell lines compared to the expression level in normal zzso However, we found expression of a zzso unknown zzso transcript in eight of eight zzso and one zzso cell lines and in nine of ten zzso biopsy specimens but in only one of six normal zzso zzso Thus, tumor samples express both types zzso and the novel one) of zzso zzso whereas normal bone expresses only the zzso zzso Further experiments identified the novel zzso species as an alternatively spliced zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso from the 3' end of zzso 3 that introduces an early stop zzso in zzso 4, which theoretically can produce a protein 79 zzso acids zzso 

We have identified a zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso of the novel transcript appears to be zzso zzso a function advantageous to the zzso
