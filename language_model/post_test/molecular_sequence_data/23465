Complete sequences of multiple strains of the same microbial species provide an invaluable source for studying the evolutionary dynamics between zzso genes over a relatively short time zzso Usually the intensity of the selection pressure is zzso from a comparison between the zzso substitution rate and the synonymous substitution zzso In this paper, we propose an alternative method for detecting genes with one or more zzso regions from zzso comparisons of zzso zzso Our method looks for regions with overrepresented zzso zzso along the zzso and requires a higher zzso evolution rate in those regions than the neutral evolution zzso It identifies gene targets under intensive selection pressure that are not detected from the conventional rate comparison zzso For those identified genes with known zzso most of them have a clear role in processes such as bacterial defense and zzso zzso Gene sets reported from our method provide a measure of the zzso divergence between two closely related zzso
