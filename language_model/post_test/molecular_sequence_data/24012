zzso mosaic virus zzso is a representative member of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso is a membrane protein of unknown structure with a zzso zzso domain and a putative zzso activity in the zzso zzso In order to make a functional prediction of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso domain, we have built a model of its zzso The use of fold recognition servers hinted at two different zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso as putative templates for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A structural model of zzso zzso in zzso was obtained by means of a fold recognition server zzso On the other hand, we used the zzso motifs described in the literature to construct a model of the structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain as a member of the zzso The biological functionality and statistic zzso were used to discriminate between the two zzso The results illustrate that the use of sequence profiles and patterns helps zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso is a potential member of the zzso of zzso and it can be modeled with the structure of a member of the zzso family of zzso The zzso mechanism was zzso by the model and this supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso should have zzso zzso
