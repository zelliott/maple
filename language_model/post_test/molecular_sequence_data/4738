zzso and genetic studies have pointed out the importance of several sites in zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli in the decoding zzso These sites consist of the core of the decoding center zzso zzso and two other segments zzso and zzso zzso To detect a possible structural link between these functionally related regions, we analyzed their sensitivity to zzso changes induced by zzso which are located in each of these regions and are known to affect the decoding zzso The zzso of five segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by chemical probing of zzso zzso containing the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with natural zzso zzso zzso showed only minor zzso differences with respect to zzso isolated from zzso When zzso zzso made in zzso replaced natural zzso zzso a slightly looser zzso of the central core region was zzso zzso zzso made by zzso with zzso zzso zzso made in zzso showed zzso effects which were in all cases localized to the region of secondary structure surrounding the site of zzso Although the core of the decoding center zzso zzso and the two other sites zzso and zzso zzso participating in the decoding function have been functionally linked, our data indicate that they are structurally zzso They also provide evidence for an unusual structure of the zzso decoding center, possibly involving zzso zzso Furthermore, the absence of any zzso effect induced by the zzso zzso except at the site of zzso itself points to its zzso as opposed to zzso involvement in the decoding function of the zzso
