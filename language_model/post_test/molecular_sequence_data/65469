zzso ammonium zzso zzso has recently been recognized as a zzso for the removal of fixed N from aquatic zzso However, the quantitative significance of zzso in zzso sediments is zzso and zzso have been limited to a few zzso We measured zzso and conventional zzso activities in sediments along zzso zzso in the zzso Bay and two of its zzso the zzso River and zzso zzso zzso sediments were incubated with zzso amendments of zzso zzso and zzso to determine relative activities of zzso and zzso The percent of zzso production due to zzso zzso ranged from 0 to zzso in the zzso system, with the highest zzso in the freshwater portion of the main stem of upper zzso Bay, where water column zzso zzso are consistently zzso Intermediate levels of relative zzso zzso were detected at locations corresponding to tidal freshwater and zzso locations in the zzso River, whereas zzso was not detected in the tidal freshwater location in the zzso zzso zzso activity was also not detected in the zzso end of zzso Bay, where water column zzso zzso are consistently zzso The zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso rate in zzso zzso zzso but zzso was related to water column zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial communities were also examined by amplifying DNA extracted from the upper zzso Bay zzso with zzso chain reaction zzso zzso that are specific for zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso A total of 35 zzso sequences were zzso and zzso analysis grouped the sequences in two distinct clusters belonging to the zzso zzso zzso
