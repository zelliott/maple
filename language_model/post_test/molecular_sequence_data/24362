zzso zzso a major zzso protein in human milk, has been suggested to have multiple biological roles such as zzso iron zzso modulating the immune system, embryonic development, and cell zzso Our previous binding studies suggested the presence of a specific zzso for zzso zzso in the small zzso of newborn zzso which may facilitate iron zzso We here report the cloning and the functional expression of the human zzso zzso and the evidence of its involvement in iron zzso The entire coding region of the zzso zzso was cloned by zzso based on zzso acid sequences of the zzso native zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was then expressed in a zzso cell system and zzso by immobilized human zzso zzso affinity zzso where binding of zzso to the zzso was partially zzso zzso The apparent molecular mass was 136 zzso under zzso conditions and 34 zzso under reducing zzso zzso bound to the zzso with an apparent zzso of approximately 360 zzso These zzso properties of the zzso are similar to those of the zzso zzso revealed that the gene was expressed at high levels in fetal small zzso and in adult heart and at lower levels in zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells indicated that the zzso is zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso were increased by zzso and zzso times, respectively, compared to those in zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate the presence of a unique zzso mechanism for zzso zzso by the zzso
