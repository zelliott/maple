A zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso has been cloned by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and has zzso zzso activity that cannot be activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a high degree of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso precisely mapped by a zzso zzso A zzso identity is observed throughout the middle segments of approximately 1000 zzso of both zzso large parts of which are composed of repetitions of a zzso acid motif similar to those found in human zzso zzso zzso and Toll gene zzso However, a segment corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears lost from zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 140 zzso are not well zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cause loss of zzso by the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may have lost the ability to interact with zzso proteins by the loss of a regulatory zzso
