Although zzso other zzso zzso and a variety of zzso proteins lacking an zzso zzso signal have been widely described as located at the cell surface in zzso and in zzso cells, their presence in this external location is still zzso Here, we report that different experimental approaches zzso cellular biology and zzso show that zzso zzso can reach the cell surface and describe the protein regions involved in its cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso fused at their C zzso with the zzso internal zzso or green fluorescent protein zzso as reporter zzso proved that the 169 zzso zzso acids are sufficient to target the protein to the cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso fusion zzso with a plasma membrane zzso zzso was also identified among membrane proteins obtained by a zzso protocol that includes sodium zzso to prevent zzso zzso These proteins were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso membrane proteins and a zzso involved in cell wall zzso zzso were also identified in this zzso
