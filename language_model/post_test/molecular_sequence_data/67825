A zzso zzso polar single zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a wheat soil subjected to zzso for several zzso zzso of strain zzso grow zzso on zzso zzso medium at 30 zzso in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso and pH zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests supported the zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso sharing zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso experiments between the two strains showed only moderate zzso similarity zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content is zzso zzso The zzso respiratory zzso is zzso The major cellular fatty acids present are zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The isolate is distinguishable from other related members of the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso From the zzso zzso and zzso data, it is evident that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
