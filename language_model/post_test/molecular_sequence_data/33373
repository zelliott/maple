zzso termination zzso zzso zzso are due to zzso or deletion of zzso causing a zzso and premature termination zzso in zzso These transcripts are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and have a very short zzso We used a zzso technique to screen for genes that zzso their zzso signal upon zzso zzso zzso blockade in chronic zzso leukemia zzso specimens and identified an zzso transcript with zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso transcript lacking zzso 11, resulting in a zzso and zzso The zzso zzso transcript was also identified in normal B cells, but occurred at a much lower level compared with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression was depressed more than 50% in zzso cases zzso to normal B zzso By real-time zzso chain reaction analysis, the relative amounts of zzso transcript zzso correlated with amounts of zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso specimens containing high amounts of zzso transcript resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso reporter, a zzso known to be zzso in zzso Our data point to a novel mechanism of zzso gene zzso with zzso cells displaying a higher proportion of zzso zzso transcripts and resulting zzso of the zzso zzso
