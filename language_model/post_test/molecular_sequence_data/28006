zzso zzso B zzso zzso a novel zzso editing reaction, which replaces a zzso zzso zzso with zzso This substitution converts zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to a stop zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Edwards, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Scott, zzso zzso Cell 50, zzso To examine sequences in the human zzso zzso required for the editing reaction, a series of deletion zzso around the zzso conversion site was prepared and zzso into a rat zzso cell line zzso zzso This cell makes both zzso and zzso zzso was detected by a primer extension zzso on zzso that had been amplified by the zzso chain zzso zzso of between zzso and 26 zzso spanning the conversion site underwent similar levels of zzso zzso was confirmed by cloning and sequencing of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso did not occur in zzso human zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cell lines, which do not make zzso These results verify that zzso is generated by a genuine zzso zzso editing reaction and show that 26 zzso of zzso zzso are sufficient for zzso
