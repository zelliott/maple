A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C zzso zzso was isolated for its ability to completely degrade the gasoline additive zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that this zzso was a member of the class zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence identity to other zzso in this group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ranged from 93 to 96 zzso The zzso data including zzso as the major zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : 0 as the major fatty acids and a DNA zzso content of 69 zzso support the inclusion of strain zzso in the class zzso It differed from other members of the zzso group by being a zzso zzso that used methanol as a sole carbon source, and by also being able to grow zzso in defined media containing ethanol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as sole carbon zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso and genetic information, a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
