zzso of zzso class II gene expression involves the formation of a zzso initiation complex that includes zzso zzso II, general zzso factors, and zzso components of the zzso zzso regulators of zzso have been zzso but it is not clear whether any are general zzso of class II genes in zzso We reasoned that defects in truly global negative regulators should compensate for deficiencies in zzso because zzso plays a positive role in zzso zzso zzso experiments reveal that this is indeed the zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso of the human negative regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses a zzso in zzso Global defects in zzso synthesis caused by the defective zzso zzso are alleviated by the zzso suppressing zzso in zzso indicating that zzso zzso is a global negative regulator of class II zzso These results imply that relief from repression at class II promoters is a general feature of gene zzso in zzso
