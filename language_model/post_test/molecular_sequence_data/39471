zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso zzso chain extension appended to a zzso zzso zzso This extension, termed a zzso factor zzso possesses a zzso motif zzso that binds zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso and provides a potent zzso binding capacity to this zzso zzso native zzso zzso a zzso zzso mimicking the zzso acid zzso zzso domain of zzso Here, examination of zzso recognition showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without specificity of zzso revealing that none of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso domain are essential zzso of zzso zzso zzso To test whether the zzso domain reduces the specificity of the zzso with regard to complete zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso truncated zzso was zzso The presence of the zzso zzso of zzso appeared to be necessary and sufficient to transform zzso zzso or zzso into potent zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso interactions between the zzso stem of zzso and the zzso domain do not relax the zzso specificity of zzso zzso The possibility that interaction of the full-length zzso zzso with the zzso is required to induce the zzso center of the zzso into a productive zzso is zzso
