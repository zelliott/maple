The zzso alpha 2 zzso the product of the zzso alpha 2 zzso is a regulator of zzso cell type; it turns off zzso of the zzso genes by binding to an operator located upstream of each zzso In this paper we describe the domain structure, zzso organization, and some unusual features of the way this protein contacts its zzso We show that the protein is folded into two zzso The zzso domain binds specifically to the zzso the zzso domain contains zzso zzso The alpha 2 zzso differs from those of the zzso zzso in that it is flexible and therefore is able to bind tightly to differently spaced operator zzso In the natural operator, the centers of the operator zzso are two and one-half turns of DNA apart, exposing them on opposite sides of the DNA zzso We show that the design of alpha 2 allows a zzso to reach across its operator such that it occupies the two zzso but leaves the middle of the operator available to other zzso
