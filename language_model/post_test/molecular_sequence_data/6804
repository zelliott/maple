We constructed a series of human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso virus strain zzso zzso zzso viruses having zzso and/or zzso genes of either zzso or zzso based on a zzso virus with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso All of the zzso viruses zzso in human and zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and in several zzso human cell lines, though their growth zzso were slightly different depending on whether zzso and zzso were from zzso or zzso or were zzso The presence of zzso accelerated replication in all the cells used and the replication of each zzso appeared to reflect that of the parental virus from which zzso was zzso The presence of zzso had no clear effect in human and monkey zzso but the replication of each zzso was influenced by the origin of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso which carries zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso into three zzso zzso three zzso monkeys and two zzso zzso From 2 to 14 weeks after zzso viruses were consistently zzso from all the monkeys and virus loads were as high as that of zzso reported zzso The results indicate that infection with zzso is more efficient than any of our previous zzso viruses and suggest that zzso having zzso zzso will be a useful challenge virus for evaluating AIDS vaccines based on zzso zzso in zzso monkeys instead of zzso
