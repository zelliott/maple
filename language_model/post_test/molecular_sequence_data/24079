Resistance zzso genes of plants are responsible for pathogen recognition and zzso proteins that trigger a cascade of responses when a pathogen invades a zzso R genes are assumed to be under strong selection, but there is limited knowledge of the processes affecting R gene diversity in the zzso In this study, DNA sequence variation of zzso zzso was surveyed in populations of zzso zzso a wild relative of the cultivated zzso The zzso locus is involved in resistance to strains of the fungus zzso zzso At least 26 different zzso zzso were detected in natural populations of zzso zzso These zzso differ by single base pair zzso as well as zzso in regions coding for zzso zzso zzso population genetic analyses suggest that natural selection has acted zzso on zzso zzso with selection against zzso acid zzso occurring in the zzso portion of the zzso and possible restricted positive selection in the 3' zzso Balancing selection may have maintained zzso at the zzso end of the zzso Limited sequence exchange between genes has also contributed to sequence zzso zzso zzso individuals differ in the number of zzso zzso they contain, obscuring the relationships of zzso and zzso This survey of zzso variation in zzso zzso illustrates the wealth of R gene diversity that exists in wild plant zzso as well as the complexity of interacting genetic and evolutionary processes that generate such zzso
