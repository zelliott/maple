We present the first description of a zzso DNA zzso zzso able to replicate in a zzso zzso zzso B5 zzso zzso zzso and has a zzso consisting of zzso bases coding for 10 putative open reading zzso The organization of the zzso is very similar to the organization of the zzso of zzso zzso active on zzso zzso The putative coat protein exhibits zzso with the coat proteins of zzso zzso and zzso active on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B5 is, therefore, zzso related to the zzso zzso active on zzso zzso
