The B zzso zzso and zzso are key structural proteins in those classes of zzso considered to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LDL, oxidized LDL, and zzso Here we describe the development of transgenic mice expressing high levels of human zzso and zzso A zzso human zzso DNA zzso containing the entire human zzso gene was isolated from a zzso zzso library and zzso into zzso mouse zzso 16 transgenic founders expressing human zzso were generated, and the animals with the highest expression had plasma zzso levels nearly as high as those of zzso humans zzso 50 zzso The human zzso in transgenic mouse plasma was present largely in zzso of the LDL class as shown by zzso gel zzso zzso on a zzso 6 column, and density zzso zzso When the human zzso transgenic founders were crossed with transgenic mice expressing human zzso the offspring that expressed both zzso had high plasma levels of human zzso Both the human zzso and zzso transgenic mice will be valuable resources for studying zzso metabolism and the role of zzso and zzso in zzso
