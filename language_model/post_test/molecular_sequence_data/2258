zzso of the gene for the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the rat is acutely regulated by a number of hormones, including zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso In this study we demonstrate by zzso I zzso that a region of the zzso promoter, extending from zzso to zzso contained eight protein binding zzso Two nuclear proteins protected adjacent sites from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso which have been previously shown to be involved in maintaining the level of zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso competition studies suggested that the zzso binding to the zzso element zzso occupies a second site at zzso to zzso which has a high degree of sequence zzso to the zzso and also binds to two other elements that show partial sequence zzso The zzso which bound to these four elements zzso through zzso affinity zzso suggesting that the zzso promoter has four binding sites for the zzso zzso Potential zzso elements in the zzso promoter were identified by zzso with nuclear extracts prepared from rat liver, zzso brain, and zzso The multiple zzso sites in this zzso region reflect the complex zzso regulation that is characteristic of this zzso
