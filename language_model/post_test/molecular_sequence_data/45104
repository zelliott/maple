zzso inclusion bodies suggestive of zzso infection were observed in zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso that died without zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed zzso zzso viral particles that measured approximately 176 zzso in zzso zzso contained a dense central core and zzso typical of zzso zzso DNA was amplified using zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso and determined to be approximately zzso similar to reported zzso zzso zzso A zzso chain zzso zzso probe was used to detect viral zzso acid in tissue sections by DNA in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The detected zzso acid corresponded to the inclusion bodies observed zzso This represents a novel zzso of zzso
