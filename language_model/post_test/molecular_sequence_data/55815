The zzso plays a critical role in bone formation, bone zzso bone zzso formation, and zzso zzso To better understand the process of zzso bone formation, we determined the structure and zzso types of the plasma membrane calcium pump from normal human zzso A complementary DNA library from normal human zzso was screened for plasma membrane calcium pump zzso zzso and analysis of zzso clones revealed the presence of a zzso base pair zzso that zzso a 1220 zzso acid protein that was similar to the human plasma membrane calcium pump zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso cells contains bands of zzso approximately zzso and zzso bases zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from human zzso followed by amplification of the zzso duplex with calcium pump zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso 1 and 2 of the calcium zzso zzso 4 was not zzso We conclude that normal adult human zzso contain a plasma membrane calcium pump that is similar to the human plasma membrane calcium pump zzso zzso It is likely that this pump plays an important role in the cell biology of the human zzso
