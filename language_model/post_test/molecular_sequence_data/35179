A long-term experiment on the effect of zzso addition to soil on the suppression of zzso pathogens was set up and monitored for 8 years in an experimental field, zzso The zzso zzso matter obtained from zzso was added to soil top layers on two different occasions, and the zzso of soil toward zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso was zzso in addition to analyses of the zzso and community structures of members of the soil zzso The data revealed that zzso amendment had raised the zzso of soil, in particular toward zzso zzso 9 months after the zzso treatment, extending to 2 years following zzso Moreover, major effects of the added zzso on the soil microbial communities were zzso First, shifts in both the zzso and structures of the zzso soil microbial communities, both of total soil bacteria and zzso were zzso In addition, the zzso and structures of soil zzso and the zzso were affected by zzso At the functional gene level, the abundance of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso genes carried by the soil bacteria also revealed zzso as a result of the added zzso The effects of zzso noted for the zzso were specifically related to significant zzso in the zzso of the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso These effects of zzso persisted over the time of the zzso
