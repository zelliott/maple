To investigate genes involved in zzso stages of cancer, we analyzed expression of zzso in three cell lines derived from zzso colon zzso 26 by means of a differential display zzso Each of these lines exhibits distinct zzso zzso Among many bands representing different expression patterns in the display, we confirmed by northern analysis that a gene corresponding to one amplified fragment, termed zzso zzso related to zzso zzso was expressed more abundantly in zzso the zzso with the lowest zzso potential, than in cell lines zzso an zzso zzso zzso and in zzso a spontaneously zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated zzso zzso clones and subsequently human zzso clones corresponding to the zzso zzso The human and mouse zzso both zzso proteins of 600 zzso zzso which show weak zzso to proteins belonging to the zzso zzso When we examined the expression levels of this novel gene in human colon zzso and in corresponding zzso zzso we found that in more than half of these zzso expression was significantly reduced in association with zzso zzso Our results imply that in humans the zzso gene product may regulate the zzso zzso of some zzso zzso
