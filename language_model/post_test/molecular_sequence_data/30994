We studied a case of familial zzso zzso zzso By Southern zzso amplification and sequence analysis, the genetic zzso was zzso It consists in a point zzso zzso greater than G in the third zzso of the gene causing a premature stop zzso zzso at the zzso 36 of the mature form, the protein loses its functional zzso becomes inefficient and cannot be detected in the zzso because of its high zzso The zzso destroys an zzso site, present in the normal gene zzso This point zzso is useful in the diagnosis of this zzso zzso zzso
