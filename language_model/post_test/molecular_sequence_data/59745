zzso zzso zzso transformed with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso fall into two distinct groups based on their zzso zzso status, zzso or zzso We have taken advantage of such clones in order to study the zzso target genes by the differential display method of zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso clone 16, that zzso a large transcript on Northern zzso The clone 16 transcript is zzso in zzso cell lines that express zzso zzso compared with zzso cell lines that express zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso which is zzso activated in cells treated with zzso radiation in a zzso manner, the clone 16 transcript was also induced in response to cell zzso The sequence of clone 16 exhibits a high zzso to two members of zzso zzso zzso
