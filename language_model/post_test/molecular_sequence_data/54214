zzso zzso proteins are special class of integral membrane proteins that in recent years have received a considerable amount of attention due to their diverse cellular functions and unique targeting and zzso zzso zzso by the presence of a single, zzso zzso domain at or near their C zzso zzso proteins must be inserted into zzso zzso and are zzso such that their larger zzso domain (most often the functional zzso faces the zzso while their shorter zzso domain faces the interior of the zzso The zzso domain of zzso proteins also usually contains the information responsible for their selective targeting to the proper zzso zzso a process that, based primarily on studies with zzso and zzso appears to be highly complex due to the presence of multiple zzso Within this context, we discuss here the zzso of plant zzso proteins and the potential for hundreds of new zzso proteins identified via zzso screens to contribute to the already remarkable number of roles that this class of membrane proteins zzso in throughout plant growth and zzso
