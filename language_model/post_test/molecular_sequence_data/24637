zzso promoters are zzso chemicals which increase the probability of cancer by accelerating the zzso expansion of cells transformed during tumor zzso zzso zzso is an zzso drug which promotes zzso in zzso when administered subsequent to an initiating zzso like zzso zzso Here we have investigated the prevalence and patterns of zzso in two zzso zzso and zzso both known zzso targets in mouse zzso Liver tumors were generated by a single administration of DEN to 6 week old mice followed by feeding of zzso zzso containing or control diet for 39 zzso zzso at zzso zzso 61 were screened by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by direct sequencing of zzso products spanning zzso zzso In tumors from mice treated with DEN alone, the prevalence of zzso zzso was approximately zzso zzso while no zzso zzso zzso were zzso in tumors of this treatment zzso By contrast, zzso zzso were zzso in tumors from mice treated with zzso zzso while approximately zzso zzso of tumors from this group showed zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso strongly affects the prevalence of zzso in the two zzso zzso presumably by positive and negative selection for cells harboring the respective zzso
