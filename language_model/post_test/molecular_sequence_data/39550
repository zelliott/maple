By fluorescent differential display, we identified six transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that showed the differential expression patterns during the zzso development of the mouse zzso We further analyzed the latter four transcripts whose cellular zzso in developing mouse brains have not been zzso In the zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso were zzso zzso clone zzso was zzso and clone zzso remained relatively zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso were derivatives of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso c zzso complex zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were identified as transcripts of a predicted gene zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were abundantly present in the zzso whereas zzso and zzso were widely distributed in various mouse zzso In the zzso mouse brain, moderately high zzso levels of zzso were restricted to the zzso bulb, zzso cerebral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized at high levels in the zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso (red zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, trapezoid body, zzso zzso High zzso levels of zzso were observed in the zzso bulb, zzso zzso and zzso whereas those of zzso were detected in the zzso cells of the zzso bulb, zzso zzso and zzso
