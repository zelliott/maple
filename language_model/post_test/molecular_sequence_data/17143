zzso DNA extracted from 2000 year-old zzso bones was examined in order to amplify zzso and nuclear DNA zzso A specific zzso zzso sequence representing zzso of the entire zzso zzso proved to be a suitable target to address the question of the presence of zzso in ancient zzso The zzso strategy designed to investigate this specific target also allowed us to calculate the molecular weight of zzso DNA zzso zzso of a 370 zzso DNA zzso of zzso control region allowed the comparison of ancient DNA sequences with those of modern horses to assess their genetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was also examined to unravel the zzso base modification feature and to test the status of zzso zzso zzso on the basis of a Mae III restriction site zzso
