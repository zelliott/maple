The principal zzso domain, zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso was inserted in two positions on the surface of the protein that makes up the zzso shell of the insect zzso House zzso The hybrid proteins were expressed in insect cells via zzso zzso Three different hybrids were used as zzso two with a single copy of the insert in different positions of the carrier protein and a third with two copies of the insert at the same positions as zzso All hybrid proteins induced strong and broad specific immune response in guinea pigs against different zzso zzso However, only one of the hybrid proteins was able to induce a strong zzso response against MN and zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that a very short zzso sequence of zzso can constitute a valuable zzso able to induce a zzso response if presented to the immune system in the context of the zzso zzso zzso
