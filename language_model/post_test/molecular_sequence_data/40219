Ras proteins regulate cell growth, death, and zzso and it is well established that this functional versatility is accomplished through their different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are believed to zzso at the zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso however, recycling zzso zzso also zzso to a zzso region, which is often indistinguishable from the zzso In this study, we show that active zzso Ras proteins mainly zzso zzso at zzso and that zzso act as a way station along the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso requires two zzso groups for zzso zzso The lack of either or both zzso groups leads to the zzso of the zzso proteins to the zzso zzso zzso apparatus, or the zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso directs Ras proteins to the correct zzso zzso for trafficking and zzso
