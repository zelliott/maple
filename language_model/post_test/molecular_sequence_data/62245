The zzso of specific zzso in seed protein processing is only vaguely understood; indeed, the overall role of processing in stable protein deposition has been the subject of more speculation than direct zzso zzso members of the zzso processing zzso zzso family were hypothesized to perform a unique function in seed protein processing, but we demonstrated previously that zzso protein processing in developing zzso seeds occurs independently of this zzso zzso Here, we describe the unexpected expression of zzso zzso in developing seeds and test the zzso of all zzso in seed storage protein zzso by systematically stacking knockout zzso zzso of all four members zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene family in zzso The complete removal of zzso function in the zzso zzso zzso zzso quadruple zzso resulted in a total shift of storage protein zzso from zzso processed zzso to a finite number of prominent alternatively processed zzso zzso at sites other than the zzso zzso zzso targeted by zzso Although alternatively zzso zzso zzso zzso largely accumulated as zzso zzso zzso with apparent molecular masses similar to those of zzso zzso zzso they showed markedly altered zzso and protein assembly zzso Instead of forming zzso zzso alternatively processed zzso zzso were deposited primarily as zzso zzso However, despite the impact on seed protein processing, plants devoid of all known functional zzso genes appeared unchanged with regard to protein content in mature seeds, relative zzso rates of protein reserves during zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso processing, and the zzso property changes attributed to this specific processing step, are not required for the successful deposition and zzso of seed storage protein in the protein storage zzso of zzso zzso
