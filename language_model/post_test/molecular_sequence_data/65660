Two zzso elements zzso were identified in the cotton zzso zzso zzso and were designated as zzso and zzso zzso is flanked by 16 zzso zzso terminal repeats zzso and the duplicated zzso zzso and contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with the presumed zzso domain, indicating that this element may be an active autonomously mobile zzso zzso was found with the same zzso but lacks the majority of an zzso zzso Thus, this element was thought to be a zzso zzso zzso element displays and distribution of the two zzso in individuals from three different zzso zzso populations suggest that zzso of zzso by the zzso of zzso may be zzso and zzso of zzso might occur not only within the same individual, but also among different zzso In addition, horizontal transfer was probably involved in the evolution of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
