zzso is an absolute requirement for living systems and the zzso trafficking of this metal to zzso proteins is fundamental to normal cellular zzso The copper zzso perform the dual functions of trafficking and the prevention of zzso exposure to copper zzso in zzso Only a small number of copper zzso have been identified at this time but their conservation across plant, bacterial and animal species suggests that the majority of living systems zzso these proteins for copper zzso The available data suggest that each zzso protein in the cell is served by a specific copper zzso Although copper zzso cannot be zzso for one another in a given cell type, copper zzso that deliver to the same protein in different cell types appear to be functionally zzso The majority of the copper zzso identified thus far have an zzso zzso global fold with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for a given zzso protein appears to be zzso by the zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso binds to such proteins as zzso in a zzso complex with three sulfur zzso Only the copper zzso specific for zzso zzso deviates from this zzso
