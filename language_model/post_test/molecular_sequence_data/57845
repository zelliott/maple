We have characterized four sequences from a small library containing a subset of the repetitive families of the zzso Each clone has a repetition frequency of less than 1,100 copies per zzso and each clone represents a unique family of middle repetitive zzso One clone zzso shares zzso with mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso a second clone zzso has partial zzso with a sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the human zzso zzso while two clones zzso zzso are new that have no zzso to any reported DNA zzso Each clone zzso to one or two discrete zzso transcripts from one or more zzso of the zzso zzso zzso detected restriction zzso length zzso zzso at three zzso in zzso mouse DNA, defining zzso at the zzso end of zzso 5 and the zzso end of zzso zzso The third locus is zzso This study demonstrates that cloned repeats from a repetitive DNA library are a potential source of genetic zzso
