A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from freshwater zzso The strain was characterized by using a zzso approach in order to determine its zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that the isolate constituted a distinct branch within the zzso zzso showing the highest level of sequence similarity with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso DNA zzso content of zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso Furthermore, the major zzso component zzso in the zzso and the presence of zzso suggested that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
