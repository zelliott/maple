zzso zzso contain peptides with high selectivity for zzso zzso Due to the limited availability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 1, the zzso was expressed in zzso cells using a synthetic zzso and zzso The isolated zzso had over four orders of magnitude higher affinity for the zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso The zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso through zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso having no effect on the function of the other zzso The zzso zzso provides a unique tool for identification and functional zzso of zzso receptors in cells and zzso
