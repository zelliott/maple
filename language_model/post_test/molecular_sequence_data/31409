zzso zzso is a serious complication of pregnancy with potentially life threatening consequences for both mother and zzso zzso there is no test with the required performance to predict which healthy first-time mothers will go on to develop zzso The high zzso sensitivity, and zzso nature of selected reaction monitoring holds great potential as a tool for the zzso and validation of putative candidate zzso disease zzso zzso of this potential involves establishing a high zzso cost effective, zzso sample preparation zzso We have developed a zzso zzso sample preparation zzso before a zzso selected reaction monitoring zzso This zzso has been applied to the search for novel zzso zzso for zzso To discover novel candidate zzso for zzso we used zzso tagging to identify several potential zzso proteins in plasma obtained at 15 weeks gestation from zzso women who later developed zzso compared with pregnant women who remained zzso Such a study generates a number of zzso zzso that require further testing in larger patient zzso As zzso two of these proteins were taken forward for zzso in a 100 women zzso zzso 42 zzso using zzso zzso We obtained zzso protein zzso across the 100 samples and demonstrated significant changes in protein levels, even with as little as zzso change in protein zzso The zzso data correlated with a commercial zzso suggesting that this is a robust zzso suitable for zzso zzso zzso zzso of which candidate zzso should be taken forward for thorough zzso A subset of zzso zzso zzso had value as novel zzso markers for zzso
