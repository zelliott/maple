We have isolated the mouse zzso of human zzso protein zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso recognition motifs zzso in the N zzso of the predicted zzso acid zzso and a highly basic C zzso rich in zzso zzso displayed a plastic of expression in cardiac zzso In the adult zzso zzso is widely distributed, although it was found at relatively lower levels in the zzso In zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso distribution in staged mouse zzso showed that zzso onset occurs later in the heart than in other embryonic zzso While zzso expression was found at day zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it was not in cardiac zzso zzso was detected in the zzso at day zzso and at day zzso it was also detected in the zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso zzso displayed a peak of expression in the heart at days zzso zzso and its abundance decayed in the zzso This dynamic pattern of cardiac expression suggests that zzso may be contributing to a change in the ratio of zzso components during cardiac growth and development, which may have consequences for zzso zzso zzso stabilization, or zzso
