As part of our effort to identify putative protein targets for the development of male zzso we performed an in-depth zzso analysis of human zzso by liquid zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso were collected from a single fertile individual and zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso separation of these zzso followed by manual cutting of the zzso yielded 35 gel sections for each fraction to include proteins across the full range of zzso zzso zzso analysis of these gel sections identified more than zzso proteins with high confidence, with zzso proteins identified in the soluble zzso zzso identified in the zzso zzso and 309 identified in both zzso This characterization of the human zzso zzso provides a zzso zzso relevant index of the proteins that comprise human zzso
