A zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library of zzso young fruits of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence is zzso zzso and zzso identical to zzso from tomato, zzso and zzso coli, zzso When the pea zzso zzso was put under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso and introduced into zzso zzso it zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso The zzso activity expressed in zzso zzso was inhibited zzso by zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso No activity was detected in the zzso zzso zzso nor when it was transformed with an zzso zzso zzso This provides direct evidence that the zzso zzso from pea zzso a functional, specific zzso activity and that zzso zzso is able to process correctly the zzso In the pea plant, gene expression of the zzso is high in young developing zzso like shoot tips, young leaflets and flower zzso zzso expanded leaflets and roots have much lower, but still zzso levels of the zzso zzso In the zzso and fruit, they are zzso zzso showing high levels of expression during the early stages of fruit growth, which in pea is mainly due to cell zzso The observed changes in the zzso levels of zzso zzso alone, however, cannot account for the differences in zzso activity suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must be zzso
