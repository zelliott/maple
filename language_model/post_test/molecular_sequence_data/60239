The zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso to zzso at particular positions in certain zzso zzso zzso data base searches and sequence alignments using the first four identified zzso zzso led zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso and, zzso Santi and co-workers zzso zzso Reid, zzso Greene, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso to group this class of zzso into four families, which display no statistically significant global sequence similarity to each zzso Upon further scrutiny zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso the Santi group discovered that a single zzso acid zzso is the only zzso acid present in all of the aligned zzso they then demonstrated that this zzso acid zzso is zzso essential in one zzso zzso To test the functional significance of the sequence alignments in light of the global zzso between the zzso zzso families, we changed the zzso acid zzso in representatives of two additional families to both zzso and zzso the zzso zzso are zzso inactive but retain the ability to bind zzso zzso We have also verified that the zzso zzso do not release zzso from the zzso at a rate significant relative to turnover by the zzso zzso zzso Our results clearly show that the aligned zzso acid zzso is critical for the zzso activity of zzso zzso from two additional families of these zzso supporting the zzso power of the sequence alignments and suggesting that the sequence motif containing the aligned zzso acid zzso might be a prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso
