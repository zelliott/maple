The zzso zzso zzso encodes one alpha zzso zzso a beta zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Our experiments show that the zzso resulting from the loss of the zzso zzso alpha zzso is reproduced by tandem depletion of both zzso and zzso zzso We propose that alpha zzso combines with the zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso and zzso zzso that perform the entire repertoire of zzso function in the zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso exhibit three striking parallels zzso zzso beta zzso are associated with the sites of zzso contact in zzso zzso zzso the highest levels of zzso zzso occur in the nervous system; and zzso beta zzso in zzso muscle is associated with points of attachment of the zzso apparatus to adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with plasma zzso at sites of zzso zzso beginning at the zzso stage, and with a dramatic increase in intensity after zzso when most cell proliferation has been zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso by zzso interference to zzso levels does not affect the establishment of structural and functional polarity in zzso and zzso zzso to recent speculation, zzso zzso is not associated with internal zzso and depletion of zzso zzso was not associated with any zzso defects in zzso Instead zzso zzso zzso arrest as early larvae with progressive defects in the zzso and nervous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for normal muscle and zzso function, but is zzso for embryonic zzso and establishment of early zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso evolved in zzso in response to the needs of cells in the context of mechanically integrated zzso that can withstand the rigors imposed by an active zzso
