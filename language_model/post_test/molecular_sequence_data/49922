zzso stimulation of zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso channel, previously identified as the transient inward zzso zzso zzso of human zzso human zzso rat zzso human zzso or skate zzso receptors in zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso dependence and zzso gating of the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and human zzso zzso did not alter the properties of the zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of either the human zzso or human zzso zzso resulted in zzso dependence and zzso properties, respectively, of the zzso channel that were similar to those zzso by the respective native zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the human zzso zzso identified a short region responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso This region contains a zzso sequence motif found in all zzso receptors that zzso the zzso dependence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides from the zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso receptors produced a shift in the zzso dependence and slowed zzso zzso respectively, after injection into zzso expressing human zzso or truncated human zzso zzso These results indicate that certain zzso receptors are capable of modulating the zzso sensitivity and zzso gating of an zzso zzso zzso channel through interactions involving the zzso region of the zzso Such zzso of zzso channel function could also exist in native zzso cells that express zzso zzso
