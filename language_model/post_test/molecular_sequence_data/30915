The zzso acids of many plant viruses zzso proteins with one or more of the following zzso an Mr of approximately zzso zzso in the cell wall of the infected plant and a demonstrated role in zzso transport of zzso A progressive alignment strategy, aligning first those sequences known to be similar, and then aligning the resulting groups of zzso was used to examine further the zzso of the zzso acid sequences of putative transport proteins of zzso of proteins similar to the putative transport protein of alfalfa mosaic virus zzso and of those similar to the tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso The strategy first identified regions in which multiple zzso of one group were similar to those of another zzso The regions of similarity were brought into alignment by the conservative introduction of zzso The positions of the introduction of gaps were adjusted to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the resulting zzso determined both by comparison with shuffled zzso acid sequences and with the sequence alignment off-set by 1 to 15 zzso in each direction, suggest that the zzso acid sequences of the three groups of viruses are zzso zzso Nevertheless, significant relationships between members of the zzso group of sequences and members of each of the zzso and zzso groups were zzso These relationships and the analysis of the number of zzso between present sequences and a hypothetical common zzso suggest that the sequences of the zzso proteins are less zzso from the zzso than either the zzso or zzso zzso The alignment identified common regions of predicted secondary structure and regions of similar zzso regions possibly crucial for proper functioning of the zzso
