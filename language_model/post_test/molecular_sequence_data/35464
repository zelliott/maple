The population structure and history of the cryptic malaria zzso species, zzso zzso zzso was investigated throughout zzso New zzso and the Solomon Islands with the aim of detailing genetic subdivisions and the potential for movement through this zzso complex zzso We obtained zzso collections from over 80 sites and zzso a diverse array of molecular markers that evolve through different zzso zzso were initially identified to species and zzso using the zzso DNA second internal transcribed zzso DNA sequencing of a single copy nuclear zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso I zzso were then investigated and 12 nuclear zzso markers were developed and zzso Our data revealed three genetically distinct zzso in zzso New zzso the second on zzso Island zzso Province, zzso New zzso and the third on zzso Island zzso zzso zzso differentiation within zzso New zzso was much lower than that found in studies of other closely related species in the zzso The data does suggest that zzso zzso has undergone a population bottleneck followed by a recent population and range expansion in zzso New zzso zzso and regional economic growth may be zzso this population expansion, as zzso zzso is able to rapidly occupy human modified landscapes and traverse zzso zzso We therefore anticipate extensive movement of this species through New zzso into the zzso with a potential increase in malaria frequency in a warming zzso well as relatively unrestricted gene flow of advantageous zzso that may confound zzso control zzso
