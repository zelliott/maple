Although several studies have demonstrated an association between the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso variable number of tandem repeats zzso in the zzso 3 at zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso disorder zzso others failed to replicate this zzso In this study, a total of zzso individuals with zzso were zzso for zzso zzso 3 zzso All zzso zzso subjects were selected for zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso were selected paired by age, ancestry and disorder zzso in order to have a sample as homogeneous as possible with zzso zzso Using these criteria, 103 individuals zzso with zzso and 37 control zzso were further zzso An excess of rare zzso were observed in the zzso zzso of zzso patient when compared with controls zzso This difference was not observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso changes that predict synonymous and zzso zzso were more common in the zzso sample zzso for total zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In zzso prediction of zzso zzso caused by these zzso have also been zzso Our findings suggest that not only repeat length but also DNA sequence should be assessed to better understand the role of zzso zzso 3 zzso in zzso genetic zzso
