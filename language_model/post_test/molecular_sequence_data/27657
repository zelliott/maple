Human zzso virus type 1 zzso encodes a nuclear zzso termed zzso that is required for the expression of the viral structural proteins and, zzso for viral zzso The Rev protein acts zzso to induce the zzso nuclear export of zzso zzso zzso species that are otherwise excluded from the cell zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify two distinct regions of the zzso Rev protein that are required for in zzso biological zzso The larger and more zzso of these two regions includes, but extends beyond, an zzso sequence element required for nuclear zzso zzso of a second, more zzso Rev protein sequence element was found to yield defective Rev proteins that act as zzso zzso of Rev zzso These Rev zzso are shown to inhibit zzso replication when expressed in zzso cells and may have potential application in the treatment of zzso related zzso
