We have cloned and expressed the zzso gene of zzso major in zzso to develop a zzso vaccine against zzso zzso zzso Two different expression systems were zzso The first system consists of zzso a zzso zzso promoter, which drives expression of zzso an open reading frame in zzso This system allows the production of zzso zzso as hybrids with the zzso gene zzso The second expression system relies on the production of zzso fragments as fusion proteins with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso resulted in the production of zzso in zzso The ability of the two zzso zzso strains to induce protective immunity against a challenge with zzso major zzso was evaluated after vaccination of susceptible zzso and resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso producing zzso as a hybrid protein with the zzso region of the zzso zzso significant protection against a challenge with zzso major in zzso zzso
