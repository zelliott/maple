zzso zzso is a newly discovered member of the zzso family that regulates cellular neutral zzso stores and zzso It is expressed in highly zzso zzso and is induced during zzso Like other members of the zzso family, zzso expression is also regulated by zzso However, its induction by zzso is zzso So far, the zzso regulation of zzso apart from zzso remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso regulation of pig zzso and revealed that its promoter activity was zzso by zzso By constructing various progressive deletions and zzso the binding region of zzso was zzso Furthermore, the binding site was identified by zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso expression in the pig kidney cell line zzso Data from zzso showed that zzso expression was induced during zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is an essential regulatory factor for zzso zzso and suggest that zzso stimulates zzso zzso through influencing zzso zzso
