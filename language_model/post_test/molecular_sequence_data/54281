zzso are zzso antibiotics and a major drug group of choice in the treatment of serious zzso zzso Here we show that zzso resistance in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as by the previously characterized zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso increases zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso and, conversely, expression of a zzso version of zzso in zzso coli zzso resistance to these zzso The zzso protein shows significant sequence similarity to zzso coli zzso zzso called zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The target for zzso is shown by mass zzso to be a neighboring zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso uses the zzso group donor zzso to catalyze formation of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso whereas naked zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are not zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure determination of zzso at zzso zzso resolution reveals an zzso domain connected to a central zzso domain that is linked by a flexible zzso region to two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain established that two zzso at specific zzso locations are required for zzso The zzso structure of zzso is highly similar to that of zzso consistent with zzso formation at adjacent sites on the zzso zzso while distinctive structural features account for the zzso respective zzso for zzso zzso and zzso
