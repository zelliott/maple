An open reading frame from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso previously identified and found to be similar to zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thereafter called zzso was further zzso Analysis of the expression of an zzso zzso fusion revealed that zzso is zzso expressed under oxygen zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso gene product only mediates zzso zzso under zzso indicating that the zzso protein zzso directly or zzso to zzso zzso which expressed zzso under the control of an zzso coli promoter were able to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso with respect to zzso growth on nitrate but not zzso and to promote zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coli genes zzso zzso and zzso coding for nitrate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were not induced by zzso The zzso coli zzso gene zzso for zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso are functionally very similar and share a common mode of zzso zzso zzso From zzso studies, it appeared that zzso genes are present in a number of different zzso zzso zzso
