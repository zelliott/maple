The zzso zzso zzso and accessory protein zzso of human zzso zzso DNA zzso have been cloned and expressed in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The influence of the zzso region zzso on the efficiency of expression from the circular plasmids has been zzso For expression of both zzso and zzso a truncated form of the alfalfa mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso was found to be superior to the full-length zzso zzso or the original zzso zzso of different zzso zzso products with Mr approximately 140 and 55 zzso were detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis in the zzso and zzso in zzso expression zzso zzso The properties of the expressed zzso were compared with those of native zzso DNA zzso zzso from zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso activities of the expressed zzso complex were found to be dependent on salt concentration in the same manner as the activities of the native zzso The in zzso zzso resembles the zzso zzso DNA zzso in its affinity for zzso zzso as well as in its sensitivity to known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This straightforward method for protein expression may also be zzso to other zzso where zzso generation of fully functional products is zzso
