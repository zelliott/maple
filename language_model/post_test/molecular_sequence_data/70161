zzso zzso is an extraordinary zzso reaction that removes an intact central zzso domain zzso from precursor proteins zzso while zzso together the zzso and zzso of the zzso via a zzso bond, to produce a new protein zzso All of the available data on protein zzso fit a model in which these intervening sequences zzso at the protein level via a zzso zzso Several proteins have recently been discovered that undergo protein zzso and in two such cases, the excised zzso protein is an zzso Such zzso are capable of zzso genetic mobility upon the intervening sequences that encodes zzso These intervening sequences define a new family of mobile genetic elements that are translated yet remain zzso silent by zzso at the protein rather than the zzso zzso
