The zzso motif on the duck zzso B virus reverse zzso zzso is proposed to be a binding site essential for viral zzso but its zzso and roles in DNA synthesis are zzso Here, we found that zzso is needed for P to bind the viral zzso the first step in DNA zzso A second zzso zzso was predicted to assist zzso zzso and zzso appear to form a composite zzso binding site because mutating zzso and zzso had similar effects on zzso zzso exposure of zzso zzso on zzso and DNA zzso The zzso and zzso motifs bound zzso zzso yet they were essential for specific interactions between P and the viral zzso This implies that specificity for the viral zzso is provided by a zzso zzso The zzso motifs are zzso with the human zzso B virus and may be an attractive target for novel zzso drug zzso
