zzso kidney disease zzso zzso protein is a member of the transient zzso potential zzso zzso channel zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso and zzso interact through their zzso domain and the resulting zzso zzso owns a unique channel property called zzso to acid zzso although zzso does not own this property by zzso To define the pharmacological properties of the zzso channel, we developed a new method to effectively evaluate channel activity using human embryonic kidney zzso cells in which the channel was zzso zzso This method was applied to screen substances that potentially regulate zzso We found that zzso and its zzso which are zzso zzso inhibited the response to acid stimuli and that the zzso zzso was zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are thus useful tools for zzso analysis of zzso zzso
