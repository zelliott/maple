zzso liver zzso contain a neutral zzso zzso zzso that requires zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso activity in catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that this zzso zzso resembles rat pancreatic zzso zzso because it zzso with a specific pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and the eight zzso zzso acids of the zzso protein are identical to those of the pancreatic zzso Nonetheless, the exact molecular relationship between the zzso and pancreatic zzso is zzso In the present study, a rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that this zzso zzso to the full-length mature pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso In individual animals the zzso and pancreatic zzso sequences were zzso However, among rats there were sequence variations, suggesting a zzso nature for this rat zzso
