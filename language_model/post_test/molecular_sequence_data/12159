Chemical and zzso probing zzso of the zzso of the promoter DNA backbone is applied to characterize two zzso open complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso detects major differences in backbone zzso between zzso and zzso in the open region from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso strand react with zzso in zzso but are relatively protected in zzso zzso of zzso to convert zzso to zzso therefore increases the zzso of two zzso charged zzso agents zzso zzso zzso Ross, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso and zzso at the start site and is required for binding of the zzso initiating zzso to the zzso and the zzso strand at the start zzso We propose that these effects result from binding of two zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso Except for the key region on the zzso strand at the start site, the promoter DNA of both zzso and zzso is continuously protected from zzso I and zzso radical zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso promoter zzso Protection in the upstream region, extending from zzso to about zzso is zzso with an 11 base pair zzso indicative of binding of zzso to a single face of the DNA zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
