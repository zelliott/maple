The rapid zzso zzso of cellular genes by either type 1 zzso zzso or type 2 zzso zzso is responsible for many of the zzso effects of these zzso including their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression is zzso by zzso factors termed Stats, which upon being zzso zzso to the nucleus and bind enhancers of zzso zzso We have recently characterized a new zzso cell zzso named zzso where zzso stimulates programmed cell zzso zzso clones that are resistant to the zzso actions of zzso have been zzso One of these clones zzso 8) is defective in its responses to zzso with regard to zzso of genes that require zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso 8 cells with zzso zzso normal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveals a substitution of zzso 630 located within the zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and its adjacent zzso acids are zzso in all zzso family members but are absent in other proteins that contain zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cells zzso zzso gene zzso These results not only define a critical motif in zzso required for its zzso activity, but they also provide evidence that resistance to type one zzso can be zzso by zzso in zzso as well as those previously described for zzso
