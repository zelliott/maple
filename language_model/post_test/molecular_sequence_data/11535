zzso Alzheimer's disease has been previously linked to three genetic zzso on zzso 21, 19 and zzso The zzso locus on zzso 14 has not been cloned and the molecular zzso in zzso zzso zzso families has yet to be zzso zzso linkage analysis has placed the zzso locus in band zzso between the zzso markers zzso and zzso a genetic distance of approximately zzso zzso We have constructed a zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso that covers the entire minimal region, encompassing all genetic markers that are zzso for the disease in zzso zzso This zzso constructed by using a combination of zzso end sequence walking and zzso site zzso zzso consists of 63 zzso from three different zzso The zzso zzso contains 12 zzso zzso repeat markers from zzso to zzso as well as an additional 43 zzso zzso This zzso physical map of the region will allow the physical distances between the markers to be determined, as well as providing a framework for the identification of candidate zzso
