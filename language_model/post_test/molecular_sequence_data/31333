An unidentified zzso zzso strain zzso zzso produced three zzso zzso in media containing zzso zzso One zzso zzso was zzso to zzso It is a zzso zzso that can be inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso A high concentration of zzso was required for its zzso in the presence of zzso zzso only zzso of the activity was lost by zzso at 60 degrees C for 30 zzso while complete zzso occurred in the presence of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso High activity was obtained at zzso degrees C when zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The optimal concentration of zzso required was zzso when zzso at 70 degrees C with zzso as zzso though a zzso characteristic was not distinct at lower zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso or zzso at 26 degrees C were zzso at 25 and zzso zzso zzso zzso was most stable at pH 6-7, and its optimal pH was zzso Its molecular weight was estimated as zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and by gel zzso liquid zzso The sequence of the 35 zzso zzso acid zzso was determined and compared with that of other zzso zzso
