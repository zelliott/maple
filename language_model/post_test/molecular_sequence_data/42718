zzso chain B, containing each one zzso and zzso zzso in its zzso chain, inhibited zzso by zzso zzso To determine the further zzso profile, chain B was zzso into 4 fragments by zzso which was contained in the preparation of zzso from zzso zzso Identification of each zzso by the zzso acid analysis revealed that the chain was zzso at the zzso site of zzso and/or zzso zzso but one zzso contained zzso instead of zzso at its zzso zzso This zzso might have originated from zzso by an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Only one zzso that contained the zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity on zzso but it was considerably weakened compared with that of the intact chain zzso The difference in the zzso activity seemed to depend on the position of an zzso zzso in the zzso this was also confirmed using several derivatives of zzso The present result suggests that the internal zzso zzso in a zzso chain may be critical for the zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso
