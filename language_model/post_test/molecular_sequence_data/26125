We report on the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso multiple steps of zzso metabolism are zzso The zzso zzso strain showed zzso in zzso zzso levels, defective zzso zzso and changes in zzso initiation or termination when shifted from the zzso to the zzso zzso In addition, a change in the structure of the nucleus in these cells became zzso zzso zzso revealed an altered structure of the zzso of zzso zzso cells when grown at the zzso temperature that was not observed in cells grown at the zzso temperature or in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was isolated and zzso The putative zzso protein has a molecular weight of 52 zzso We found that the zzso gene is identical to the zzso zzso gene zzso and Sprague zzso In addition, the zzso protein sequence shows significant sequence similarity to the human zzso protein zzso et zzso zzso This protein has been implicated in the control of zzso zzso Based on the zzso of the zzso zzso and the observed sequence similarity to the human zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso zzso protein is involved in the control of nuclear zzso
