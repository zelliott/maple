zzso zzso proteins have been identified in all zzso In zzso structural and zzso studies of zzso have been restricted to the zzso zzso zzso In this article, four zzso proteins were zzso from a membrane preparation of the human zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso Using new methodology applied to western zzso protein bands, the zzso structures were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso membrane anchors was shown to be an zzso containing mainly zzso and zzso zzso fatty zzso In zzso to zzso only zzso was found in the zzso anchor structures of zzso zzso even for zzso a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso that contains zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly a linear zzso structure linked to a zzso zzso zzso
