zzso zzso is the light chain of major zzso class I zzso I) that binds zzso with the zzso heavy zzso Both proteins attach to the zzso zzso presenting a complex to the T cell to be destroyed via the immune zzso 

In this study, a zzso sequence zzso zzso in the Asian zzso zzso zzso was identified and analyzed using in zzso approaches to predict and characterize its functional zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso bases with a coding capacity of 116 zzso zzso A large portion of the protein consists of the zzso constant domain zzso similar to zzso sequences from other species studied thus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and other species shows a high degree of overall zzso Seven zzso acids were found to be zzso across zzso whereas conservation between zzso zzso and other fish species was restricted to 14 zzso acids at identical zzso zzso 

As the zzso zzso zzso protein analyzed in this study contains a functional domain similar to that of zzso proteins in other species, it can be zzso that the zzso proteins from zzso zzso and other organisms are derived from a common zzso and thus have a similar immune zzso Interestingly, fish zzso genes could also be classified according to the ecological habitat of the species, zzso whether it is from a zzso marine or zzso zzso
