Little is known regarding the molecular pathways that zzso the retinal maturation zzso We are studying the regulation of the retinal zzso protein zzso zzso highly expressed in retinal precursor cells, to identify DNA regulatory elements and zzso factors involved in retinal zzso Although the upstream sequence of the zzso gene is extremely zzso rich, zzso zzso in this region is not implicated in the regulation of this gene because the zzso zzso DNA remains zzso with tissue differentiation when there is a dramatic decrease in zzso transcript zzso Using a combination of zzso I hypersensitivity experiments, gel shift zzso and zzso I zzso we have found three sites of zzso interaction within 205 zzso of zzso zzso DNA in the zzso zzso and four sites in the differentiated zzso DNA zzso analysis indicates that the first two zzso located within 150 zzso of zzso zzso DNA are required for high levels of zzso in primary zzso retinal zzso The first footprint includes a putative zzso box and zzso binding sites while the second footprint contains a consensus zzso DNA binding zzso zzso experiments using zzso to zzso and zzso interference experiments indicate that an zzso zzso factor present in both zzso zzso and differentiated zzso binds to the upstream region of the zzso zzso A combination of data including the expression profile of zzso during retinal development and DNA zzso analysis using zzso zzso at critical zzso within the zzso binding site suggests that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso
