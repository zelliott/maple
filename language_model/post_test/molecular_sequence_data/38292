African zzso are zzso from their zzso defenses by a coat of zzso surface zzso zzso each of which is attached to the plasma membrane by a zzso zzso During the later stages of zzso zzso zzso acid is incorporated into the anchor from the donor zzso by a series of unique fatty acid zzso and exchange zzso We have cloned and expressed a zzso zzso zzso protein that has a preference for binding relatively short chain zzso and that has a high affinity for binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein enhances fatty acid zzso of zzso precursors in the zzso zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso protein plays an active role in zzso zzso to the fatty acid zzso machinery in the zzso
