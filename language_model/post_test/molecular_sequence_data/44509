The mechanism of action of zzso a potent and specific inhibitor of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso 54, zzso was zzso This zzso zzso neither interferes with zzso binding to the zzso zzso nor has any effect on zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso was carried out using a synthetic zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the sequence around zzso zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso It revealed purely competitive zzso zzso zzso mixed competitive zzso zzso the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and mixed competitive zzso zzso both zzso for the activated zzso Thus, the type of zzso apparently changes upon zzso zzso indicating zzso changes at the zzso zzso The high degree of selectivity for the zzso zzso might result from the complex type of interaction with the active center of the zzso as revealed by the kinetic zzso zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso of individual zzso sites of the zzso zzso by zzso were different, zzso of zzso zzso being the most susceptible to zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain seems zzso for partial zzso zzso The findings are discussed in relation to current models of zzso zzso zzso zzso
