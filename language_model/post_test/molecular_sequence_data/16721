zzso assists the mismatch recognition protein zzso to initiate and coordinate mismatch repair in species ranging from bacteria to zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain is highly zzso but the zzso region shares little sequence similarity among zzso zzso We report here the crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso domain and the likelihood of its conservation among zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso which generates a large central cavity in zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and deletions of one-third of its length with no functional consequences in zzso or in zzso Along the surface of the central zzso zzso essential for DNA binding are located in both the zzso and zzso zzso Each domain of zzso interacts with zzso zzso and is required for zzso the zzso zzso The zzso capacity of zzso is correlated with the level of zzso zzso A model of how zzso zzso its zzso and zzso activities to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso
