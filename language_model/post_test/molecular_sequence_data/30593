The H and L chain V region sequences of nine zzso zzso that are representative of a zzso population of zzso produced by the zzso prone zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, were zzso These nine zzso zzso were zzso connected members of a zzso Id family called the zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso were all zzso in charge, zzso in zzso and their H chain C regions had the normal zzso parent's zzso Although derived from two different zzso animals, these zzso zzso possessed highly zzso zzso sequences that could account for their zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso region sequences of these zzso zzso contained numerous basic zzso that could impart their zzso zzso The zzso sequences of these zzso were also highly zzso to that of an zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso mice, called zzso Among these nine zzso zzso three sets of zzso related zzso zzso could be zzso Thus the zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice are zzso by highly related zzso zzso and this zzso connected population of zzso zzso are selected to undergo an zzso expansion in the zzso zzso zzso
