An ultraviolet zzso difference spectrum characteristic of the zzso change of a zzso zzso was observed on the binding of zzso zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso at alkaline zzso This difference spectrum was considered to be induced by a zzso shift (from zzso to zzso or zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the interaction with zzso of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso In the present paper, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso were identified by analyzing the difference spectrum using zzso of zzso zzso and zzso naturally occurring zzso and those prepared by zzso and cassette zzso The difference spectrum disappeared on the binding of a zzso zzso zzso of which zzso was replaced by zzso zzso and zzso at pH zzso The magnitude of the zzso difference was much smaller when zzso zzso was bound with a zzso zzso of which both zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso than with the zzso zzso These lines of evidence indicated that the difference spectrum was caused by zzso of zzso zzso interacting with zzso and zzso of zzso The binding of zzso zzso and zzso is accompanied by an increase of zzso fluorescence, which is zzso in the range of pH zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso In the present study, this zzso of the zzso diminished when zzso bound with zzso This suggested that the zzso increase was due to zzso of zzso zzso and was influenced by the zzso of zzso
