zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from a zzso zzso extract of young rat zzso The zzso was separated by affinity zzso on zzso column and resolved by linear zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso Final zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso on a zzso zzso column and specific zzso with zzso The zzso activity was highest at pH zzso and required the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso for its full zzso The product of the reaction zzso by the zzso was identified as zzso based on its mobility on thin layer zzso plates using two different zzso zzso zzso with several zzso zzso showed high specificity of zzso for zzso The apparent zzso value for zzso and zzso acid were 80 and 210 zzso zzso The apparent molecular mass of the zzso determined on zzso gel zzso was 76 zzso
