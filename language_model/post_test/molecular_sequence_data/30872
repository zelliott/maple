A series of synthetic peptides representing authentic zzso zzso sites of human zzso type 14 were zzso as zzso for zzso zzso zzso Competition zzso zzso were employed to determine the relative specificity zzso zzso for zzso with sequences related to the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso length peptides representing the zzso zzso site were zzso with comparable zzso These studies defined a minimum zzso of 6 zzso acids zzso although retention of the zzso at position zzso zzso resulted in a better zzso by an order of zzso zzso acid zzso at position zzso zzso zzso or zzso indicated that the identity of the zzso at position zzso was not critical, whereas zzso at position zzso zzso or zzso resulted in zzso with zzso values varying over 2 orders of zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso site, small zzso derivatives representative of the zzso zzso site were relatively poor zzso which suggested that zzso zzso the minimum core sequence may influence zzso to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso type 14 was also capable of zzso peptides representing comparable zzso sites predicted for zzso B virus and zzso
