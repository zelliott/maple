To zzso clinical and molecular characteristics of zzso fever zzso zzso from the zzso outbreak caused by zzso virus zzso in southern zzso 

Three hundred and zzso zzso from 332 patients with acute zzso illness were tested for zzso zzso zzso by zzso A molecular analysis of these zzso was performed using a zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso followed by direct sequencing and zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients were diagnosed with zzso fever by molecular analysis and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients diagnosed with zzso fever were significantly older than controls zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, zzso and presented with zzso more often than zzso One hundred percent of the zzso were positive by zzso whereas only zzso were positive in zzso tests for zzso zzso zzso by zzso if the serum was obtained during the first 4 days of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso by zzso was found in zzso of patients, whereas zzso of patients were positive by zzso if the serum was obtained more than 9 days after the onset of zzso zzso for zzso should be performed if the patients present within the first 4 days of zzso Patients presenting after at least 9 days of fever should be tested for zzso zzso Based on zzso analysis, the zzso strains isolated belong to African zzso harboring the E1 zzso zzso indicating a single origin of the zzso zzso zzso 

The novel zzso zzso could potentially modify the zzso presentation of zzso zzso Early diagnosis of zzso fever is essential for preventing further massive zzso
