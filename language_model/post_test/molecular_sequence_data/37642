zzso is an zzso zzso binding protein that, depending on the conditions, causes either zzso or zzso of zzso zzso In plants, zzso are zzso by zzso zzso In this study, an analysis of native and zzso proteins from zzso demonstrates the existence of two classes of functionally distinct zzso zzso Class II zzso including native zzso zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso have zzso properties that differ from those of class I zzso Class II zzso had higher affinity for zzso and zzso more zzso zzso than did class I zzso zzso a class I zzso inhibited zzso of membrane zzso by zzso C more strongly than did a class II zzso These zzso properties correlated with the ability of class II zzso to disrupt zzso zzso architecture in live cells more rapidly than did class I zzso The zzso activity of both zzso zzso classes was found to be dependent on the concentration of free zzso We propose a model in which zzso alters cellular zzso of zzso zzso in response to fluctuations in zzso calcium zzso These results provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso gene family consists of at least two classes, with distinct zzso and zzso properties, zzso that the zzso zzso zzso perform distinct functions in the zzso
