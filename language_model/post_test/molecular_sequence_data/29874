In addition to zzso zzso an unusual and extremely minor zzso zzso zzso was efficiently isolated from bovine brain by combination of zzso and zzso column zzso In the course of zzso steps, the presence of the zzso zzso was proved by a highly sensitive zzso zzso The structure was characterized by zzso zzso zzso study, zzso degradation, zzso with specific zzso fast atom zzso zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso The content of the zzso was very small zzso in the total zzso This finding suggests that a synthetic zzso of zzso zzso alpha may exist in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso that was obtained by zzso mice with zzso zzso reacted specifically with zzso but showed no zzso with other structurally related zzso such as zzso zzso and so zzso Using the method of zzso with zzso zzso was found to be strongly expressed during embryonic days zzso in chick zzso Thus, it is assumed that extremely minor zzso like zzso and zzso alpha found in adult brains are characterized as embryonic zzso
