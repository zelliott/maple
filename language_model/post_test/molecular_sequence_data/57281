zzso zzso protein zzso and cellular zzso binding protein zzso are members of a family of cellular zzso transport zzso zzso has been refined at a resolution of zzso A, and zzso has been solved by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of zzso zzso The members of this family form a compact three-dimensional structure built up from ten zzso strands that fold to form an zzso barrel containing the zzso In zzso the zzso group of an zzso acid zzso interacts with the zzso of two zzso (106 and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso The zzso adopts a zzso zzso In zzso the zzso has a zzso zzso with its alcohol group hydrogen bonding to the zzso of zzso 108 zzso to zzso 106 in zzso The local interactions of zzso 108 explain zzso preference for binding zzso rather than zzso The zzso of zzso 40 makes a close contact with the zzso tail of the zzso
