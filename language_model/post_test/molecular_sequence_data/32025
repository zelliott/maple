zzso feeding on plant zzso blood, and other nutritionally incomplete diets are typically associated with zzso bacteria that supplement missing zzso zzso zzso zzso contains more than zzso cellulose and lacks zzso acids essential for insect development and zzso Yet one of the most ecologically necessary and zzso successful groups of zzso the zzso zzso zzso feeds primarily, or exclusively, on zzso These associations suggest that zzso zzso may benefit from zzso bacteria that provide nutrients missing from zzso The zzso behaviors of the female parent and the feeding behaviors of the larvae suggest that a zzso could be vertically transmitted from the parental female to her offspring through the zzso zzso Using sterile rearing and a combination of molecular and zzso techniques, we examine transmission of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were reared on zzso zzso and the zzso was characterized across zzso A zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso as the most common bacterial families across all life stages and zzso including cultured zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso analyses based on zzso and zzso zzso of cultured zzso placed the zzso closest to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of zzso balls constructed from sterile zzso reveals zzso and microbes only in the chamber the female prepares for the zzso The use of zzso zzso for zzso the presence of microbes in the zzso ball and zzso and identical zzso zzso sequences in both parent and offspring suggests that the zzso zzso female parent zzso specific zzso members to her offspring through the zzso zzso The transmission of the zzso zzso zzso highlights the maintenance and likely importance of this zzso bacterial zzso
