zzso zzso is a major mechanism in cellular zzso A large number of zzso zzso is known from zzso and more recently bacterial zzso have also been zzso By employing zzso sequence patterns from both zzso and bacterial zzso zzso we have identified three zzso sequences in two of the four complete zzso zzso Two hypothetical open reading frames in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso clearly bear all the zzso zzso of this zzso No zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso sequences in zzso
