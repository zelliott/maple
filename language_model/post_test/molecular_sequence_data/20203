zzso are plant secondary zzso that comprise two main groups: zzso and zzso The latter group includes zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso To develop tools to alter zzso zzso in plants, we isolated a zzso clone zzso a candidate zzso zzso zzso from the flower petals of zzso zzso zzso protein has zzso to zzso zzso from other organisms, and possesses the four zzso motifs zzso in this family of zzso zzso analysis predicted the presence of a putative zzso transit zzso at the zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso to be zzso by a zzso gene family with at least three members in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso transcript abundance by Northern zzso indicates it is highly expressed in flower zzso roots and zzso with relatively low expression in leaves and developing zzso zzso was able to catalyze the formation of zzso and its intermediate precursor zzso from zzso in functional zzso conducted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso wild type and a zzso deficient for zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso in the zzso
