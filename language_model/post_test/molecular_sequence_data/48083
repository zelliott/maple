zzso dynamics zzso simulations on a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution were carried out to study its interactions with zzso Pair distribution functions and diffusion zzso were calculated from a 4 zzso trajectory and the zzso of different molecular groups was zzso The average values of the zzso zzso angles found in the simulations are zzso 13 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 13 zzso zzso degrees and zzso 13 zzso 80 degrees, zzso 13 zzso 90 degrees for the zzso linkage, and zzso 14 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 14 zzso zzso degrees for the zzso zzso zzso patches formed by sugar ring zzso groups were zzso The diffusion zzso of the water molecules vary from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depending on the distances between the water molecules and the atoms of the zzso zzso and the type of zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation times of the water molecules in the vicinity of different zzso atoms were estimated to be about 1 zzso at a zzso concentration of 4 zzso zzso The number of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the zzso atoms of zzso was determined to be about 20 per zzso unit, indicating a higher zzso ability of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso where water molecules are involved in hydrogen bonds to different sugar rings, were found, which may be important for the zzso of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso
