In zzso zzso illuminated zzso activates multiple G zzso which are assumed to initiate multiple zzso zzso In this paper, we focused on one of the zzso zzso which zzso zzso a zzso G zzso and zzso C zzso A zzso G protein from octopus zzso was successfully zzso to apparent zzso as an active form by simple zzso zzso The zzso G protein had an alpha beta zzso structure consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso The zzso alpha zzso was assigned to the zzso class by western zzso with zzso against zzso zzso alpha and by partial zzso acid sequencing of its zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso gamma S was observed when the zzso octopus zzso was zzso with octopus zzso that had been integrated into zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso beta 1 zzso from bovine brain zzso in the presence of zzso Finally, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso beta 1 was observed in a zzso system consisting of octopus zzso zzso and bovine zzso beta zzso
