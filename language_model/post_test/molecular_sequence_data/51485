zzso genes zzso zzso factors that are thought to specify zzso identity by regulating expression of subordinate zzso zzso development is zzso in the abdominal segments of the zzso zzso by the zzso genes of the zzso complex zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso is required for leg development in zzso zzso We have identified a minimal zzso zzso element that directs zzso expression in the zzso leg zzso We present evidence that the zzso proteins repress zzso expression in abdominal segments by binding to a small number of specific sites in this zzso zzso these sites eliminates zzso protein binding and renders the element insensitive to zzso repression in zzso zzso of limb development in the abdomen appears to be controlled at the zzso zzso Thus zzso may serve as a downstream target gene through which the zzso genes control abdominal segment identity in the zzso zzso
