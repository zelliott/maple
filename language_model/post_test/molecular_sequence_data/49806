The zzso zzso promoter presents two evolutionary zzso overlapping zzso and zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso binding sites zzso putative zzso sites, zzso and zzso zzso the promoter domain containing zzso and zzso is recognized by zzso nuclear extracts containing zzso and zzso and has regulatory functions in primary cultures of embryonic zzso nerve zzso zzso experiments further demonstrate that zzso and zzso interact zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso regulation of the zzso promoter, and vice zzso This led us to investigate if zzso and zzso interact zzso zzso interaction was confirmed by pull-down experiments, and the regions participating in this interaction were zzso In zzso the interacting domain is the zzso box zzso zzso In zzso two independent interacting zzso zzso the zzso and a region that includes the zzso zzso Finally, zzso not only binds zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the four cases zzso binds at least the zzso Based on the involvement of zzso zzso in both classes of zzso it is proposed that the interaction between zzso box zzso factors and zzso is a general zzso
