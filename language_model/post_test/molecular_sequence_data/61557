zzso is an zzso protein that functions in zzso cells in zzso repression and zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso gene symbol zzso is zzso in human, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison of the coding regions of the zzso genes among the four zzso reveals an extraordinarily low rate of sequence zzso suggesting that the zzso genes carry out essential functions in these zzso With DNA zzso zzso we have established the importance of the zzso domain for the zzso activity of zzso Both human and mouse zzso genes belong to a gene family that also consists of a number of processed zzso Interestingly, combined database analysis and zzso cloning have demonstrated that the primary transcript of the zzso zzso genes zzso alternative zzso to generate 11 zzso including the one zzso zzso Eight of the 11 zzso events involved the use of four each of the zzso and zzso sites, all of which reside within the last zzso of the zzso zzso The existence of zzso zzso of zzso proteins provides further support for the functional complexity of the zzso zzso zzso
