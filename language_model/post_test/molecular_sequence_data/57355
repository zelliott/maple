In the zzso zzso zzso the nucleus zzso dramatic shape changes during zzso and zzso We have studied nuclear envelope dynamics during the processes of zzso and zzso using nuclear pore complexes as a marker for the nuclear envelope in zzso cells and several zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso are described that recognize nuclear pore zzso zzso in zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso has been extensively characterized by zzso and colleagues and recognizes nuclear pore complexes in zzso and zzso zzso By indirect zzso of zzso cells, all three zzso yield a zzso nuclear rim zzso All three react with multiple zzso proteins in zzso including the zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso When the zzso were used in zzso experiments on mating cells, the nuclear pore complex zzso pattern proved to be a sensitive indicator of nuclear zzso zzso with closely zzso zzso pole bodies and zzso nuclear envelopes could be readily zzso zzso shape changes were observed in zzso during fusion and segregation of the zzso nucleus into the zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso that arrest late in zzso the zzso nuclear envelope extension that stretches between daughter zzso during zzso was zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso nuclear envelope was usually resolved into two daughter zzso in the absence of zzso These results indicate that nuclear envelope division is mechanically distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso segregation and zzso
