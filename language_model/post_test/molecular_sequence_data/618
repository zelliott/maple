zzso zzso cell zzso expression of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso 2 is induced in zzso by zzso zzso To assess effects of molecular oxygen on zzso zzso we subjected cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso to hypoxic conditions zzso zzso or to hypoxic conditions followed by return to zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are expressed under zzso conditions but are rapidly reduced by zzso they fall even further upon zzso but rebound by zzso zzso zzso expression is unaffected by zzso or zzso in these same zzso We identified a potential zzso binding site in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso but not hypoxic zzso binds an zzso sequence matching this site, and the zzso zzso binds zzso at this site in zzso under zzso but not hypoxic zzso zzso zzso is present in the nucleus of zzso under zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso at an zzso zzso B target site and subsequent nuclear zzso these processes are reversed by zzso and blocked by zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor that blocks zzso zzso zzso also prevents the zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso construct in zzso whereas small interference zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso but not zzso expression under zzso zzso Reduction in zzso by small interference zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso regulates zzso changes in expression of zzso in zzso controlling sensitivity to zzso zzso
