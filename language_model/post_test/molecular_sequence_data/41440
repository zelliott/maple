Usher syndrome is the leading cause of genetic zzso zzso zzso in zzso increase the severity of Usher type II syndrome caused by zzso in zzso and zzso which respectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7 protein zzso is a zzso of the scaffolding proteins zzso and zzso which are implicated in Usher type 1 and type 2 zzso While zzso and zzso have been reported to form hair cell zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso upper zzso density and zzso zzso to both tip and zzso zzso Here, we used mass zzso to show that zzso is expressed in chick zzso at a comparable molecular abundance to zzso We also show by zzso and by zzso of zzso proteins in rat and mouse hair cells that zzso zzso to the zzso region, overlapping with zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we show in zzso cells that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso can bind to both zzso and zzso These observations are consistent with zzso being a modifier and candidate gene for zzso and suggest that zzso is a second scaffolding component of the zzso zzso
