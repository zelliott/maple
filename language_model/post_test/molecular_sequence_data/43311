zzso is one of the two zzso zzso of zzso the first component of complement, in which it is associated in a zzso manner to the zzso zzso zzso zzso This interaction is zzso by the zzso region of zzso which comprises a single zzso growth factor zzso module containing the consensus sequence required for calcium zzso surrounded by two zzso zzso With a view to determine the structure of the zzso module of zzso and evaluate its contribution to calcium zzso this module zzso was zzso by automated zzso methodology using the zzso zzso A first synthesis using the zzso zzso gave very low yield, due to partial zzso of His zzso leading to chain termination by zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso This could be zzso by using the zzso zzso and by zzso of appropriate zzso zzso The synthetic zzso was efficiently folded under zzso conditions to the species with three correct zzso bridges, as determined by mass zzso and zzso sequence analyses of zzso zzso The zzso of the synthetic zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis provided evidence that the zzso module had a well defined structure, and was able to bind calcium with an apparent zzso of 10 zzso This value, comparable to that found for the isolated zzso zzso of zzso factors IX and X, is much higher than that measured for native zzso As already proposed for factors IX and X, it is suggested that zzso zzso most probably the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the calcium binding zzso
