Although knowledge of the zzso zzso between zzso is important for understanding the mechanisms of allergy, the regulation of the allergic immune response and the development of efficient modes of zzso zzso the zzso of animal zzso is poorly zzso 

The aim of this study was to characterize zzso zzso between zzso zzso including five zzso zzso zzso and one human zzso zzso tear zzso zzso 

The zzso proteins were validated by zzso and mass zzso The zzso capacity of the zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with zzso from 42 zzso patients and 21 control zzso The zzso zzso between the zzso proteins were determined by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso between Can f 1 and human zzso between Can f 1 and Can f 2, and between zzso c 1 and zzso m zzso Low levels of zzso to human zzso were found in the zzso of seven zzso patients of whom six were zzso for Can f zzso 

Several zzso exhibited zzso zzso probably due to the sequential identity of the proteins and also due to similarities in their three-dimensional zzso The clinical significance of the findings needs to be zzso zzso zzso zzso can play a role in regulating immune response to zzso zzso
