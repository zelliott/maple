We compared the tissue zzso prevalence and protein maturation of two zzso zzso of mouse zzso a zzso implicated in airway zzso These zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso forms that differ primarily in 26 zzso zzso 17) between the zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso of approximately 120 and 103 zzso zzso by zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso appearance of the approximately zzso form and its zzso by a zzso zzso or the calcium zzso zzso indicated that this was mature zzso which was processed by a zzso zzso One form, approximately 110 zzso was detected in zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso treatment of zzso cells demonstrated that all of the mature approximately zzso a minority of the approximately zzso zzso and none of the zzso zzso form localized to the cell zzso The mature form was resistant to zzso zzso The approximately zzso form was zzso zzso indicating retention zzso to the zzso consistent with a lack of zzso zzso of transcripts demonstrated that those containing zzso 17 zzso whereas those lacking zzso 17 are negligible in the mouse zzso although zzso at low levels in mouse zzso heart, and zzso Thus, potential zzso effects exerted by the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso are unlikely to occur in mouse zzso
