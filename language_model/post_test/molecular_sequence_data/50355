zzso graphics and molecular mechanics techniques have been used to study the mode of zzso binding and mechanism of action of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso complex was constructed based on the crystal structure of the zzso The complex was minimized to relieve initial strain, and the structural and energetic features of the zzso complex analyzed in detail, at the molecular and zzso zzso The minimized complex was then used as a basis for examining the action of the zzso on modified zzso binding of zzso to the zzso and possible reaction intermediate zzso The model is compatible with the suggested mechanism of zzso and with experimental data about zzso efficiency of zzso of modified zzso and inhibitor zzso In conclusion, the model can be used as a tool in evaluating new zzso as possible zzso and in the rational design of zzso for the therapeutic treatment of diseases such as zzso arthritis, zzso and zzso
