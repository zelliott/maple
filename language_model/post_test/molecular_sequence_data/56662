zzso are described to determine in 10 zzso the activity of the five most common pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Progress of the reactions is monitored at 405 zzso allowing the kinetic determination of the five zzso on a single zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is measured by the release of zzso from a chemically defined zzso zzso of the zzso is from 10 to 360 zzso of zzso and activities as low as zzso zzso can be easily measured by extending the period of incubation up to 24 zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities are monitored by the release of zzso from specific zzso and activities are from 25 to zzso 15 to zzso and 20 to 600 zzso zzso Finally, zzso is determined by the clearing of a commercially available stabilized emulsion of zzso The zzso determination can be performed from 90 to 3,600 zzso When zzso methods were compared with conventional procedures, a perfect correspondence was found between the two types of zzso zzso necessary to convert zzso results to those of conventional zzso are zzso These zzso make possible the rapid and simultaneous determination of the three main types of pancreatic zzso (a zzso three zzso and a zzso with zzso 5 zzso of pancreatic juice by kinetic zzso They could be easily adopted as routine zzso in most research zzso
