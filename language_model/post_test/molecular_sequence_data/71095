zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso systems in zzso coli, and the proteins exhibit strong similarity at the level of both primary sequence and domain zzso The proteins are maintained closed by zzso and are activated by binding of zzso formed between zzso and zzso By construction of equivalent zzso in each zzso this study has analyzed the control over inactive state of the zzso A zzso zzso in zzso zzso causes rapid spontaneous zzso zzso but has only a minor effect on zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that cause increased spontaneous activity in zzso have only small effects in zzso Exchange of an eight zzso acid region from zzso zzso with the equivalent sequence from zzso zzso has identified a role for a group of zzso zzso in controlling zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso in zzso act zzso and the activity of the zzso protein resembles that of zzso We conclude that, despite the high degree of sequence zzso zzso and zzso exhibit different sensitivities to the same zzso zzso
