A zzso zzso zzso obtained from a zzso zzso of zzso showed a zzso effect on primed zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells of zzso A biologically active zzso sequence of bovine zzso zzso zzso was zzso The corresponding synthetic zzso had a zzso effect on primed zzso cells but failed to enhance proliferation of zzso zzso We prepared two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of bovine zzso which zzso respectively, zzso and zzso of the sequence including zzso zzso They induced a significant zzso response in both zzso and zzso zzso It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in zzso zzso
