A zzso zzso that causes a silent zzso for human serum zzso was identified in the DNA of seven individuals of two unrelated zzso The zzso identified using the zzso chain reaction, causes a shift in the reading frame from zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso to a new stop zzso created at position zzso This zzso is upstream of the active site zzso zzso and, if any protein were made, it would represent only zzso of the mature zzso found in normal zzso zzso of analysis of the zzso activities in serum agreed with the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Rocket zzso using zzso zzso to detect zzso activity showed an absence of zzso material, as zzso One additional individual with a silent zzso did not show the same zzso zzso This was not unexpected, since there must be considerable molecular zzso involved in causes for the silent zzso zzso This is the first report of a molecular mechanism underlying the silent zzso for serum zzso The zzso approach used was similar to the one we recently employed to identify the zzso that causes the zzso zzso zzso
