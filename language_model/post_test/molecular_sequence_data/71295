zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which has been involved in the regulation of cell growth, zzso and zzso Recently, nuclear zzso of zzso has been reported indicating the potential of active nuclear zzso In this study we use the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to show that zzso interacts with the nuclear transport protein zzso Using electron zzso we demonstrate that nuclear expression of zzso in a zzso cell lung cancer cell line is induced by zzso acid zzso These data suggest that zzso could mediate active nuclear transport of zzso which may be important for the regulation of critical cellular zzso
