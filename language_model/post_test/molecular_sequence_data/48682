One of the key limiting factors for using zzso interference technology to develop new zzso control practices is the zzso zzso In order to explore potential methods to improve the efficiency of zzso in insects, we cloned two zzso binding proteins from zzso zzso and investigated their zzso 

In this study, the genes zzso to the zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were first cloned and designated as zzso and zzso Using the zzso gene zzso which has been confirmed to have lethal effects when knocked down by zzso as a reporter, the functions of these two zzso binding proteins were then investigated by using zzso zzso The results showed that feeding with zzso alone caused significant lethal effects, with a mortality zzso higher than that of the control, whereas feeding with zzso or zzso alone did not yield any significant lethal zzso When zzso was fed in the mixture zzso with zzso it also resulted in high zzso which was a little lower than feeding with zzso alone, but not statistically zzso However, when fed in the zzso mixture with zzso the lethal effect of zzso was completely zzso Further analysis of gene expression found that single zzso depressed only its own target zzso When treated in zzso mixture, zzso or zzso did not change significantly the depression of the other zzso but zzso zzso almost all the effect of zzso 

These results indicate that the loss of zzso can significantly inhibit zzso genetic zzso These findings not only suggest that the zzso gene in zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso but also imply that the zzso regulation of zzso with respect to genetic interference in zzso zzso is similar to that in higher animal zzso
