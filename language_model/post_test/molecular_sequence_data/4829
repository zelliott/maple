The first crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso at zzso A resolution, reveals the structural basis for iron zzso and transport required by several important bacterial zzso Paradoxically, although zzso belongs to a protein zzso which includes human zzso iron binding in zzso and zzso appears to have developed independently by zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso with other zzso zzso transport proteins and the zzso zzso suggests that these proteins are related by divergent evolution from an zzso common zzso not from an zzso zzso The iron binding site of zzso incorporates a water and an zzso zzso zzso as iron zzso and exhibits nearly ideal zzso metal zzso zzso is highly zzso required for zzso and is a zzso point for free iron zzso in several zzso zzso bacteria, thus providing a potential target for zzso zzso drug design against human pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
