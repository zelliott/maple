The present studies were designed to further determine whether the zzso marker could distinguish between cells zzso and zzso infected with zzso This was accomplished by combining zzso zzso killing of zzso cells, highly sensitive indirect zzso to detect remaining zzso cells, and zzso amplification of zzso DNA in zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that: 1) By direct zzso 3 to zzso of zzso are zzso whereas by indirect zzso zzso are zzso The increased number of zzso cells is due to their detection by the highly sensitive indirect zzso zzso Up to zzso of the zzso cells are zzso and zzso are zzso 2) Treatment of zzso zzso with an zzso IT for 6 days eliminated both zzso and zzso cells and decreased the production of zzso by zzso 3) zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso vs zzso from which zzso cells had been eliminated by IT zzso zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso cells express all intermediate zzso species and full-length zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells contain predominantly intermediate zzso These results confirm and extend our previous observations that expression of zzso can distinguish zzso infected cells from cells producing zzso
