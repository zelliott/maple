The zzso of peripheral zzso zzso are poorly zzso The most zzso abnormalities are zzso involving zzso occurring in approximately half of zzso large cell zzso zzso To gain insight into the zzso of zzso lacking zzso zzso we combined zzso DNA library construction, zzso parallel zzso zzso sequencing, and a novel zzso zzso We identified a balanced zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene on zzso and adjoining the zzso fragile site on zzso in a systemic zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso was zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso These findings represent the first zzso zzso reported in zzso zzso and highlight the utility of zzso parallel zzso sequencing to discover novel zzso in zzso and other zzso
