The gene coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso under zzso conditions, using two different expression zzso the more efficient proved to be zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in high yield by this expression system, and was zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein with that zzso from zzso zzso showed no differences in structural and functional zzso zzso an internal zzso in zzso zzso is located at zzso distance from zzso zzso together with zzso zzso of zzso was related to the observed zzso of zzso zzso The role of zzso in determining the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso by substitution with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso although similar to the zzso protein in spectral properties and electron donation to zzso is characterized by a weakening of the zzso bond, as shown in the oxidized protein by the loss of the zzso zzso band zzso 2 pH units below the zzso Moreover, in zzso the zzso potential and its zzso are both different from the zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso to zzso zzso is important in zzso of the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso
