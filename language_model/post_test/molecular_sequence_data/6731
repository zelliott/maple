A new IS element zzso was discovered in zzso zzso zzso zzso during the characterization of the linkage relationships between the two genes important for milk zzso zzso zzso and the zzso associated zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso element, flanked by 38 zzso imperfect zzso repeats, and generates an 8 zzso target zzso upon zzso It contains one open reading frame, zzso a potential zzso of 434 zzso zzso which shows significant zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso element zzso zzso analysis of spontaneous zzso zzso revealed some strains that had sustained deletions of 7 to 30 zzso in size, centered on and eliminating the copy of zzso next to zzso Other deletion zzso were identified as located immediately adjacent to zzso Furthermore, genetic zzso that had occurred via zzso of zzso were observed zzso in cultures screened for deletion zzso zzso can be found in one to several copies in various strains of zzso zzso However, it was not present in other dairy zzso acid bacteria zzso
