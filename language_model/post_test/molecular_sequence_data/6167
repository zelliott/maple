The binding properties of zzso toxic zzso zzso with zzso and zzso were investigated by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human alpha zzso zzso reacted strongly with zzso zzso over zzso of the zzso nitrogen tested, while the zzso of its zzso product decreased by zzso Native zzso zzso 50% of the zzso added, and its zzso was reduced by zzso after zzso On the contrary, the poor zzso of rat zzso zzso with zzso increased substantially after removal of zzso acid and completely zzso the zzso zzso The zzso interactions were inhibited by zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso and/or Gal beta zzso zzso zzso From the above results, it is concluded that zzso is specific for zzso zzso However, zzso acid of some zzso also acts as masking zzso as the zzso of rat zzso and bovine zzso zzso with zzso increased after zzso
