The sequence of 9 DNA clones obtained from zzso zzso immune complexes zzso in 11 zzso patients was analyzed and the possible zzso role of the circulating DNA in zzso patients was zzso zzso acid length of 9 cloned zzso ranged from 87 to 312 base zzso with a mean length of 177 zzso zzso which were rich in zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which contain the zzso motif in zzso zzso sequence segments in cloned DNA zzso the expression of zzso on the zzso cells detected by zzso analysis and also zzso the gene expression of several zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso These data suggest that DNA in zzso of zzso patients will augment expression of zzso on zzso cells, resulting in zzso of zzso
