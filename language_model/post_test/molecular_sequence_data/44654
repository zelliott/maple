We have previously isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which encodes a zzso Southern blots of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso with the zzso zzso indicated that this gene exists as a single zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso was screened at high stringency to isolate the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso clone was coined zzso because of its sequence divergence from isolated zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso with zzso derived from the coding region of the zzso clone showed that this gene is expressed at high levels in zzso roots and the enhancement occurred within two days of growth in medium lacking zzso The expression of this gene is zzso by heat shock and zzso conditions, and it is not significantly induced by high zzso or by nitrogen or sulfur zzso zzso analysis of the zzso clone revealed the existence of 13 zzso interrupted by 12 zzso zzso and it possessed a high zzso with the zzso zzso zzso as well as various other zzso genes from other zzso zzso similarity and divergence percentages between the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso clones and other zzso suggests that they should be included along with two other zzso genes in a distinct zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso The presence of an zzso zzso retention signal at the zzso zzso indicates the likely cellular location of zzso The possible zzso and regulatory roles of this zzso during the zzso response are zzso
