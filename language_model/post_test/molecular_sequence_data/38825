Human zzso zzso form and simple zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso are greater than zzso identical in their primary sequences and yet display distinct zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Through the generation and characterization of a series of zzso zzso we have previously demonstrated two highly variable regions within their sequences to be responsible for determining their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By employing the zzso zzso technique, the present study aims to identify and zzso evaluate the specific zzso acid zzso critical to the zzso binding and zzso in these two zzso Twelve zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso were generated, zzso and zzso zzso characterization showed that, of the twelve zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a dramatic decrease in zzso with zzso as zzso being greater than 450 times for the zzso zzso zzso With zzso as zzso the zzso determined for the zzso zzso increased more than 25 times and approached that determined for the zzso zzso These results indicated that the concerted action of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is sufficient for the conversion of the zzso zzso of zzso to that of zzso Among the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso displayed considerable zzso in zzso with zzso or zzso as zzso No corresponding changes, however, were detected with the opposite compound as zzso These results indicated that, in contrast to zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso to the corresponding zzso in zzso are not sufficient for rendering the change of zzso zzso zzso to that of zzso For both zzso and zzso zzso at zzso or zzso led to the loss of zzso activities, indicating their importance in the zzso zzso
