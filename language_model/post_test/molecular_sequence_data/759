zzso zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by excessive zzso cell zzso zzso dependent upon zzso which acts through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways are controlled through regulation of its synthesis by zzso zzso and zzso degradation by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso cells from mice with a targeted zzso in the zzso gene are zzso to the action of zzso in terms of testosterone zzso These observations led us to evaluate the human zzso gene as a zzso candidate zzso and the hypothesis that reduced zzso activity or expression would contribute to excessive zzso zzso zzso We identified a rare zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and studied another known single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso coding sequence causing zzso zzso acid zzso and a new zzso in the promoter region zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso were consistent with reduced activity in zzso cell zzso study of the expressed zzso did not confirm reduced activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was also not different among the coding sequence zzso The zzso promoter zzso and a previously described promoter zzso did not affect promoter activity in in zzso zzso The more common coding sequence zzso zzso and the promoter zzso were not associated with zzso in our zzso zzso analysis, nor where they associated with total testosterone or zzso zzso zzso These findings exclude a significant role for zzso as a zzso candidate zzso and as a Las major zzso of zzso levels in zzso
