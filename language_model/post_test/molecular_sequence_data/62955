zzso throughout B cell maturation and zzso prevents zzso B cells from entering zzso center zzso zzso This study shows that a subset of zzso B cells in zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice escapes these serial checkpoints and proceeds into zzso zzso zzso B cells isolated from these mice all express the transgenic zzso zzso heavy chain, some zzso light chains that yield an zzso specificity and some have zzso zzso consistent with their zzso zzso Nonetheless, B cell tolerance is ultimately preserved as serum zzso of zzso zzso are not zzso These observations suggest that those zzso zzso B cells that escaped earlier checkpoints and possibly also those cells that acquire zzso de zzso by mutating their zzso zzso are arrested within the zzso zzso before zzso further into zzso plasma zzso
