zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduction of a zzso form of zzso carrier protein zzso the first reductive step in de zzso fatty acid zzso and a reaction often performed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and forms part of a zzso type II fatty acid zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity is observed with zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso the other zzso of zzso and the zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso 

The first crystal structure of zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution in a zzso complex with an zzso zzso The structure reveals a zzso in which each zzso has a classical zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is found at the active site, characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a very similar structure to zzso with good zzso of zzso important zzso zzso of the zzso into the active site of zzso indicates the need for zzso changes in the zzso 

A zzso mechanism can be proposed involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso must shift its position to permit zzso binding to zzso and might act as a flexible lid on the active zzso The similarities in fold, mechanism and zzso binding between zzso which zzso a zzso zzso reduction, and zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggest a close evolutionary link during the development of the fatty acid zzso zzso
