zzso zzso zzso proteins control many aspects of growth and patterning in animal zzso The mechanism by which the zzso signal is sent and zzso is still not well zzso We describe a genetic screen aimed at identifying positive regulators in the zzso zzso We recovered multiple new zzso of zzso and dispatched zzso In addition, we identified a novel component in the zzso pathway, which we name central missing zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause similar patterning defects to those caused by zzso or dispatched zzso zzso Moreover, zzso affects the expression of zzso responsive genes but not of zzso zzso Like zzso zzso acts upstream of patched zzso and its activity is required only in the zzso zzso zzso However, unlike zzso which is required for the release of the zzso form of zzso zzso regulates the activity of zzso in a manner that is independent of cholesterol zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso bear molecular zzso in zzso which encodes a putative membrane bound zzso related to zzso a protein implicated in regulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
