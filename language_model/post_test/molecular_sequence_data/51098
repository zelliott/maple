This report describes the determination of the complete primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized as zzso zzso zzso a zzso bacteria implicated in dental plaque zzso The zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso It was shown to consist of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso ratios of zzso zzso and linkage assignments of the zzso zzso were obtained by zzso analysis followed by zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was present in a zzso connecting zzso to one of the zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso of a partial acid hydrolysate of the zzso confirmed this finding by showing zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structural determination was completed by the combination of two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso experiments and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso composed of zzso repeating units that contain zzso linked through a zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso and are joined zzso through zzso zzso zzso see zzso This structure is novel among bacterial cell surface zzso in general and specifically among those implicated in dental plaque zzso
