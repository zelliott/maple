zzso randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso markers were obtained from total zzso DNA of zzso zzso Such zzso zzso bands zzso zzso zzso zzso (through zzso in a cross between a pair of zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that they originated from the zzso zzso Southern analysis mapped the zzso to the zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and was fine mapped to the 3 zzso region encompassing 3' end of zzso full zzso and zzso region between zzso and zzso This region seems divergent enough between the two parents, such that a specific zzso designed for a parental specific zzso sequence within this region, amplified a marker in that parent only and not in the other, indicating the utility of zzso for locating the zzso regions of sequence zzso zzso the zzso zzso seems to have originated from a zzso of a much smaller (about 600 zzso but highly zzso zzso and zzso domain of the 3 zzso region in a manner that yielded no linear sequence alignment with its own template zzso The amplification yielded the same uniquely zzso product, whether the template used for zzso was total cellular DNA, zzso DNA or a zzso clone DNA corresponding to that zzso The zzso product, a zzso new zzso had lost the repetitive organization of the template zzso where it had originated from and perhaps represented a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
