It has been proposed that zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso quality control machinery used to degrade newly zzso zzso that do not correctly fold in the zzso However, a lack of information about the structure of the zzso has limited our ability to obtain insight into its precise biological zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified by screening a collection of zzso strains for the absence of zzso activity in cell zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the left arm of zzso XVI by genetic approaches and its open reading frame was zzso zzso encodes a soluble protein that, when expressed in zzso coli, exhibited zzso zzso zzso may be required for efficient zzso degradation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is present in the nucleus as well as the zzso zzso of expressed sequence tag clones revealed that zzso is highly zzso in a wide variety of zzso including zzso suggesting that the zzso has an important zzso
