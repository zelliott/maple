We have newly isolated one partial zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and two full-length zzso clones from a kiwi fruit zzso zzso The two full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso had an open reading frame of 185 zzso zzso including a predicted signal zzso sequence necessary for zzso in the zzso zzso As the deduced zzso acid sequence of the cloned zzso was almost same as the sequence of the previously zzso zzso protein zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso the clones were considered to be zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated a zzso number of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of asparagus zzso expressing a kiwi fruit zzso gene driven by the zzso zzso promoter demonstrated in zzso zzso effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative expression levels of the zzso genes in kiwi fruit, analyzed by competitive zzso increased with the progression of fruit zzso Given that zzso activity also showed its highest level at the fully zzso stage of zzso the increase in zzso expression may not indicate direct zzso effects on the zzso activity and fruit maturation zzso
