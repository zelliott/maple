Two different zzso zzso were raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to distinct putative zzso receptors of rat and zzso Both zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso as seen with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso organ where label was detected were consistent with those found at zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso only up to about zzso of these zzso cells were zzso Despite chemical, species, and zzso differences both zzso behaved zzso in their zzso zzso zzso For both zzso zzso was very specific for zzso zzso both bound zzso to the thick zzso and the thinner and long zzso parts of the zzso zzso knobs showed little zzso if zzso zzso zzso cell structures below the zzso supporting cell structures, and respiratory zzso did not zzso There were no obvious differences in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso cells and their zzso zzso could be followed up to a distance of about 15 zzso from the knobs along the zzso parts of the zzso When zzso cells were observed, this signal was zzso in two, sometimes three, sections taken through these cells while being consistently absent in zzso zzso This pattern argues strongly for the specificity of the zzso In conclusion, very few zzso cells zzso with the zzso to putative zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the cellular regions that first encounter zzso molecules and that are thought to zzso the zzso zzso displayed the most intense zzso with both zzso zzso the results showed these zzso as having many copies of the putative zzso Finally, similar patterns of zzso zzso were displayed in two different species, despite the use of different zzso Thus, this study provides compelling evidence that the zzso putative zzso receptors zzso in the zzso zzso
