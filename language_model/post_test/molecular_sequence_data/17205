zzso salmon anemia virus zzso is the type species of the zzso zzso belonging to the zzso and causes serious disease in Atlantic salmon zzso zzso This study presents the expression and functional analysis of the zzso zzso segment 3, and provides further evidence that it encodes the viral zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in a zzso system, and Western zzso analysis showed that it zzso to the zzso zzso structural protein previously found in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was established by the interaction of viral and zzso zzso with zzso zzso transcribed in zzso zzso studies of infected cells showed the zzso zzso to be an early zzso It locates to the nucleus of infected cells before it is transported to the zzso prior to virus zzso A similar zzso pattern was observed in cells zzso with the zzso zzso confirming that the zzso protein has an intrinsic ability to be imported into the zzso Two zzso nuclear zzso signals zzso at zzso acids zzso and zzso were identified by computer analysis, and validated by zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso that have several zzso that function independent of each other, both zzso had to be present for the zzso zzso protein to be transported into the nucleus, indicating that these motifs cooperate to target the protein to the zzso
