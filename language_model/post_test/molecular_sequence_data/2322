The zzso transforming region II zzso of human zzso zzso strain zzso has been localized to a zzso zzso containing three putative open reading frames zzso of 79, 83, and 34 zzso acids zzso In addition, zzso DNA sequence elements which have the potential to form zzso structures were also observed within zzso To determine what elements within zzso zzso zzso are important in zzso zzso regions in other zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated and a comparison of transforming potential was zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso region in strain zzso was zzso whereas the zzso zzso region in strain zzso showed significantly reduced transforming zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence data of these zzso regions revealed the presence of the zzso zzso in strains zzso and zzso and its absence in strain zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso which was zzso within the zzso ORF, was shown to display significantly reduced transforming zzso Since the zzso and zzso coding sequences were interrupted in both the transforming zzso zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso these zzso were thought not to be important in zzso Analysis of the zzso structures within each of the zzso zzso regions did not reveal significant changes among the transforming and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the comparative data indicate an important role for the zzso zzso in zzso
