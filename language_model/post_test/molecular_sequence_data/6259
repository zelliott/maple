Although several signal zzso zzso including zzso of specific protein zzso have been proposed and studied for the zzso processes of lung zzso from zzso zzso type II cells, the role of zzso processing by zzso zzso neutral zzso in zzso has not been zzso zzso we examined the effect of cell permeable zzso inhibitor I zzso and II zzso on zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso participate in the zzso processes of zzso zzso type II zzso zzso inhibitor I zzso zzso zzso zzso while inhibitor II zzso zzso zzso zzso type II cells were zzso with zzso for zzso zzso To measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso released in the medium was zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso depressed by the presence of 10 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was also modulated by inhibitor II zzso zzso with calcium zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso However, cells zzso to inhibitor II displayed a zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (1 zzso each increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso cells, exposed to the same zzso attained only 53 or zzso of these zzso zzso inhibitor I, on the other hand, inhibited neither zzso nor zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso the major zzso of lung zzso requiring zzso calcium for activity in zzso is involved in the zzso pathways of zzso zzso type II zzso
