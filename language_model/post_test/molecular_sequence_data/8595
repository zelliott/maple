Three distinct genes zzso the three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, II and zzso expressed in zzso zzso domain of zzso type I zzso contains a 117 zzso insert located between two zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso this insert is removed by alternative zzso zzso tissue and cerebral arteries share the same zzso zzso The present study was designed to characterize alternative zzso of the type I zzso zzso gene in vascular tissue of human zzso Total zzso was isolated from human zzso and middle cerebral arteries and zzso One zzso of total zzso was reverse zzso First strand zzso was obtained and used as a template in zzso chain reaction zzso zzso products were zzso and zzso zzso zzso for type I and II receptors were detected in human cerebral zzso In vascular zzso a short transcript was expressed indicating that the type I zzso was alternatively zzso In contrast, only zzso zzso was detected in zzso These results suggest that alternative zzso zzso to differences in regulation of cerebrovascular and zzso zzso zzso
