The zzso zzso virus zzso from the family zzso belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso capping activity occurs in a zzso zzso We report a full atomic model of zzso built from a zzso density map obtained using zzso zzso The image data for the zzso reconstruction were acquired exclusively from a zzso zzso Our structure shows that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso and that there are five unique channels connecting the zzso and zzso zzso This structural organization reveals how the channels guide nascent zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso undergoing the highly coordinated zzso capping zzso Furthermore, by fitting the deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein zzso to 120 large zzso proteins on the zzso zzso zzso we confirmed that this zzso protein is zzso by zzso zzso segment zzso
