zzso interference zzso is a natural cellular regulatory process that zzso gene expression by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches that emulate this process zzso interfering zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso have been shown to be similarly effective in this zzso We developed a novel zzso zzso strategy, which further zzso target gene zzso zzso A zzso construct zzso was generated against zzso a critical zzso zzso that is zzso in human zzso The zzso construct is zzso to zzso repress the translation of the target zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and degrade (through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced potency and durability in parallel comparisons with conventional zzso and zzso targeting the same zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso was accompanied by target site zzso at the zzso level showed by the rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso at the zzso level consistent with its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a highly effective and advantageous approach zzso zzso at zzso significantly lower than conventional zzso or zzso These results support further zzso
