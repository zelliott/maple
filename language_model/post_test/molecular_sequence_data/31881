The zzso family in the sea zzso is comprised of three members designated zzso through zzso In this study, we found a high level of similarity between the zzso domain of the predicted gene zzso in the sea zzso zzso zzso and the same domain of a gene that we found in a closely related sea urchin, zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso was determined, and the expression of the zzso zzso throughout early sea zzso development was studied by zzso and in zzso zzso Also we analyzed zzso relationships of zzso and other members of the zzso and zzso zzso We have found that the zzso present during the time span from the egg to the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso distributed in eggs, zzso zzso and early zzso At the zzso stage, the zzso transcripts are localized in the zzso clusters of primary zzso cells, and later, at the zzso stage, they are detected in the forming zzso At the early zzso stage, zzso zzso are found in two groups of zzso cells in the zzso region on the zzso zzso We have determined that zzso is a zzso factor but its zzso function is zzso
