zzso variation plays a significant role in maintaining the evolutionary potential of a zzso Comparing the patterns of zzso and neutral diversity in extant populations is useful for understanding the local adaptations of a zzso In this study, we determined the zzso genetic structure of 6 extant populations of the giant panda zzso zzso using zzso and DNA zzso and then zzso zzso variations in 6 functional zzso class II genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this zzso We found that: zzso analysis of the zzso and DNA zzso networks of the 6 populations identified the independent evolutionary histories of the 2 panda zzso zzso the zzso zzso branches of the zzso zzso network all originated from the smallest zzso zzso population, suggesting the status of a glacial refuge in zzso zzso the zzso variations among the tested populations showed that the XXL population exhibited extraordinary high levels of zzso diversity in zzso zzso which is consistent with the diversity characteristics of a glacial zzso zzso the zzso tree showed that the zzso zzso of giant panda zzso sequences were all occupied by zzso zzso providing evidence for the zzso traits of zzso Finally, we found that the giant panda had many more zzso zzso than DR zzso zzso contrary to other zzso and that the XXL refuge showed special characteristics in the zzso zzso with 7 zzso members of 9 zzso zzso Thus, this study identified XXL as a glacial refuge, specifically harboring the most number of primitive zzso zzso
