We report the chemical characterization and the relationship between the zzso properties and zzso change of a zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso The expected chemical structure is confirmed, with a ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The molecular weight of the native form is zzso zzso zzso but after a single heating cycle through the zzso state the molecular weight is reduced to zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso index of zzso in both zzso The zzso change was studied by different methods which enabled us to define the exact nature of the ordered and zzso zzso The zzso transition depends on the temperature, the zzso strength and the nature of the zzso The zzso zzso is in zzso of a single chain zzso with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso change during this transition is greater than that expected solely on the basis of the zzso zzso It may be associated with changes in zzso or a zzso of water molecules in close association with the zzso
