zzso are zzso peptides from shrimp that are constituted by divergent classes of zzso zzso in an individual zzso zzso sequence variation suggests functional diversity in the host and promises differential activities if applied to treat infections in zzso We have zzso zzso 4 of zzso class 3 from the Atlantic shrimp, zzso zzso by native zzso using three zzso zzso Our synthesis approach led to the discovery of an irreversible side reaction that was successfully zzso a discovery, which has particular relevance to the synthesis of zzso zzso The zzso activity of full-length zzso and the zzso zzso domain of this zzso were compared with the corresponding peptides of zzso class 4 zzso 1 using a wide range of bacteria and zzso New aspects of zzso function are reported that include activity against zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso that are zzso to humans and effectiveness in the context of zzso resistance mechanisms zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso class 4 shows the highest relative zzso activity, while exhibiting no zzso to human zzso and therefore stands out as a potential zzso zzso
