P zzso elements in zzso are mobilized via a zzso zzso The broken DNA ends generated during zzso can be repaired via the zzso zzso strand zzso or by zzso end joining zzso zzso studies have demonstrated an interaction between the gene zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which is involved in zzso We have used zzso interference zzso to knock down expression of zzso and one or both of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Our results show that upon reduction of zzso an increase in small deletions zzso zzso and large deletions zzso zzso zzso the site of P zzso breaks is observed, and a reduction in large deletions at these sites is found upon reduction of zzso Moreover, double zzso of zzso and zzso results in an increase in small deletions characteristic of the zzso zzso and also partially suppresses the reduction in repair efficiency observed with zzso zzso These results suggest that there are DNA zzso break recognition and/or processing events involving zzso and zzso that, when eliminated by zzso lead to zzso Finally, these results raise the possibility that, unlike the situation in zzso where zzso appears to function exclusively in the zzso repair pathway, in zzso zzso may be directly involved in, or at least influence the zzso break recognition that leads to the zzso repair zzso
