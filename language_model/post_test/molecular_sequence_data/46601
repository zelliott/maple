zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso a nuclear zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso alpha zzso in the absence of zzso This interaction was enhanced in the presence of zzso but was reduced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in enhancement of zzso transcription, indicating that zzso serves as a zzso in zzso zzso To examine whether zzso of zzso plays a role in breast cancer because of its zzso function in zzso zzso we determined the levels of zzso expression in breast zzso High levels of zzso expression were detected in approximately 50% of primary breast zzso and breast cancer cell lines by zzso protection analysis, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso of human zzso revealed that the zzso gene is located on zzso zzso a region that is amplified in some breast zzso We found zzso gene amplification in approximately zzso zzso of breast tumors and approximately zzso zzso of breast cancer cell lines, zzso that zzso gene zzso can occur independent of gene zzso This gene comprises 17 zzso that, together, span zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso pairs inserted into a zzso reporter zzso revealed that the promoter activity in zzso cells increased by deletion of zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso to zzso region, which exhibited high promoter activity, contains a typical zzso box and multiple zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso These zzso in particular zzso gene amplification, suggest that zzso by its ability to function as zzso zzso might play a role in zzso zzso differentiation and in breast zzso
