A zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso from zzso virus has been cloned and the zzso sequence was zzso The zzso was cloned by zzso zzso of viral DNA and therefore does not contain the zzso closed terminal zzso The cloned sequences comprise a short zzso zzso unique region at the terminal end, which is adjacent to a zzso zzso long, zzso region consisting of sets of short zzso repeated units, 32 and 56 zzso zzso The remainder of the zzso is composed of a zzso zzso unique region containing three major open reading zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso by one of these has some similarity to that of zzso growth zzso
