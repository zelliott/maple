In zzso zzso zzso the zzso and highly zzso laminated layer, and molecules associated with this structure, is believed to be involved in modulating the zzso zzso We report on the molecular and functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a component of this laminated zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is virtually identical to that of its zzso in zzso zzso and shares zzso identity and zzso similarity with human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein which, besides its zzso function, can also act as a zzso growth factor and zzso of zzso and plays a role in zzso growth, development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also functionally active as a zzso zzso and was found to be present, besides the laminated layer, in zzso fluid and in zzso layer cell zzso zzso is released from zzso and zzso a zzso immune response in zzso infected mice, and vaccination of mice with zzso renders these mice more resistant towards secondary challenge infection, indicating that zzso plays an important role in zzso development and/or in modulating the zzso zzso We show that zzso stimulates the growth of isolated zzso zzso zzso layer cells in zzso and selectively stimulates the proliferation of bovine adrenal zzso zzso cells but not of human zzso and rat zzso Thus, besides its role in zzso zzso could also act as a factor that stimulates zzso growth and potentially zzso the formation of novel blood vessels around the developing zzso in zzso
