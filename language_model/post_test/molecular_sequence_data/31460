Twelve strains of zzso zzso isolated from zzso sites throughout the world, including some previously shown by zzso sequence analyses and zzso zzso to comprise a distinct species, were characterized in terms of their zzso The bacteria were shown to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso and grew in both zzso and zzso zzso using zzso iron, reduced sulfur or hydrogen as electron donors and oxygen or zzso iron as electron zzso Some of the strains grew at lower pH than those reported for the two recognized zzso zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of transition metals and zzso and also specific rates of iron zzso and reduction, were more similar to those of zzso zzso (to which the strains are more closely zzso than to zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate the 12 zzso with the type strain being zzso zzso zzso zzso
