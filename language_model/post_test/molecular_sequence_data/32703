zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso is important in the zzso salvage zzso and is an attractive target for rational drug design by incorporation of zzso that are lethal to many zzso organisms zzso So far, zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso only, not in zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso family zzso zzso a 309 zzso acid protein with a putative zzso zzso domain was isolated from the human fetal brain zzso It was named human zzso zzso zzso The zzso of human zzso gene was cloned into zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso The protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso but zzso activity could not be detected by zzso zzso analysis showed that human zzso was strongly expressed in blood zzso liver, zzso and zzso with lower levels of expression in the zzso heart, brain, zzso and skeletal zzso zzso location of zzso fusion protein revealed that human zzso was distributed in the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso zzso tree analyses of zzso or zzso proteins showed that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso had zzso activity whereas those higher than zzso zzso which lacked two zzso acids in the zzso region, had no zzso zzso This means that human zzso may have zzso activity with another, unknown, factor or have other activity in zzso zzso
