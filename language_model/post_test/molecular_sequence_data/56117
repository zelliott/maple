zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells via a zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso were expressed as zzso fusion proteins in zzso coli and reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso or pooled human immune zzso The zzso tested recognize seven distinct zzso on the zzso zzso and have distinct effects on the adherence and zzso activities of the zzso All seven zzso reacted with a fusion protein containing the zzso domain of the zzso zzso human immune zzso reacted with the same zzso domain as the zzso and also with a construct containing the first zzso zzso zzso zzso of three zzso with the surface of intact zzso confirmed that the zzso domain was located zzso The location of individual zzso was fine mapped by constructing zzso deletions in the zzso region of the fusion zzso The locations of zzso and zzso zzso were partially zzso and the zzso where zzso zzso bound were demonstrated to be near the zzso area of sequence identity with the human complement inhibitor zzso
