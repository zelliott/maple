The plant hormone zzso acid zzso zzso activates early genes in zzso The zzso family of early genes encodes proteins that are short-lived and zzso They also contain a putative zzso zzso DNA binding motif whose formation requires protein zzso Here, we show that the pea zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins perform zzso and zzso interactions in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso experiments demonstrate that the zzso and zzso proteins interact to form zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that the zzso containing zzso C zzso of the protein is necessary for zzso interactions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso library using zzso as a bait reveals zzso interactions of zzso with known and newly discovered members of the zzso zzso gene zzso The new member zzso has similarity to zzso a zzso factor that binds to an zzso response zzso zzso interactions among the various members of the zzso gene family may regulate a variety of late genes as well as serve as zzso of early zzso gene zzso These interactions provide a molecular basis for the zzso and zzso manner of zzso zzso
