A zzso zzso chain reaction system with zzso derived from the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity for detection of zzso zzso The method used target DNA within samples of zzso zzso broth cultures and clinical material, without a formal extraction zzso The sensitivity for detection of DNA was found to be to a level of one copy per sample and was specific to zzso zzso only, discriminating from the other human mycoplasma and zzso species zzso The system offers the opportunity for a simple and highly specific laboratory method for diagnosis which may be compared to currently available zzso methods, and may provide another method of studying zzso zzso
