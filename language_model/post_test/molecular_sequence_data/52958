Most zzso G protein alpha zzso are zzso modified by zzso attached to one or more zzso zzso zzso Although a wide variety of proteins undergo zzso the role of this fatty acid modification in G protein signaling is not well zzso Thus, we examined the role of zzso of zzso a G protein alpha zzso that regulates many pathways involved in cell zzso Both zzso zzso at positions 14 and 18 were required for zzso zzso zzso in which both zzso were changed to zzso failed to zzso to plasma zzso in zzso cells and failed to activate zzso serum response zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber zzso However, zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso retained the ability to zzso with a direct zzso zzso Finally, we report the novel observation that activated zzso zzso a zzso of zzso from the zzso to plasma zzso but zzso zzso of zzso fail to cause zzso zzso These findings identify zzso of zzso as critical for its proper membrane zzso and signaling and provide insight into the mechanism of zzso of zzso signaling pathways by zzso
