It was observed in the course of other studies that rat fetal lung extracts inhibited proliferation of fetal lung cells in zzso The purpose of the present study was to isolate and characterize this zzso zzso It was found that fetal lungs contained a 16 zzso zzso factor and its concentration was twofold greater in fetal lungs of diabetic rats compared with control zzso This fetal lung zzso protein zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso The zzso protein was zzso onto zzso zzso membrane and subjected to sequence zzso The zzso sequence of this fetal lung zzso protein was P E P A K S A P A P X K G I G K Q X X K A X X K A zzso and showed significant zzso with zzso zzso however, the zzso acid composition of zzso suggested that it may be structurally distinct from zzso zzso zzso mass zzso suggested that zzso was made up of at least two species of the protein with molecular weights of zzso and zzso and was different from the molecular weight of rat zzso zzso predicted by its zzso zzso The concentration of zzso based on zzso acid compositions, was zzso zzso and zzso zzso wet fetal lung from zzso and diabetic rats zzso These findings suggest that the fetal rat lung produces a regulatory factor bearing considerable zzso with but possibly different from zzso zzso and that fetal lung zzso during diabetic pregnancy might be contributed to by an increase in this zzso
