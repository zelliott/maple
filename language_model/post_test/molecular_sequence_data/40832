The invasive forms of zzso zzso share a zzso form of gliding zzso that powers zzso migration across biological zzso host cell invasion and zzso from infected zzso Previous studies have established that the duration and direction of gliding zzso are determined by zzso zzso however, regulators of zzso dynamics in zzso remain poorly zzso In the absence of a complete zzso complex, the zzso zzso 2 domain containing proteins and the accessory protein zzso are presumed to orchestrate zzso zzso during host cell zzso Here, we have undertaken the zzso and functional characterization of two zzso zzso zzso and established that they act in concert as zzso zzso during zzso The importance of zzso for zzso zzso has been assessed by conditional gene zzso The contribution of each zzso individually and jointly was revealed by an approach based upon the expression of dominant zzso with modified zzso zzso impaired in zzso binding but still able to zzso with their respective zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso were fused to the zzso zzso domain zzso to achieve conditional zzso This strategy proved unique in identifying the zzso and critical roles of both zzso in zzso These findings provide new insights into how controlled zzso zzso drives the directional movement required for productive penetration of zzso into host zzso
