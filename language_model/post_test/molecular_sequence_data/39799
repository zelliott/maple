zzso idiopathic zzso zzso is the most common cause of zzso While calcium sensing zzso zzso zzso are observed in zzso of cases, zzso mechanisms in others are under zzso zzso in the zzso gene including its 3' untranslated region, zzso regulator gene and lead zzso gene single zzso zzso zzso are not associated with the zzso There are reports of de zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a few patients with zzso 

To assess the frequency of zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

DNA sequencing of all six translating zzso and nine of 12 zzso boundaries of the zzso gene was performed by zzso zzso chain termination method using an automated zzso in 39 patients with zzso Spot urinary zzso ratio in the zzso state and zzso of the abdomen was performed to assess zzso and zzso The zzso analysis was performed using zzso restriction zzso in 32 additional patients with zzso and 90 healthy controls to further assess the prevalence of a novel zzso zzso observed in the DNA zzso 

zzso sequence analysis revealed the presence of a wild type zzso gene in all subjects, except in one patient who showed a zzso zzso zzso due to substitution of base zzso in the zzso state at position zzso in zzso 7 zzso zzso coding for the first zzso loop of the zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and was due to a maternal zzso However, the mother and brother of this patient with the same zzso were zzso and had normal serum chemistry indicating the functionally zzso nature of the zzso None of the additional 32 patients with zzso and 90 controls showed zzso zzso The urinary zzso ratio and zzso were normal in all patients with zzso 

De zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene typical of familial zzso is not common among patients with zzso in zzso
