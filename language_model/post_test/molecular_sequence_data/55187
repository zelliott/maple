zzso expression systems have become powerful tools for understanding the structure and function of zzso including the zzso that comprise human zzso However, human zzso zzso has proven difficult to produce by zzso techniques, likely contributing to our lack of knowledge about its structure, specific biological function, and role in cardiovascular zzso Here we present a novel zzso zzso zzso expression system that produces highly pure mature human zzso at substantial zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso binding domain was fused at the C zzso of zzso A zzso zzso was also added at the fusion zzso C zzso After rapid zzso on a zzso column, zzso zzso was induced under reducing conditions, releasing a zzso with only one extra zzso Met compared with the sequence of human mature zzso A pass through a zzso zzso column removed any zzso residual fusion zzso leaving highly pure zzso A variety of zzso mass zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso form is comparable in structure to human plasma zzso Similarly, zzso zzso is comparable to the plasma form in its ability to bind and reorganize zzso and promote cholesterol zzso from zzso via the zzso binding cassette zzso zzso This system is ideal for producing large quantities of zzso zzso or zzso zzso for structural or functional zzso
