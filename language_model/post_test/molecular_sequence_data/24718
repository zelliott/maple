zzso 1 probably functions as a zzso sensor in neurotransmitter release via its two zzso but no common zzso activity that could zzso a cooperative action between them has been zzso The zzso structure of the zzso now reveals a beta sandwich that exhibits striking similarities and differences with the zzso Whereas the bottom face of the zzso has two additional alpha zzso that may be involved in specialized zzso functions, the top face binds two zzso zzso and is remarkably similar to the zzso zzso with these results, but in contrast to previous studies, we find that the zzso binds zzso in a zzso manner similarly to the zzso These results suggest a novel view of zzso function zzso the two zzso cooperate in a common activity, zzso zzso zzso to trigger neurotransmitter zzso
