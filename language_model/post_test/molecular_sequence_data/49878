zzso communication via zzso sensing zzso has been reported to be important in the production of zzso factors, zzso sensitivity, and zzso zzso Two zzso systems, known as the las and zzso systems, have been identified previously in the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate global gene expression patterns modulated by zzso zzso In the initial experiments we focused on identifying las and/or zzso zzso genes using a zzso signal zzso zzso zzso that was cultured with and without added zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes showed statistically significant differential expression zzso zzso zzso in response to the zzso zzso and were classified as zzso zzso A total of zzso genes were identified as being zzso regulated at the zzso phase, and 450 genes were identified as being zzso regulated at the early stationary zzso Most of the previously reported zzso genes were confirmed, and a large number of additional zzso genes were zzso zzso 222 genes were identified as being zzso zzso Environmental factors, such as medium composition and oxygen zzso eliminated detection of transcripts of many genes that were identified as being zzso zzso
