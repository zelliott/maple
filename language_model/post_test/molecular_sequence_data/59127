The structure of a parallel left-handed zzso form of zzso was detected by circular zzso zzso and determined using 500 and 600 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were converted into zzso distance and 48 zzso angle constraints for structure zzso zzso assignments and zzso 1 angles were calculated using zzso alpha zzso d alpha beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 angles were determined using d alpha zzso zzso zzso d beta zzso zzso zzso and d alpha zzso The calculations of initial structures were performed using the distance zzso zzso method in zzso The initial structures were further refined and energy minimized using simulated zzso dynamics zzso zzso for every generated structure were also performed to check their consistency with the experimental zzso zzso final structures with no violations above the threshold conditions zzso A, 5 degrees, 5 degrees, zzso A and 5 degrees for bonds, angles, improper, zzso and zzso zzso were produced from the 200 initial zzso Twenty structures with the lowest zzso energies were used for further zzso The average zzso zzso for the 20 structures are zzso A for backbone and zzso A for all zzso zzso zzso in this form, with approximately zzso zzso per turn, is a parallel double zzso zzso The length along the zzso axis is about 30 A and the inner pore diameter varies from 1 to 2 zzso It is different from all other zzso structures determined to zzso The presence of zzso zzso a zzso that prevents the binding of zzso zzso It is likely that this structure is related to a zzso zzso role of zzso
