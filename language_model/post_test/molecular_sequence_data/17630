zzso is a zzso zzso hormone which serves a variety of biological functions, including cell growth control in Swiss zzso cultured zzso It has been also involved in an zzso system regulating the growth of small cell lung zzso A series of zzso zzso were developed by zzso acid zzso inversion or substitution in the zzso region, identified by the target cell zzso Their properties were examined for: zzso competitive binding zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso zzso zzso effects on early cellular events zzso zzso production and protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso zzso induced complete loss of zzso affinity and biological zzso zzso of the His zzso or its zzso as His zzso in conjunction with Met deletion or zzso gave rise to compounds with reduced zzso affinity and weak zzso zzso Other modifications in the zzso zzso affected the potency but not the biological profile of the parent zzso These results indicate the basis for the eventual design of improved, specific zzso zzso zzso and stimulate further studies on their possible application in the therapy of human small cell lung zzso
