There has been a recent revival of interest in one of the most abundant zzso coli zzso zzso (also called zzso This protein was first identified many years ago as a major component of the bacterial zzso and has been characterized zzso by several zzso However, no clear function for the protein emerged from these zzso Our thinking has been transformed by recent findings which complement the zzso with genetic zzso Several zzso selected over many years by virtue of their diverse effects on gene zzso have turned out to be zzso and to fall within the structural gene for zzso Bringing together the zzso and the zzso has demonstrated that the whole is worth more than the sum of the zzso These findings have far-reaching implications for the mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated and also, perhaps, for the control of bacterial zzso
