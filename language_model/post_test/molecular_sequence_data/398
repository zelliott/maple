zzso of heat shock factors zzso with heat shock element sequence is critical for the zzso induction of heat shock zzso Rice zzso sequence shows 26 zzso genes out of which 25 possess various important zzso noted in zzso zzso DNA binding domain zzso zzso domain zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso nuclear export signal zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso entry zzso has the zzso domain but lacks the above other zzso Also, there are no zzso or full-length zzso noted for this entry in zzso zzso profiling showed that 22 zzso genes are induced by high zzso zzso of 10 and 14 zzso genes was also noted against low temperature stress and zzso stress, zzso All zzso genes induced by zzso stress were also induced by high zzso On the other hand, induction of 6 and 1 zzso genes was noted to be exclusive to high and low temperature zzso zzso Seven zzso genes showed induced expression in response to all the three stresses zzso While in zzso promoter analysis showed that zzso genes contain upstream regulatory elements corresponding to different zzso zzso there was lack of correlation noted between the in zzso profiling of the elements and their corresponding transcript expression zzso Apart from stress zzso zzso database suggests that various zzso genes are zzso regulated in diverse tissue zzso
