Resistance to several toxic zzso in zzso coli is zzso by the zzso zzso carried on zzso zzso The gene products of this zzso catalyze zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso In this paper, we report the determination of the overall fold for zzso a 16 zzso protein of the zzso zzso involved in the reduction of zzso to zzso using zzso zzso zzso The protein is found to contain large regions of extensive mobility, particularly in the active zzso A model fold, zzso on the basis of a preliminary set of zzso was found to be structurally zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some kinship to the structure of low molecular weight zzso zzso based on rough zzso similarity but more so on the basis of a common zzso motif zzso was also zzso Although functional, secondary, and zzso structural zzso is observed with these zzso no significant zzso in primary structure was zzso The zzso of the active site of zzso and of other zzso are zzso
