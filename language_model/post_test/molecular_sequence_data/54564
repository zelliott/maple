zzso inflammation and subsequent zzso zzso may play a key role in prostate zzso In this way, molecular zzso of the zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso one of the most important zzso zzso of inflammatory signal zzso zzso could contribute to explain the zzso role of zzso zzso in this type of zzso 

We analyzed the zzso status and zzso expression of zzso in 20 benign prostate zzso zzso and in 51 prostate cancer zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso status using zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by sequencing after zzso zzso zzso of this gene was also demonstrated by real-time zzso and by zzso zzso and correlation with clinical data were statistically zzso 

We found that the promoter of zzso was zzso in zzso of prostate zzso On the contrary, all zzso and normal controls had an zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that in zzso cases zzso zzso expression was reduced by three and four folds as compared to zzso and zzso cases, zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso level was higher in zzso prostate cancer than in zzso The zzso zzso analysis for zzso 3 confirmed zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso promoter significantly associated with zzso grade zzso score zzso and with an zzso clinical outcome zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of prostate cancer and could identify a tumor subset with an aggressive zzso
