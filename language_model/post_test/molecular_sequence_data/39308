Complex zzso in the zzso of zzso effects mean that environmental zzso present in the aquatic environment have the potential to disrupt zzso function in fish in a more complex manner than portrayed in the present zzso Taking a broader approach to investigate the possible effect pathways and the likely consequences of environmental zzso exposure in fish, the effects of zzso zzso were studied on the expression of a suite of genes which interact to mediate growth, development and zzso and zzso function zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ), zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ), zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso together with the expression analyses of zzso receptors and ten other genes centrally involved in sexual development and reproduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of adult zzso to 35 zzso zzso for 14 days induced classic zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso 1 and plasma zzso and impacted on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profiles and suppressing genes involved in zzso zzso However, zzso also triggered a cascade of responses for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso brain, liver, zzso and zzso with potential consequences for the functioning of many zzso zzso not just zzso zzso responses to zzso were complex, with most genes showing differential responses between zzso and zzso For example, zzso expression increased in brain but decreased in zzso on exposure to zzso and responded in an opposite way in males compared with females in liver, zzso and zzso These findings demonstrate the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the zzso interactions for zzso the mechanisms of environmental zzso action and predicting the likely health zzso
