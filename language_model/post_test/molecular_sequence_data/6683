zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso from a human zzso cell line, zzso The zzso zzso has a specific activity of 600 zzso of zzso oxidized per zzso per zzso which is about half that of chicken liver zzso All the partial activities of human zzso are comparable to those of other animal zzso except for the zzso zzso whose significantly lower activity is attributable to the low zzso content of zzso zzso We cloned the human brain zzso zzso The zzso sequence has an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the human zzso has zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with the sequences of the rat and chicken zzso Northern analysis revealed that human zzso zzso was about zzso zzso in size and that its level varied among human zzso with brain, zzso and liver zzso showing prominent zzso The zzso sequence of a segment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical to that of the zzso from normal human liver and brain zzso except for a zzso sequence zzso zzso that does not alter the reading zzso This altered sequence is also present in zzso zzso zzso The origin and significance of this sequence zzso in the zzso zzso gene are zzso but the zzso apparently does not contribute to the lower activity of zzso zzso
