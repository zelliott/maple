zzso 9-12 of the first domain of zzso which zzso the zzso acid sequence zzso (in zzso zzso served as the basis for the construction of a zzso chain reaction primer specific for zzso of the whole zzso zzso Using this primer for the zzso end and a primer for a zzso region at the 3' end, we could amplify selectively the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso and zzso were also specifically zzso zzso This selectively amplified DNA could then be used in a zzso procedure for zzso with zzso zzso chosen to define the zzso that characterize these zzso and their zzso zzso of zzso for groups of related zzso have been zzso and their zzso were determined in representative panels available in our zzso The results presented illustrate the extraordinary power of this new DNA typing zzso Using these relatively simple methods it is possible to zzso with zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso associated with the zzso zzso The ability to type extends far beyond the capabilities of present zzso the precision achieved with this method in panel zzso is zzso
