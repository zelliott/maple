Genes zzso the zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso There are at least four genes that zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The genes zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso and their predicted products showed zzso identity with zzso zzso from diverse zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso showed that it is present in spores and zzso expressed during zzso development and during zzso and zzso zzso However, during zzso cell growth, decreased levels of zzso were zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced sequence of zzso protein contains all the consensus regions of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso except the zzso near the C zzso for potential zzso by zzso zzso This zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso Based on its zzso mobility in zzso the molecular mass of the zzso zzso was 45 zzso The zzso protein was recognized by a zzso zzso against a zzso of a human zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was zzso by activated zzso toxin and zzso but not by zzso zzso These results indicate that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso during zzso
