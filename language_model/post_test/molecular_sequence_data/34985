zzso 71 zzso zzso disease has become a major threat to public health in the zzso zzso Although T cell immunity is closely correlated with clinical outcomes of zzso infection, little is known about T cell immunity baseline against zzso and T cell zzso of zzso zzso in the population, which has restricted our understanding of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the cellular immune responses against the four structural zzso of zzso and determined the zzso of these zzso in healthy zzso A low frequency of zzso T cells was detected circulating in peripheral blood, and broad T cell immune responses could be identified in most of the subjects after in zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso with broad distribution of zzso peptides dominates T cell responses against zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the responses were illuminated to be mainly single zzso zzso T cell dependent, indicating the previous natural acute viral infection of the adult zzso Conservancy analysis of the zzso peptides revealed that moderately zzso peptides were in the majority in zzso A16 zzso whereas most of the peptides were highly zzso in zzso Less efficient zzso against zzso might broadly exist among individuals, whereas influences derived from zzso vaccination would be zzso Our findings suggest that the significance of zzso zzso should be addressed in the future zzso zzso zzso And the findings concerning the less efficient zzso against zzso and limited influences from zzso vaccination in zzso population would contribute to a better understanding of zzso mechanisms against zzso
