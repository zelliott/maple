The geographic and zzso origins of zzso zzso have long been in the center of zzso We reconstructed a zzso including nearly all native zzso and zzso zzso zzso present on the island, from DNA sequences of two zzso zzso nuclear genes zzso and zzso and a set of zzso time zzso zzso calculated with zzso or independent substitution rates over zzso agreed in placing the origins of the 31 included zzso in zzso to zzso zzso The two zzso with sister groups in South America were the oldest, followed by those of a putative Asian ancestry that were significantly older than the prevalent zzso of African zzso No colonizations from Asia occurred after the zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso of zzso groups were favored over a comparatively short period zzso and shortly after, the separation of India and zzso Species richness of zzso zzso with their age but those zzso that have a large proportion of species diversity in zzso are significantly more zzso This finding suggests an underlying pattern of continuous zzso through time in zzso zzso with accelerated episodes of zzso diversification in those zzso that succeeded radiating into the zzso
