Although many human zzso possess potent zzso activities for primary zzso zzso such activities are not efficiently induced by the current generation of vaccine candidates, and the zzso zzso this zzso are not zzso The zzso loop of zzso is believed to be the principal zzso domain of zzso zzso but the importance of this region in zzso of primary zzso is zzso This question was explored using zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso methods from zzso of zzso zzso To include zzso that might be directed against zzso and/or zzso zzso not presented by synthetic zzso the zzso zzso were performed with a fusion zzso expressing the native zzso region of zzso a primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from all eight zzso examined showed potent zzso of at least one of the three primary zzso zzso zzso four of these zzso preparations neutralized all three primary zzso For a number of zzso combinations zzso zzso doses zzso between 1 and 5 zzso were zzso and the most potent zzso fraction had zzso values at or below zzso zzso for all three primary zzso These zzso activities against primary viruses were higher than those of potent zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso These data indicate that the zzso region can be an important zzso target in primary zzso and suggest that effective presentation of zzso zzso in a vaccine zzso might induce protective zzso responses against natural infection by zzso
