zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we attempted to purify zzso from the zzso zzso We also examined an interaction of the protein with zzso zzso zzso which can induce zzso in zzso A zzso protein zzso with zzso against muscle zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso treatment, ammonium zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its partial zzso acid sequence was then zzso A zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein was examined by a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein and its fragments with zzso were analyzed by an affinity zzso using zzso Determined zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein were completely identical with those deduced from zzso sequence of the zzso zzso human zzso The zzso protein possessed the known function of zzso the zzso activity, and was tightly bound to zzso The zzso site was mapped within a central rod domain of the zzso which is a possible interaction site for various zzso and zzso zzso We have established an efficient zzso method for zzso zzso Moreover, our findings indicate that the central rod domain of zzso has a high affinity to zzso In the zzso zzso animal model, zzso might be a target protein from zzso zzso
