zzso protein zzso is one of two known naturally occurring zzso of zzso coupled zzso zzso is zzso in the brain and is an zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso These three proteins are involved in the regulation of energy zzso and obesity in both mice and zzso The human zzso protein is 132 zzso acids and contains five zzso bridges in the zzso zzso Previous reports of the zzso structures of zzso and a truncated 34 zzso acid form consisting of four zzso bridges identified that zzso contains an inhibitor zzso knot zzso structural fold, and that is the first zzso zzso zzso we report a zzso zzso analogue that, when compared to zzso possesses equal binding affinity but is zzso less potent at the mouse zzso Using zzso computer assisted molecular modeling zzso and cluster analysis, we have identified five structural families, two of which are highly populated, of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of this zzso zzso zzso using a three-dimensional zzso molecular model of the mouse zzso identified that three of the five structural families could be zzso into the zzso without problems from zzso zzso Those three zzso zzso zzso family structures were compared with putative zzso zzso interactions previously reported zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2004, 47, zzso in attempts to identify a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and account for the zzso decreased zzso potency compared to zzso
