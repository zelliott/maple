zzso 1, a zzso zzso protein that has been implicated in development, zzso suppression, zzso and cell death, exists in a complex with zzso the class III zzso zzso that mediates multiple zzso processes including zzso and zzso However, the precise role of the zzso zzso complex in zzso regulation remains to be zzso Combining mouse zzso and zzso we have identified a large in zzso zzso 1 complex containing the known proteins zzso zzso and zzso as well as two newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain and zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the new proteins revealed that zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso whereas zzso reduces zzso activity and zzso zzso We show that zzso 1 and zzso zzso promote the formation of zzso zzso that are associated with zzso and zzso whereas forced expression of zzso results in zzso late zzso structures and impaired zzso zzso We zzso that by forming distinct protein complexes, zzso 1 and its binding proteins orchestrate the precise function of the class III zzso in regulating zzso at multiple zzso
