The results of analyses of zzso precursor and zzso protein gene sequences indicated that an zzso isolated from a Mexican zzso zzso zzso captured in Arizona is a strain of a novel species zzso name Skinner zzso zzso and that zzso isolated from Mexican zzso captured in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah are strains of zzso zzso virus or species zzso closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons of zzso precursor sequences and zzso protein sequences revealed a high level of divergence among the viruses isolated from the Mexican zzso captured in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah and the zzso zzso virus zzso strain zzso zzso which originally was isolated from a white-throated zzso zzso zzso captured in New zzso zzso the viruses from Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah and strain zzso zzso could be grouped together in a species complex in the family zzso zzso zzso
