zzso from a man with a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta zzso and from his son with zzso lethal zzso zzso type zzso produced normal and abnormal type I zzso zzso The abnormal molecules zzso by both cell strains contained one or two pro alpha zzso chains in which the zzso at position 550 of the zzso domain was zzso by zzso as the result of a zzso transition in the first base of the zzso zzso zzso from the mother produced only normal type I zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso to amplified zzso sequences from paternal zzso we determined that the zzso zzso accounted for approximately 50% of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of those in blood, and 37% of those in zzso These findings demonstrate that the father is mosaic for the potentially lethal zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso is determined by the nature of the zzso and the relative abundance of the normal and zzso zzso in different zzso Furthermore, the findings make it clear that some individuals with mild to moderate forms of zzso are mosaic for zzso that will be lethal in their zzso
