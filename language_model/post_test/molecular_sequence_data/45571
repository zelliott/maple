zzso zzso strain zzso is a versatile zzso zzso able to grow on a wide variety of aromatic compounds as carbon and energy zzso Since the strain is zzso to genetic analysis, a zzso approach was used to study the zzso pathways involved in the zzso of such compounds by analyzing zzso induced zzso The most marked difference was observed when the zzso profiles of zzso cells were compared with those cultured in the presence of zzso or zzso suggesting that different zzso pathways are involved in the degradation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso cells indicated that each zzso was specifically induced by the corresponding aromatic zzso A combination of zzso and molecular biology led to the identification of 14 proteins zzso identical to known zzso zzso that describe a complete zzso for the zzso of zzso to central zzso via zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were also induced in zzso cells, indicating that growth on this compound zzso a stress zzso zzso of zzso repression by zzso was observed by both zzso and zzso analysis, suggesting that zzso zzso strain zzso may have advantages over other tightly regulated strains in zzso
