For possible multiple zzso of zzso protein zzso I zzso zzso zzso only one zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso has to been zzso By screening of embryonic zzso rat brain zzso libraries, we have now isolated two additional examples zzso zzso I beta and zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso I alpha to predominate over I beta and gamma in rat zzso Analysis of the tissue distribution of the zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso protocols demonstrated zzso zzso I alpha in a variety of zzso while the expression of zzso zzso I beta and gamma was more limited to the zzso The obtained results support the idea that zzso zzso I exists as a set of zzso
