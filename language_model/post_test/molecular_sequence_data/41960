The zzso element zzso zzso gene encodes a family of zzso regulators that bind to promoter sequences activated by increased zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are generated by alternative zzso and alternative zzso zzso During the development of male germ cells, there is a switch in the transcripts generated by zzso Specifically, from the zzso of zzso there is an increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we present results showing that expression of the zzso zzso protein is restricted to zzso germ zzso We show that zzso zzso is efficiently zzso at a zzso zzso at position 117 by the protein zzso zzso to germ cells, indicating that it constitutes a natural target of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso turns zzso zzso into a powerful zzso The rise in zzso zzso protein zzso with the zzso zzso of several zzso We show that zzso zzso efficiently binds to zzso present in the promoters of these zzso suggesting that they could constitute zzso targets of zzso We have analyzed in more detail the regulation of one of these zzso the male germ zzso zzso The zzso promoter is zzso zzso and activated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso promoter is efficiently transcribed in zzso with nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso in zzso transcription, implicating a role for zzso zzso in a cascade of zzso events during zzso
