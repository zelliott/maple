zzso strains attenuated by various zzso zzso and expressing zzso colonization and zzso zzso specified by cloned genes have begun to be widely used as vaccines for oral zzso to induce protective immunity against the pathogens zzso the genes for the colonization or zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso instability and/or poor expression of cloned gene products have frequently been encountered and regulatory agencies are now banning use of zzso resistance markers in live attenuated vaccine zzso We have therefore developed a balanced lethal zzso system in which the zzso of the attenuated vaccine strain contains a deletion zzso that impose a requirement for zzso acid zzso an essential constituent of the rigid layer of the cell wall of all zzso and some zzso zzso The zzso cloning zzso contains the zzso zzso for this gene allowing the zzso zzso zzso to be independent of zzso Since zzso is not prevalent in nature, especially in the animal host, essentially zzso of the surviving zzso zzso recovered from an zzso animal host still contain the zzso zzso and express the foreign colonization or zzso zzso zzso loss of the zzso renders the zzso zzso zzso which quickly results in zzso death with zzso of the zzso to release its zzso zzso an occurrence which might further enhance the immune response to the foreign colonization or zzso zzso We describe below strains of bacteria, zzso zzso and the methods to make use of this system in a diversity of situations for development of live zzso zzso vaccines as well as for other potential zzso
