Using a zzso zzso against a bovine brain zzso protein zzso we isolated from a zzso zzso bovine brain expression library a zzso that zzso a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 zzso The zzso zzso sequence contained a unique open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acids deduced sequence showed a significant zzso with several zzso mainly with a bacterial zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso identity was confirmed by the determination of zzso zzso activity in zzso of zzso zzso constructions containing the full length zzso The results described in this report are to our knowledge the first molecular characterization of a zzso zzso in zzso
