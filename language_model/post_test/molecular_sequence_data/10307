The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso coupled zzso which is located on zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso signals through multiple zzso including zzso of zzso zzso leading to zzso of bone zzso In the present study, we used zzso raised against the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso to study zzso zzso In baby zzso kidney cells zzso with the human CT zzso zzso of the zzso increased approximately zzso after cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso zzso reached a maximum 20 minutes after treatment with zzso and zzso zzso was observed at zzso zzso zzso a hormone concentration related to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso yielded a single zzso zzso which zzso at Mr 14 zzso on gel zzso This zzso to the predicted size of the zzso zzso containing the zzso domain of the zzso No zzso bands were observed for zzso fragments predicted to contain the first, second, or third zzso zzso An identical labeling pattern was seen with cells expressing an alternatively spliced zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso and zzso was further localized to a Mr 6 zzso zzso zzso within the zzso The protein zzso A and C zzso zzso zzso and zzso had little effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso CT zzso zzso
