A novel zzso male sterile zzso line in zzso zzso zzso which was identified in 1999, was found to be controlled by a zzso dominant zzso which we have designated as zzso The zzso of the zzso abort before the degradation of the zzso cell zzso The F1 fertility from any fertile lines crossed with zzso zzso and the ratio was close to zzso zzso segregation analysis zzso was employed to identify random amplified zzso DNA zzso markers linked to the Ms gene in zzso Among 880 random zzso zzso zzso screened against the bulk DNA of sterile and zzso one primer zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso DNA zzso segment zzso between the two zzso Analysis of individual plants of each zzso and other types of zzso and zzso male zzso zzso lines suggest that the zzso marker zzso is closely linked to the zzso locus in zzso This zzso marker has been converted into sequence characterized amplified region zzso marker to aid identification of zzso zzso in segregating zzso of zzso in zzso selection zzso breeding zzso
