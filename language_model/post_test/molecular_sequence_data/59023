The zzso region zzso in the promoter of the zzso gene was analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants in which the zzso zzso region of the zzso promoter was placed upstream of the gene for zzso zzso The zzso was located between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dissection of this segment revealed that the presence of the zzso sequences from zzso zzso to zzso and from zzso zzso to zzso was required for the expression of the zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso The sequence from zzso zzso to zzso was found to contain a sequence which resembles the zzso element in the zzso promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso Although it has been reported that the zzso element is involved in zzso responsiveness zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that introduction of a point zzso into the zzso sequence completely eliminated zzso zzso a result that suggests that the sequence is indispensable for zzso zzso However, the presence of the zzso sequence alone was not sufficient for zzso zzso since the segment zzso zzso to zzso that included the zzso sequence failed to zzso zzso responsiveness on the core zzso It is possible that the two separately located sequences play specific roles in interactions with zzso that are required for the expression of the zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso
