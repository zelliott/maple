Loss of arc function results in a zzso curved wing and smaller eyes with a reduced number of zzso zzso with this zzso molecular analysis shows that arc zzso and protein are expressed in the wing zzso disc and in clusters of cells in the zzso zzso of the eye zzso zzso The zzso arc zzso unit contains 10 zzso that are spliced to form a zzso zzso zzso The zzso Arc protein is zzso Da and contains two zzso zzso zzso large, zzso zzso there is no close structural similarity to other zzso zzso In addition to its expression in zzso discs, arc is expressed during zzso in zzso undergoing zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and developing zzso Arc protein zzso with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso surface of these developing zzso indicating that it is associated with zzso zzso Genes that are required for patterning of embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso fork head, and zzso or for progression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are required to establish or maintain the regional expression of zzso zzso of arc in the eye zzso discs results in rough and larger eyes with fused zzso We propose that arc affects eye development by modulating zzso junctions of the developing zzso
