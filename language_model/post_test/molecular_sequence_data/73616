We have analyzed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso factor zzso attachment protein zzso receptors in the target zzso proteins that are believed to be involved in the fusion of transport zzso with their target zzso By using a sensitive computer method, the generalized profile method, we were able to identify a new zzso domain that is common in the two protein families previously identified to act as zzso the zzso and zzso zzso protein of 25 zzso families, which therefore constitute a new zzso This zzso domain of approximately 60 zzso acids is predicted to form a zzso zzso The significance of this zzso domain could be demonstrated by a partial suppression of the zzso properties of the domain zzso In proteins belonging to the zzso family, a single zzso domain is located near the zzso domain, whereas the members of the zzso family possess two zzso zzso This domain was also identified in several proteins that have been implicated in zzso transport but do not belong to any of the zzso protein zzso Several new zzso zzso and zzso proteins were identified that belong to the new zzso The evolutionary conservation of the zzso zzso zzso domain suggests that this domain has a similar function in different membrane fusion zzso
