zzso of zzso in zzso zzso by exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, and fetal bovine serum is accompanied by a transient burst of zzso beta protein expression that precedes the induction of the fat gene zzso In this study we have investigated the role of zzso beta in initiating the zzso program by zzso zzso beta in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso beta was accomplished by using an artificial zzso regulatory system based on the zzso coli zzso zzso to generate a stable cell line, beta 2, that expresses zzso beta zzso and protein in a tightly controlled zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta zzso activity in zzso beta 2 cells exposed to zzso in the presence of insulin and fetal bovine serum activates the expression of an zzso nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso that stimulates the conversion of these zzso into committed zzso Either zzso expression of zzso beta or treatment with zzso alone is incapable of inducing zzso gamma zzso but when present together, they have a synergistic effect on the zzso zzso Exposure of these zzso cells to a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso results in the zzso of fat droplets and expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of beta 2 cells that can differentiate into zzso is related to the concentration of zzso and, therefore, the amount of the zzso zzso beta protein zzso zzso beta can induce zzso gamma zzso in the absence of zzso however, expression of zzso zzso and maximum fat deposition is dependent on the zzso zzso Our results suggest that enhanced expression of zzso beta converts zzso zzso precursor cells into zzso that respond to zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso to differentiate into zzso
