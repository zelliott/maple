This study uses zzso zzso and wide-angle zzso X-ray zzso zzso volume zzso and thin layer zzso to determine the structure and interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the zzso zzso motif segment in the zzso region of the zzso protein of zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso is used as a zzso Both peptides thin the zzso zzso by approximately 3 A, and cause the zzso cell zzso to increase by approximately 9 zzso from the zzso of zzso at 30 degrees C zzso zzso Model fitting suggests that zzso average position is slightly closer to the zzso center than zzso and both peptides are just inside of the zzso zzso Both peptides increase the wide-angle spacing d of zzso without cholesterol, whereas with 50% cholesterol zzso increases d but zzso decreases zzso TLC shows that zzso is more zzso than zzso this difference persists in zzso zzso mole ratio zzso Both peptides counteract the chain ordering effect of cholesterol to roughly the same degree, and both decrease zzso the zzso zzso thus increasing the zzso membrane zzso Both peptides zzso zzso of cholesterol, but the zzso zzso are weaker and zzso more zzso
