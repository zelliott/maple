It has been proposed that recognition of the 3' zzso site in many group I zzso involves base pairing between the start of the 3' zzso and a region of the zzso known as the internal guide sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ray, zzso zzso Brown, and zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso We have examined this hypothesis, using the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the 3' zzso that weaken this proposed pairing increased use of a downstream cryptic 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso in the guide sequence that restore this pairing resulted in even stronger selection of the normal 3' zzso zzso These changes in 3' zzso site usage were more pronounced in the background of a zzso zzso which resulted in an zzso instead of a zzso being the last base of the zzso These results show that the proposed pairing zzso plays an important role in ensuring that cryptic 3' zzso sites are selected zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso alone did not result in zzso of the cryptic 3' zzso zzso
