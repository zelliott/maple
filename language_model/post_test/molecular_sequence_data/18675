zzso zzso are critical zzso in the cellular zzso of the biologically and zzso important zzso zzso and zzso Recently, these zzso have been cloned and expressed in bacteria for application in the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso have largely relied on the use of zzso methods using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we examine alternative zzso that are more compatible with a zzso zzso A high zzso zzso approach is reported that relies on a coupled zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso using zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso zzso A second liquid zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso acting on structurally defined zzso zzso is also reported that provides additional information on the number and positions of the transferred zzso groups within the zzso Together, these zzso allow quantitative and zzso information to be obtained on zzso that act on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
