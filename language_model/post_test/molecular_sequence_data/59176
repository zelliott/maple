In zzso coli, the products of the zzso zzso and zzso genes are all involved in the processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso We cloned a zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso in a zzso by functional zzso of the zzso sensitivity of an zzso coli strain with zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso region seemed to form a zzso regulated single zzso consisting of zzso while in this region of zzso coli, zzso and zzso form an zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso and these two zzso are split by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were 55, 72 and zzso identical to those of the corresponding zzso coli zzso zzso The individual zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso the corresponding single zzso zzso of zzso coli, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso proteins can interact functionally with their zzso coli zzso partners in forming zzso zzso The sequence alignments of the zzso proteins were extended by incorporation of data about the putative zzso genes obtained from data banks, and the zzso sequences were conspicuously more zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso
