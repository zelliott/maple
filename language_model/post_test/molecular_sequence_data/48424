We have engineered a zzso zzso derived from the hairpin zzso that runs through a cascade of zzso and zzso reactions thereby changing its zzso The first two zzso events leave the resulting zzso with a zzso group and a zzso zzso Thus, upon zzso zzso zzso delivers a zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate formation of zzso resulting from multiple zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the potential of zzso for zzso zzso changes and support the suggestion of zzso zzso being suitable activated building blocks for zzso zzso bond formation in the zzso zzso
