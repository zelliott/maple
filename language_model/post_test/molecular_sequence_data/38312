zzso of zzso initiation appear to be remarkably zzso between zzso and zzso For instance, there is zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles zzso nuclear zzso in zzso composition and at the zzso acid sequence zzso Here, we examine the role of zzso factor B, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso We show that the zzso region of zzso factor B is required for zzso zzso Furthermore, we reveal that zzso of a zzso zzso immediately zzso of the zzso zinc ribbon motif abrogates zzso on certain zzso Finally, we identify the promoter sequences responsive to this zzso and demonstrate that the effect of the zzso is to block a late stage in zzso zzso following formation of the promoter open zzso
