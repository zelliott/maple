Northern elephant seals are naturally adapted to prolonged periods zzso zzso of absolute food and water deprivation zzso In zzso zzso food deprivation stimulates zzso degradation and decreases zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by recycling the zzso degradation products derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso which also promotes zzso zzso The contributions of zzso to zzso recycling during prolonged food deprivation in marine zzso are not well zzso In the present study we cloned and characterized the complete and partial zzso sequences that zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in northern elephant zzso We also measured zzso protein expression and circulating activity, along with zzso and zzso plasma content in zzso northern elephant seal zzso zzso zzso and muscle tissue samples were collected from animals after 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks of their natural zzso zzso The complete zzso and partial zzso zzso sequences are 771 and 345 zzso long and zzso proteins of 218 and 115 zzso zzso respectively, with zzso zzso important for their function and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression increased zzso and zzso with zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso expression increased after 7 weeks in zzso tissue and zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso activities increased during the last 2 weeks of zzso zzso suggest that prolonged zzso in elephant seal zzso is associated with increased capacity to zzso zzso which may contribute to zzso zzso production and enhancing the supply of zzso both of which would be beneficial during prolonged food deprivation and appear to be zzso in this zzso
