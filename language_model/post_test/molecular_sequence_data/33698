Although an zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso has been shown to be required for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso seeds, its direct target genes have not been zzso zzso of zzso zzso a set of genes involved in fatty acid zzso synthesis in zzso including genes for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier protein zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso zzso while expression of these genes is reduced in zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso reporter genes with the zzso sequences upstream from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso was activated by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso bound to these upstream sequences in zzso The seven zzso binding sites shared a sequence zzso where zzso is any zzso designated as the zzso and zzso in zzso near the zzso start site and in the zzso region of zzso abolished zzso by zzso in zzso and expression during seed zzso Although expression of genes for the synthesis of zzso and packaging into oil bodies in the zzso zzso in developing seeds required zzso their expression was not zzso by zzso zzso Thus, zzso promotes the flow of carbon to oil during seed maturation by directly zzso genes involved in zzso synthesis and controlling genes for assembly and storage of zzso
