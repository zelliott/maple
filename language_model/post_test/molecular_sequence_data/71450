zzso sets of random point zzso generated by zzso amplification can be transferred efficiently to the zzso of zzso zzso (also known as strain zzso by natural zzso The technique does not require cloning of zzso fragments in zzso zzso DNA fragments are zzso by cells and directly incorporated into their zzso by zzso zzso Previously such procedures for random zzso could be applied only to zzso genes zzso the selection of zzso zzso Here we describe the construction of a zzso and recipient that allow for zzso recovery, and expression of zzso genes that may lack a positive zzso The zzso carries an zzso zzso segment interrupted by a multiple cloning site next to a zzso resistance zzso The zzso of zzso DNA into the multiple cloning site prepares the insert as a target for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso resistance marker and a zzso region of zzso DNA along with the insert of zzso zzso zzso sequence identity between the zzso regions and corresponding zzso segments in an engineered zzso recipient allows zzso zzso of the zzso DNA fragments into a specific zzso zzso site from which they can be zzso The recipient strain contains only a portion of the zzso resistance zzso so donor DNA containing both this gene and the zzso insert can be selected by demanding growth of zzso in the presence of zzso The effectiveness of the technique was demonstrated with the relatively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After only one round of zzso amplification (35 zzso donor DNA produced zzso of which up to zzso carried a defective zzso gene after growth at 37 degrees zzso Of zzso clones that failed to express zzso at 37 degrees C, about zzso expressed the gene when grown at 22 degrees zzso The techniques described here could be adapted to prepare colonies with an altered function in any gene for which either a selection or a suitable zzso screen zzso
