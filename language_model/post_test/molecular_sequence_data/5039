A novel zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from mantle tissue of the zzso snail zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was removed from the zzso by addition of ammonium zzso The resulting zzso zzso mass zzso zzso was zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the resulting peptides were determined by zzso zzso tandem zzso The protein is zzso at its zzso and consists of 64 zzso zzso 18 of which are zzso zzso A comparison with the zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of the same species shows an identical arrangement of the zzso but an unexpectedly high zzso in the other zzso zzso The two zzso zzso differ in total length and at 26 positions of their zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso zzso from the mantle of zzso zzso is responsible for regulatory functions in zzso of copper, probably in connection with the metabolism of the zzso zzso zzso
