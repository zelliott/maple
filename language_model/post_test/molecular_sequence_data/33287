The members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family are involved in the sensing of zzso zzso including zzso zzso peptides and zzso peptides and zzso We have recently described two zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso blocks the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso for complement zzso zzso while zzso 1 zzso zzso protein zzso blocks the zzso Here, we describe another zzso zzso protein with zzso overall zzso to zzso and identical first 25 zzso which we termed zzso This protein zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso induced by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso While its zzso activity lies in the comparable zzso range of zzso its antagonism of the zzso is approximately zzso more potent than that of zzso and comparable to that of zzso The second zzso zzso was required for its zzso of the zzso but it was zzso for the zzso Furthermore, the deletion of the first seven zzso acids reduced its antagonism of the zzso and the exchange of the first six zzso acids with that of zzso zzso zzso Finally, studies with cells zzso with several zzso receptors confirmed that zzso specifically binds to the zzso and zzso In conclusion, the newly described zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of the zzso and zzso zzso responses and may be used to selectively zzso these zzso zzso
