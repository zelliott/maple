The complete primary and three-dimensional solution structures of zzso A zzso a zzso from zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso studies on zzso produced using zzso labeled zzso derived from zzso zzso grown on sodium zzso and zzso Additional samples of 1 were also generated by separate zzso of zzso and zzso using otherwise zzso zzso The results demonstrate that in addition to having a zzso zzso backbone zzso between N and C zzso three zzso are formed between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of all zzso in 1 except for the three modified ones was confirmed to be L by complete zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso to the constituent zzso zzso and conversion of these to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso at the modified zzso was determined by subjecting each of the eight possible zzso of 1 to eight rounds of zzso structure calculations, starting with the same zzso peak files and zzso The zzso with the zzso zzso at zzso zzso and d zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fit the zzso data, giving the lowest energy family of structures with the best zzso Thus, zzso formation of the unusual zzso links proceeds with net retention of zzso at zzso and inversion at zzso and zzso Model zzso acid derivatives bearing a zzso zzso at the zzso were zzso by reaction of the corresponding zzso compounds with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of their pure zzso and zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that the reduction of such compounds proceeds with zzso in contrast to the previously reported retention of zzso for analogous reaction of zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso A to zzso zzso 14, which is inactive as an zzso agent, occurs with inversion of zzso at the zzso of zzso and zzso and with zzso retention at zzso This indicates that the zzso reaction proceeds via an zzso zzso and that the structure of the surrounding zzso controls the geometry of zzso zzso linkage of a zzso to the zzso of an zzso acid zzso is unprecedented in zzso zzso peptides or zzso and very rare in secondary zzso zzso A zzso represents a new class of zzso
