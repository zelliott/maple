zzso zzso is the agent of zzso zzso It invades and replicates within zzso cells, including aquatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of the zzso interaction with target cells are not fully zzso In an attempt to discover novel zzso factors of zzso zzso we searched for bacterial zzso with zzso zzso Upon screening zzso extracts of virulent zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso activity, which was capable of zzso a zzso zzso in host zzso An approximately zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and subjected to zzso An zzso zzso acid zzso as well as the sequence of an internal zzso allowed us to identify the gene for the zzso within the unfinished zzso zzso zzso zzso The intact gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was zzso and confirmed to possess an zzso activity similar to that of the native zzso We designated this gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not exhibit significant zzso with any known zzso suggesting that it is novel in structure and, perhaps, in zzso Based on zzso data, an zzso zzso and an zzso analysis, the zzso appeared to be zzso in zzso zzso strains but was absent from the other zzso zzso This study represents the first identification of a zzso in an zzso zzso and therefore modification of a zzso zzso by this zzso may influence host cell function and promote zzso zzso zzso
