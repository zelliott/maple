As a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit paradoxical zzso although collectively the zzso display a broad range of zzso zzso individually they are characterized by a high degree of zzso and product zzso Mouse zzso alpha and zzso for example, which are expressed in female liver and male kidney cells, zzso 15 zzso of delta 4 zzso steroids, such as testosterone and zzso of zzso zzso In spite of their divergent zzso activities, however, these zzso differ by only 11 zzso acids within their zzso zzso To determine the structural basis of the different zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso we therefore altered each of these 11 zzso by zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report that the activities of both zzso depend critically on the identities of the zzso acids at positions zzso 209 and 365 and, moreover, that a single zzso in which zzso 209 is zzso by zzso is sufficient to convert the specificity of zzso from zzso to steroid zzso
