The recognition of zzso zzso by the T cell zzso zzso has revealed a wide range of possible zzso Here, using a series of zzso and zzso zzso of the same T cell zzso we find that while the expression of zzso converts weak zzso into full zzso none of the zzso peptides are efficiently recognized as zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso little difference can be seen in the response of zzso and zzso T zzso Together with previous work showing a marked difference in stability between zzso binding to zzso versus zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso engagement occurs after a zzso complex has formed and that it requires a certain minimal zzso of the zzso complex to be fully engaged in zzso
