The major zzso complex genes coding for zzso binding and presenting molecules are the most zzso genes in the zzso zzso We studied the zzso and zzso gene zzso of the family zzso In addition to 11 previously reported zzso and 24 zzso zzso six new zzso sequences and 13 new zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of both zzso and zzso sequences provided evidence for zzso zzso in the family zzso The zzso trees differed from species relationships defined by standard zzso of zzso and from trees based on zzso or neutral gene sequence zzso Analysis of selection showed differences between the less variable zzso and more variable zzso zzso zzso zzso were more often shared by more zzso The zzso sequences zzso showed strong zzso positive zzso the selected zzso acid positions mostly corresponded to selected positions in zzso and human zzso zzso
