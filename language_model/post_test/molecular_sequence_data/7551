zzso of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and a combination of both zzso were produced in a zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha to potentially interfere with the ability of the expressed zzso to act as zzso for zzso zzso Each of these zzso and the zzso protein were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso decreased the degree of zzso of the protein by some zzso compared with the zzso while the double zzso totally failed to incorporate zzso By contrast, in all zzso the zzso expressed zzso zzso alpha incorporated zzso to similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso from these cells were subjected to zzso under conditions which allow resolution of zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso demonstrated that in all cases the zzso expressed zzso zzso alpha was exclusively associated with the particulate zzso as was the zzso and expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, each of the zzso forms of zzso zzso alpha displayed a distribution in which zzso zzso of the expressed protein was present in the particulate fraction and zzso in the zzso To examine the zzso of the particulate expressed forms of zzso zzso zzso these zzso were treated with various zzso of sodium zzso and zzso were subsequently performed on the zzso and remaining particulate zzso Whereas essentially all of the zzso zzso zzso alpha was zzso by treatment with zzso zzso sodium zzso and some 50% with zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso alpha was more recalcitrant to zzso However, that fraction of zzso zzso zzso alpha which was zzso behaved zzso to the zzso zzso zzso alpha on zzso zzso zzso The particulate fraction of the zzso double zzso of zzso zzso alpha was highly resistant to zzso by sodium zzso whereas the particulate zzso of the two single zzso to zzso zzso were intermediate to the zzso and double zzso in their ability to be zzso by this zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso status of the zzso zzso at positions 9 and 10 in zzso zzso alpha plays a central role in defining membrane association of this zzso and indicate that much of the particulate fraction of the expressed zzso zzso is likely to represent zzso rather than correctly folded zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
