A zzso zzso zzso zzso a pancreatic zzso protein zzso was obtained from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso expressed gene zzso The open reading frame specified a protein containing 353 zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain, which contained the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso involved in zzso bridges, and the zzso lid domain, indicated that the protein would be zzso zzso However, zzso lacked the zzso zzso domain present in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso with members of the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso family suggested that zzso was related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso after 25 cycles showed that zzso was expressed at a high level in the zzso and at low levels in zzso and zzso expression was not detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso at different stages of development showed that zzso was expressed at a significantly higher level in the late growth stage than in the ripe and spent zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso metabolism associated with zzso maturation and zzso that occurs during zzso zzso
