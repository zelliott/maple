The theory of classical and cryptic zzso zzso is based mainly on historical changes in temperature, and the zzso are usually defined within a zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso climate zzso zzso was also significantly variable during glacial cycles with important zzso zzso zzso zzso of the European ground zzso zzso was used to interpret the evolutionary and zzso history of the species in Europe and to shed light on its zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso species and the zzso member of the zzso in the zzso zzso We have zzso zzso specimens throughout the present natural range by employing zzso DNA sequences zzso b zzso and 12 nuclear zzso zzso The reconstructed zzso divides the species into two main geographical groups, with deep zzso within both zzso Bulgaria is the zzso of the ancestral area, and it also has the highest genetic diversity within the zzso The northernmost group of the zzso survived in the southern part of zzso throughout several zzso zzso Animals from this population probably repeatedly zzso areas further to the north and west during the glacial zzso while in the zzso zzso the zzso distribution contracted back to this zzso zzso The zzso thus represents a species with a glacial zzso contraction zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are supported as cryptic zzso of zzso climate during zzso zzso
