We analyzed zzso zzso of two zzso genes in rice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso show the same floral zzso and did not affect zzso zzso We show that zzso is a rice zzso zzso zzso In contrast, two strong zzso of the zzso zzso drooping zzso zzso and drooping zzso zzso cause the complete transformation of the zzso into zzso In these strong zzso many zzso zzso are formed in the region where the zzso is produced in the zzso flower and they are arranged in a zzso alternate zzso The intermediate zzso zzso zzso results in an increase in the number of zzso and zzso and zzso occasionally show zzso zzso In the weakest zzso zzso most of the flowers are zzso All four zzso zzso cause zzso drooping zzso The flower of the double zzso zzso zzso produces incompletely differentiated zzso indefinitely after zzso zzso are produced in the position where zzso are formed in the zzso zzso These incompletely differentiated zzso are neither zzso nor zzso but have partial floral zzso Based on genetic and molecular results, we zzso a model of zzso and zzso zzso in rice, with DL as a novel gene controlling zzso identity and acting mutually and zzso to the class B zzso zzso
