zzso A zzso molecules were zzso linked with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed zzso channels, selective for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The main goal of this study was to compare the functional single zzso channel properties of natural zzso and its zzso linked zzso in two different zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso channels with different gating and zzso properties were identified in zzso from the product of zzso zzso The most commonly observed and most stable zzso A zzso is the main object of this zzso This zzso zzso remained in the open state most of the time, with brief closing flickers zzso approximately 30 zzso The frequency of closing flickers increased with zzso potential, making the mean open time moderately zzso dependent zzso changed approximately zzso zzso Such gating behavior is markedly different from what is seen in natural zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso single-channel zzso relationships had an zzso behavior at low zzso and a marked zzso at relatively higher zzso This behavior contrasts with what was previously described in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the linear zzso of single-channel zzso currents at different zzso zzso was essentially the same for both natural and zzso zzso zzso and zzso obtained from fitting experimental points to a zzso zzso zzso were approximately 1500 zzso and 300 zzso respectively, for both the natural zzso and its zzso In zzso zzso however, zzso affinities of zzso and the zzso were significantly lower zzso of approximately 1 and zzso M, respectively), and the zzso higher zzso 1750 and zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Furthermore, the relationship between single-channel zzso and zzso concentration was linear at low bulk zzso of zzso zzso zzso and saturated at zzso of more than 3 zzso It is concluded that 1) The mobility of zzso in zzso A channels in different zzso zzso is remarkably similar to zzso zzso in zzso zzso In particular, at high zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso A channel and in solution differ by only zzso 2) zzso between zzso zzso in zzso A channels in zzso and zzso cannot be explained by surface charge effects on zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso adjacent to the mouth of the pore act as an additional source of zzso for zzso through zzso channels in relation to zzso zzso 3) Some experimental results cannot be zzso with simple zzso in access resistance to zzso flow in zzso zzso Said differences could be explained if the structure and/or dynamics of water molecules inside zzso A channels is modulated by the zzso environment and by modifications in the structure of zzso zzso 4) The zzso ring is probably responsible for the closing flickers seen in the zzso zzso However, other factors can also influence closing zzso
