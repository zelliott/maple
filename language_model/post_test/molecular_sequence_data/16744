The global human zzso virus zzso is characterized by significant genetic diversity in circulating zzso We have recently characterized a group of viruses that form a distinct zzso within the zzso A radiation, which we have designated zzso type 1 zzso zzso A, circulating in West zzso A prospective study of a cohort of female sex workers zzso in zzso zzso over an 18-year period indicated that an zzso sequence in the zzso region of the zzso gene was found in 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso A3 appeared in the zzso population as early as 1988 and continued to be transmitted as of zzso We also found that zzso A3 is not confined to the zzso cohort in zzso but is also circulating in the general population in zzso Furthermore, analyses of viral sequences from a few other West and Central African countries also demonstrated evidence of zzso A3 sequence in zzso from zzso people in Ivory Coast, Nigeria, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, because of the evidence of zzso A3 in the general population in zzso as well as in a few neighboring West and Central African countries, along with the increasing zzso of infection with zzso viruses in the Dakar high-risk zzso population, we feel that zzso zzso A3 viruses are important to distinguish and zzso
