zzso analyses based on zzso zzso zzso sequences were generated from zzso zzso group specimens collected in 29 localities among 9 zzso countries, plus ticks collected in South Africa, Spain, and zzso zzso from Latin America generated six different zzso zzso B, C, D, zzso and zzso zzso analyses generated trees that zzso our tick sequences into two distinct zzso one is represented by zzso zzso and South African zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the second zzso is represented by zzso zzso and European zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso are plotted in the Latin America map according to their geographical zzso it is clearly seen that zzso zzso are restricted to the southern portion of this continent, whereas zzso zzso are distributed in areas between northern Mexico and Brazil (except for the extreme south of this last country, where zzso E was zzso zzso our zzso analyses separated New World specimens of zzso zzso into two distinct zzso one represented by tropical and zzso populations zzso zzso here designated as the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso are here designated as the zzso species because of their distribution in the southern portion of South zzso Until recently, it was assumed that the zzso zzso group was represented by a single species in the New World, namely zzso zzso While the present results coupled with recent studies support the presence of at least two species under the zzso zzso zzso in the New World, they also show that even in the Old World, the zzso zzso zzso might be represented by more than one species, since our zzso analysis zzso European and South African zzso zzso ticks into two distinct zzso The same can be applied for Spanish and South African zzso zzso
