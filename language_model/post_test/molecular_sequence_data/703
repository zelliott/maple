Development of the zzso skeletal muscle is orchestrated by the zzso regulatory factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso which likely arose from the zzso of a single ancestral gene early in zzso zzso We have isolated two zzso genes from Atlantic zzso and examined their differential expression during zzso using quantitative zzso and in zzso zzso to address their functional roles in this zzso organized zzso zzso was initially zzso zzso while zzso zzso was first zzso during zzso The zzso zzso levels predominated throughout zzso and both slow and fast muscle precursor cells displayed the bilateral zzso zzso signal during the formation of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso zzso expressed in the fast muscle zzso The random expression of zzso was not associated with the zzso eye migration and the development of thicker fast skeletal muscle on the zzso side than on the blind zzso The zzso substitution analysis indicated that the zzso zzso essentially have evolved under zzso selection, but a subset of zzso acid sites under strong positive selection were identified in the zzso zzso Altogether, zzso zzso seems to have retained the central role of zzso in driving skeletal zzso whereas the function of zzso is uncertain in this zzso zzso
