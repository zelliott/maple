The hairpin zzso complex contains two independently folding zzso that interact with one another to form a zzso zzso However, little is known about the key structural elements involved in these zzso zzso Here, we report the use of a zzso zzso method to investigate the relative proximity and orientation of the two zzso of the hairpin zzso This method allows the incorporation of a zzso zzso group at specified positions within synthetic zzso zzso was performed following the assembly of four zzso zzso into active zzso zzso Two zzso attachment sites in the zzso binding strand within domain A (between positions zzso and zzso and three in the zzso strand of domain B zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Several zzso between the zzso binding strand and the zzso segment of domain B were zzso All of the photo zzso zzso species were dependent upon proper assembly and folding of the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso base zzso zzso to zzso that prevents the zzso of the two zzso blocks the zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to retain zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the characterized zzso provide important information concerning the alignment of the two zzso and accurately reflect the active zzso zzso of the zzso
