zzso zzso containing zzso have been reported to be extremely weak or inactive as zzso We have recently shown that basic proteins I and II zzso and zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are potent to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In order to ensure such zzso activity of zzso two other zzso from different snake zzso zzso II (from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso II was found to be very active, even more potent than zzso liberating about zzso of zzso acid from zzso zzso was also active (about zzso for zzso zzso They were very weak or almost inactive for zzso zzso and zzso All these zzso were inactive for zzso zzso in the absence of zzso These results clearly demonstrated that zzso are the zzso to zzso the zzso bond of zzso in zzso zzso
