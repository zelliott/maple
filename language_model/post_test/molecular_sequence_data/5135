We have characterized the zzso unit of a zzso zzso gene in the fourth zzso group, zzso We have identified two zzso zzso start sites by zzso zzso The upstream promoter zzso is zzso zzso pairs upstream from the coding region, while the downstream promoter zzso is zzso zzso pairs zzso Both promoters bear a cluster of start zzso Multiple transcripts were identified by Northern zzso originating from both promoters and multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in the neural tube shows an anterior border at the zzso zzso boundary, corresponding to previous reports zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) Development zzso zzso Morrison, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso A more zzso boundary in the central nervous system was observed for zzso zzso We observed strong expression up to zzso 6 and weak expression in zzso 5, zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso Nagy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso acid, expression from zzso in the zzso was zzso after 4 or 24 h of zzso zzso transcripts seemed to be less responsive and/or to have an indirect response to zzso zzso The long zzso region found in all zzso transcripts suggests that translation does not occur by a classical zzso scanning zzso
