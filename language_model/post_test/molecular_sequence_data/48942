A general correlation between neural expression and negative charge in zzso suggests charge represents an adaptation to the neural zzso Interestingly, a notable exception exists in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have different spatial expression patterns in certain zzso one is expressed in all zzso and the second is expressed primarily in the eye and skeletal zzso While the neural zzso zzso is zzso charged, the difference in charge between the two zzso is not as pronounced as that observed in other gene families zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso express a single zzso zzso zzso and it has been demonstrated recently that the pair of zzso found in zzso results from a gene zzso sometime after the separation of zzso and zzso although the exact timing of this zzso has not been zzso zzso analyses suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso occurred during the radiation of zzso fish, consistent with the timing of zzso at other zzso Using zzso zzso acid zzso we examine the pattern of change following the zzso and across the rest of the zzso gene zzso zzso between the zzso gene family and another gene family that shows a larger charge differential among members zzso zzso indicates that the smaller charge difference between zzso zzso is best explained by greater constraint on zzso acid change directly following the duplication, not greater constraint across the entire gene zzso This difference in constraint might result from the wider pattern of expression of the zzso zzso zzso
