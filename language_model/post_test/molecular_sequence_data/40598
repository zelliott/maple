Since zzso is a highly abundant natural zzso many attempts have been made to convert this zzso zzso into commercially valuable products using zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported the structure and function of zzso A from zzso zzso zzso This study zzso reports the identification of two zzso from the same zzso and their detailed functional zzso 

The genes zzso two new members of zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cloned and expressed at a high level in zzso zzso zzso has a molecular mass of 89 zzso and an optimum pH of zzso whereas zzso has a molecular mass of 73 zzso and an optimum pH of zzso The zzso zzso were found to zzso all the natural zzso zzso being zzso more active than zzso zzso analysis by TLC and quantitative zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso in a sequential manner, its highest activity being with zzso zzso modeling of the zzso reaction revealed that binding at zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso binding free energy changes and that the binding pocket of zzso contains four zzso binding zzso designated zzso and zzso 

Two novel zzso were identified as zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso releasing zzso as the end zzso In living cells, these zzso zzso may work after zzso zzso to complete zzso zzso The availability of the two zzso together with the zzso zzso A from the same zzso suggests that a systematic development of the zzso zzso may provide a valuable tool in commercial zzso zzso
