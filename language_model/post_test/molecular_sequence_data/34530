The underlying mechanism of the chronic inflammatory process in zzso is still zzso As a possible trigger, several studies in recent years have suggested that different viruses and bacteria are associated with zzso zzso 

We applied zzso chain reaction to zzso whether zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso DNA could be detected in zzso + cells from 184 patients with zzso documented coronary artery disease zzso zzso patients with stable angina zzso 51 patients with unstable angina zzso and 59 patients with zzso zzso zzso and from 52 healthy zzso 

In two patients (one patient with zzso one patient with zzso with zzso and one healthy control, DNA from zzso was found zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in one patient zzso but not in any controls zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was found in nine patients (three patients with zzso one patient with zzso five patients with zzso and two controls zzso zzso zzso 

Our data do not support the hypothesis that zzso zzso are related to the zzso of human coronary zzso
