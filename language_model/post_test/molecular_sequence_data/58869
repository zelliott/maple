As part of efforts to identify candidate genes for disorders mapped to zzso we have constructed a zzso zzso zzso encompassing five tightly linked markers mapping to this zzso A subset of these zzso was used to identify zzso fragments by the method of hybrid zzso We present here the zzso sequence of one such gene zzso mapping to this zzso The gene is expressed as a zzso transcript predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle, potentially displays alternate zzso and is predicted to zzso a protein 268 zzso acids in zzso zzso spans an estimated 13 zzso of zzso DNA and is split into seven zzso Five of the six zzso conform to the zzso zzso zzso zzso AG consensus for zzso zzso zzso the sixth contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We screened this gene for zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis of both zzso and zzso DNA from a number of unrelated individuals and have identified several sequence variations, two of which cause conservative zzso acid zzso This gene is well zzso zzso with zzso identified in zzso and zzso coli, suggesting that it plays an important role in basic cellular zzso
