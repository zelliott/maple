Changes in zzso zzso levels are involved in the regulation of several plant zzso However, to our knowledge, no regions of genes or specific zzso elements have been shown to be involved in the regulation of plant gene expression by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso is positively zzso in zzso cells zzso but not in zzso cells zzso This gene is highly zzso expressed in zzso zzso versus zzso In zzso transient expression zzso have revealed that exposure of zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso which zzso zzso blocks the zzso of zzso full promoter zzso to + zzso activity in zzso of leaf segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso has no effect on expression in zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso concentration in zzso is required for the enhancement of zzso expression in zzso zzso of the sequence from zzso to zzso completely abolished zzso responsiveness of zzso expression in zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region zzso to zzso relative to the translation start zzso zzso zzso responsiveness on a zzso core promoter: reporter zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is zzso via specific sequences in this short zzso Furthermore, possible involvement of zzso in the signal zzso chain for regulating zzso expression was suggested by the results of inhibitor zzso
