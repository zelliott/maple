The protein zzso family is a prime target for therapeutic agents, since zzso protein zzso activities are linked to myriad zzso zzso a zzso zzso consisting of four rings, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and can be modified to yield potent zzso that are zzso of a desirable pharmaceutical zzso Here, we characterize three zzso zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso more specifically and zzso than zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso potency suggests that better zzso zzso enhanced protection against zzso zzso Crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to each analogue show the zzso loop stabilized in an zzso zzso zzso from important zzso transfer zzso An analogue that zzso the zzso zzso tail has slightly weaker zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso C zzso is illustrated by active site zzso that adopt alternate zzso depending on the zzso zzso On the basis of sequence zzso to zzso a preliminary model of the zzso active site is zzso The zzso zzso serve to test the model and to highlight differences in the active site local environment of zzso and zzso The zzso C zzso appears to tolerate zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso does zzso We attribute this difference in preference to the variable B zzso and zzso zzso By understanding the details of zzso zzso more specific and potent zzso may be designed that differentiate among closely related zzso protein zzso family zzso
