zzso of transforming growth factor alpha zzso zzso is frequently associated with the development of human and animal zzso Using a sensitive zzso zzso which can be applied on zzso zzso zzso we have examined the expression of zzso alpha in 71 human zzso zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso zzso were graded by a zzso grade I zzso low grade zzso grade II zzso zzso zzso and grade III zzso zzso A strong positive correlation between tumor grade and extent of zzso alpha expression was found zzso less than zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify the fourth zzso of the zzso alpha gene of 8 zzso DNA specimens and increasing amounts of normal human DNA, which served as a zzso No amplification of the zzso alpha gene copy number in tumors could be zzso
