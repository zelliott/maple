For the evaluation of zzso by in zzso zzso agents working zzso are difficult to zzso conventional preparations of bacterial zzso tend to vary for different zzso Here we suggest that synthetic zzso zzso derived from bacterial zzso can be used as standards for various in zzso zzso studying B zzso zzso zzso act as potent zzso and zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso In zzso zzso stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and nitrogen oxide zzso they also induce tumor zzso zzso also constitute potent zzso in zzso and in zzso either in combination with or zzso bound to zzso These activities are displayed in various zzso in mice they are found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The novel synthetic zzso described here can be zzso readily in gram amounts with high purity and zzso they are zzso and can be stored for a long time even at room zzso Thus, zzso meet the requirements to serve as effective standards for a multitude of relevant biological zzso
