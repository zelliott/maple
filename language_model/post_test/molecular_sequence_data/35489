zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso zzso making them subject to various zzso and ecological studies, as well as indicators for detecting changes in the marine zzso For all these zzso valid zzso mainly of sibling and cryptic species as well as early life history zzso represents a central zzso In this study, we compare species identification methods for zzso zzso zzso species from the North Sea and adjacent regions in a total of zzso zzso zzso identified specimens were zzso on the basis of zzso sequences zzso partial zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso and complete zzso zzso and on zzso fingerprints using the technology of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso On all three molecular approaches, all specimens were classified to species level indicated by low zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso in both markers revealed a second zzso species for the southern North Sea identified as zzso zzso by zzso sequence comparisons to zzso zzso fingerprints were valid for species clusters irrespective of high zzso zzso including significant differences between early zzso stages and zzso There was no effect of sampling region or time; thus, zzso effect, when zzso the whole organisms, was observed in zzso protein mass zzso underlining the power of this tool in the application on zzso species zzso Because of less sample preparation steps, we recommend zzso zzso using the zzso zzso as an alternative or supplementary approach for zzso cost-effective species zzso
