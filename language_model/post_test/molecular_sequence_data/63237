We had been unsuccessful to amplify desired zzso sequences from various environmental DNA samples by using the inverse zzso chain reaction zzso technique, most probably because the copy numbers of target DNA sequences had been quite zzso To enrich the target DNA sequences prior to zzso a zzso amplification was used with a zzso primer containing locked zzso acids zzso This zzso zzso zzso method increased the sensitivity of zzso almost 10,000 times compared with the standard zzso in model experiments using zzso zzso We then applied the zzso method to isolate zzso zzso genes from zzso extracted from zzso appendixes of horses and zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the target genes were amplified and cloned successfully using zzso whereas standard zzso resulted in no zzso
