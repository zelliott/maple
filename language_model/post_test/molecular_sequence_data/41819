The oxidized form of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso has been studied by two-dimensional zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso protein with 72 zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in bacteria with resistance against zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso space are first scavenged by the zzso zzso then transported into the zzso by the zzso transport protein zzso and finally reduced to elementary zzso mercury by the zzso zzso zzso In this work, the zzso zzso spectrum of oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso has been assigned by using zzso zzso zzso zzso The secondary structure and global fold have been zzso from the nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso The secondary structure comprises four zzso and two zzso in the order beta 1 alpha 1 beta 2 beta 3 alpha 2 beta zzso The protein folds into an zzso zzso beta 2 beta 3 beta 1 beta 4, with the two zzso zzso on one side of the zzso The folding zzso is similar to that of zzso the zzso domain of zzso pancreatic zzso B, the zzso domain of bovine zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A and zzso C zzso However, there is no structural similarity between zzso and other bacterial zzso binding zzso
