The zzso box is a key upstream control element for zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso III in some zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher plants, but not in others such as the budding zzso zzso zzso To gain information on this differential zzso box requirement, we examined side-by-side the in zzso zzso properties of zzso and zzso plant and zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso systems from both organisms and in a hybrid system in which zzso zzso was replaced by its plant zzso The data support the general conclusion that specific features of the plant zzso machinery, rather than upstream region architecture per se, are responsible for the much stronger zzso box dependence of the plant zzso In both systems, however, a strong influence of the zzso box on zzso start site selection was zzso This was particularly striking in the case of plant zzso where zzso upstream regions were found to zzso the use of alternative initiation zzso Replacement of zzso zzso with its plant counterpart did not zzso any general zzso box responsiveness to the zzso zzso zzso zzso involving components other than zzso are thus responsible for the strong zzso box requirement of plant zzso zzso
