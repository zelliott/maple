A zzso tree of zzso including marine zzso zzso and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus zzso was developed based on the zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso segment zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso acid sequences were very similar, with identities of zzso zzso unique zzso acid zzso were found in the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso gene of zzso zzso The zzso tree based on the zzso sequence of zzso segment A and zzso sequences showed that 31 zzso strains were clustered into seven zzso All zzso strains isolated in Japan and Korea were clustered into one zzso which was distinct from other zzso The seventh zzso containing all zzso strains showed zzso acid sequence similarities of zzso with other zzso In zzso four unique zzso were found in zzso strains when compared with zzso zzso The zzso strains exhibited zzso acid sequence similarities of zzso with zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso were zzso among zzso zzso but differed from those of zzso zzso The zzso strains isolated from different host species and different geographical areas were very similar to each other, suggesting that the zzso are distinct from the other zzso
