The gal locus from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Four genes were identified by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The coding direction of zzso zzso and zzso is divergent from that of zzso There are zzso zzso regions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso constructed in zzso and zzso which is in zzso were moved into the zzso zzso zzso generating each of the single zzso as well as the double gal zzso Even when grown on complex media, the double zzso failed to react with an zzso zzso zzso known to react with a zzso zzso Both the zzso single and the zzso zzso double zzso were zzso and relatively zzso in infant rats, indicating a critical role for zzso zzso and providing evidence to support a central role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
