zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso and zzso coli at zzso The zzso induced stable surface pressure changes in zzso formed from zzso zzso native zzso extract zzso zzso but transient pressure changes in corresponding zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which led to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the extracts were used to generate zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicated membrane zzso by zzso zzso via a mechanism dependent upon the zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso coli zzso indicated membrane zzso by the zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso levels present and appeared to involve a mechanism resembling those used by zzso zzso These data zzso that zzso analysis of zzso must consider not only their structural characteristics but also the zzso zzso of the target microbial zzso
