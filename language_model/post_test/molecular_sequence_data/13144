zzso an zzso zzso acid amplification system was used for identification of zzso zzso A primer set and a zzso probe were selected from the zzso zzso zzso The probe was shown to zzso specifically to the amplified zzso zzso of zzso zzso No zzso occurred with amplification product of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity for the zzso zzso was determined at zzso zzso The possibility of using the zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso in foods after a zzso enrichment procedure was zzso zzso was compared to a modified zzso method and zzso for detection of zzso zzso artificially zzso zzso zzso zzso in eight food zzso zzso results were obtained with the modified zzso method zzso zzso and zzso were shown in this study to detect the pathogen with equal efficiency (no false negative or false positive zzso Both methods allowed detection of less than 10 zzso g within 3 days but zzso can only be used for diagnosis of zzso zzso while the zzso procedure permitted specific identification of the human pathogen zzso zzso
