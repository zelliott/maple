The zzso zzso of T zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso are expected to fold into similar three-dimensional structures because of their identical protein domain organization, the conservation of key zzso and their overall sequence zzso However, T cells mostly appear to recognize short zzso zzso bound to zzso class I or class II presenting zzso A complete model of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructed from the zzso coordinates was used to investigate the putative organization of a zzso zzso In this article, zzso zzso and co-workers show that the respective zzso of a zzso zzso structure and of the zzso zzso binding site suggest a model where the third variable regions of both chains of the zzso mainly interact with the zzso zzso while the first and/or second less variable regions are in position for making contact with zzso pointing up from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso regions of the zzso zzso
