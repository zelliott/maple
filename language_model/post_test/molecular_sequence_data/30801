zzso instability is characteristic of regulatory proteins whose in zzso zzso must vary as a function of zzso The cell zzso alpha 2 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is shown here to have a zzso of only approximately 5 zzso Each of the two structural zzso of alpha 2 carries a sequence that can independently target a normally zzso protein for rapid zzso Moreover, these two degradation signals are shown to operate via distinct zzso zzso deficient in the degradation of alpha 2 have been isolated and found to have a number of additional zzso indicating that the pathways responsible for alpha 2 turnover include components with multiple zzso Finally, we demonstrate that a short-lived zzso of an zzso protein can be zzso in zzso without zzso other, zzso zzso of the same zzso This zzso degradation makes possible a novel type of zzso zzso in which a zzso protein could be functionally modified by selective, zzso replacement of its zzso
