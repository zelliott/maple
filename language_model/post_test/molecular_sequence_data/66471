zzso acid zzso zzso is a key intermediate in zzso bacterial pathways that are responsible for the metabolism of a large number of aromatic zzso The critical step of these pathways is the zzso reaction zzso by zzso zzso which opens the aromatic ring of zzso to form zzso From zzso acid, the cell derives carbon and energy through the conversion of zzso to central zzso We have confirmed the zzso of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso coli strain and present the first structural characterization of this family of zzso The identity of the reaction product was revealed using tandem mass zzso The zzso responsible for the degradation of zzso in this zzso exhibits a high degree of conservation with the zzso zzso of other zzso bacteria, including the zzso zzso zzso coli zzso but does not appear to be present in zzso zzso The acquisition of the zzso zzso may represent a special adaptation to meet carbon source requirements under conditions of environmental stress and may provide a selective advantage for zzso zzso coli relative to their zzso zzso
