The discovery and zzso of factors governing innate immune responses in insects has driven the zzso of many immune system components in zzso and other zzso Focusing on the immune system responses of the malaria zzso zzso zzso has uncovered an array of components and mechanisms involved in zzso against pathogen zzso Two of these immune factors are zzso and zzso which are zzso repeat zzso containing proteins that activate zzso zzso responses against malaria zzso In addition to their zzso zzso these zzso repeat immune zzso proteins share several structural features including signal zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The identification and zzso of genes related to zzso and zzso revealed zzso novel innate immune factors and furthered the understanding of their likely molecular zzso zzso scans using the shared features of zzso and zzso identified more than 20 zzso genes exhibiting all or most of their sequence features in each of three zzso mosquitoes with zzso zzso zzso zzso Aedes zzso and zzso zzso Comparative sequence analyses revealed that this family of zzso zzso genes is zzso by a variable number of 6 to 14 zzso of different zzso The zzso zzso zzso with 10 or more zzso and the zzso zzso with 6 or 7 zzso also share the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence features of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso have a predicted zzso zzso region, and the zzso zzso exhibit the characteristic zzso sequence signatures but lack the zzso zzso zzso 

The evolutionary plasticity of the zzso zzso zzso may provide templates for diverse recognition properties, while their zzso zzso could be involved in the formation of zzso protein complexes or mediate interactions with other immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns are likely to be important for structural fold stability and the formation of protein zzso These zzso relations of zzso zzso will serve to guide the experimental zzso of their molecular roles in zzso zzso
