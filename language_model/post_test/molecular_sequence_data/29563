zzso zzso derived zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso that is related in sequence to the zzso zzso zzso common gamma zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso alpha chain to form the zzso for zzso zzso derived zzso a zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso from rat and find that the zzso motif commonly found in zzso zzso of zzso receptors is zzso as a zzso motif among zzso receptors from zzso rat and zzso As in the zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in rats suggesting that zzso may have roles in signaling outside the zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in all zzso species zzso The absence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is similar to the expression of several other zzso receptors that have been characterized thus zzso We have also characterized the zzso structure of the zzso zzso gene which shows that in addition to primary sequence zzso it shares a common zzso organization of coding zzso with the zzso zzso zzso common gamma chain zzso Use of an alternative zzso zzso site leads to two alternatively spliced transcript zzso of zzso zzso both of which are functional zzso Finally, using linkage analysis, we mapped the zzso zzso gene to mouse zzso 5 between the zzso and zzso zzso
