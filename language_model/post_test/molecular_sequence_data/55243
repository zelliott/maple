In this work, evidence for a critical role of zzso zzso protein zzso 1 gamma zzso in proliferation and attachment of the zzso to the zzso cell is zzso zzso proliferation and attachment of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells was blocked by zzso A zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso it was demonstrated that the zzso activity of native and zzso zzso proteins was inhibited by zzso zzso reverse genetic studies confirmed that zzso zzso targeted to zzso but not zzso or zzso inhibited proliferation and attachment of zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso including a lack of zzso typical zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could be regulated by a zzso zzso where the role of zzso could not be ruled zzso Analysis of zzso distribution of zzso by cell zzso and electron zzso demonstrated the association between zzso and the zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso at the cell surface was also inhibited by zzso The zzso zzso of expression of zzso and changes in the zzso in zzso zzso suggest a specific role for zzso zzso zzso in the early stages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed the conservation of zzso critical for maintaining proper folding into the gross structure common to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso could be considered a potential novel drug target for treatment of zzso
