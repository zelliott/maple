In previous studies it has been shown that the bacterial zzso zzso zzso an initial burst of inflammatory zzso synthesis in human zzso which is followed by substantial zzso zzso the zzso then zzso the inflammatory zzso production as well as zzso production zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso production in human zzso is under control of one of the zzso induced by zzso zzso we zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso with a panel of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso and then measured zzso zzso production using a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso We found that zzso had a major effect on zzso zzso production, inducing a zzso to zzso increase over baseline zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso had little effect zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso was dose dependent and began between 8 and 24 h after the addition of zzso this suggests that the increased zzso zzso level was due to de zzso zzso synthesis rather than zzso zzso this latter finding was zzso by zzso time course studies, which showed that the zzso of zzso was less than 1 h and was not significantly altered by zzso These studies concerning zzso zzso induction by zzso were zzso by studies of zzso protein zzso zzso alone, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso substantial zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso a large amount of zzso zzso that is largely inhibited zzso to zzso by zzso but not by zzso to other inflammatory zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso is unique among the inflammatory zzso in its role as an zzso of zzso in human zzso as such, it zzso a zzso that provides negative feedback to its own zzso
