In this work four different types of zzso to zzso membrane protein of zzso zzso cartilage zzso proteins zzso and heat shock proteins zzso were tested in order to find an available clinical laboratory method for diagnostic and monitoring purposes in patients suffering from zzso From the point of view of diagnostic efficiency, the zzso of zzso level to zzso seemed to be the best and as a supplementary method the determination of zzso factor was zzso The zzso zzso zzso is less sensitive, anti zzso zzso are not zzso In spite of zzso zzso between zzso and cartilage zzso component the zzso level against zzso has no correlation with zzso The appearance of zzso reaction, zzso against different cartilage specific zzso and zzso membrane zzso is an zzso however as the supposed immune complexes, trapped in a cartilage, play an important role in the damage of cartilage which may explain the zzso and chronic nature of cartilage degradation on zzso
