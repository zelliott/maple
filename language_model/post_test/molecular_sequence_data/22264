Human zzso is a zzso zzso unique in its ability to bind both zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso binding has been implicated as a regulator of zzso binding function of mouse zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and compared its zzso binding properties in relation to zzso effects with that of human zzso Human zzso exhibits a stable zzso state and binds zzso targets, all of which get attenuated when zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a stable zzso state that assembles into a zzso zzso form and fails to bind zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly enough, CD spectral zzso partial zzso zzso profile revealed zzso zzso changes in human zzso whereas the same were largely missing in zzso zzso zzso zzso delineated specific heat changes associated with zzso binding in human zzso which invoked zzso zzso in its zzso the same effect was absent in zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as a specific molecular zzso that zzso the zzso acid binding function selectively in human zzso perhaps by affecting its zzso zzso
