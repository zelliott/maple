The human zzso A beta gene sequence was inserted in an zzso coli expression zzso zzso The zzso coli cells transformed with this zzso produced proteins with molecular masses of 52 and 50 zzso These products bound zzso zzso with an affinity constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso The order of affinity for zzso zzso was zzso acid greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso zzso labeling experiments showed that the 50 zzso protein was zzso labeled with zzso and this was zzso by zzso acid, zzso and zzso (from potent to weaker zzso The zzso A protein bound to calf zzso zzso and the binding was inhibited by zzso M zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso A product became less zzso upon zzso or zzso acid zzso The same finding was obtained when zzso bound to partially zzso rat liver nuclear zzso hormone zzso However, zzso binding zzso became more zzso upon zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso zzso into the upper zzso zzso phase, the zzso of zzso behavior of zzso binding zzso was explained by a simple additive effect of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso behavior of the zzso A product or zzso reflected a zzso transition upon zzso zzso The zzso A protein expressed in zzso coli showed various characteristics similar to classical zzso hormone zzso and may be useful in studying the structure and function of the zzso hormone zzso
