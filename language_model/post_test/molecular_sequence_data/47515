Two putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recently discovered in the complete zzso sequence of zzso tuberculosis zzso Here, we show that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso that binds oxygen zzso with very high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 degrees zzso because of a fast combination zzso zzso and a slow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso kinetic zzso along with zzso studies, reveal that the stabilization of the bound oxygen is achieved through a zzso at the B10 position in the zzso pocket of the zzso with a zzso that is unique among the zzso zzso studies performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the expression of zzso is greatly enhanced during the stationary phase in zzso cultures but not under conditions of limited oxygen zzso The results suggest that, zzso the primary role of zzso may be to protect the zzso against zzso nitrogen species produced by the host zzso
