The gene zzso zzso an zzso neutral zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso was zzso The deduced open reading frame zzso 550 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso with a putative signal sequence of 34 zzso at the N zzso zzso zzso mapping identified the zzso start point at about zzso zzso upstream from the start zzso The zzso sequences at both zzso and zzso regions resemble the consensus sequence of typical zzso coli promoters and a zzso containing the promoter was functional in an zzso coli promoter probe zzso In zzso zzso and translation of the cloned zzso sequence revealed a zzso protein product, correlated with the sequence data but not with the size (35 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence in conjunction with the zzso composition analyses on the zzso mature zzso led to the conclusion that it was processed from the zzso zzso form zzso by zzso The zzso zzso contained putative zinc zzso regions and two repeated zzso zzso similar to the active site zzso of the zzso acid and zzso zzso
