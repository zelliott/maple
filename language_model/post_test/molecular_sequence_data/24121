zzso the molecular mechanisms that zzso regulation of zzso of the human zzso zzso gene zzso may help to clarify several zzso such as zzso evolution of organ damage, zzso and zzso and immune response, in which zzso zzso is zzso With the aim to evaluate zzso with functional effect on transcription, we have analyzed the promoter region and focused our investigation on three common zzso present in the first 500 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso of zzso carrying the four most frequent zzso relative to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso fused to the zzso reporter gene in a panel of different cell lines showed that one zzso zzso a significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression in all tested cell zzso We describe that the zzso zzso zzso the binding affinity for the zzso zzso factors, the zzso zzso is included in a yet zzso zzso binding site, and the zzso zzso causes differential binding of an unknown zzso The finding of differential effects of various combination of zzso in zzso may contribute to explain data of association studies reported in several already published zzso Future association studies using zzso instead of single zzso zzso will allow to achieve more accurate results zzso to differential expression of zzso in several common diseases, in which zzso is considered a candidate zzso zzso
