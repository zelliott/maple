zzso diseases have been considered to be one of the main causes of zzso zzso To explore the role of the zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso system in a zzso zzso model, we primarily studied the full-length zzso and the three-dimensional zzso structures of the important zzso zzso of the zzso 

The full-length zzso of zzso zzso was obtained by zzso monkey liver zzso library screening and a zzso zzso The 3-D protein structure was modeled using the zzso zzso The important zzso interaction sites were compared with human and zzso zzso 

At first, the full-length zzso zzso zzso was zzso the sequence was submitted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso is zzso zzso with a complete open reading frame of 1884 zzso coding zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence contains a signal zzso zzso zzso domain, two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso similarities of zzso and zzso genes are zzso and zzso and those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some important functional sites, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso site, are highly zzso However, among the three species some variations are observed in potential zzso zzso zzso zzso site, zzso zzso zzso the zzso loop shows great differences in both zzso acid sequence and 3-D zzso 

The great similarity of zzso among zzso human, and zzso confirmed the great value of the zzso zzso zzso The variation especially in some important recognition sites between zzso and pig would vary the binding affinity of zzso to zzso and their reaction zzso in zzso zzso zzso which would be one possible reason for the zzso regulation of zzso seen during the zzso in animal zzso
