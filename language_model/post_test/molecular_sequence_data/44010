We have cloned an zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the determined zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids split with three zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence was nearly identical to that of the zzso previously zzso The cloned gene was introduced into zzso zzso and its expression in the zzso was shown to be regulated by the carbon sources in the zzso suggesting that a common regulatory expression system is shared by these two species as is the case of other zzso zzso of zzso zzso
