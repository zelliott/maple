zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to act as a second zzso to recruit regulatory proteins to the plasma membrane via their zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in the human disease zzso zzso has been shown to interact with zzso in zzso In this study, a fusion protein containing the zzso domain of zzso and the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was constructed and zzso to study the ability of this zzso domain to interact with membrane zzso zzso inside living zzso The zzso of expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells was indistinguishable from that of zzso alone, both being zzso as assessed by zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso growth factor or zzso zzso growth factor receptors caused a rapid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso membrane zzso This response was not observed in cells expressing zzso only and was completely inhibited by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused membrane zzso of zzso that was slowly reversed by zzso When the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, which causes zzso zzso was introduced into the fluorescent zzso no zzso was observed after zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which zzso transforming activity to native zzso caused significant membrane zzso of zzso with characteristics indicating its possible binding to zzso This zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results show in intact cells that the zzso domain of zzso binds selectively to zzso lipids after zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that losing such binding ability or specificity results in gross abnormalities in the function of the zzso zzso the interaction with zzso is likely to be an important zzso of the zzso regulation of zzso and can be zzso to zzso the dynamics and zzso organization of changes in this zzso in living zzso
