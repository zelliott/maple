zzso zzso hybrids zzso prime the initiation of replication in zzso coli zzso The zzso are resolved by zzso coli zzso zzso a Holliday junction specific zzso A stable zzso hybrid formation in the zzso zzso region is also implicated in zzso the replication of zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the zzso zzso formed by in zzso zzso are located close to the initiation sites of the zzso DNA zzso This zzso zzso is resolved by zzso in a zzso zzso Since the resolution by zzso requires zzso the resolution is dependent on the zzso activity of zzso A linear zzso zzso is not resolved by zzso suggesting that zzso specifically recognizes the higher structure of the zzso zzso This is the first example that zzso of an zzso origin is sensitive to a zzso zzso The resolution of the zzso zzso by zzso suggests that the zzso zzso have a common structural feature recognized by zzso
