The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso potato virus Y strain N zzso was obtained from cloned zzso This sequence is zzso zzso long and can zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The positions of the zzso sites at the N zzso of the zzso and zzso inclusion proteins have been zzso Other putative protein zzso sites have been deduced by searching for consensus sequences and by zzso with the zzso of the tobacco vein zzso virus and of the tobacco etch zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with that of other zzso zzso shows similarities in zzso organization and a high level of identity along most of the zzso except for the putative proteins zzso the helper zzso A search for specific protein motifs has revealed the existence of a potential zzso site at the putative N zzso of the helper component in zzso The possible functions of this structure are zzso
