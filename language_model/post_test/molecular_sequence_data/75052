The B1 zzso zzso is a Mr zzso zzso on the surface of human B zzso that may serve a central role in the zzso immune response by regulating zzso proliferation and zzso In this report, a zzso clone that encodes the B1 zzso was isolated and the zzso acid sequence of B1 was zzso zzso zzso clones were selected from a human zzso zzso library by differential zzso with labeled zzso derived from either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Of the 261 zzso clones isolated, 3 zzso zzso clones were chosen as potential candidates for zzso B1 based on their selective zzso to zzso from zzso cell zzso The longest zzso zzso contained a zzso insert with an zzso open reading frame that encodes a protein of 33 zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso clone in zzso was translated into a protein of the same apparent molecular weight as zzso Limited zzso zzso of the zzso translation product and B1 generated peptides of the same sizes, indicating that the zzso zzso encodes the B1 zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso with two zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso only in zzso cell zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso sequence apparently lacks a signal sequence and contains three extensive zzso zzso The deduced B1 zzso acid sequence shows no significant zzso with other known zzso
