The zzso and human zzso genes regulate the zzso cell cycle but are not yet known to be required for zzso Nine zzso zzso zzso have been uncovered and are named zzso through zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a male sterile zzso zzso and show that the zzso zzso was caused by a Ds zzso zzso into the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso abnormal zzso exhibit a range of zzso Furthermore, during zzso male zzso although zzso zzso pairing appeared normal at zzso I, zzso segregation at zzso I is zzso and some zzso are zzso zzso zzso in zzso at least some zzso remain associated after zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso at both zzso I and early zzso I is zzso thus, the abnormal zzso segregation is not likely caused by a zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso is required for targeting specific proteins for zzso zzso we propose that zzso controls zzso separation by degrading or otherwise removing a protein that is required directly or indirectly for zzso association before zzso zzso
