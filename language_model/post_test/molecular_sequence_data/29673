The zzso blood group system consists of two antithetical zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Joseph zzso zzso and zzso have an unusual zzso zzso All zzso zzso are zzso but not all zzso zzso are zzso The molecular background associated with zzso and zzso zzso is zzso 

DNA from 18 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 13 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso and zzso revealed 323 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes on a zzso background zzso associated with the zzso zzso The sister of the original zzso zzso and the majority of samples had an additional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso others had zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso there is a 350 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso change on a zzso background zzso 

The results provide an explanation for the variation in typing results in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and the weakening of zzso in the zzso zzso may be due to the close proximity of these zzso The zzso zzso zzso within the sequence motif for zzso linkage, may cause reduced efficiency of zzso the protein to the zzso zzso thereby weakening the expression of zzso and zzso
