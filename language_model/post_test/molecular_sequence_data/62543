The predicted zzso domain of the zzso protein of African zzso fever virus zzso shares significant similarity to that of the zzso protein in T cells but has a unique zzso domain of unknown zzso Here we have shown that zzso is expressed as a zzso of approximately 105 zzso in zzso zzso In the absence of an zzso zzso the majority of zzso appears to zzso to zzso membrane zzso Furthermore, we have shown using the zzso zzso system and by direct binding studies that the zzso tail of zzso binds to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which has been reported to be involved in diverse cellular functions such as zzso transport and signal zzso A zzso clone zzso a zzso form of zzso could also be identified and was found to be expressed in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso repeats of sequence zzso in the zzso zzso protein to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the zzso domain of zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso in areas surrounding the zzso virus zzso These areas also stained with an zzso that recognizes a zzso network zzso indicating that they contained zzso derived from the zzso zzso Our data provide a first molecular basis for the understanding of the zzso functions of zzso in zzso zzso
