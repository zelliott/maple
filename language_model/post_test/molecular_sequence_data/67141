In this study, we zzso and zzso characterized a zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso from strain zzso exhibited high activity at 0 degrees C, and its optimum temperature and pH were 10 degrees C and zzso zzso It was possible to zzso the zzso rapidly at 45 degrees C in 5 zzso The zzso was able to zzso zzso as a zzso as well as zzso zzso the zzso values with zzso and zzso being calculated to be zzso zzso and 50 zzso respectively, at 10 degrees zzso Moreover, the zzso gene zzso the zzso of strain zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso gene consists of a zzso open reading frame corresponding to a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the gene product derived from zzso had several zzso regions for zzso zzso family 2, zzso the zzso zzso 2 zzso sugar binding domain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso barrel domain, zzso signature 1, and several other zzso zzso zzso From these facts, we conclude that the zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso which is a new member of zzso zzso family 2, is a zzso zzso that is extremely heat zzso and could have advantageous applications in the food zzso
