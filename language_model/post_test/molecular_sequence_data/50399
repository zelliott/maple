zzso analysis revealed a striking sequence similarity between the putative zzso protein zzso zzso by open reading frame zzso 5 of beet zzso zzso and the coat protein of this virus zzso by the adjacent zzso Both of these proteins are closely related to the zzso proteins of another zzso citrus zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the genes for coat protein and its zzso tandem copy have evolved by zzso zzso analysis using various methods for tree generation suggested that the zzso was already present in the zzso of the common zzso of the two zzso The genes for zzso and coat protein of beet zzso zzso were zzso zzso and translated in zzso yielding products of the expected zzso It was shown that zzso is translated starting from the first of the two alternative zzso zzso located near the zzso zzso of zzso The presence of a single protein species in beet zzso zzso zzso and the near identity of the zzso acid composition of this protein with the composition of the zzso but not the zzso product indicated that zzso is not a major zzso zzso Most of the zzso acids that are zzso in the coat proteins of zzso viruses of plants are retained also in zzso These observations suggest that zzso may share some structural and functional features with the coat protein but probably fulfills a distinct function in virus zzso
