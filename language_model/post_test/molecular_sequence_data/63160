Here we describe a zzso zzso the second zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso tick zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all the zzso stages of the zzso localized mainly in the zzso zzso and was zzso by the host zzso process, as demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso and real-time zzso showed that the zzso gene was expressed at a lower level during all zzso of zzso than our previously characterized zzso zzso gene from the same zzso More zzso there was no expression of zzso zzso beyond 96 h of zzso while zzso zzso expression continued until full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso the zzso synthetic zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and zzso and also by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso and exhibited strict specificity for the zzso bonds on the zzso side of a zzso as demonstrated by internal zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso bovine serum zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso together with zzso plays a pivotal role in host zzso zzso zzso
