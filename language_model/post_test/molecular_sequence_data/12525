zzso zzso zzso zzso 8-8 displays high zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso compounds, including zzso zzso products such as zzso The zzso efficiency of the related class Alpha zzso 1-1 is substantially lower with the same zzso zzso zzso were prepared by replacing zzso zzso 8 segments of different lengths zzso 25, or 100 zzso with corresponding sequences from zzso 1 using zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing 25 zzso acid zzso from zzso 1, had the same low activity with zzso zzso as that displayed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso in zzso gave rise to the high zzso activity characteristic of zzso 8, showing the importance of zzso acid zzso 12 for the zzso However, other structural zzso are also essential, as demonstrated by the corresponding zzso zzso in zzso 1, which did not afford high zzso zzso The results show that a single point zzso in a zzso zzso may give rise to a zzso increase in zzso efficiency with certain zzso Introduction of such zzso may have contributed to the biological evolution of zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso and may also find use in the engineering of zzso for novel zzso
