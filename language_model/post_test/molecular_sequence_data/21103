zzso relations for small zzso zzso gene zzso were zzso for the zzso zzso and some of its zzso targets in zzso zzso Numerous zzso of zzso and its targets were generated and their in zzso functions characterized at various levels of target and zzso zzso Although a core complementary region is required for repression by zzso variations in the complementary sequences of the core region gave rise to a zzso of repression strengths, correlated zzso with the zzso free energy of zzso duplex zzso Moreover, sequence variations in the zzso region known to interact with the zzso zzso zzso also gave rise to a zzso of repression strengths, correlated zzso with the zzso energy cost of keeping the zzso region zzso These results support the zzso of the zzso model in predicting zzso interaction and suggest that sequences at these locations may be used to fine-tune the degree of zzso Surprisingly, a truncated zzso without the zzso region is found to repress multiple targets of the zzso zzso zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso even though the former is required for the activity of zzso zzso zzso These findings challenge the commonly accepted model concerning the function of zzso in gene zzso in providing stability to the zzso and in catalyzing the target zzso to take on active zzso raise the intriguing question of why many zzso zzso subject their functions to zzso
