zzso is produced by the zzso degradation of zzso and by the degradation of dietary zzso by zzso It enters the pathways of zzso metabolism by the action of zzso zzso In this study we report the isolation and characterization of a zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso base pairs encodes zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence contains matches of the sequences of eight peptides derived from zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was functionally expressed in zzso coli zzso cells, where it displays zzso zzso activity as well as zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of human zzso zzso was derived from the zzso sequences of several expressed sequence zzso An open reading frame of zzso base pairs encodes 344 zzso acids and a protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso between human and zzso zzso zzso were zzso on the zzso level and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso and human zzso zzso show sequence similarities to other sugar zzso and all five sequence motifs necessary for the binding of zzso by sugar zzso are zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso revealed an ubiquitous occurrence of the zzso and a very high expression in zzso The size of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso in all zzso investigated, with the exception of zzso where it was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was continuously expressed during mouse zzso zzso of the human zzso was expressed in all investigated human zzso as well as in cancer cell zzso In both the zzso and the cancer cell lines, the human zzso was zzso zzso in zzso
