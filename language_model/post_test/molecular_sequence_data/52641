The first structural analysis of zzso factor G zzso from a zzso zzso is zzso zzso is an essential protein involved in the zzso process during protein synthesis and is therefore thought to play a crucial role in the zzso adaptation of zzso zzso To define its importance, the zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The deduced primary structure of the zzso factor is composed of 700 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of the protein was constructed based on the known crystal structures of structurally zzso zzso zzso features that might potentially be important for activity and flexibility at low temperature were deduced by comparisons with models of the zzso proteins from the closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These features include a loss in the number of salt bridges in zzso and zzso positions, increased zzso interactions zzso by greater charge and polarity on domain surfaces, loop zzso loss of zzso zzso in loop structures, and an increase of zzso in core zzso zzso changes have also been identified in the zzso domain zzso zzso and sites of potential zzso interaction, which may directly affect zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates at low zzso
