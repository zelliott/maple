Identification of the zzso activated targets of zzso zzso zzso is critical to understanding zzso programs directing both normal and zzso zzso To zzso these molecular zzso we identified genes induced by a potent zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso Using differential display reverse zzso chain reaction technology, we isolated a novel growth zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript induction occurred within 60 zzso in zzso zzso zzso and proceeded in the presence of zzso zzso induction of the zzso transcript occurred between 8 and 16 zzso concurrent with passage of zzso through zzso zzso message was zzso induced by zzso AA and zzso and zzso and basic zzso growth factors, all strong zzso of zzso zzso but not by zzso growth factor and zzso In a zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso transcript induction strictly correlated with zzso zzso Isolation and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso zzso a zzso protein required for zzso processing and zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to rescue a zzso zzso zzso implicating zzso in the process of zzso zzso zzso with this result, zzso was localized to the zzso in both zzso and zzso Thus, zzso may provide a link between growth factor zzso zzso and the cellular zzso zzso
