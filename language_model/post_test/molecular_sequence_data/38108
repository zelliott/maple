zzso assembled from the products of a zzso zzso zzso gene cluster depend on these genes being zzso regulated in particular populations of zzso Little is known, however, about the zzso mechanisms that are likely to zzso their zzso in correct zzso cell zzso We have identified several regulatory elements and zzso factors that influence zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The promoters of these genes appear to contain a common zzso element that binds zzso zzso zzso They can be activated by the zzso factor zzso and zzso does not require zzso binding zzso Between these two promoters is a cell type specific zzso called zzso This zzso has little activity in zzso cells and is zzso active in particular populations of central zzso The clustered genes are potential targets of zzso factors as the zzso domain factor, zzso can activate zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso and its location suggest that it is a component of the zzso regulatory information required to control expression of the zzso and zzso genes in specific populations of zzso
