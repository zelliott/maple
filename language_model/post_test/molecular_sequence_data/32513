We have zzso an zzso mouse zzso zzso II inhibitor alpha protein zzso in zzso coli and demonstrate that the zzso protein is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso II zzso in zzso However, zzso raised against zzso zzso react with an approximately zzso protein present in mouse zzso The pattern of expression of the approximately zzso protein is similar to that of zzso zzso as both are expressed in normal but not Japanese encephalitis virus zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the approximately zzso protein is present in the zzso density zzso where zzso is known to perform key regulatory zzso We conclude that the approximately zzso protein identified in this study is zzso and its zzso in the zzso indicates a novel role for this protein in the regulation of zzso zzso
