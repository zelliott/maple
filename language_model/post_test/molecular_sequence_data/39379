The zzso oriented zzso integral membrane protein zzso forms zzso zzso and associates with zzso zzso To characterize the zzso that are involved in zzso and zzso membrane zzso association, we expressed zzso and point zzso of zzso and analyzed their size and zzso by zzso zzso A small zzso region of zzso that is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be crucial for zzso whereas the zzso domain zzso zzso and the last 12 zzso zzso acids zzso zzso were not zzso The introduction of zzso zzso in the region zzso resulted in the appearance of zzso zzso only three of these zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be indispensable for the zzso zzso Interestingly, the exchange of zzso and to some extent the zzso zzso which are essential for zzso did not affect the zzso association of zzso This suggests that the formation of zzso is not necessary for the association of zzso with zzso Internal deletions near the membrane zzso domain resulted in the formation of intermediate size zzso suggesting a zzso zzso of large parts of the zzso zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein and wild type zzso zzso showed a significantly higher lateral mobility of the zzso zzso in the plasma membrane suggesting a membrane interaction of the respective zzso region also in zzso
