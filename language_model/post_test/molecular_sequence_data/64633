zzso zzso to the zzso probe, a zzso of DNA derived from the rice blast fungus zzso zzso carrying zzso repeat zzso sequences and 30 zzso direct repeats were identified in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso species by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and slot zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso probe revealed zzso signals with zzso zzso from various pine and spruce zzso Further analyses indicated that the copy number of the zzso motif was higher than 5 zzso zzso per plant zzso for all plant samples tested, but the copy number of the sequences zzso to the whole zzso probe varies considerably among the 25 plant species zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the presence of sequences zzso to this probe on several zzso in a dispersed zzso Major signals were observed on a few zzso indicating that some of these sequences are clustered in specific zzso zzso The locations of these repeats were compared to those of zzso zzso in pine zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso varied among the three pine species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso sites were identified on 14 to 20 zzso in these pine zzso
