A new zzso zzso experiment is described for the assignment of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso namely zzso (where zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso is correlated zzso While this technique may formally be thought of as a zzso zzso experiment, by use of selective zzso it is demonstrated that the analogous zzso experiment is a valuable improvement over conventional three-dimensional zzso in that the degree of resonance overlap is markedly reduced by the zzso of zzso into a fourth effective zzso The technique is demonstrated by application to the zzso zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso
