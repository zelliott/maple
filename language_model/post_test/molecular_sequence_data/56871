zzso acids are expected to provide zzso constraint to the zzso zzso A zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso separated by one zzso acid has been zzso and its solid state zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso methanol in the zzso space group zzso There are four formula units, zzso in a unit cell of dimensions a zzso zzso b zzso zzso and c zzso zzso A, at room zzso The structure was solved by direct methods program, zzso and refined to a final R zzso zzso based on zzso reflections with I zzso 2 zzso zzso All the zzso links are trans and the backbone zzso of the zzso can be described as a zzso with mean zzso values of zzso degrees and zzso degrees (the value is averaged over the first four zzso There are four zzso zzso type hydrogen bonds characteristic of zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso are held together by zzso zzso zzso C zzso and lateral hydrogen bonding between symmetry related zzso This mode of packing is similar to the packing motifs observed so often in other zzso that adopt a zzso zzso
