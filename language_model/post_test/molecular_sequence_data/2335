zzso transformation induced by zzso zzso virus is zzso by its zzso zzso the monkey zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso B zzso By use of an appropriately engineered zzso expression zzso the zzso protein was expressed in the insect cell line zzso zzso zzso at a level 50- to zzso higher than that observed with zzso in zzso zzso The sis protein produced by zzso cells underwent processing similar to that observed in zzso cells, including efficient zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso sis protein was capable of binding zzso receptors and inducing DNA synthesis as efficiently as zzso zzso by zzso zzso A significant fraction of sis protein was released from zzso cells, which made possible a zzso zzso zzso to near zzso with a zzso recovery of biological zzso These results demonstrate that a protein whose normal processing requires both zzso and zzso zzso formation can be efficiently expressed in a biologically active form in insect cells by using a zzso zzso zzso
