zzso zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso type 1 zzso are zzso in the zzso of zzso defective interfering particles zzso that mediate zzso transformation and persistent zzso The zzso protein was identified by in zzso zzso and zzso translation analyses which employed a zzso construct designated zzso zzso analyses of in zzso translation products zzso from zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso encodes a 30 zzso protein which zzso in size to the 258 zzso acid protein predicted by DNA sequence zzso This result was confirmed by arresting translation of the in zzso transcribed zzso zzso with an zzso complementary to zzso coding zzso The zzso protein is a zzso of the predicted protein zzso by the zzso gene of zzso virus, but zzso has no zzso in zzso zzso virus type zzso The zzso protein contains a region zzso to a zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso which is commonly found in proteins with zzso of less than two zzso
