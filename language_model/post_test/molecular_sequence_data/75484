A zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizes a zzso zzso expressed both on surface membrane zzso and on zzso soluble zzso of human zzso lung zzso zzso cells, and the corresponding zzso can be detected as a circulating tumor marker in plasma of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of neutral zzso extracted from zzso cells reveals a zzso zzso whose zzso structure, as determined by fast atom zzso zzso is identical with that of an zzso zzso described zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso II, with the same zzso structure, fails to inhibit binding of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks only zzso of zzso binding sites on zzso cells, suggesting that the major zzso recognized by zzso is more complex than the Lea zzso To search for a higher affinity zzso zzso among more complex zzso a mixture of zzso neutral zzso zzso from pooled human milk was passed through a zzso affinity zzso A major retarded zzso was zzso by zzso liquid zzso and shown by fast atom zzso zzso to have the following zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso containing this sugar sequence are at least zzso more active than zzso II as competitive zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso binds to the above zzso zzso zzso with high affinity and zzso zzso with the Lea zzso under some conditions such as occurs in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso where multiple weak interactions of the zzso zzso zzso may zzso
