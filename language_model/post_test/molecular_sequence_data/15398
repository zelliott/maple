zzso in zzso is required for growth cone zzso responses to many guidance zzso Although locally zzso proteins are beginning to be identified, how specific zzso are selected for translation remains zzso Control of zzso tail length by zzso zzso element zzso binding protein 1 zzso is a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso regulation that could be involved in regulating translation in zzso 

We show that zzso zzso is required in zzso retinal zzso cell zzso growth cones for zzso but not zzso zzso responses in zzso and that zzso of zzso binding through zzso interference severely reduces zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are present at low levels in zzso but, surprisingly, zzso protein was not detected in eye or brain zzso and zzso zzso does not affect zzso responses or zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso proteins other than zzso in the zzso regulate retinal zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulation are involved in retinal zzso development, but that zzso may not be the key regulator of zzso in the developing zzso
