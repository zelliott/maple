The AAA zzso zzso and zzso are components of the zzso protein import machinery required for the relocation of the import zzso zzso from the zzso membrane to the zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso form a stable complex in the zzso which associates at the zzso membrane with their membrane anchor zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with the components of the zzso was independent of zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is an incorporated component of the zzso Further evidence suggests that the AAA zzso shuttle between zzso and zzso with proper binding of the zzso complex to the zzso and release of the AAA zzso from the zzso membrane depending on an operative zzso protein import zzso zzso cells exhibit a zzso assembly of the zzso which differs in that it is associated with increased amounts of zzso and zzso in agreement with a function for zzso in the release of AAA zzso from the zzso zzso
