A zzso chain reaction based method was established using zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso as markers to detect zzso B cell populations in zzso embedded zzso Family specific zzso and zzso zzso are used in separate reactions together with the corresponding J zzso to amplify rearranged zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso This allows to distinguish zzso from zzso B cell populations in most of the zzso The method may be helpful in routine diagnosis of B cell NHL and some zzso and zzso difficult zzso
