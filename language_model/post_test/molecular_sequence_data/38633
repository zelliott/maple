Two zzso zzso from the soluble fraction of a zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and the genes coding for these zzso were cloned and zzso One of the zzso designated zzso zzso was found to have a molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso and it contained one zzso c per zzso The other, designated zzso zzso was found to have a molecular mass of approximately 23 zzso and it contained two zzso c molecules per protein zzso The amount of zzso zzso expressed in cells grown at high zzso pressure zzso zzso was less than that in cells grown at atmospheric pressure, whereas zzso zzso was zzso expressed under all pressure conditions zzso The results of Northern zzso analysis were consistent with the zzso observations and suggested that the pressure regulation of zzso zzso gene expression occurred at the zzso zzso These results suggest that the components of the respiratory chain of moderately zzso zzso zzso could be exchanged according to the growth pressure zzso
