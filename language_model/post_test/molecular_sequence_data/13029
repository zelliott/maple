The zzso for the rat zzso zzso chain zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 410 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, zzso message of approximately zzso zzso was readily detected in rat brain, but was absent from liver, a rat zzso cell line, zzso and skeletal zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso is zzso indistinguishable from the native zzso found in rat brain zzso zzso of the rat zzso sequence with available data bases identified the zzso coli (and zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso and revealed a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is hypothesized to be a zzso form of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular masses for the complete proteins are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso sequence was zzso identical with zzso zzso zzso identical with zzso zzso identical with zzso zzso zzso identical with the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identical with the evolutionary related zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignment of zzso with zzso suggests that the folding pattern of the overlapping zzso zzso sequence is similar to that of zzso and indicates that orientation of the zzso zzso zzso in the active site of the zzso zzso is the same as in zzso Thus, zzso are the only zzso zzso to abstract and replace the zzso on the zzso face of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, requirements for recognition of zzso zzso acid and zzso binding are zzso
