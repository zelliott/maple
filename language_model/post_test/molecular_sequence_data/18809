The E1 zzso is one of the most zzso regions in the human zzso zzso zzso The complete E1 gene of the zzso zzso was amplified with four overlapping primer sets in 16 high-grade zzso II, zzso and 13 zzso cervical zzso I) zzso zzso as well as in one cervical cancer zzso zzso analysis of the E6 and zzso genes was also carried out in the same cervical samples in order to confirm the association between zzso sequence variations in the zzso E1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the E1 zzso revealed 27 zzso changes, and these changes were correlated with those found in zzso Asian American and African type II zzso Of these zzso variations, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified only in high-grade zzso zzso A zzso tree of the E1 zzso and zzso sequence analysis of the zzso E6 and zzso genes revealed that zzso zzso sequence zzso located in the E1 zzso can be used to identify the major zzso branch to which a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, amplification of the E1 zzso revealed a disruption between zzso zzso and zzso in five zzso and two zzso cervical cases, indicating that integration of zzso DNA occurs at an early stage of viral zzso
