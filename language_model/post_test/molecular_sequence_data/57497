The zzso of zzso causing zzso disease in non-Jewish populations requires efficient techniques allowing the simultaneous screening for both known and novel zzso zzso zzso isolated from cultured zzso of 19 zzso patients (7 with adult or late onset form of the disease and 12 with infantile zzso disease) was amplified by zzso in two overlapping segments spanning the entire coding zzso We used chemical mismatch zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and direct sequencing of amplified fragments displaying a zzso product or an altered melting behavior to screen the zzso A gene for zzso and to determine their distribution and frequency in the non-Jewish zzso zzso These methods allowed us to identify 31 out of 38 zzso studied zzso In addition to 9 previously described zzso (the 4 zzso zzso in zzso 11, G to A transitions at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C to T transition at zzso zzso and 504 and a zzso to AT transition at the donor site of zzso zzso we have identified 10 novel zzso These include 1 donor zzso site zzso in zzso 6, 8 zzso zzso at zzso distributed zzso zzso and a 2 zzso deletion in zzso zzso These results confirm the extreme molecular zzso of zzso causing zzso disease in non-Jewish zzso The strategy used should be profitable for identifying zzso in large genes and for diagnostic zzso
