The solution structure of the major form of the reduced soluble zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso has been solved through zzso zzso The protein contains 98 zzso zzso zzso assignment was available for zzso zzso except 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso and has been zzso From zzso zzso of which zzso were found to be zzso a family of 40 zzso structures has been obtained with average backbone zzso (for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and average target function of zzso zzso no distance violations being larger than zzso zzso The structure has been compared with the X-ray structure of the oxidized rat zzso zzso and with that of the highly similar bovine zzso zzso in the oxidized zzso The analysis of the elements of secondary structure is zzso in terms of their stability and of their occurrence in related structures, and of the capability of zzso and X-ray zzso to observe zzso Some detailed structural variations are noticed among the solved structures of the various zzso and between solid and zzso The structural features in solution of the zzso proposed to be involved in zzso recognition are found to be largely zzso with respect to the solid zzso
