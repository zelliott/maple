The genes zzso zzso and zzso share significant structural similarity and form zzso 7 of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso To determine the regulatory potential of these three zzso factors, we used a combination of zzso functional zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso show a high degree of functional similarity and display very similar target gene specificity for several genes of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the triple zzso zzso zzso zzso which genetically lack a complete zzso of zzso zzso do not form zzso while the zzso of zzso is not zzso In developing zzso zzso zzso and zzso act in an additive manner due to their differential spatial zzso zzso controls zzso zzso mainly in the zzso while zzso controls zzso zzso primarily in zzso We identified and confirmed additional target genes of the zzso zzso 7 factors, including the zzso zzso and zzso and we demonstrate that the zzso of distinct and structurally identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the expression zzso of the different zzso zzso zzso we refer to these genes as zzso for zzso OF zzso zzso
