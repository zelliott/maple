zzso E zzso 2 is a recently identified zzso that resembles low and very low density zzso zzso Isolation and characterization of zzso clones zzso human zzso E zzso 2 revealed that the gene spans approximately 60 zzso and contains 19 zzso The positions of the zzso boundaries of the gene are almost identical to those of low and very low density zzso zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso of human zzso revealed that the gene is located on zzso zzso Isolation of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction indicate the presence of multiple zzso with different numbers of zzso repeats in the binding domain of the zzso We also found a zzso zzso lacking a zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso start site was mapped to the position 236 base pairs upstream of the zzso translation zzso zzso by primer extension zzso zzso inspection of the zzso region revealed potential DNA zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso The minimal promoter region and a region required for nerve growth factor zzso in zzso cells were also zzso
