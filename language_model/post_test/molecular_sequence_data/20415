The purpose of the current study was to investigate the presence and molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso in hospitals of Tehran, zzso Over a period of 17 months, 129 zzso zzso were isolated from zzso samples and tested for zzso using the zzso disk diffusion zzso then, screening for zzso zzso and determination of their minimum zzso zzso were carried out using the combined disk method and standard zzso dilution method, zzso The presence and type of zzso genes were determined by zzso and sequence zzso The zzso were all identified as zzso zzso of different zzso The highest resistance in the collected zzso zzso was to zzso acid zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the zzso were susceptible to zzso zzso and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and DNA sequencing revealed that two of the three zzso zzso both a zzso and a zzso gene while the third one carried only a zzso zzso This is the first study providing structural data for a zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso recovered in zzso
