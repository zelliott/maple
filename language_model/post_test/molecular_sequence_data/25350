The zzso zzso rat is one of several zzso animal zzso that have severe zzso in the central nervous zzso It appears in all to be the result of zzso in the zzso zzso protein gene which is located on the long arm of the zzso To identify the zzso rat zzso we isolated and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso from the brain of zzso affected zzso The only consistent sequence difference between these and normal rat sequences was the substitution of a C for an A at the first position of zzso 74, resulting in a zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso The presence of this zzso zzso acid in the second zzso zzso segment of the protein might be expected to influence its ability to interact with the zzso zzso amplification and sequencing of the corresponding zzso regions were used to confirm the presence of the single base change in the zzso and both normal and zzso versions in the zzso It is interesting that this change, like those detected in other zzso zzso disorders, involves an zzso acid replacement within a zzso zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso of these structures apparently has severe consequences for the ability of zzso to contribute normally to zzso
