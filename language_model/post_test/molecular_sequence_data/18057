The zzso zzso is common in patients who develop zzso arthritis after having an zzso One hypothesis concerning the zzso of zzso arthritis is that molecular mimicry between zzso and certain bacterial components might be zzso It is known that an infection with zzso is commonly associated with zzso arthritis in zzso positive zzso zzso we were interested to investigate whether zzso between zzso and zzso zzso A gene library of zzso zzso was created in the zzso zzso zzso One of the resulting clones contained a gene zzso an zzso protein that seems to have partial zzso identity with zzso It reacted in western zzso zzso and zzso with three different zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso However zzso of the cloned zzso gene and the predicted zzso acid sequence revealed only a very remote similarity with zzso in the primary zzso Instead, an extremely high degree of similarity with the zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso coli was identified indicating that the protein zzso by the cloned zzso zzso gene is a corresponding zzso zzso
