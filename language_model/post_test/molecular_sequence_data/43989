We previously reported the isolation of a rat zzso clone zzso a protein with significant sequence zzso to the B zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this protein was thus designated rat zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso Stanley and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso zzso had been shown to generate the zzso important zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now present direct evidence that the putative rat zzso zzso B is genuinely an zzso zzso We also show that the zzso exists both as a peripheral membrane protein tightly associated with the zzso face of the extended zzso zzso network, and as a zzso zzso Association of the zzso zzso with zzso is not affected by treatment with zzso A, zzso zzso zzso 2 M zzso or zzso of zzso However, treatment of isolated zzso with 4 M zzso leads to zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso that membrane association involves specific, zzso zzso zzso The fact that zzso zzso B is localized exclusively to zzso of zzso stores, is consistent with a model where this zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso
