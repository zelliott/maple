The pygmy rabbit zzso zzso is a small zzso of the western United States that specializes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso habitat loss and modification have increased the vulnerability of pygmy rabbit zzso but the current geographic distribution and population status remain zzso To aid in detection and population monitoring, we developed a species identification test that uses zzso DNA zzso zzso to distinguish among six zzso zzso species using DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso this test, we successfully identified the species of origin for all zzso samples that produced a positive zzso result zzso of 283 zzso zzso zzso collected during the winter zzso had higher zzso success rate zzso than zzso collected at other times of the year zzso This test, using zzso genetic sampling of zzso zzso provides an efficient method for assessing site occupancy and distribution of pygmy rabbits and other zzso across large geographic zzso
