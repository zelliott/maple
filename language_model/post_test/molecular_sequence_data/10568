The zzso zzso zzso has been associated with the zzso of mobile element Delta 88 at zzso on the zzso complex zzso DNA map, zzso of all zzso zzso zzso Different zzso of zzso are regulated by the zzso zzso maternal effect zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso maternal effect, zzso offspring produce zzso abdominal and zzso tissue in the zzso In the presence of the dominant zzso maternal effect, zzso offspring have normal heads but now show zzso zzso One other zzso zzso produces flies with identical defects to that of zzso in the presence of both maternal zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed the zzso of mobile element 297 in the zzso zzso approximately 25 zzso downstream of the Delta 88 zzso in zzso No other abnormalities were zzso zzso of our zzso strain revealed a 297 zzso in an identical region to that of zzso in addition to the Delta 88 zzso zzso of zzso carrying 297 only, produced zzso head defects and zzso defects in the presence of the zzso and zzso maternal effects, zzso zzso of zzso carrying Delta 88 only, failed to produce any defects in the presence of either maternal zzso Based upon these results, we propose that it is the 297 zzso in the zzso zzso not Delta 88, that is responsible for the zzso zzso
