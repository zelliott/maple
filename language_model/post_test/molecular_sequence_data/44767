Most zzso species zzso zzso are zzso between periods of sexual zzso They are also highly zzso with different adult zzso occurring in the life cycle, zzso zzso zzso asexual and zzso It is assumed that zzso born in a zzso zzso lineage are genetically identical regardless of the final adult form with the exception of sexual zzso Using the randomly amplified zzso zzso chain reaction zzso we have found that different asexual adult zzso winged and wingless of some clones of two cereal zzso species (the grain zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be distinguished by the presence or absence of one or more zzso zzso In three of nine clones zzso such differences were found, and Southern zzso and zzso of the discriminating bands confirmed these to be of zzso origin, rather than due to zzso bacteria or zzso zzso The main 248 and 296 zzso bands, in the two species respectively, were zzso and found to be zzso zzso The smaller band showed 57% zzso with white zzso muscle over a stretch of 90 zzso zzso DNA treated with zzso zzso to remove secondary structures still showed differences in zzso profiles between winged and wingless zzso within the unusual zzso This discovery may be widespread and therefore it is important to understand the phenomenon in relation to zzso zzso
