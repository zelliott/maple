A gene zzso a zzso zzso was identified in the zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The bacterial zzso zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso alcohol zzso from the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso could be expressed at high levels in zzso coli, which allowed zzso of 160 zzso of zzso zzso from 1 L of zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso forms zzso zzso zzso is partly expressed in the zzso form, but can be fully zzso by the addition of zzso zzso incorporation involves the formation of a zzso zzso linkage, which is formed zzso Modeling using the zzso alcohol zzso structure indicates that the zzso zzso is zzso to zzso in zzso zzso The model also provides a structural explanation for the observation that zzso zzso is zzso whereas zzso alcohol zzso is zzso The bacterial zzso efficiently zzso zzso into zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol and zzso are also readily accepted as zzso whereas other zzso compounds zzso zzso are converted with relatively poor zzso zzso The zzso efficiencies with the identified zzso are zzso different when compared with zzso alcohol zzso The ability to efficiently convert zzso may facilitate zzso zzso of this natural aromatic zzso
