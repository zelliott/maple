The zzso genes of human zzso zzso types 3, 16 (both zzso B), and 4 zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences were zzso We observed a high degree of zzso between the three zzso and thus could confirm the close evolutionary relationship of zzso B and E which was previously zzso after comparing other zzso zzso zzso the three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso the structures of the three zzso were zzso The major differences between the zzso of zzso and zzso were confined to the zzso and zzso surface zzso As expected from zzso in zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso were not only very zzso in the zzso regions but also in the zzso zzso and zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is located in these regions of the zzso Closer examination of the loop zzso zzso including also zzso of zzso A, C, and zzso revealed that this region is zzso The finding that zzso differs from zzso and zzso in loop zzso supports the placement of zzso in a separate zzso
