The zzso zzso zzso gene cluster codes for components of a type III zzso zzso necessary for the zzso of zzso a hypersensitive zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that several other zzso proteins can be detected by growing zzso bacteria in minimal medium in the presence of zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by genes located downstream of zzso and constitute an zzso with zzso zzso zzso retain the zzso ability to cause disease in hosts and to elicit the hypersensitive response on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso regulatory gene and is induced upon zzso with zzso cell zzso This plant zzso induction depends on zzso a putative zzso for plant specific zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is not modified by the addition of zzso red to the growth medium and the zzso pools of zzso and zzso are very similar in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso data suggest that zzso red zzso zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that contains a functional zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that carries 22 tandem zzso repeats zzso The zzso domain of this protein forms a consensus that perfectly matches the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso may be zzso into plant cells via the zzso zzso
