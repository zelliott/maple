zzso proteins play central roles in the function of many signaling zzso Among the zzso examples are the zzso and zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso These proteins contain three zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of some zzso zzso and a zzso domain implicated in zzso zzso In zzso zzso regulates the mating zzso zzso while zzso coordinates the cellular polarity zzso Within the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso contain a single zzso zzso while several zzso species, belonging to the zzso zzso zzso contain both a classic zzso protein and a zzso protein that lacks the zzso zzso We analyzed the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of this class of structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso is essential for mating and still coordinates the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cascade elements in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso as well as with the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso similar to zzso but can also zzso with zzso potentially forming zzso signaling zzso We found direct binding between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso that depends on a mobile zzso loop absent from zzso zzso zzso but related to the zzso region within the zzso domain of zzso Thus, the zzso lineage has restructured specific scaffolding zzso to coordinate the proteins required to direct the gene zzso zzso and cell cycle regulation essential for zzso
