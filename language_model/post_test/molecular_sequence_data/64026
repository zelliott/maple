zzso zzso derived from the negative strand of satellite zzso from the tobacco zzso virus zzso can be engineered to target and cleave a variety of zzso zzso from both cellular and viral zzso Attention to design and targeting rules and zzso of zzso 1 length and zzso efficiency in zzso may increase the efficacy of hairpin zzso in reducing the expression of targeted zzso Here, principles for the design and targeting of zzso hairpin zzso are zzso as well as methods and materials for zzso zzso 1 zzso and for conducting an initial screen of zzso efficiency to identify promising candidates for further zzso Examples are provided for hairpin zzso that target human and mouse transforming zzso beta zzso as well as human zzso kidney disease gene 1 zzso and zzso virus large zzso The zzso modification of the zzso hairpin zzso is considered superior to designs based on the native zzso hairpin zzso given its potential to yield considerable improvements in stability and zzso zzso
