zzso proteins are extremely challenging to produce in sufficient quantities for zzso and structural analysis and there is a growing demand for solutions to this zzso In this study we attempted to improve expression of two zzso coding sequences zzso and zzso for membrane zzso For both coding zzso synonymous zzso zzso in the region adjacent to the zzso start led to significant improvements in zzso whereas zzso sequence zzso of zzso throughout the coding sequence zzso We conclude that coding sequences can be zzso for high-level protein expression by selective engineering of the zzso coding sequence with synonymous zzso thus zzso the need to consider whole sequence zzso
