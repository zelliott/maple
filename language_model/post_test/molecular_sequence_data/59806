The molecular zzso in an zzso zzso zzso previously characterized as a zzso zzso has been identified as containing an zzso of the zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and partial sequence analysis of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso indicates that this element is distinct from the previously described zzso as well as the defective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is, however, inserted at the same site in zzso as the zzso of zzso and can transpose when zzso is zzso This study shows that, depending on genetic background, this zzso may not behave as a stable zzso which could dramatically influence the conclusions drawn from experiments based on this particular zzso
