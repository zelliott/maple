In contrast to most adult organisms, freshwater zzso can zzso any injured body part, including their entire nervous zzso This allows for the analysis of genes required for both the maintenance and zzso of specific neural zzso In addition, the loss of specific neural zzso may uncover previously unknown behavioral roles for that neural population in the context of the adult zzso Here we show that two zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso are required for the maintenance and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso When either zzso or zzso was knocked down by zzso zzso the expression of multiple zzso markers for zzso zzso was zzso Surprisingly, the loss of zzso function uncovered a role for these zzso in the coordination of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso that are required for their zzso gliding zzso Finally, we show that in addition to its requirement in zzso zzso zzso is required for proper zzso patterning during zzso when it is required for the expression of the zzso molecules zzso in the anterior and zzso in the zzso
