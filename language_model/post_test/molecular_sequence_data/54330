zzso provide key mechanisms of resistance to zzso particularly zzso zzso in zzso One resistance mechanism is a qualitative change in the properties of a zzso Two zzso forms, zzso and zzso have been observed, mostly in zzso species, to affect zzso specificity of zzso But whether these two single zzso can commonly change character of insect zzso is zzso In our study zzso genes from seven insects distributed among four orders were zzso zzso at position 151 or zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso proteins was examined towards an artificial zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso activity in zzso and zzso cases, respectively, and at the same time zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso and zzso cases, zzso Thus, the change at position zzso is more effective to influence zzso specificity than that at position zzso These results may suggest that these two zzso have the potential to cause zzso resistance broadly in zzso
