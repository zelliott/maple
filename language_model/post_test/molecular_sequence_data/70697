zzso is an zzso zzso protein that was originally identified as zzso an zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso and, zzso as the putative translation initiation factor zzso To establish the in zzso function of zzso its topographical distribution was investigated in zzso cells and the effects of zzso the corresponding gene was studied in the budding zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells containing zzso zzso zzso is present in the zzso and enriched at zzso with a pattern similar to that of zzso zzso Surprisingly, in the absence and in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is in the zzso and associated with the nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and depletion of the corresponding gene product is associated with a dramatic decrease of the level of free zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, human zzso can rescue the lethal effect of the zzso zzso zzso The data obtained in zzso suggest an zzso zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso or assembly rather than in zzso A further function related to the zzso zzso zzso may have evolved specifically in higher zzso zzso
