The zzso known as zzso zzso zzso can transfer zzso units from zzso to zzso to give good yields of zzso which may serve as zzso The main products were the zzso zzso and zzso in ratios ranging from zzso to zzso along with lesser amounts of zzso Ten unusual zzso structures were zzso Three of these arose from zzso of the major zzso product, two each from the minor zzso and three were the result of zzso of the zzso zzso product zzso or zzso The major zzso product arose from zzso of the major zzso at position 4 of the zzso unit, to give a zzso structure analogous to that of zzso A number of zzso and higher zzso were also zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso gave only a single zzso product in low yield, and no significant amounts of higher zzso The zzso structure from zzso was found to be zzso which is at odds with the previously published zzso
