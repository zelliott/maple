The present study was designed to determine whether an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso may prevent development of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso canine model of the disease was used zzso zzso 17 zzso and the degree of zzso of the zzso artery was assessed by zzso zzso dogs of either sex were divided into three experimental groups: animals treated with daily zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and control animals treated with saline solution zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso arteries in animals treated with saline solution was reduced by zzso to 56 zzso zzso of control zzso zzso and zzso did not significantly affect zzso zzso zzso were 62 zzso zzso and 56 zzso zzso of control diameters for zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in isolated canine zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso selectively inhibited zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in plasma and zzso fluid were not affected by development of zzso These results suggest that zzso injections of zzso zzso or zzso cannot prevent zzso cerebral zzso and that zzso may not be the major zzso responsible for the decrease in cerebral zzso diameter associated with zzso
