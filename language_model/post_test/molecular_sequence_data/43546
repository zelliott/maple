zzso growth factors zzso induce a variety of biological effects on different cell zzso They activate a number of zzso including zzso zzso such as the zzso factors zzso and zzso which are also common targets for other zzso zzso zzso growth zzso Here we describe a secondary zzso zzso on the zzso gene that is activated only by members of the zzso family in zzso zzso cells, not by other zzso zzso zzso growth factors zzso zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, or zzso This zzso response element zzso consists of a zzso array of five DNA motifs which bind two zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso a zzso expressed upstream zzso factor, and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both zzso binding motifs are required, but not zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, agents such as zzso zzso acid, or zzso which are known to activate zzso complexes and zzso zzso fail to activate zzso However, zzso can be activated by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, this data implies a differential zzso of growth zzso signaling on zzso regulatory zzso
