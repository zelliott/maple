It is widely assumed that the functional activity of signal sequences has been zzso throughout evolution, at least between zzso bacteria and zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a unique tool to test this zzso since individual members can be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or targeted to both compartments zzso zzso inhibitor 2, zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by a signal sequence proposed to be inefficient by zzso We show here that the same internal domain that promotes an inefficient zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells is a weak signal sequence in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso signal sequence is much more efficient, whereas the corresponding sequence elements from zzso zzso and zzso are entirely devoid of signal sequence activity in zzso zzso that improve the activity of the zzso signal sequence and that convert the zzso regions of zzso and zzso into efficient signal sequences have been zzso Taken together, these results indicate that several structural features contribute to the weak activity of the zzso signal sequence and provide new insights into the plasticity of the zzso zzso of signal zzso zzso expression of two zzso proteins containing the zzso signal sequence is toxic, and the reduced viability is accompanied by a rapid decrease in the membrane zzso motive force, in zzso levels and in zzso In zzso cells, which lack the zzso zzso the zzso proteins retain their toxicity and their expression only affected the zzso motive zzso Thus, the properties of these toxic signal sequences offer a new tool to dissect the interactions of signal sequences with the protein export zzso
