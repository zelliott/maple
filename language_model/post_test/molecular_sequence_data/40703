zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso pathogens of zzso with great potential as a biological control zzso Development of tools that allow high-resolution monitoring of zzso zzso in the environment is a prerequisite for the successful zzso of biological control zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso targets 13 zzso identified in 6 zzso regions including the largest zzso of nuclear zzso zzso II zzso zzso the second-largest zzso of nuclear zzso zzso II zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the large zzso zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso gene together with the internal transcribed zzso zzso The zzso allowed the discrimination of 15 different zzso profiles among 19 zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso is zzso to DNA extracted from infected zzso allowing zzso of the fungus without zzso The zzso zzso provides an efficient tool for investigation of population structures and dynamics of zzso zzso as well as its persistence and epidemiology in zzso Furthermore, it constitutes a powerful approach for monitoring potential biological control strains of zzso zzso in the zzso
