Recent studies have detailed the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso stimulation of gene zzso however, an zzso regulator for the zzso activity of this protein has not been zzso To characterize the regulation of zzso activity, we have expressed full-length and truncated peptides corresponding to various regions of the zzso protein in bacteria and the zzso insect cell zzso zzso expressed truncated zzso but not full-length zzso was able to bind a consensus zzso response zzso zzso suggesting the zzso zzso may serve as a negative regulator of zzso zzso In contrast, the full-length zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells using a zzso zzso was fully competent to bind zzso zzso zzso 2A reversed the zzso activity by zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso activity of zzso expressed full-length zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso proteins identified a single zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso zzso we propose that zzso of this regulatory site is sufficient to induce an zzso structural change in the zzso zzso which allows zzso and subsequent DNA zzso
