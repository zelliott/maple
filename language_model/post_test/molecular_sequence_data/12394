The zzso process of zzso pancreatic zzso B zzso has been studied in detail by a number of complementary zzso and a description of the molecular events that lead to the generation of active zzso B zzso has been zzso The generated zzso zzso in the degradation of its own zzso segment by zzso zzso zzso from fragments produced by zzso zzso The trimming action of zzso is, however, not essential for the release of a fully functional zzso in contrast to what was previously reported for zzso zzso A zzso In the model presented here, the zzso process is solely dependent on the first zzso zzso at the limit between the zzso segment and the zzso region, and the former piece loses all of its zzso capacity once severed from the zzso The use of zzso zzso of zzso activity during the study of the zzso zzso process of zzso has been required for the capture of short-lived, otherwise zzso zzso This has allowed a complete description of the process and shown that the first zzso action of zzso can also take place on a second target zzso zzso considerations that take into account the three-dimensional structures of the A and B forms of the zzso lead us to propose that the differences in zzso at the region that connects the zzso zzso domain to the zzso are the main responsible elements for the differences observed in the zzso processes of both zzso
