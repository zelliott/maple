Recent studies on the zzso zzso have suggested that the zzso of zzso and tandem repeats in the control region are important changes that are related to species zzso This paper reports the study of zzso from five zzso zzso zzso species with very similar zzso A duplicated zzso gene in the zzso region is present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso sequence blocks of the control region, a duplicated zzso and promoter are found in zzso zzso but are absent in zzso zzso Moreover, a duplicated zzso is found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso the first sequence reported from zzso and the longest zzso zzso among the zzso zzso we conducted zzso analysis to show that zzso and zzso are more closely related to each other than to other zzso zzso However, we reject the zzso zzso of these two zzso
