zzso nuclear zzso alpha zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso a class of zzso zzso zzso A nonsense zzso in the gene zzso this zzso factor was recently found in a white family with one form of zzso diabetes of the young, zzso Here, we report the zzso organization and partial sequence of the human zzso alpha zzso In addition, we have screened the 12 zzso zzso zzso and minimal promoter region for zzso in a group of 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with zzso zzso of unknown zzso Eight zzso zzso were noted, of which one resulted in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso a region of the protein that may play a role in zzso alpha zzso and DNA zzso This zzso was not found in 214 unrelated zzso subjects zzso Japanese, 53 Chinese, 51 white, and 57 zzso The zzso zzso was only present in three of five diabetic members in this family, indicating that it is not the only cause of diabetes in this zzso The remaining seven zzso zzso were located in the zzso promoter region and zzso They are not predicted to affect the zzso of the gene or zzso processing and represent zzso and rare zzso The results suggest that zzso in the zzso alpha gene may cause zzso zzso in Japanese but they are less common than zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The information on the sequence of the zzso alpha gene and its promoter region will facilitate the search for zzso in other populations and studies of the role of this gene in determining normal pancreatic zzso zzso
