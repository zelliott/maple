zzso zzso strategies offer unique advantages over current molecular array approaches, as the zzso identified can directly provide zzso peptides for zzso and/or zzso zzso The vascular zzso is well suited to zzso assessment by in zzso zzso display, but extensive enrichment and sequencing steps limit its application for high zzso molecular zzso To overcome these limitations we developed a quantitative zzso zzso strategy to allow the rapid zzso of in zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed for distinct clones selected from a defined zzso pool to probe for zzso changes in cardiac vascular zzso zzso and specificity of the primer sets were tested and confirmed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso confirmed the preferential zzso of all zzso clones to the young rather than old cardiac zzso and demonstrated a close correlation with zzso zzso previously determined using traditional zzso zzso zzso This zzso approach provides zzso of zzso within hours of zzso injection and may therefore be used for zzso high zzso analysis of binding of defined zzso sequences both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches for the zzso mapping of vascular beds and other zzso
