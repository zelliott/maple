zzso growth zzso zzso is a recently identified growth factor that stimulates the zzso growth of mouse zzso zzso zzso Evidence from mouse development also shows that zzso may play an important role in growth and patterning of zzso face, and the central nervous zzso We describe here the human zzso zzso sequence and demonstrate conservation between the human and mouse zzso including alternatively spliced zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso by FISH using an zzso bacterial artificial zzso and by genetic linkage using a zzso zzso identified in this study is also reported and zzso the zzso map location to zzso Since zzso maps to the same zzso region as zzso has indeed been shown to be a zzso for zzso and has an expression pattern consistent with limb and zzso anomalies, we have screened two zzso with Pfeiffer syndrome that were previously linked to markers from zzso and a large number of individuals with zzso and limb anomalies for zzso in the coding sequence of zzso While no such zzso were identified, a rare zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is reported that apparently has no clinical zzso Our zzso data suggest that zzso in zzso would be, at best, an zzso cause of such zzso
