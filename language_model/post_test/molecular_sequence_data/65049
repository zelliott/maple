The zzso gene was originally identified as a putative tumor zzso gene from a zzso tumor cell line by zzso zzso zzso Later studies showed that the zzso protein is multifunctional, involved in cell growth and zzso energy zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this report a full-length complementary DNA zzso a zzso counterpart in pearl oyster zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis shows that oyster zzso is more closely related to its insect zzso than to the zzso zzso Analysis of the tissue expression pattern of the oyster zzso gene showed that oyster zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso tested, with highest levels in the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we expressed the zzso protein in zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the zzso of human zzso is zzso to the expressed oyster zzso zzso zzso of the oyster zzso with zzso resulted in the reduction of intrinsic zzso zzso and a zzso in the zzso zzso indicating the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso This evidence presents a possible mechanism for the critical function of zinc zzso in the interaction of zzso with zzso
