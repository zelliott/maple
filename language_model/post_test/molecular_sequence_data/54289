zzso zzso male sterile zzso rice exhibits a number of desirable traits for hybrid rice zzso The cloning genes responsible for zzso and those zzso male zzso mechanisms and zzso to fertility would be of great significance to provide a foundation to develop new male sterile zzso zzso a zzso line, is one of the most widely used zzso zzso hybrid rice breeding systems in zzso In this study, genetic analysis based on zzso and zzso populations derived from a cross between zzso and zzso determined a single zzso gene controls male zzso in zzso zzso marker techniques combined with zzso analysis zzso were used and located the target gene (named zzso between two zzso markers zzso and zzso Fine mapping of the zzso locus was conducted with 45 new zzso zzso markers developed between the zzso and zzso region, using zzso sterile individuals from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was further mapped to a zzso zzso DNA zzso between two zzso zzso zzso and zzso with genetic distances of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which zzso with zzso located on the zzso zzso zzso Ten genes were identified in this region based on zzso results from the zzso zzso A nuclear zzso Z gene was identified as the candidate for the zzso zzso This result will facilitate cloning the zzso zzso The tightly linked markers for the zzso gene locus will further provide a useful tool for zzso selection of this gene in rice breeding zzso
