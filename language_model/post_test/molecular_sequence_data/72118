We cloned and zzso a mouse gene zzso a new type of membrane bound zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso The initial zzso clone was found previously in a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso library generated from fetal zzso zzso cells, and the message was shown to be highly expressed in a zzso zzso nurse cell zzso A clone isolated from a severe combined zzso zzso zzso library and extended to its full length at the zzso end with the zzso technique contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence of this zzso the predicted protein structure is a type II membrane protein with a zzso zzso zzso domain linked to the membrane by four low density zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso High message expression by northern zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fetal zzso zzso but not in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, zzso and zzso zzso zzso class zzso and zzso fetal zzso zzso cells were positive for expression by reverse zzso whereas zzso zzso were zzso The gene was found in chicken and multiple zzso species under low stringency Southern zzso zzso Under high stringency conditions, only a single gene per zzso zzso was identified in the zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was mapped to mouse zzso 9 and is closely linked to the zzso zzso leukemia integration 1) zzso
