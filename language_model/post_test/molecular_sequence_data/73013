The interaction between vitamin zzso protein S and the zzso protein zzso was studied using surface zzso resonance and genetic zzso The zzso as well as association and zzso rates of the complex, was measured for human and bovine protein S at five different calcium zzso The binding to zzso of six protein hybrids containing different parts of zzso factor IX and protein S was studied in the absence and presence of zzso The results show that zzso of the human protein zzso complex is extremely slow in the presence of zzso or zzso 10 zzso calcium zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso and the association rate constant is zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso Human and bovine protein S were found to bind to human zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the rates of association and zzso were higher for the bovine protein S zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the affinity for zzso was reduced by a factor of 65 for human protein S and by a factor of 40 for bovine protein zzso The decreased affinity could be mainly attributed to an increased zzso zzso while the zzso decreased zzso The studies using zzso proteins show that the portion of protein S that is responsible for binding to zzso is fully contained in the two zzso repeats, which are zzso to the sex hormone binding zzso zzso All hybrids that contain the zzso repeats bind to zzso with the same affinity as zzso protein zzso whereas hybrids lacking these repeats show no zzso binding to zzso The present data also suggest that the effect of calcium on the zzso properties is zzso by calcium binding zzso in the zzso zzso
