zzso replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively zzso zzso In this study, we initially revisited the determination of the replication initiation sites of zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso A universal initiation site for each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the plus and minus zzso zzso that is shared by a relatively wide repertoire of zzso zzso was identified, in agreement with a previous report based on a different zzso zzso an in zzso selection procedure based on a model rolling circle replication zzso was zzso This latter experiment led to the identification of a highly zzso zzso box which is reminiscent of the sequence found in the vicinity of the zzso initiation zzso The zzso sequence contributes to zzso the initiation site and provides an explanation for the presence of a specific universal initiation site on the zzso zzso
