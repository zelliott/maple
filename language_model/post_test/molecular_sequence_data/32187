zzso zzso is required to execute many cellular zzso In zzso zzso timely degradation of the master regulator zzso by zzso zzso is essential for zzso progression and requires the zzso of zzso and zzso Here, we establish a zzso framework to understand regulated zzso in zzso zzso and show that zzso is not an zzso for zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso without zzso and is recognized with an affinity comparable with the best zzso zzso In contrast, zzso the zzso zzso of zzso functions as an zzso to enhance degradation of specific zzso zzso zzso is also itself a zzso of zzso zzso Thus, our analysis zzso reveals the consequences of both direct and zzso recognition in zzso zzso specificity in zzso zzso reveals a potential regulatory role of controlled zzso stability, and zzso suggests that zzso regulation of zzso stability depends on repression of its intrinsic degradation rather than zzso zzso
