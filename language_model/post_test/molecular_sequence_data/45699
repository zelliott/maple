The zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso bond formation in the zzso zzso zzso by selectively zzso the soluble zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which in turn can directly zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso bonds are essential for zzso zzso activity: zzso and zzso zzso and structural data indicate a zzso bond is transferred from zzso directly to zzso whereas a zzso zzso bond is used to zzso the reduced zzso pair through an internal zzso zzso zzso transfer from zzso to molecular zzso by way of a zzso zzso maintains zzso in an oxidized zzso zzso we identify a mixed zzso species that confirms the zzso zzso zzso relay in zzso and identify zzso and zzso as the zzso that mediate zzso zzso Moreover, we describe zzso zzso that have the surprising ability to zzso zzso in the absence of zzso We show the zzso activity of these zzso results from structural changes in zzso that allow zzso increased access to zzso which are normally buried beneath the protein zzso The altered activity of these zzso zzso toward selected zzso leads us to propose the zzso mechanism involving transfer between zzso pairs evolved to impart zzso specificity to zzso
