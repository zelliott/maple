The zzso family of genes contains five functional zzso We describe the cloning of a new member of the zzso family from rat zzso and zzso libraries, designated zzso A zzso of cloned zzso was used to map the corresponding rat locus by Southern zzso of DNA prepared from rat X mouse zzso cell zzso zzso mapped to rat zzso zzso We have previously mapped the zzso to rat zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Klein, Nature zzso zzso 1983) and zzso and zzso to rat zzso 6 and 5, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Klein, and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial sequence of zzso had extensive sequence zzso to the zzso zzso region, and the detection of zzso zzso further indicated that these two genes are closely zzso The DNA regions zzso among the zzso family members, designated zzso boxes, were highly zzso between zzso and zzso A lower degree of zzso was detected in other parts of the coding region in zzso and zzso not present in zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso was detected in most rat zzso with the highest expression in the zzso This resembled the expression pattern of zzso although at different relative levels, and was in contrast to the more zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso was expressed at zzso high levels in all fetal zzso and during subsequent zzso development, in contrast to the zzso expression of zzso
