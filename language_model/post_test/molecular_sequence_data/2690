zzso inhibitor is a zzso zzso complex of three different types of zzso Their zzso relation in the complex is not yet zzso One zzso results from zzso processing of a precursor protein composed of alpha zzso and a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso From this, only the inhibitor protein becomes part of the zzso inhibitor zzso Another zzso whose function is not yet understood is structurally unrelated to the first one as well as to other proteins of various data zzso Now we have obtained a zzso clone coding for zzso zzso acid zzso of a precursor protein of the third zzso Its primary structure is zzso identical to that of the completely known zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from isolated zzso inhibitor represent a distinct part of only about two thirds of the predicted zzso zzso suggesting that its maturation is very similar to that of the second zzso zzso we conclude that the deduced primary structure covers about zzso of the mature third zzso
