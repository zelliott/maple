zzso zzso techniques were zzso to determine the secondary structural elements of zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso and two of its point zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso assignments were determined for all three zzso as well as chemical shifts and zzso connectivity zzso The chemical shifts of zzso and zzso are identical zzso zzso zzso except for the site of zzso whereas marked shift changes were detected between zzso and zzso These chemical shift differences imply that the zzso to zzso zzso has induced a zzso change relative to the parent zzso All three molecules show the same basic nuclear zzso effect zzso pattern, which suggests that the gross zzso of all three molecules is the zzso Small changes in sequential zzso zzso and changes in zzso zzso patterns indicate that there are subtle zzso differences between zzso and zzso
