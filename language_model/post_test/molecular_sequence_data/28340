zzso zzso may be useful in the treatment of zzso zzso disease and gastrointestinal zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso zzso zzso and test them for their ability to inhibit zzso acid zzso Five peptides were zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso and the zzso zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso was removed, and the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso and the zzso bond between zzso and zzso acid was replaced by a zzso zzso zzso in which the bond between zzso and zzso acid was replaced by a zzso zzso zzso and, finally, zzso zzso in which a zzso was induced in the zzso region by the introduction of a zzso in place of zzso The zzso effect of the peptides was tested in the totally isolated, zzso zzso rat zzso The peptides were tested in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso M for zzso activity and together with zzso zzso zzso X zzso M, at a concentration of zzso M for zzso zzso zzso zzso had full zzso activity but greatly reduced zzso and zzso zzso had a faint zzso zzso None of the peptides showed any zzso zzso
