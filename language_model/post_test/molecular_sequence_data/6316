An zzso zzso zzso zzso library was constructed using the zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso B zzso zzso gene zzso for selection of DNA fragments with promoter zzso This library was transformed in zzso coli and zzso colonies were zzso zzso of which contained zzso zzso of zzso DNA from the library into An resulted in 53 zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of 21 zzso confirmed the integration of zzso into the An zzso Using the zzso selection zzso three functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified from this zzso Both DNA strands of all three fragments were zzso and their sequences showed no significant zzso to those in the zzso zzso of the sequences of all known promoters from An suggested that zzso stretches are probably important for promoter zzso The promoter activity was zzso further using zzso zzso zzso as a quantitative zzso The results suggest that while zzso is a much stronger promoter than the known zzso promoter of zzso zzso zzso promotes only weak expression of beta zzso
