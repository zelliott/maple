The gene corresponding to a zzso zzso protein previously described in adult human zzso cartilage was characterized by sequencing of zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence zzso to the recently described zzso protein zzso The protein was zzso by messages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose relative abundance increased as their size zzso The message zzso appears to originate from variation in the length of the zzso region, with the smallest message being contained within the reported sequence and the larger messages having extended zzso zzso Two zzso were identified within the zzso sequence zzso the smallest zzso The first zzso of about zzso zzso resides 16 zzso prior to the translation initiation zzso and the second zzso of about zzso zzso resides 173 zzso prior to the translation termination zzso The zzso which encompasses at least 16 zzso of zzso DNA, was shown to reside on zzso zzso zzso extension techniques were used to establish that the coding sequence zzso 199 zzso downstream from the major zzso start zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream from the zzso start site reveals the presence of numerous potential zzso factor binding sites, but no zzso or zzso zzso At the message level, gene expression was at a high level in juvenile and adult cartilage, but not in the fetus or zzso The presence of protein in the cartilage zzso was also much lower in the zzso than in the zzso In zzso zzso appreciable message levels were observed only in the adult zzso
