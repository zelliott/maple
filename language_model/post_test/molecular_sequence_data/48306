zzso analysis of human zzso type 4 zzso a pathogen that is the only zzso member of species zzso provides insights into its zzso origin and molecular zzso Its zzso encodes a domain of the major zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso into the zzso chassis of a zzso zzso zzso of two recent field strains provide a clue to its adaptation to the new zzso zzso of a zzso binding site zzso which is required for efficient viral zzso from another zzso zzso This motif is absent in the zzso zzso and the zzso prototype, but is zzso amongst other zzso This is the first report of an zzso zzso event for zzso and the first documentation of a lateral partial gene transfer from a zzso zzso The potential for such zzso events are important when considering zzso zzso as candidate gene delivery zzso for human zzso
