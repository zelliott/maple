The transient synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso component of zzso cells, brings about expansion of zzso complexes zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso expressions of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso as well as the responsiveness to zzso and zzso zzso fluid zzso of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso during in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also analyzed in zzso After 12 h of culture, the area of zzso expansion in medium 199 supplemented with both 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than that in the medium supplemented with zzso or zzso zzso reduced the expansion area in the group supplemented with zzso In reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, all transcripts were identified in zzso but zzso transcript was not found in zzso Only zzso zzso was zzso in zzso indicating that zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso and zzso express zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso increased in the presence of zzso and zzso after 24 h of culture, suggesting that these genes have a positive dependency on zzso and zzso In contrast, the high level of zzso zzso was detected in zzso cultured in the medium zzso zzso slightly reduced the expression level of zzso zzso On zzso for zzso zzso was expressed apparently in zzso cultured with zzso and zzso for 24 zzso The positive zzso was distributed on zzso along the zzso of zzso cells and at the junctions between zzso cells and zzso zzso was also localized on zzso of some zzso These results indicate that 1) zzso zzso promote zzso zzso expansion and the expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells, but these are not essential for expansion of zzso cells and the expression of zzso zzso 2) zzso is involved in zzso synthesis during zzso expansion, and zzso and zzso zzso its zzso 3) the expression profile of the zzso zzso that is transcribed in zzso is different from those of zzso and zzso zzso and 4) zzso may participate in the interaction between zzso cells and zzso
