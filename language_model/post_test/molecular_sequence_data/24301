The zzso promoting activity of zzso is under the strict control of its aromatic zzso zzso that are bound by its regulatory zzso zzso The positive control function of zzso resides within the central zzso that is highly zzso among zzso of zzso zzso The zzso mediates zzso zzso and interaction with zzso zzso that are essential for zzso formation and thus initiation of zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso which are defective in distinct steps in zzso zzso were used to address the consequences of zzso binding and zzso with respect to the zzso state of zzso and its ability to promote in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso derivatives deleted of the regulatory zzso domain undergo an zzso independent zzso triggered zzso as detected by zzso In the intact zzso however, aromatic zzso zzso is required before zzso can trigger an apparent zzso switch in zzso zzso The data suggest a model in which the zzso domain controls the zzso promoting property of zzso by constraining zzso changes in its zzso zzso The results are discussed in the light of recent zzso insights from the zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso to restructure their zzso
