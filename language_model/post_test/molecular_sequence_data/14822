The zzso protein zzso is essential for regulating many cellular activities through its binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leads to many zzso zzso activity can be zzso by viral zzso including human zzso zzso that share an zzso zzso Because there are no treatments for existing zzso infection leading to nearly all cervical zzso and other zzso to a lesser extent, we screened for compounds that inhibit the ability of zzso to disrupt zzso zzso This lead to the identification of zzso compounds that bind to zzso with zzso zzso zzso constants, are competitive with the binding of viral zzso containing an zzso zzso and are selectively zzso in zzso cells alone and in zzso These zzso provide a promising scaffold for the development of therapies to treat zzso zzso
