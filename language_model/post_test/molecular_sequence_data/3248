zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in many tumors and induced by zzso in normal and zzso zzso The degree to which zzso zzso activates zzso is cell type zzso The zzso promoter region contains a zzso responsive element zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso consensus binding site plus adjacent sequence zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using transient zzso experiments with the zzso promoter region linked to a zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso was zzso activated by zzso in each of three human prostate cancer cell lines tested, with the greatest level of induction in the most differentiated cell zzso Using sequence analysis of the zzso promoter region, we identified a novel zzso distinct from the previously characterized one that consists of two consensus zzso sites arranged as zzso repeats separated by 5 zzso zzso zzso activated a promoter construct in which the previously characterized zzso was zzso and the novel zzso remained zzso zzso promoter zzso containing only one or two copies of the novel zzso plus a minimal promoter consisting of a zzso box drove zzso zzso expression of the zzso reporter gene in transient zzso zzso zzso of zzso sites within the novel zzso resulted in complete loss of zzso
