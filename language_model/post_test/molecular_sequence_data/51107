The zzso charged zzso in the zzso of zzso and the zzso region on zzso zzso 1 zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to be important for zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between these two sites was first examined by monitoring the rates of zzso and zzso modification with zzso in the presence of zzso and, zzso by testing for direct binding of zzso peptides to the zzso segment on zzso While zzso alone protected zzso from zzso zzso this effect was abolished by an zzso against the seven zzso zzso acids on zzso zzso and was greatly reduced when the charge of zzso zzso at zzso zzso was altered by zzso zzso of zzso Neither zzso nor zzso treatment reversed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results show a communication between the zzso region on zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To test whether such a communication involves the binding of the zzso site on zzso to the zzso segment of zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso experiments revealed the binding of three to six peptides per zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was affected slightly, if at all, by zzso The zzso also did not change the zzso of zzso by the zzso The peptides caused a small reduction in the binding of zzso to zzso and did not change the binding of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
