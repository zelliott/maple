Bone zzso zzso cell zzso 2 zzso also known as zzso restricts the production of a number of enveloped viruses by blocking virus release from the cell zzso This zzso activity is zzso by such viral factors as zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso human zzso but not zzso derived from African green zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso map to the zzso domain of zzso In accordance with this, expression of human zzso containing a modified zzso domain effectively blocks the replication of zzso zzso zzso in zzso T zzso Furthermore, these zzso zzso as opposed to zzso human zzso are zzso to zzso zzso as a result of an attenuated interaction with zzso In view of the work by others pointing to a key role of the zzso domain of zzso in promoting virus release, our data suggest that a direct interaction through the zzso domain of each of these two proteins is a prerequisite for zzso to zzso zzso
