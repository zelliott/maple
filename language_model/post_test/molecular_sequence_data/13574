We recently identified a new zzso gene zzso which is zzso by zzso 2 of the cucumber mosaic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and whose coding sequence zzso the zzso 69 zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso We have now found that although a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso zzso of cucumber plants, it was unable to spread zzso demonstrating involvement of zzso in long distance zzso The same zzso infected tobacco zzso with a much reduced zzso and delayed appearance of symptoms, indicating that zzso may contribute to long distance movement in this zzso zzso of the overlapping zzso part of zzso zzso did not change zzso of the zzso in either host species, ruling out zzso zzso as the reason for the change of zzso Further zzso studies with zzso containing partial deletions in zzso zzso further supported the conclusion that zzso encodes a zzso long distance movement zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso may represent a novel naturally occurring hybrid gene important to the evolutionary formation of the zzso group and that it could provide a genetic basis for the wide host range of these zzso
