We describe the results of functional studies on DNA clones zzso functional zzso receptors derived from human, zzso and mouse sources and including both zzso and complementary DNA zzso In both the zzso zzso and the zzso cell expression systems, the receptors from human and rat showed the pharmacological properties of B2 zzso but receptors from mouse displayed both zzso and zzso pharmacological zzso We further investigated the molecular relationship between the B1 and B2 zzso zzso expressed by a human zzso cell line, and we demonstrate that these two zzso zzso are zzso by distinct zzso zzso
