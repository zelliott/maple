The fork zzso genes form a zzso of a family of zzso factors united by the possession of a zzso DNA binding domain known as the fork head zzso Most zzso zzso class genes show several zzso sites of expression during development, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and floor plate, all structures known to zzso adjacent zzso In this paper I report the zzso of zzso class genes from the zzso zzso I show that zzso has two zzso class zzso named zzso and zzso molecular zzso analysis reveals that these derive from an independent zzso in the zzso zzso The expression of both genes in early development appears identical and shows striking similarities to that of zzso In zzso transcripts of both genes were detected in the presumed zzso zzso and zzso supporting zzso and zzso evidence that these are zzso between zzso and zzso This expression pattern zzso considerably with that of zzso zzso suggesting that the functional relationship between these genes in zzso is zzso with zzso zzso of both genes was maintained in the zzso and zzso up to the 6 zzso zzso After the 6 zzso stage no expression of zzso was detected and expression of zzso began to decrease in the zzso such that by the 10 zzso stage transcripts were only detected in the terminal zzso At this stage, however, a column of zzso cells was detected at the zzso zzso of the neural tube, a position occupied by the floor plate in zzso This is the first evidence that zzso has a floor plate which is specified by a mechanism zzso with zzso Taken together these data support two zzso zzso that the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and floor plate as zzso of the zzso body plan evolved prior to the separation of the zzso and zzso zzso at least 520 million years zzso zzso that the role of zzso genes in these structures predates the origin of the multiple zzso genes found in zzso
