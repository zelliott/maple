zzso zzso that can be recognized by the immune system include the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite their expression of these distinct zzso tumor elimination by the immune system is often zzso zzso mechanisms include insufficient expression of zzso or zzso molecules by tumor cells, or defective processing and presentation of zzso on their cell zzso zzso cells may also evade immune attack by expressing zzso zzso zzso or other molecules that induce zzso in activated T zzso Here we describe zzso zzso cancer zzso expressed on zzso zzso a membrane zzso expressed on human cancer zzso zzso acts as a zzso for a putative zzso present on various human cell lines and normal peripheral zzso such as zzso B and zzso zzso The zzso expression was enhanced by zzso of the zzso zzso inhibited the in zzso growth of zzso cells and induced zzso cell zzso Given these results, tumor cells may evade immune surveillance by expression of zzso which would suppress zzso expansion and induce zzso in zzso zzso immune zzso
