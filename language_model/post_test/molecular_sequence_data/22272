zzso is a member of the human zzso zzso family, the gene for which, zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso studies in the zzso indicate a highly developed network of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in the brain, suggesting that zzso peptides have important functional roles in the central nervous zzso A zzso zzso synthesis protocol was developed and used for the chemical synthesis of human zzso zzso The selectively zzso A and B chains were combined by zzso formation of each of the three zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso positioning of the three sets of zzso groups was crucial for acquisition of synthetic zzso zzso in a good overall zzso The activity of the zzso was tested against zzso family zzso zzso Although the highest activity was demonstrated on the human zzso zzso zzso the zzso also showed high activity on zzso receptors zzso from various species and variable activity on the zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso demonstrated similar activity to zzso zzso suggesting that the presence of the C zzso did not influence the zzso of the active zzso zzso zzso was also able to activate native zzso zzso It zzso increased zzso expression in zzso rat zzso zzso in a zzso manner and, following infusion into the lateral zzso of the brain, zzso water drinking in rats, zzso zzso receptors located in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is able to interact with the zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso
