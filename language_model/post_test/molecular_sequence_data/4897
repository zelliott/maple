During zzso retinal zzso zzso mediates signal zzso in the zzso outer zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso have been associated with inherited retinal zzso in a number of species, including zzso Here we have investigated the zzso upstream sequences that participate in zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the sequence from zzso to zzso zzso contained sufficient information to direct high levels of gene expression in cells of retinal zzso zzso or zzso of an zzso motif present in this region caused zzso reduction in reporter gene zzso By gel mobility shift zzso we demonstrated specific interactions between putative nuclear zzso factors and this zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso site in the human zzso promoter is functionally relevant and necessary for zzso zzso of this zzso
