A novel gene product, zzso showing zzso to the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned by differential screening from a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone represented an abundant approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis including various human zzso revealed an zzso zzso In zzso transcript zzso localized the zzso within the zzso cells lining the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis, employing a zzso zzso part of the zzso zzso domain as a probe, identified an zzso zzso gene in the human zzso zzso zzso products showing zzso sequence identity were observed in the zzso of all zzso species zzso A cloning and sequencing strategy, combining approximately zzso zzso fragments obtained by conventional zzso library construction with overlapping zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso fragments, yielded total sequence information of zzso zzso for the human zzso This sequence comprises a long open reading frame of zzso zzso A zzso search for related sequences revealed highest similarity zzso zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso extension, however, was much longer than in the other members, and showed similarity to highly zzso zzso zzso zzso
