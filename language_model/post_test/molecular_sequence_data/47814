In previous work, zzso zzso of protein function zzso functional zzso were used to identify zzso zzso active sites in high-resolution protein zzso During this analysis, a potential zzso zzso active site in the zzso protein zzso zzso crystal structure was zzso In zzso the potential zzso active site is located in close proximity to the zzso active zzso This result is interesting in view of literature suggesting that zzso zzso could be subject to zzso control mechanisms within the zzso however, the actual source of this control is zzso Additional analysis presented here shows that the putative zzso active site is highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results demonstrate the significant advantages of using zzso motifs for protein functional site zzso First, a putative zzso zzso active site has been identified in zzso zzso using a zzso built from the zzso family, proteins that have no apparent evolutionary relationship whatsoever to the zzso zzso Second, the proximity of the putative zzso zzso active site to the zzso active site provides evidence toward a regulatory control zzso No zzso method could provide either piece of zzso
