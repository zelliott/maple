The complete zzso map of zzso folded zzso human zzso growth factor II zzso was determined to verify its sequence and zzso bonding zzso Each zzso generated by zzso with zzso was zzso and characterized by zzso acid analysis, zzso acid sequence analysis, and fast atom zzso zzso Some peptides were also zzso using tandem mass zzso The zzso zzso map was compared to that of rat zzso growth factor II and to that of a zzso zzso of zzso The data obtained in these studies are consistent with the conclusion that the zzso obtained from zzso coli has the correct zzso acid zzso zzso and the native zzso zzso The binding affinities of these forms of zzso zzso for zzso carrier proteins were measured in an zzso binding protein zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was zzso less potent than native zzso in the competitive protein binding zzso These studies illustrate the need to characterize zzso zzso containing zzso bonds to allow the native structure to be verified before characterizing the biological properties of such molecules in hopes of zzso their zzso zzso
