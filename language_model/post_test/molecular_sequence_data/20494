Ring zzso are zzso hallmarks of zzso amplification in several bone and soft tissue tumors, in particular zzso zzso tumors zzso In zzso the ring zzso invariably contain amplified material from the central part of the long arm of zzso 12, mainly zzso but often also segments from other zzso are zzso Previous studies have shown that one of the zzso zzso in zzso located in zzso and harboring the candidate target genes zzso and zzso often has a sharp zzso zzso To characterize this zzso region in more detail, 12 cases of zzso with ring zzso were analyzed by array comparative zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In the seven cases showing a sharply delineated zzso in zzso the zzso region was further investigated by real time quantitative zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso The zzso clustered to a zzso region containing 11 zzso Whereas there was no indication that the zzso gave rise to fusion zzso in zzso analysis revealed that the zzso region was enriched for repeated elements that could be important for ring zzso formation in zzso
