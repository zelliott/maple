In zzso the 40 S zzso zzso serves as the platform of initiation factor zzso to place itself precisely on the zzso start zzso zzso arrangement of the 18 S zzso determines the overall shape of the 40 S zzso Here, we present genetic evaluation of zzso 18 S zzso function using 10 point zzso altering the zzso zzso All the zzso reduce the abundance of the zzso 40 zzso making it limiting for translation zzso Two of the isolated zzso zzso altering the core of the platform domain that binds zzso and zzso and zzso changing the zzso loop located below the zzso zzso show zzso indicating defective regulation of zzso zzso Evidence is provided that these zzso reduce the interaction with the components of the zzso complex, thereby zzso its function at different zzso These results indicate that the 18 S zzso zzso impair the integrity of zzso zzso complex, thereby altering the 40 S zzso response to stringent zzso zzso Interestingly, nine of the zzso alter the zzso zzso of 18 S zzso potentially affecting the bridges to the 60 S zzso but they do not change the level of 18 S zzso zzso Based on these results, we also discuss the mechanism of the selective degradation of the zzso 40 S zzso
