zzso T4 zzso zzso which removes the zzso zzso that initiate lagging strand fragments, has a zzso to zzso activity on zzso and zzso duplexes and an zzso activity on zzso or zzso DNA structures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso family of zzso and zzso replication and repair zzso The crystal structure of T4 zzso zzso in the absence of DNA, shows two zzso zzso coordinated to the zzso acids highly zzso in this zzso It also shows a zzso region proposed to be involved in DNA binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Hyde, zzso zzso Cell zzso 85, zzso To identify the zzso acids essential for zzso and DNA zzso we have constructed and characterized three kinds of T4 zzso H zzso proteins based on the possible roles of the zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso coordinated to each of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso basic zzso in or near the zzso region zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso side chains involved in the hydrogen bonding network zzso and zzso Our studies show that zzso and the zzso surrounding it are important for zzso and that zzso is necessary for DNA zzso
