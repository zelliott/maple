The zzso of human natural killer zzso cells is modulated by the major zzso complex human zzso zzso zzso molecules on the surface of the target zzso zzso zzso cells specific for the zzso zzso could be zzso generated from individuals that were zzso for zzso with zzso at zzso 77 and zzso at zzso 80 zzso by stimulation with target cells that were zzso for zzso the zzso stimulation yielded zzso cells specific for the zzso zzso However, neither zzso target cell zzso the generation of zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso Thus, these data reveal an unanticipated difference between human zzso zzso defined by this system and zzso zzso zzso
