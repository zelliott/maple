The zzso A1 transcript has a relatively short zzso untranslated region zzso starting with a zzso tract similar to that of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso Such genes code for zzso proteins and for other proteins directly or indirectly involved in the production and function of the translation zzso As expected from the role of the zzso tract in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso the A1 zzso is more efficiently loaded onto zzso in growing than in resting zzso On the other hand, a less stringent regulation with respect to that of other zzso zzso is observed, partially due to the presence of multiple zzso start sites within the zzso zzso where transcripts with shorter zzso sequences are less sensitive to zzso Thus, from the point of view of structural features and translation zzso the A1 zzso can be included in the class of zzso zzso suggesting a possible role of A1 in zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso was observed for zzso I zzso but not for zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating the existence of two classes of zzso with different zzso zzso
