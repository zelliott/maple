zzso of an zzso zzso expression library resulted in the isolation of two almost identical zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso showing zzso with sequences zzso zzso channel proteins from the zzso zzso Both clones were expressed in several zzso but not in zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the surrounding zzso zzso of zzso zzso subjected to drought were induced to accumulate even more zzso zzso which was entirely due to higher zzso gene zzso On basis of isolation procedures, sequence zzso and drought zzso of zzso we conclude that the zzso proteins probably are constituents of the zzso coat and are zzso
