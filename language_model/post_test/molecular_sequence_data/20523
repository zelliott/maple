zzso of major zzso zzso zzso and zzso is induced in rice upon recognition of zzso invasion as plant zzso zzso We recently showed that zzso genes for zzso are clustered on rice zzso 4 and zzso after zzso mimicking pathogen zzso Because genes for most zzso pathways in plants are not organized in gene zzso examination of the zzso regulating the expression of such clustered genes is zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso which is essential for zzso zzso and regulates the expression of the five genes in the zzso The zzso zzso for zzso had almost no expression of the five clustered genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or production of zzso upon zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso for zzso zzso was also largely affected in the zzso zzso although zzso zzso still zzso zzso zzso lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and zzso of zzso in response to the zzso Furthermore, enhanced expression of zzso and zzso of zzso was also zzso We also found that zzso zzso can influence zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, eventually leading to zzso production of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a key regulator of the coordinated zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for zzso zzso
