The gene which codes for zzso III of zzso coli has been zzso The zzso gene was previously zzso and defined as the gene which led to overproduction of zzso III when present on a zzso zzso and which created a zzso in zzso III activity when zzso The zzso gene was zzso and translated into a predicted zzso The molecular weight zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso acid composition of the zzso predicted from the zzso sequence are excellent agreement with those same properties determined for the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene is the structural gene for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence reveals that there is an open reading frame immediately upstream of the zzso zzso suggesting that it might be part of an zzso There is a region of zzso symmetry which could form a hairpin stem and loop structure if transcribed into zzso characteristic of a zzso zzso downstream from the zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso coli has been cloned onto a zzso zzso expression zzso which yields approximately zzso overproduction of zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso to apparent zzso using two zzso zzso Our zzso scheme allowed the preparation of 117 zzso of protein from 190 g of zzso coli with a zzso zzso The zzso protein has both zzso zzso activity and DNA zzso zzso The protein has a zzso radius of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso a molecular weight of zzso in the native state and zzso in the zzso state, and a zzso ratio of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
