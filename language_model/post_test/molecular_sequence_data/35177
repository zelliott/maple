zzso zzso strain zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso expresses a novel zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso zzso The zzso is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso recently identified in other zzso zzso strains and from zzso zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso The zzso zzso belongs to a separate family of zzso and differs in zzso temperature zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to two distinct protein families, while zzso is a member of the unrelated zzso signature zzso The zzso gene was identified in a draft zzso sequence of strain zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso degradation by strain zzso is zzso from its absence in spontaneous zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso and its presence in zzso zzso strains that lack zzso In strain zzso the zzso gene is combined with zzso gene zzso zzso the downstream pathways for zzso degradation, which are very similar to those present in zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso Our results show that the expansion of a zzso zzso zzso toward zzso degradation in zzso can involve different but zzso zzso zzso genes zzso proteins that belong to evolutionary unrelated zzso zzso This may be explained by divergent evolution and the independent acquisition of the corresponding genetic zzso
