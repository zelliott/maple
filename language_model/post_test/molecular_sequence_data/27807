A gene sequence zzso the zzso zzso hormone zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plaques were screened with a zzso zzso zzso with zzso at six ambiguous zzso zzso One clone was obtained from which we deduced an zzso gene zzso the zzso precursor zzso From zzso to zzso zzso zzso consists of a signal zzso a single zzso zzso block followed by a zzso processing site, and a zzso sequence that appears unrelated to known zzso The cloned zzso gene sequence zzso to one transcript from the adult corpus zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to contain one copy of the zzso zzso These studies are a basis for explaining synthesis of a representative from a zzso zzso important family of zzso zzso
