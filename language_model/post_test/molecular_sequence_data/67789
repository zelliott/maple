The aims of this study were to identify small zzso plasmids that carry either the zzso resistance gene zzso or the zzso resistance gene zzso and zzso them for their structure and organization with regard to their potential role as precursors of large zzso plasmids that carry these zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso from the strain collections of the two participating institutions were investigated for the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso or zzso plasmids were zzso completely and compared with sequences deposited in the zzso 

Two small zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis revealed that both plasmids had a similar organization, zzso a single resistance gene zzso or zzso a zzso replication gene zzso and three partly overlapping genes for zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Comparisons showed zzso zzso acid identity between the zzso and zzso proteins of these two zzso however, distinctly lesser percentages of identity to zzso and zzso proteins of zzso and other bacteria deposited in the databases were zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso appeared not to be typical zzso zzso The zzso to larger plasmids that zzso the genes zzso and/or zzso was limited to these resistance genes and their immediate upstream and downstream regions and thus suggested that these small plasmids were not integrated into larger zzso
