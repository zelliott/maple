zzso is a critical, direct regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during B cell development and is thus essential for the generation of a diverse repertoire of zzso zzso Although zzso regulation has been widely studied in many cell types, pathways regulating zzso in B cells have not been fully zzso By screening a panel of zzso zzso we identified zzso 215 on zzso as a novel zzso site that is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso strongly attenuated zzso of zzso but did not affect most other zzso target zzso We show that zzso a zzso protein zzso is a previously unidentified upstream regulator of zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient to activate zzso zzso in transformed and primary zzso zzso Together, our experiments show that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso via zzso of zzso in developing B zzso
