The zzso box domain is a DNA binding domain present in the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and in other proteins involved in the regulation of gene zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso and zzso bind with high affinity to DNA modified with the cancer zzso drug zzso zzso In this report, we compare the binding of full-length zzso and zzso and the zzso boxes present in these proteins to that of zzso zzso between zzso zzso or zzso Box A + B and zzso were stable at zzso or zzso 500 zzso salt, while complexes between a single zzso box and zzso exhibited decreased zzso Analysis of a series of zzso Box A zzso zzso revealed different affinities for zzso Two zzso containing a zzso to Ala substitution at position 19 and a zzso to zzso substitution at position 71, are zzso these peptides exhibited reduced affinity for zzso We have generated a structure of zzso Box A and used it, along with the results of our binding studies, to model its interaction with zzso zzso Box A binds in the minor groove of zzso in agreement with earlier zzso Our model predicts that zzso partially zzso and forms an H bond with the zzso zzso The model also suggests that zzso 19 does not directly interact with DNA, and hence an Ala substitution at position 19 may alter protein zzso This model should provide a framework for future studies examining zzso zzso zzso
