zzso structural transitions and zzso formation are a common problem both in zzso and in zzso and are of critical relevance in disparate areas such as protein processing and zzso and prion zzso zzso provide a zzso of zzso zzso zzso acting as a window onto structural zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expected to exhibit an intractable zzso form, were characterized using zzso transform infrared zzso circular zzso and electron zzso zzso resembling the silk I, silk II zzso and silk III zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal structures were identified for the zzso zzso C zzso repetitive zzso Two peptides based on silk zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso V zzso zzso as silk I under most zzso zzso treatment of zzso A resulted in a gradual transition from silk I to silk II, with an intermediate state involving a high proportion of zzso zzso total zzso zzso transform infrared zzso has been used to observe zzso changes as the peptides zzso from solution onto a zzso zzso zzso C has a zzso structure in solution but adopts a silk zzso structure upon zzso which when dried on the zzso crystal contains silk III zzso
