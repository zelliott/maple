We have characterized the primary structures of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso I from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso Different zzso and zzso techniques were used to analyze six zzso The combined data showed that the zzso carbohydrates have a core structure that is identical to the zzso zzso zzso In the bulk of the zzso the zzso arm is extended with two zzso and a zzso suggesting incomplete processing of the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso arm shows a remarkable zzso in addition to zzso and zzso the presence of a terminal zzso zzso was zzso This latter zzso has not been characterized before on zzso zzso and its function and synthesis zzso are entirely zzso The zzso zzso on zzso I can be represented as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
