zzso cells play a crucial role at the early stages of immune response against bacteria and zzso where their functionality is based on their capability of releasing highly zzso compounds, among them zzso zzso cells are considered the only cells storing zzso zzso which allows for the immediate release of this zzso upon contact with zzso We approached the question of mechanisms and zzso acid motifs directing newly zzso zzso for storage in zzso zzso by analyzing the trafficking of a series of zzso zzso fusion proteins in human mast cell lines zzso and zzso zzso covering the full zzso sequence was successfully sorted into zzso zzso in a process involving transient exposure on the outer membrane and zzso In human cells, contrary to results previously obtained in a zzso model, zzso seems not to be zzso and, thus, trafficking is zzso zzso In an effort to zzso the zzso acid motif responsible for zzso zzso we constructed additional fusion proteins and analyzed their trafficking, concluding that zzso sequences are localized in the mature chain of zzso and that the zzso tail is zzso for zzso sorting of this zzso thus excluding direct interactions with zzso zzso zzso
