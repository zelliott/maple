We have isolated the gene for transition protein 2 zzso from a human zzso clone that contains the genes for zzso 1 and zzso A zzso sequence of 1776 zzso that comprises 268 zzso of the zzso region, 400 zzso of zzso 1, zzso zzso of an zzso 17 zzso of zzso 2, and 242 zzso of the zzso region was zzso A modified zzso box, a zzso box, and two possible zzso sites were zzso zzso in zzso zzso could be detected only by zzso and zzso protection zzso By direct sequencing of the zzso products, a zzso sequence was zzso It can be deduced from these results that, in contrast to other zzso zzso the human zzso gene is expressed at a very low zzso The human gene differs from that of other zzso species by the absence of a zzso zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso Since both zzso genes are known to be localized on zzso zzso this zzso zzso holds true for the human zzso gene as zzso The genes for both zzso and zzso are arranged in a DNA stretch of 13 zzso
