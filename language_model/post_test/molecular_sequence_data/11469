Since zzso have fastidious growth requirements and conventional detection and identification requires at least 4-6 days, the development of fast but reliable detection procedures is zzso Although methods based on DNA probe technology have been developed, these are not sensitive enough for the detection of zzso zzso in food zzso Therefore a zzso procedure based on the amplification of the zzso zzso gene was developed that specifically detects the zzso zzso zzso This zzso provides an excellent tool for the rapid and sensitive isolation and identification of zzso zzso from chicken zzso In order to further identify the different zzso zzso which are difficult to distinguish by conventional methods, zzso zzso approximately DNA typing was used to select zzso DNA zzso This combination of zzso zzso and probe zzso results in a highly specific identification zzso and provides an example of specific test development without the prior need for DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso DNA typing was also used to study the epidemiology of zzso diseases caused by zzso zzso Using zzso complementary to dispersed repetitive DNA sequences and arbitrarily chosen DNA motifs zzso zzso has proven to be a fast, highly zzso and relatively simple method that can be applied in zzso investigations on zzso zzso Besides this application of zzso zzso for typing of zzso zzso this method can also be used for the development of specific DNA zzso
