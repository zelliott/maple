zzso zzso gene c in the zzso results in a failure of affected zzso to develop contracting zzso This zzso can be corrected by treating the zzso heart with zzso isolated from normal anterior zzso or from zzso zzso zzso A zzso library was constructed from the total zzso medium zzso using a random zzso technique in a zzso zzso We have previously identified a clone zzso as zzso from the constructed zzso zzso library, which has a unique zzso zzso We have also discovered that the zzso gene product is related to heart development in the Mexican zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso In the present studies, we further investigate the role of zzso on zzso and heart development in zzso zzso zzso expression has been determined by using zzso zzso with specifically designed zzso zzso embryonic hearts (at stages zzso have been zzso with zzso zzso against zzso to determine if zzso of zzso gene expression has any effect on normal heart zzso Our results show that cardiac zzso zzso expression is partially blocked in the hearts zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso gene expression results in a decrease of zzso in normal zzso although the hearts remain alive as indicated by calcium spike movement throughout the zzso zzso zzso data indicate some zzso disorganization in the hearts zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we also find that zzso gene expression is significantly decreased in the zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a novel gene in Mexican zzso and it probably plays an important role in zzso and in the initiation of zzso during heart zzso
