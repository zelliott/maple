The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region of the 150 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso The minimal region necessary for stable zzso maintenance lies within a zzso zzso fragment, as defined by transformation zzso The DNA sequence contained two open reading frames arranged in opposite zzso separated by an unusually high zzso zzso zzso sequence of 350 zzso All zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso investigated zzso zzso plasmids containing the zzso zzso however, these zzso plasmids differ by insertions and zzso zzso to the zzso and separated by a copy of each of the zzso elements zzso and zzso is the 9 zzso zzso region required for gas zzso zzso Analysis of these and other zzso element copies in zzso revealed that most of them lack the target DNA zzso usually found with recently zzso zzso zzso These results underline the plasticity of zzso zzso
