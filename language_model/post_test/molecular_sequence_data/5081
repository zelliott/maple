zzso zzso zzso zzso are important phase II zzso zzso Despite the expression of zzso proteins in many species, previous results have suggested that zzso represent the most appropriate animal model to study the zzso of steroids in zzso steroid target zzso Northern zzso analysis using a pool of human zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso transcripts in several zzso including the liver, zzso zzso breast, zzso and prostate of the zzso monkey zzso Western zzso analyses using a zzso zzso raised against human zzso protein also demonstrated expression of zzso zzso proteins in monkey zzso zzso libraries were constructed from monkey liver and prostate zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso was isolated from both zzso The zzso zzso from the prostate library is zzso zzso in length and contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 529 zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso clone produced a protein of 52 zzso The zzso zzso clone was zzso into zzso cells and a stable cell line expressing zzso protein was zzso The activity of zzso was tested with over 60 compounds and was demonstrated to be active on zzso zzso and zzso steroids, zzso zzso and several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso steroids with high affinity and efficiency with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso testosterone, zzso and zzso zzso It is apparent that this zzso zzso zzso is specific for more different classes of steroids than any other zzso zzso characterized to date, and may be related to the high plasma levels of zzso zzso steroids found in the zzso zzso
