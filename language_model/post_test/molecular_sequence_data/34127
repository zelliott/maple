zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso How it remains in the zzso has been zzso We report that a zzso zzso domain zzso directs zzso retention of zzso within the zzso by excluding it from zzso exit sites, as has been previously reported for short zzso zzso zzso We show that despite the zzso zzso similarity to zzso it does not traverse the zzso defining zzso as a zzso zzso membrane protein and requiring a new paradigm to explain zzso zzso retention and membrane association are zzso by a subset of zzso zzso to the zzso suggesting that a zzso structure with defined orientation in the membrane is zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso as might be expected for a zzso zzso membrane zzso We propose that the principle of zzso protein sorting extends to zzso membrane zzso and identify other proteins including the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso H zzso 1) that share this mechanism of retention with zzso
