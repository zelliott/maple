The ability to generate and obtain full-length zzso zzso is of critical importance to the field of zzso Most zzso in a traditional zzso library lack the initiating zzso zzso making it difficult to obtain a FL zzso We report here on an improved protocol for the preparation of FL enriched zzso zzso We demonstrate that if good quality zzso is used in the zzso zzso zzso FL zzso can be generated for messages upward of 7 zzso In addition, we demonstrate the utility of size zzso as a means to produce libraries containing a high percentage of initiating zzso zzso containing clones with insert sizes greater than 4 zzso The method is simple, cost efficient, and can be performed in most laboratories equipped to perform molecular zzso Lastly, the novel zzso used in the analysis of the zzso and library should prove useful to others working to create high-quality zzso zzso
