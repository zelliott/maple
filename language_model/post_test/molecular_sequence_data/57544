The molecular structure of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso techniques and refined to a conventional zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso exists as a symmetrical zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso surface area is buried upon zzso The zzso displays a novel fold that contains a central zzso zzso The zzso surface of the zzso is covered by seven zzso whereas the zzso interface is primarily a flat surface composed of zzso The protein zzso binds two molecules of zzso zzso each of which has zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso carbon atom of zzso zzso Both zzso groups of these zzso are buried within the zzso core of the zzso One of the zzso contributes to interactions at the zzso zzso The zzso protein displays considerable zzso acid sequence zzso with both zzso and zzso of bacterial zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso shared between zzso and the zzso zzso cluster predominantly in two distinct regions of the zzso protein zzso These zzso regions in the zzso zzso probably share a three-dimensional fold similar to that of the zzso zzso
