The zzso hormone zzso derived from zzso zzso is generated by a zzso processing mechanism involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the brain, zzso is produced in the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso and in the nucleus of the solitary tract zzso of the zzso This zzso is key in controlling energy balance, as judged by changes observed at zzso zzso However, little information is available regarding the zzso of the precursor zzso and the production of its processed peptides during zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso in the ARC compared with the zzso in conjunction with the PC zzso In this study we found that, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all decreased during zzso and administration of zzso reversed these zzso In contrast, in the zzso where there is a large amount of a zzso zzso similar in size to zzso the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso including zzso were further accumulated in zzso conditions, whereas zzso zzso zzso These changes were not reversed by zzso We also observed that, during zzso zzso levels decreased in the zzso These data suggest that, in the zzso zzso induced changes in zzso zzso and processing is independent of zzso These observations indicate that changes in energy status affect zzso in the brain in a zzso zzso This represents a novel aspect in the regulation of energy balance and may have implications in the zzso of zzso
