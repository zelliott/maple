The identification of the zzso of sensitivity and resistance to broadly zzso zzso is a high priority for human zzso virus zzso zzso An analysis of the swarm of closely related envelope protein zzso in an zzso individual revealed a zzso that markedly affected sensitivity to zzso by zzso and zzso entry zzso targeting both zzso and zzso This zzso mapped to the zzso zzso of zzso and disrupted an unexplored structural feature consisting of a ring of hydrogen bonds in the zzso zzso This zzso appeared to affect the assembly of the zzso bundle required for virus fusion and to alter the zzso zzso so as to favor the zzso intermediate zzso required for the binding of the membrane zzso external zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso drug zzso zzso The zzso zzso method we describe zzso our understanding of the relationships among the structure, function, and zzso of the zzso envelope protein and represents a new approach to the identification of vaccine zzso
