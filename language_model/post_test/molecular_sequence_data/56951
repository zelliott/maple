Rapid diffusion of zzso molecules across the outer membrane of zzso has been related to the presence of a protein of 29 to 37 zzso called zzso zzso channel zzso able to generate large zzso pores when integrated in zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of zzso from different origins appear highly zzso in artificial zzso at low zzso zzso the channel is in a highly conducting state, but a raise of the potential (both positive and zzso reduces drastically the current and changes the zzso selectivity from slightly zzso to zzso It has thus been suggested that zzso is not a mere molecular sieve but that it may control zzso physiology by restricting the access of zzso of different zzso in response to zzso and/or by interacting with a soluble protein of the zzso zzso The latest application of the patch clamp and zzso techniques, however, has indicated both a different electric behavior of the outer membrane and that other proteins may play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso studies, use of zzso zzso and electron zzso of two-dimensional crystal zzso of zzso have contributed to propose a zzso beta barrel as the structural model of the zzso An important insight into the physiology of the inner membrane of zzso zzso has come from the direct observation of the membrane with the patch zzso A slightly zzso zzso zzso of 107 zzso and one of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the best characterized at the single channel zzso Under certain conditions, however, the inner membrane can also show zzso zzso peak zzso possibly arising from a cooperative assembly of multiple zzso
