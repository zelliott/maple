The zzso small nuclear zzso zzso U2, zzso and zzso are transcribed by zzso zzso II as precursors with extensions at their 3' zzso The 3' processing of these zzso is not understood in zzso Two pathways of zzso zzso 3' processing in zzso were revealed in the present investigation by using a series of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso 3' ends were initially shortened by three or four zzso (which is the first step in zzso and the correct mature 3' end was then rapidly zzso In contrast, certain zzso zzso zzso displayed an zzso 3' processing zzso typified by the persistence of zzso representing zzso at each zzso bond in the precursor 3' zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a potential zzso interaction between zzso in the precursor 3' extension and a sequence located between the zzso domain and zzso III of U2 zzso zzso processing competition experiments using a highly zzso zzso zzso 3' processing activity suggested that only zzso capable of this zzso interaction had high affinity for the zzso zzso 3' processing zzso The importance of this zzso zzso interaction between the precursor 3' extension and the internal region between the zzso domain and zzso III was confirmed by the results obtained with a zzso substitution that restores the base zzso which displayed the normal 3' processing zzso These results zzso a zzso zzso structure involving sequences on both sides of the mature zzso site in the 3' processing of human U2 zzso
