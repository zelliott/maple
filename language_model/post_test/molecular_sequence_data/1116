Because zzso connect regular secondary structures, analysis of the former depends directly on the definition of the zzso The numerous assignment methods, however, can offer different zzso In a previous study, we defined a structural alphabet composed of 16 average protein fragments, which we called zzso zzso zzso They allow an accurate description of every region of zzso protein zzso and have been used in local structure zzso In the present study, we use this structural alphabet to analyze and predict the zzso connecting two repetitive zzso 

We first analyzed the secondary structure zzso Use of five different assignment methods zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the absence of zzso zzso of the zzso were assigned to different zzso The discrepancies were particularly important at the zzso of the repetitive zzso We used zzso to describe and predict the short zzso because they can help analyze and in part explain these zzso An analysis of the zzso distribution in these regions showed some zzso in the zzso zzso Of the zzso acid zzso or zzso observed in the short loop zzso zzso did not appear in the entire zzso Finally, predicting zzso structure in terms of zzso with a zzso approach yielded an accuracy rate of zzso for all zzso and zzso for the short zzso zzso learning in the short zzso increased the latter by zzso 

This work highlights the difficulties of assigning repetitive structures and the advantages of using more precise descriptions, that is, zzso We observed some new zzso acid zzso in the short zzso and used this information to enhance local zzso Instead of describing entire zzso our approach predicts each position in the zzso zzso It can thus be used to propose many different structures for the zzso and to probe and sample their zzso It can be a useful tool in zzso zzso loop zzso
