zzso forms of receptors for tumor necrosis factor zzso might be important for regulating the actions of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was employed to examine the processing of the zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso chain zzso into soluble zzso protein zzso An zzso sequence close to the zzso region in zzso was indicated as a putative zzso site for zzso zzso By zzso zzso and Val were replaced with zzso and Ala, zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in identical binding of zzso to zzso receptors as compared to receptors not subjected to zzso zzso rates of receptors as judged by disappearance of zzso binding capacity after zzso of de zzso protein synthesis and zzso in response to incubation with zzso zzso were also identical between zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso site resulted in a decreased spontaneous and zzso zzso release of soluble zzso zzso which was almost abolished when both zzso and Val were zzso Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of an zzso sequence for zzso processing of the zzso into soluble zzso and indicate that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso may be zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso
