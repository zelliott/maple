The zzso of cardiac muscle zzso I zzso at two adjacent zzso zzso zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso response of the heart to zzso zzso of these zzso has been shown to reduce the zzso affinity of the single zzso regulatory site of cardiac zzso C zzso and to increase the rate of zzso zzso from this site zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Potter, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies zzso zzso zzso zzso and Potter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 76, zzso have correlated this increase in zzso zzso with a reduced zzso sensitivity of force development and a faster rate of cardiac muscle relaxation in a zzso zzso zzso cardiac muscle zzso To further determine the role of the two zzso zzso sites in mouse zzso zzso 22 and 23), zzso 22 or 23, or both were zzso to zzso The wild type and the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso Using these zzso it was found that zzso 23 was zzso more rapidly than zzso 22 and that both zzso are required to be zzso in order to observe the characteristic reduction in the zzso sensitivity of force development seen in a zzso cardiac muscle zzso The latter result confirms that zzso zzso of zzso and not other zzso is responsible for this change in zzso zzso The results also suggest that one of the zzso (23) may be zzso zzso and that zzso 22 may be functionally more zzso
