zzso and zzso are zzso critical to the development of T zzso zzso immune responses, which are associated with zzso and zzso and exert their actions through three different combinations of shared zzso Here we present the crystal structures of the complete set of type I zzso zzso and type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The type I complex reveals a structural basis for zzso ability to recognize six different zzso The two type II complexes zzso an unusual zzso zzso domain on zzso zzso for a novel mode of zzso engagement that contributes to a reversal in the zzso versus zzso zzso complex assembly zzso which are zzso through substantially different recognition zzso We also show that the type II zzso zzso signals with different zzso in response to zzso versus zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso interactions are modulating zzso zzso signaling zzso
