The zzso zzso zzso zzso has three putative zzso zzso of the zzso family, named zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation under zzso pH zzso Here we characterize zzso which contains a zzso zzso domain and a WW domain but lacks a C2 zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso and further enhanced by nitrogen zzso A zzso zzso gave no remarkable zzso but intensified temperature sensitivity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the temperature sensitivity of zzso cells, which suggests that the function of zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso of zzso by a strong zzso promoter in zzso strains caused growth arrest and cell zzso probably zzso to defects in zzso progression or the zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso of zzso did not reduce the levels of zzso zzso was found throughout the cell, especially at the cell surface in the polar zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso in its putative zzso zzso domain that can be zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso caused a functional zzso because growth arrest and cell zzso were not induced by zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso domain was replaced by the zzso zzso domain, completely suppressed the temperature sensitivity of zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso domain of zzso has the zzso activity of a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that shares partially overlapping function with zzso
