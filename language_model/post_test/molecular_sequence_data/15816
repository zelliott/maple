A zzso zzso has been isolated from Walker 256 rat zzso cells which can convert zzso zzso zzso to a zzso DNA zzso zzso agent by reduction of its zzso group to the corresponding zzso species zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso zzso Knox zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has now been identified as a form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by comparison of partial protein zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso of the isolated Walker cell zzso This observation could explain the reported zzso action of the zzso zzso to the zzso effects of CB zzso
