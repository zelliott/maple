A reliable method for high-resolution zzso typing using the combination of zzso amplification and zzso analysis is zzso zzso amplification was carried out for the zzso of two groups using the two primer pairs under the same zzso zzso One group contains zzso and zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso and zzso zzso Computer analysis on zzso patterns for 19 zzso of the zzso gene showed that the 11 zzso of the former group could be distinguished with five restriction zzso and the eight zzso of the latter group could be distinguished with four zzso We could reduce the number of restriction zzso required compared with the number used in previous studies because we selected appropriate restriction zzso which had at least one recognition site in almost all zzso zzso as a form of internal zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso which were indistinguishable using the previously reported zzso methods, could be distinguished by the present zzso The results of typing of 100 samples from Japanese individuals by this method showed no zzso with the results obtained by zzso zzso The calculated zzso zzso showed good agreement with those reported at the 11th International zzso zzso
