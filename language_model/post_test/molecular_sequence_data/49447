We report an zzso system of self zzso expression that examines the relationship between serum protein levels and central T cell zzso This transgenic approach is based on zzso expression of a zzso form of zzso egg zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso serum levels of the zzso protein are extremely low zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the mice show partial tolerance to both zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso expression increases to zzso zzso and the mice are completely zzso zzso tolerance was further investigated by crossing these mice to strains expressing transgenic zzso At the lowest zzso levels, zzso T cells zzso for zzso escape the zzso and approximately zzso of zzso zzso express the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso T cells zzso for zzso egg zzso are completely eliminated by negative zzso These data define a zzso threshold for negative selection of zzso T cells by circulating self proteins that are zzso more sensitive than previously zzso They suggest that partial tolerance at extremely low levels of self zzso exposure is the result of a restricted repertoire of responding T cells, rather than a simple reduction in precursor zzso zzso thresholds are T cell zzso
