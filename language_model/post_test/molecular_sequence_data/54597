Recently, a complex zzso zzso B virus zzso zzso first reported in 2000, was proposed as a new zzso although this was zzso immediately because the strains differ by less than zzso in zzso distance from zzso zzso Over zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the Long An cohort in China were not assigned to a specific zzso using current zzso tools to zzso surface zzso zzso and these have about zzso similarity to the zzso zzso To determine whether this close identity extends to the full-length sequences and to investigate the evolutionary history of the Long An zzso zzso 17 complete zzso sequences were zzso They are highly similar zzso to the Vietnamese strains and, although some reach or exceed zzso zzso sequence difference from all known zzso they cluster together in the same zzso separating in a zzso tree from the zzso C zzso Analysis of zzso reveals that all but one of the Long An zzso resembles the Vietnamese zzso in that they result from apparent zzso between zzso C and a parent of unknown zzso zzso which shows similarity in part to zzso zzso The exception, isolate zzso has a greater proportion of zzso C zzso zzso analysis reveals that these zzso probably arose in southern China and spread later to Vietnam and zzso
