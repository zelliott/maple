zzso zzso signaling provides growth promoting signals in many forms of zzso We performed molecular modeling and molecular dynamics studies of the interaction between the regulatory zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso and 6 with zzso peptides of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and T cell zzso The studies give insight into the zzso binding specificity of the zzso zzso zzso and provide the first model for the differential zzso of zzso or zzso by two distinct regions of the viral Tip zzso The biological relevance of the modeled interactions was then confirmed by zzso studies using corresponding zzso zzso and finally by respective zzso zzso The functional data give experimental validation of the molecular dynamics study, and provide evidence for the involvement of zzso in the zzso induced T cell zzso
