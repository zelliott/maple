Live attenuated bacteria have great potential for use in vaccine development due to several unique advantages, including stable zzso zzso effective zzso zzso convenient and inexpensive delivery, and low cost of vaccine zzso In this study, we expressed zzso B virus zzso gene zzso on mouse melanoma cells as the target zzso and constructed zzso zzso vaccines by two strategies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Type III zzso system zzso fusion zzso Both zzso zzso zzso significant levels of zzso reaction and zzso zzso T zzso When mice were challenged with melanoma cells expressing zzso tumor growth rates in zzso animals were significantly slower than zzso zzso sizes and tumor weight zzso of zzso mice were also significantly lower than zzso We conclude that both strategies described in this study may lead to novel approaches of tumor zzso
