zzso carrier protein is an integral component of many cellular zzso zzso A number of studies have reported zzso behavior in zzso carrier zzso Although zzso exhibit high levels of similarity in their primary and zzso structures, zzso behavior is restricted to only some zzso that can be classified into two major families based on their zzso The first family of zzso is involved in zzso zzso whereas the second family zzso in fatty acid zzso zzso by the growing number of zzso sequences available for zzso large-scale zzso studies were used in these studies to uncover as to how zzso behavior of zzso carrier proteins is linked with the evolution of zzso pathways in zzso These studies show that zzso behavior in zzso carrier proteins was lost during the course of evolution, with certain organisms and zzso zzso zzso retaining it for specified zzso
