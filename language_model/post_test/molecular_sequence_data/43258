Treatment of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells by the zzso containing zzso inhibitor I resulted in the induction of a zzso protein that was partially zzso and shown to be a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sharma, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso chain reaction, we have zzso the zzso for this protein zzso zzso This zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso zzso and shows greatest zzso acid sequence identity to mouse zzso growth zzso protein and mouse zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso sequence identity, zzso The zzso exhibits about zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and about zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that it is induced in preference to either zzso or zzso and zzso protection zzso showed gene expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in descending order of zzso The zzso for this zzso zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed kinetic properties distinct from either zzso or zzso including the ability to metabolize zzso This protein joins a growing number of zzso zzso zzso that may play a role in cellular regulation and zzso
