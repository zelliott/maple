The use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis has been used to identify a unique genetic marker on the zzso oral vaccine zzso This method was also used to characterize the genetic profiles of a number of other zzso zzso This procedure takes advantage of the zzso differences between the zzso strain, and the Miller and Purdue zzso Within the S gene there are three zzso differences between the zzso strain and the published Purdue zzso There are additional zzso differences in the structural and zzso gene zzso but we have chosen to focus on the differences contained within the S zzso The zzso strain has a closer sequence zzso to the Purdue strain than to the Miller zzso The zzso and Purdue strains contain a six zzso deletion at position zzso that is not present in the Miller published sequence or the zzso strain of zzso (based on our zzso zzso We have designed a zzso zzso whose sequence is zzso to a region located 80 zzso upstream of the zzso and zzso S gene initiation zzso to be used in conjunction with either of two 3' zzso whose sequences are identical with the exception of the last six zzso of their 3' zzso When zzso with the appropriate zzso conditions, these zzso can differentiate between zzso Miller and Purdue zzso virus zzso These zzso products were then subjected to zzso analysis using four separate restriction zzso zzso II, zzso I, zzso III, or zzso zzso We have used this procedure to analyze six zzso vaccine zzso zzso derived virulent zzso cell cultured viruses at different cell passage numbers, and field zzso of zzso or zzso
