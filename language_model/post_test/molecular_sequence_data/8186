We chose the zzso 15 cells as an in zzso cell culture zzso system, and identified the surface zzso zzso of zzso B virus zzso DNA in the cells, by using the amplification of zzso chain reaction and directed sequencing of amplified zzso According to the result of the sequencing, a zzso zzso analogue of the zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso region was zzso and then linked with two zzso zzso The zzso human serum zzso coupled zzso and the zzso zzso The effect of different modifications of zzso on the expression of zzso gene was compared by using the zzso 15 zzso In the same experimental conditions, the zzso effects of surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and those of zzso and zzso by zzso were zzso and zzso In the same time, the amount of zzso zzso in culture zzso and cells was depressed zzso Thus, the zzso targeted zzso to the zzso were more effective zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso were effective and specific zzso of zzso replication and zzso caused the zzso zzso of viral proteins and had no effect on cellular zzso synthesis and no zzso
