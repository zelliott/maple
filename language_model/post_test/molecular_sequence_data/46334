The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize new zzso that zzso a wide range of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Fifteen zzso were isolated from pepper, tomato and tobacco plant zzso infected with zzso zzso A host specificity analysis of the isolated zzso using nine strains of zzso zzso indicated great zzso diversity in a single zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso showed clear plaques on all nine bacterial hosts tested and were virtually identical in zzso and zzso zzso an zzso is a long, flexible, zzso zzso carrying a circular zzso sense zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso DNA sequences of zzso exhibited nine open reading frames zzso that were not highly similar to those of other zzso infecting zzso zzso The zzso organization of zzso was partially similar to that of zzso of zzso zzso One zzso of zzso showed identity to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso toxin of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also present in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso However, zzso a highly virulent strain in tomato, was still sensitive to zzso zzso 

A new, flexible, zzso zzso zzso infected wide range of zzso zzso strains and carried unique circular zzso DNA zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be a new type of temperate zzso based on its zzso nature on a wide range of hosts and the presence of a zzso zzso in a host bacterial zzso
