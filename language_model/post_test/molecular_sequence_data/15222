The variations in zzso zzso during zzso zzso in freshwater zzso appear to depend on numerous factors, which have still not been fully zzso To contribute to clarify the situation, we have developed a spatial sampling approach to determine the dynamics and genetic diversity of a zzso population of zzso zzso in a large French zzso and the variations in the proportions of zzso zzso We demonstrated that marked changes occurred in the internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso composition of the zzso zzso population during the development of the zzso These changes led progressively to the selection of one dominant ITS zzso throughout the entire zzso when the cell number reached its zzso At the same time, we identified a decrease in the proportion of the zzso zzso and a significant negative correlation between this proportion and that of the dominant ITS zzso during the zzso Thus, it appeared that favorable conditions for zzso cell growth led to the selection, within the zzso population, of a zzso zzso whereas potentially zzso zzso were dominant in this population before and after the zzso when environmental conditions were less favorable for zzso
