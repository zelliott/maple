zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso are key elements in zzso signaling and have been implicated as regulators of more complex biological processes such as differentiation and zzso The G protein G alpha zzso is capable of zzso the zzso control of zzso and regulates stem cell differentiation to primitive zzso Here an zzso zzso to G alpha zzso was expressed in a hybrid zzso construct whose expression was both zzso and induced at zzso zzso mice in which the zzso construct was expressed displayed a lack of normal development in targeted zzso that correlated with the absence of G alpha zzso The loss of G alpha zzso expression in zzso tissue of the transgenic mice was correlated with a rise in zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and the loss of zzso zzso of zzso These data expand our understanding of G protein function in zzso and demonstrate the necessity for G alpha zzso in the development of liver and zzso
