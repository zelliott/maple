zzso of adjacent zzso zzso into a zzso forms a strained zzso zzso This motif was tested as the basis for an zzso with an artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced into two different structural contexts in zzso A zzso zzso by zzso zzso to produce the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in an zzso whereas zzso and zzso are located in a surface zzso Only zzso zzso A had the desired zzso The zzso activity of this zzso decreases by zzso upon zzso The new zzso bond also decreases the zzso stability of the zzso zzso Reduction with zzso restores full zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of adjacent zzso zzso in a proper context can be used to zzso zzso zzso
