The recent cloning of plant resistance zzso genes and the sequencing of resistance gene clusters have shed light on the molecular evolution of R zzso However, up to now, no attempt has been made to correlate this molecular evolution with the zzso zzso process at the population zzso zzso were carried out between 26 strains of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and 48 zzso zzso plants collected in the three centers of diversity of the host zzso A high level of diversity for resistance against the pathogen was zzso Most of the resistance zzso were overcome in zzso situations, indicating an adaptation of the pathogen to the local zzso In contrast, plants were generally resistant to zzso zzso suggesting that R genes that were efficient against exotic strains but had been overcome locally were maintained in the plant zzso These results indicated that zzso processes between the two protagonists led to a differentiation for resistance in the three centers of diversity of the zzso To improve our understanding of the molecular evolution of these different zzso a zzso zzso zzso population derived from two representative zzso of the Andean zzso and zzso zzso gene pools was used to map zzso zzso A gene cluster zzso both Andean zzso zzso and zzso zzso host resistance zzso was identified, suggesting that this locus existed prior to the separation of the two major gene pools of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a high level of complexity at this zzso It harbors 11 restriction zzso length zzso when R gene analog zzso clones are zzso The relationship between the zzso process and diversification of resistance zzso at resistance gene clusters is zzso
