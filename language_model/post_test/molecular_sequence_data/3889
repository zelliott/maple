zzso interactions involving the zzso hairpin of zzso zzso P zzso are thought to form a structural zzso to support zzso folding and zzso We determined the structure of this element by zzso and refined the structure using residual zzso zzso from a sample zzso oriented in a dilute liquid zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso refinement improved the global precision of the structure from zzso to zzso A (to the zzso revised the bend angle between segments of the zzso stem and zzso the structure of the loop zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contains two stacks of bases on opposite sides of the loop, distinguishing it from zzso zzso The unusual zzso of the juxtaposed zzso zzso within the zzso may explain their requirement in zzso zzso
