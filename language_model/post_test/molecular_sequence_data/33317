The human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both result in a zzso protein zzso with a unique zzso zzso that can be detected by the zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso was expressed in zzso and in zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso In this study we aimed at further investigating the zzso zzso expression and we started by affinity zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso zzso zzso although other zzso directed against the zzso and zzso of zzso still revealed zzso zzso as described zzso With an in-depth analysis of a western zzso followed by mass zzso we discovered that the previously detected zzso zzso expression was due to zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso fluorescent zzso and western zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso against zzso Our data imply that zzso can accumulate in some zzso structures in zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso zzso clearly revealed a specific zzso of zzso in the adult human zzso These large zzso are present throughout the brain, zzso along the zzso zone, in the zzso in the zzso and in the spinal zzso of controls, zzso and Parkinson zzso The presence of a specific zzso suggests a specialized function of these zzso
