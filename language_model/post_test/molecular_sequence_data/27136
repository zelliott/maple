The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a very important target for T cell recognition during infection with zzso zzso Although zzso contains numerous potential T cell zzso the immune response during infection is often focused toward a few zzso zzso By zzso with individual overlapping synthetic peptides in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso contains several zzso zzso that are not recognized in zzso mice either during tuberculosis infection or after zzso with zzso zzso with a truncated zzso zzso zzso that lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso the response to include T cells directed to these zzso zzso After zzso infection of zzso mice, T cells directed to both dominant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and are recruited to the zzso The zzso response consists mainly of double- zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso This zzso quality of the zzso T cell response is maintained unchanged even during the later stages of infection, whereas the naturally occurring infection stimulates a response to the zzso zzso that consist almost exclusively of zzso zzso T zzso zzso and zzso both give significant protection against zzso challenge with zzso but the most efficient protection against pulmonary infection is zzso by the zzso T cell repertoire primed by zzso
