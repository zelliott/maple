We have identified a new protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is common to several zzso zzso of widely differing zzso origin and zzso zzso The core of each zzso is zzso an zzso sheet, not barrel, of eight zzso connected by zzso These zzso have zzso from a common zzso so as to preserve the arrangement of the zzso zzso not the binding zzso They all have a zzso zzso the elements of which are borne on zzso which are the zzso structural features in the zzso Only the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is completely zzso with the zzso and acid zzso accommodating more than one type of zzso zzso The unique zzso and sequence arrangement of the zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso which is, in a sense, a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso There are now four groups of zzso which contain zzso zzso and which are related by zzso evolution towards a stable, useful active zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso fold zzso
