zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso produced in the membrane by zzso zzso is a strong zzso agent of primary zzso zzso We recently raised a zzso zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated the presence of zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso in which intense zzso was associated primarily with zzso foam cells zzso et zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso 42, zzso To identify the structure of the zzso in the protein recognized by zzso in the present study, we exposed chain B from bovine insulin zzso B zzso to zzso and characterized the zzso zzso by mass zzso The zzso insulin B chain was zzso with zzso zzso and the resulting peptides were subjected to liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analyses confirmed the formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and the zzso of insulin B zzso The zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso including the zzso zzso using zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso was more significant than the zzso zzso The results of this study chemically characterized that the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso generated in the zzso group of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in the protein and the structure of the zzso recognized by zzso were zzso zzso in zzso
