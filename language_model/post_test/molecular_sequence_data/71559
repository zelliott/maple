zzso zzso zzso is an inherited disease characterized by progressive zzso dysfunction, occasionally associated with adrenal zzso The classic form of zzso usually has onset in childhood zzso cerebral zzso with rapid zzso deterioration leading to a zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso also presents with rapidly progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and Addison disease only also have been zzso Despite discovery of the zzso zzso a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be zzso 

To conduct zzso analyses in 29 Japanese patients with zzso from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of zzso in this zzso and to study zzso correlations in Japanese zzso 

The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral zzso 11 patients with zzso cerebral zzso and 5 patients with zzso We conducted detailed zzso analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with zzso by zzso Southern zzso analysis and direct zzso sequence analysis of reverse zzso chain reaction products derived from total zzso that was extracted from cultured skin zzso zzso cells, or peripheral blood zzso 

Three patients with zzso cerebral zzso were identified as having large zzso zzso The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent zzso including 12 novel zzso resulting in small zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 26 zzso were zzso zzso Most zzso zzso involved zzso acids zzso in zzso gene products, including zzso zzso and zzso The AG zzso deletion at position zzso which has been reported previously to be the most common zzso in white patients zzso was also identified as the most common zzso in Japanese patients zzso All zzso were associated with zzso resulting in protein zzso or subtle zzso acid zzso There were no differences in zzso expressions between zzso zzso involving zzso zzso acids and those involving zzso zzso zzso 

There are no obvious correlations between the zzso of patients with zzso and their zzso suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the zzso expressions of zzso
