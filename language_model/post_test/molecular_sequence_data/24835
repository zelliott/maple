zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso are modular scaffolds that organize signaling complexes at zzso and other cell zzso zzso contain zzso zzso which recruit signaling zzso as well as a zzso zzso 3 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain, implicated in scaffold zzso The crystal structure of the zzso module from zzso reveals that these zzso form an integrated unit: the zzso fold comprises zzso sequence elements divided by a hinge region and the zzso zzso These elements compose two zzso that can assemble in either an zzso or zzso fashion to complete the zzso zzso We propose a model for zzso zzso in which complementary zzso zzso associate by zzso domain zzso This model provides a possible mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso
