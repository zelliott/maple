We have analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso structure of zzso zzso an zzso family member recently discovered in human and zzso While human zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso we observe expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso related zzso including the zzso zzso stomach, and zzso but not in zzso The expression patterns in adult and day zzso zzso are zzso We have detected multiple zzso zzso varying in the zzso domain coding sequence and zzso prime or minute untranslated region due to alternative zzso and zzso events that occur in the final four zzso and three zzso The entire zzso gene spans 55 zzso and contains 23 zzso The protein sequence contains all zzso zzso required for zzso activity, indicative of a role in zzso shedding and zzso zzso zzso Given its unique expression pattern and potential functions, zzso zzso may play a role in zzso and zzso functions such as zzso T cell zzso
