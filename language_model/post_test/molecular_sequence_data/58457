We have recently cloned the gene responsible for the mouse neurological disorder zzso zzso The predicted product of this zzso zzso zzso is a neural zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso with an zzso zzso binding zzso Here we report on the cloning and characterization of mouse zzso zzso analysis revealed extended zzso of zzso with both the zzso binding domain zzso and the zzso portions of zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso display similar zzso diversity and zzso similar sized transcripts in the nervous zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso sequences suggests a recent evolutionary origin and that these proteins form a separate novel zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso Given the implication of several zzso binding proteins in genetic disorders, it is important to know the pattern of zzso zzso zzso transcripts are detected principally in zzso brain, spinal cord, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and zzso zzso zzso expression in lung is strongly induced just before birth and is restricted to type II zzso zzso To determine whether spontaneous zzso that may be defective in zzso exist, we have mapped the zzso gene to mouse zzso zzso
