zzso zzso of native zzso zzso zzso receptors increases channel zzso by zzso protein interactions involving the zzso zzso zzso region, which is found in the zzso loop between zzso zzso 3 and 4 zzso et zzso zzso However, many drugs, predicted to act on different zzso zzso zzso increase channel zzso leading us to zzso that zzso variation in zzso receptors may be a general property, zzso by protein interactions involving the zzso MA stretch of zzso zzso In this study we have tested this hypothesis by zzso zzso zzso currents with zzso and examining the ability of peptides mimicking either the zzso or zzso MA region to affect zzso In zzso zzso patches from newborn rats the general zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producing either an increase in open probability and single-channel zzso or an increase in open zzso as described previously zzso et zzso zzso In patches displaying high zzso channels application of a zzso MA zzso but not a scrambled version or the equivalent zzso MA zzso reduced the zzso effects of zzso significantly reducing single-channel zzso In contrast, when zzso currents were zzso by the zzso drug zzso the zzso MA zzso had no zzso These data reveal that zzso and zzso zzso different zzso zzso zzso zzso but both drugs zzso zzso zzso One interpretation of the data is that these drugs elicit zzso through protein interactions and that the MA peptides compete with these interactions to disrupt this zzso
