A unique combination of zzso conditions prevails in the lower zzso layer zzso of the brine pool at Atlantis II zzso Deep in the Red zzso With a maximum depth of over 2000 zzso the pool is characterized by zzso pH zzso high temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso low light levels, zzso and high zzso of heavy zzso We have established a zzso zzso derived from the microbial community in the zzso and here we describe a gene for a novel zzso zzso a key component of the bacterial zzso system for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene and an zzso from an zzso soil zzso were zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The properties of their products show that, in contrast to the soil zzso the zzso zzso zzso is functional in high salt, stable at high temperatures, resistant to high zzso of zzso and efficiently zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, despite the marked functional differences between the zzso their zzso acid sequences differ by less than zzso zzso zzso and kinetic analysis of the zzso zzso in conjunction with three-dimensional zzso have identified distinct structural features that contribute to extreme zzso zzso and high zzso capacity, suggesting that these were acquired independently during the evolution of this zzso Thus, our work provides fundamental structural insights into a novel protein that has undergone multiple zzso and zzso adaptations to promote the survival of zzso that reside in the extremely demanding environment of the zzso
