Individual zzso muscles and heart zzso are specified at defined positions within the zzso layer of zzso The expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso identifies one specific subset of cells in the zzso zzso which give rise to particular zzso cells and zzso body wall zzso zzso analysis has shown that the induction of eve in these cells involves the combined activities of genes zzso zzso factors, such as zzso zzso and zzso restricted signaling activities that are largely derived from the zzso particularly those zzso by wingless zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells during an extended zzso zzso We demonstrate further that a zzso active zzso of eve contains several zzso and Tin binding sites that are essential for zzso activity in zzso This zzso also contains a number of binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso which are required for full levels of zzso zzso However, we find that their main function is to prevent zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso This suggests that, in the absence of zzso zzso Pan binding serves to abrogate the synergistic activities of zzso and Tin in eve zzso while, in cells that receive zzso signals, Pan is converted into a zzso that promotes eve zzso Together, these data show that the eve zzso zzso several regulatory pathways via the zzso binding of the zzso regulator Tin and the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
