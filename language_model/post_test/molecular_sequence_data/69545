The solution structure of zzso a zzso bee zzso zzso has been characterized by circular zzso zzso two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and distance zzso A total of 21 lowest error structures were obtained from distance geometry zzso zzso of these structures shows that the backbone of zzso is very well zzso One zzso reverse turn from zzso 4 to 7 and an zzso from zzso 12 to 19 exist in the structure of zzso The zzso region is best defined from both zzso analysis and structural zzso The overall three-dimensional structure of zzso is highly compact resulting from side chain zzso The structural information obtained from CD and zzso are compared for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso another bee zzso zzso zzso and zzso have some similar secondary structure, but display different zzso zzso
