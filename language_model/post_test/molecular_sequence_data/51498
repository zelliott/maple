The solution structure of the tenth type III module of zzso has been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso has a fold similar to that of zzso zzso with seven beta strands forming two zzso beta zzso which pack against each zzso Both beta sheets contribute zzso zzso zzso to a compact zzso The zzso is more similar to that of domain 2 of zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the human growth hormone zzso than to that of zzso C zzso The module contains an zzso sequence known to be involved in cell zzso This zzso is zzso exposed and lies on a zzso mobile loop between strands F and G, consistent with its cell zzso zzso
