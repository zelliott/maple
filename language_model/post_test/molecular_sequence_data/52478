zzso zzso can regulate the expression of the zzso zzso in different cell zzso Here we show zzso binding of zzso and human zzso nuclear factors to a DNA sequence element located in the zzso upstream region zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This element, like the zzso zzso element, the zzso response element zzso that mediates zzso induction of zzso zzso also binds factors in response to zzso growth factor zzso and zzso medium zzso The zzso zzso shares an zzso stretch of sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso element, and competes efficiently for binding of factors to the zzso zzso zzso experiments with the zzso binding site identified an zzso nuclear protein of approximately 98 zzso This protein does not appear to be involved in zzso zzso since zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso in nuclear zzso zzso or the zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data nonetheless suggest the zzso promoter may be an early target for signal zzso triggered by zzso zzso zzso
