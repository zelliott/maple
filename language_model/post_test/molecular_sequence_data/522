Although zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is found associated with the zzso zzso zzso complexes, its roles in zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, we describe a comprehensive zzso analysis of the zzso zzso complexes using zzso and a zzso analysis of zzso Together with our previous results, we finally identified 115 protein components of the complexes, including 39 zzso proteins and 54 potential zzso factors whose zzso zzso are found in the zzso complexes formed at various stages of zzso zzso We give evidence that, although zzso exists in both the zzso and zzso forms in the cell, only the latter form is associated with the zzso S and zzso S zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso during the zzso and in the zzso apparatus during zzso and that zzso D treatment results in the exclusion of zzso from the zzso Finally we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso the processing of zzso to 18 and 28 S zzso We propose that zzso is a component of the zzso complexes and functions as an zzso processing factor in zzso zzso As the zzso acid sequence of zzso including that in the zzso zzso binding region is zzso only in zzso zzso we suggest that its roles in zzso zzso have evolved in the zzso zzso
