The promoter region of the zzso gene in man, mouse and rat contains several putative zzso start sites, which in mouse have been shown to be tissue specific and differently zzso To investigate which of these start sites are used during stimulation of zzso gene zzso by the major zzso control factors, we determined the zzso start sites of rat zzso in the kidney and adrenal zzso by zzso protection using a zzso probe spanning zzso bases upstream and 121 bases downstream from the zzso zzso initiation zzso To stimulate zzso gene zzso we used zzso artery zzso zzso II antagonists, zzso and zzso infusions and low sodium zzso Our results suggest that only one zzso box is functional in rat kidney and zzso
