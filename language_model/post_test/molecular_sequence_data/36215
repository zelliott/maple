zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso salvage zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso and zzso to their respective zzso zzso zzso of this zzso can result in the overproduction of zzso acid leading to a severe form of zzso whilst a virtual absence of zzso activity causes the zzso syndrome which is zzso by zzso mental zzso zzso and compulsive zzso The zzso gene is located on the X zzso in the region zzso and consists of nine zzso and eight zzso zzso 57 zzso This gene is transcribed to produce an zzso of zzso zzso which contains a protein zzso region of zzso zzso With the advent of increasingly refined techniques of molecular biology, it has been possible to study the zzso gene of individuals with a zzso in zzso activity to determine the genetic basis of the zzso zzso Many different zzso throughout the coding region have been zzso but in the absence of precise information on the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso it remains difficult to determine any consistent correlation between the structure and function of the zzso
