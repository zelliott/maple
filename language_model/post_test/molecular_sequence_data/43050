The small zzso zzso gene of the oyster pathogen zzso zzso was characterized from cells of infected oyster zzso by zzso chain reaction and molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso in size, has zzso sequence similarity to that of its host, the eastern oyster zzso zzso The sequence was confirmed using recently available in zzso cultures of zzso zzso DNA from pure zzso zzso culture was amplified with specific zzso zzso according to the sequence from infected oyster zzso and predicted size fragments were zzso Furthermore, restriction zzso yielded fragments of expected size in amplified zzso from in zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence has zzso similarity to the zzso zzso sequence from the Australian zzso zzso zzso
