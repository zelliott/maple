The effects of the zzso region of the B component zzso of soluble methane zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso the transient zzso of the reaction cycle, and the properties of the zzso zzso zzso active site zzso cluster have been zzso zzso is known to have many profound effects on the rate and specificity of zzso Past studies have revealed specific roles for the zzso core structure of zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso zzso region of zzso also performs critical roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso missing 5, 8, and 13 zzso zzso cause progressive decreases in the maximum zzso turnover number, as well as lower apparent rate zzso for formation of the key reaction cycle zzso compound zzso It is shown that this latter effect is actually due to a decrease in the rate constant for formation of an earlier zzso probably the zzso species, compound zzso Moreover, the deletions result in substantial zzso at or before the P zzso It is proposed that this is due to competition between slow zzso release from one of the zzso and the reaction that carries this intermediate on to the next step in the cycle, which is slowed by the zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso studies of the zzso component zzso in the mixed zzso state suggest that zzso with the zzso zzso alters the electronic properties of the zzso cluster in a manner distinct from that observed when zzso zzso is zzso Active site structural changes are also suggested by a substantial decrease in the zzso kinetic isotope effect for the reaction of Q with methane thought to be associated with a decrease in quantum zzso in the zzso bond breaking zzso Thus, the surface interactions between zzso and zzso that affect zzso zzso and its regulation appear to require the complete zzso zzso region for proper zzso
