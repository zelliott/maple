The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso release from the zzso zzso zzso One proposed mechanism involves an interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel localized with zzso on the zzso Here we document zzso interaction within cells by zzso and identify a zzso interacting region in the regulatory and zzso domain of the zzso A zzso based on this zzso sequence displaced zzso from the zzso and reversed zzso zzso of zzso channel activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso release in zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso This zzso also reversed zzso zzso of T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the interaction of zzso with zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso zzso signals by zzso suggesting the zzso interaction as a potential therapeutic target in diseases associated with zzso zzso of cell zzso
