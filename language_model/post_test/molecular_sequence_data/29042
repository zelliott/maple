zzso zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso bacteria were isolated from environmental samples in Kuwait, Indonesia, zzso and Japan by enrichment with either zzso or zzso as a sole carbon zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene indicated that at least seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in this zzso zzso of the ability of the zzso to use zzso and its presumed zzso zzso suggests that the zzso showed multiple zzso in terms of zzso and degradation zzso The large zzso of the terminal zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso whilst gene probing using the large zzso of terminal zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso revealed no zzso genes amongst the zzso Using three zzso primer sets zzso zzso and zzso targeting a zzso region with the genes zzso the large zzso of terminal zzso successfully amplified material from 6 additional zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the large zzso of terminal zzso in 4 zzso was highly zzso to the large zzso of zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso However, we could not obtain any information on the zzso system involved in the zzso and/or zzso degradation by 7 other zzso These results suggest that zzso bacteria are diverse, and that there are still many unidentified zzso zzso
