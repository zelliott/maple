Development of resistance to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a major threat to the successful treatment of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso has been previously found to lead to a partially zzso zzso characterized by increased zzso production but retaining further zzso the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso is far from well zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso zzso by three zzso zzso including the previously described protein zzso plus two additional zzso designated zzso and zzso The three zzso zzso are responsible for a zzso zzso zzso mechanism ultimately leading to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and high-level zzso zzso resistance, as shown by analysis of the three single zzso zzso the three double zzso zzso and the triple zzso zzso This is achieved by a three-step escalating mechanism rendering four relevant expression zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso expression with increased zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso high-level zzso expression with high-level zzso resistance zzso zzso double zzso and very high-level (more than zzso compared to the wild zzso zzso expression zzso zzso Although zzso zzso expression models are frequent in natural resistance mechanisms, this is the first characterized example in which expression of a resistance gene can be zzso amplified through multiple steps of zzso
