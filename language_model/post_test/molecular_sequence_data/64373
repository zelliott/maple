zzso c zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsible for generating the zzso bond between the zzso prosthetic group and zzso zzso The zzso protein with its presumably zzso zzso and zzso zzso parts is thought to be responsible for binding zzso and presenting it to the zzso zzso zzso We propose that these two zzso of zzso play roles in different functions of the zzso The zzso 96 zzso acids represent an active zzso of the zzso which is able to complement the zzso IX zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strain zzso suggesting that it is involved in the final steps of zzso C zzso Furthermore, three zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to mediate zzso zzso Each of these zzso zzso is absolutely required for protein function, since zzso zzso carrying zzso genes with zzso zzso deletions were not able to complement zzso zzso for their nitrate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also found that the zzso acid zzso portion of the zzso which includes all the zzso zzso is able to mediate the assembly of the zzso zzso required for the zzso zzso In contrast, only the full-length protein zzso the ability to fix zzso
