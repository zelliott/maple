Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory zzso disease of the zzso Although the zzso of multiple sclerosis is still unknown, it is widely believed that T cells play a central role in its zzso To identify and characterize zzso T cells, we zzso zzso and zzso T cells freshly isolated from the zzso and peripheral blood of 36 multiple sclerosis patients for their zzso zzso variable beta zzso chain zzso In most patients, we found significant zzso of individual zzso chains on zzso T cells from zzso compared with peripheral zzso In contrast, only a few multiple sclerosis patients showed differences between the two compartments in zzso expression on zzso T zzso The zzso of specific zzso chains on zzso T cells was found to be stable over several months in selected patients and involved mainly T cells with a memory zzso In two patients zzso individual zzso chain zzso was found to be caused by the expansion of T cell populations with identical or highly similar rearranged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were not found among peripheral blood zzso T zzso Our findings demonstrate selective enrichment of memory zzso T cells in the zzso of multiple sclerosis patients, suggesting a role for these zzso T cells in the zzso of multiple zzso Our study provides a basis for future trials to identify zzso zzso and disease zzso in multiple zzso
