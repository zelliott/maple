The zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are a family of small zzso G proteins of unknown zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso protein known as zzso zzso zzso C, D, and E assemble the zzso zzso zzso and also interact with native zzso stimulating it to zzso zzso and thus acting together as a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We find that zzso zzso the zzso GAP activity of C, D, and zzso and zzso the binding of D to native zzso in zzso We also find that zzso of zzso D or E in cultured cells results in the destruction of the zzso zzso and of zzso zzso specifically prevents destruction of zzso and zzso by zzso D, but not by zzso zzso We generated zzso forms of zzso based on the known properties of classical zzso zzso zzso using these altered forms of zzso in zzso and in zzso demonstrate that it is zzso zzso that interacts with zzso D, thereby averting zzso and zzso zzso These data establish a role for zzso in modulating the interaction of zzso zzso with native zzso in zzso
