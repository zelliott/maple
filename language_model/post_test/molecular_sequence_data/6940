Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrated zzso in the lateral heart nerve of zzso zzso The identical labeling of some fibers suggests the coexistence of the two zzso zzso six zzso types in the peripheral part of the lateral heart nerve can be distinguished according to their size and density zzso zzso These zzso types can be subdivided zzso by means of a new zzso zzso zzso of types 4 and 5 always exclusively show zzso In the populations of fibers containing zzso of types 1 and 6, zzso profiles can be found that contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other zzso profiles of these populations only contain zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso of type 2 can be differentiated zzso in three forms in the same zzso In some zzso they are zzso in other fibers of the same section, they show zzso - zzso whereas in a third fiber type, zzso show AS - zzso Finally, zzso of type 3 can be observed with zzso In other zzso they occur with the same zzso but exhibit no zzso Two zzso types occur in the lateral heart zzso zzso type I is characterized by the production of zzso zzso that show zzso Type II is in close contact with various zzso forming different types of zzso zzso zzso unknown in zzso
