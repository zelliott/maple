zzso T cell zzso is central to the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso an inflammatory zzso disease that leads to severe focal bone zzso and generalized systemic zzso Previous studies have shown novel zzso activities in medium containing activated T cells, characterized by potent induction of the zzso production of zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso and zzso of zzso as well as induction of an activity that directly stimulates zzso formation in a manner independent of the key zzso zzso zzso This study was undertaken to identify the factors zzso by T cells that are responsible for these zzso 

Human T cells were activated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 72 hours in zzso V zzso medium to obtain T zzso zzso followed by concentration and zzso of the medium by zzso liquid zzso zzso active zzso were resolved using sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Major bands were analyzed by mass zzso and a major candidate protein was zzso This novel zzso was zzso and its expression was analyzed using zzso DNA zzso 

A single novel zzso that could induce both zzso zzso production and functional zzso formation in the absence of zzso or zzso and that was insensitive to the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso was identified in the activated T zzso zzso this zzso was designated zzso zzso factor of activated T cells zzso Further analysis of zzso revealed that it was derived from an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso coded by the zzso zzso 2 gene zzso which is a zzso gene remnant coding for zzso zzso an zzso that functions only in zzso and zzso 

zzso may act to exacerbate inflammation and/or bone turnover under inflammatory conditions such as zzso or zzso and in conditions of zzso zzso
