We have identified a zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a light harvesting protein of zzso II most likely involved in zzso zzso binding studies and dot zzso analyses of zzso demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso The primary sequence of zzso does not exhibit an obvious zzso site therefore we have used zzso replacement to analyze this zzso zzso zzso zzso side band zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 91, zzso of zzso zzso indicated a single population of zzso sites rich in zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso A structural model of zzso presents two zzso zzso zzso which are relatively rich in zzso zzso one on the zzso side and one on the zzso zzso The loop on the zzso side is adjacent to zzso acid 166 in zzso C of zzso which is known to be the binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding prevented zzso zzso therefore we propose that the zzso in zzso is bound in the domain including the zzso loop between zzso B and zzso
