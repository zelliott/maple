zzso divergence times can be zzso from molecular distances if a molecular clock can be assumed and if the substitution rate can be zzso We present new evidence from relative rate tests that the rate of substitution at fourfold zzso sites of nuclear zzso DNA is uniform in zzso and zzso zzso We also review recent relative rate test results showing substitution rate uniformity in the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso DNA distances between a range of zzso zzso shows that a molecular clock is inconsistent with many assumed divergence times irrespective of the assumed substitution zzso We find that the substitution rate that implies the best compromise fit with divergence times across the range of zzso is zzso zzso zzso This range of substitution rates implies a divergence time of humans and chimpanzees of zzso million years zzso This zzso the occurrence of zzso zzso and the earliest occurrence of zzso zzso suggesting that the common zzso of humans and chimpanzees was bipedal and that the trait has been lost in chimpanzees rather than gained in zzso
