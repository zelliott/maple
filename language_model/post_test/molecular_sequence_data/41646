zzso the zzso of positive zzso zzso factor b zzso stimulates zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso Using kinetic analysis of a human zzso complex consisting of zzso and zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso tail sequence is important for the zzso mechanism and zzso an ordered binding of zzso and release of zzso zzso analysis of a zzso T complex in which the zzso tail partially blocks the zzso binding site reveals a possible reaction zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso supports a model in which the zzso tail cycles through different zzso zzso We propose that this mechanism is critical for the pattern of zzso zzso zzso on actively transcribed zzso
