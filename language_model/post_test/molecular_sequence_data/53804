As part of a project involving large-scale sequencing of clones randomly selected from a human zzso library, we isolated a novel human zzso termed zzso zzso 7 zzso member zzso Its open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso acid protein containing seven putative zzso zzso The transcript of this gene was expressed in all human zzso zzso but most zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso of zzso protein at the plasma zzso We determined the zzso location of zzso as zzso by a combination of zzso in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid zzso
