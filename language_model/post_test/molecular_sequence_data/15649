zzso activity in bacteria is generally maintained at a low zzso The activity of mobile DNA elements can be controlled by zzso zzso global zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is one such zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in starving bacteria requires the zzso zzso factor zzso and integration host factor zzso zzso plays a dual role in zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso binding to the zzso repeats of the zzso Our previous results have indicated that besides zzso some other zzso zzso global zzso might bind to the ends of zzso and regulate zzso zzso In this study, employing a zzso I footprint zzso we have identified a binding site of zzso zzso zzso zzso for inversion zzso zzso 135 zzso inside the left end of zzso Our results of gel mobility shift and zzso I footprint studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso from the left end of zzso thereby abolishing the binding of zzso Thus, the results obtained in this study indicate that the zzso of zzso is regulated by the cellular amount of zzso zzso global regulators zzso and zzso
