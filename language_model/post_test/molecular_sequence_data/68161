Gene expression studies require a sensitive and quantitative zzso of zzso amounts present in small zzso We describe a general method of zzso specific zzso quickly and easily from zzso zzso or directly from a few cells by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revelation of the resulting products zzso of the last zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and the total cellular zzso is zzso and then amplified with zzso and 3' zzso the former being zzso zzso The amplification product is captured on zzso zzso and zzso by zzso with a zzso internal zzso zzso After revelation with an zzso alkaline zzso coupled zzso zzso the amount of zzso probe is determined by optical zzso The results can be easily converted to absolute values by comparison with an external DNA standard zzso An internal DNA or zzso standard can also be zzso The method we describe can be adapted to any cellular or viral gene of known sequence in a matter of zzso Since it uses zzso zzso commercially available zzso and standard zzso readers, it is inexpensive and could be automated zzso In this study, zzso zzso expression could be studied in as few as 40 zzso zzso It was also possible to zzso human zzso virus zzso DNA from 1500 to zzso copies out of zzso zzso zzso human zzso DNA zzso
