The zzso response zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso acids as well as several zzso zzso The zzso gene is known to zzso a crucial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of zzso and the zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso the mechanism through which zzso zzso is regulated appears to be critical for the zzso among these zzso zzso Even so, the direct involvement of zzso zzso through zzso zzso factors has not been shown zzso In this study, the promoter structure of the zzso gene was investigated in detail, and a genuine zzso responsive element zzso was confirmed among three putative zzso elements in zzso and in zzso Through gene deletion studies of zzso and zzso it was established that both factors are involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso binding to this zzso and the occupancy of the zzso promoter by these factors were also zzso Taking these results together, we concluded that zzso is responsible for the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso while zzso is required for its zzso zzso
