The key zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso have been identified except the zzso which zzso two zzso zzso A zzso molecules to zzso or one zzso and one zzso to zzso zzso analysis has revealed eight potential zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso among which the zzso zzso and zzso were identified by gene knockout and zzso zzso Unlike all known bacterial counterparts zzso by a single zzso the zzso zzso that was involved in zzso generation, was composed of two different types of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso that was involved in generation of zzso and zzso was also composed of two different types of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso and determined zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Their zzso zzso zzso was distinct from the bacterial zzso zzso and zzso both contained an zzso fold domain, which was essential for the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso were functionally zzso although zzso preferred functioning with zzso In addition, zzso showed zzso potential for the production of zzso with the desired zzso fraction in zzso This is the first report of the zzso type of zzso zzso which are distinct from their bacterial counterparts in both zzso composition and zzso zzso
