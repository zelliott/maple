To study the relation between the human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso brush border membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to synthetic peptides representing a putative external zzso and an internal zzso domain zzso of human zzso were generated in zzso Western zzso analyses indicated that both zzso recognized a zzso protein in rabbit zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso proteins also contained the zzso zzso as did a fraction zzso from an zzso column with zzso M zzso zzso zzso A fraction zzso between zzso and zzso M zzso zzso zzso did not contain this zzso Prior zzso studies have indicated that zzso exchange activity is higher significantly in fraction B than fraction zzso Administration of zzso for zzso d to zzso a stimulus known to increase zzso zzso zzso exchange activity, did not result in a change in expression of the zzso protein in either zzso zzso or zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso to two separate zzso of the human zzso zzso recognize a zzso protein in rabbit zzso zzso but not zzso The zzso between recognition of the zzso protein using zzso and the majority of functional zzso exchange activity after zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins and in native zzso after administration of zzso suggest that rabbit zzso zzso contains more than one form of zzso zzso
