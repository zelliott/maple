The zzso abilities of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso disease virus zzso have been characterized in zzso and zzso zzso This zzso represents the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso loop of protein zzso which is involved in cell recognition and zzso The efficiency of the viral motif in promoting cell attachment and spreading is comparable to that shown by zzso or zzso Cell binding is inhibited by a zzso zzso directed against a zzso zzso zzso zzso and also by zzso against zzso zzso V beta zzso 5) and zzso zzso 5 beta 1) zzso In addition, a synthetic zzso zzso which is a zzso for both zzso prevents the cell binding zzso by the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso motif is a potent zzso for zzso zzso and sufficient to promote cell attachment to susceptible cells mainly through the zzso zzso
