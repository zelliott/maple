The zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso 115 in zzso has been zzso from sheep zzso The zzso is a zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 38,000 on the basis of gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of calcium the zzso exhibited a zzso of 100 zzso for zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was able to use zzso zzso as a zzso albeit with less zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was inhibited by increases in zzso strength, whereas zzso of zzso zzso was not zzso This suggests a difference in the mode of interaction of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso As with zzso interactions with other zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso of zzso by zzso acid treatment decreases the ability of the zzso to recognize and zzso zzso A zzso zzso based on the zzso protein zzso II sequence and the zzso zzso inhibit the zzso zzso interaction in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso lobe zzso zzso does not affect the ability of the zzso zzso to recognize and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso for zzso zzso binding reside solely in the zzso lobe of zzso Further, structural features within this region, in particular, the zzso zzso that are zzso upon calcium binding may contribute to the interaction of zzso with the zzso
