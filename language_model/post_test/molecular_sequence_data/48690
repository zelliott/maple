zzso of zzso processes is a critical mechanism that enables efficient coordination of the synthesis of required proteins in response to environmental and cellular zzso zzso factors require accurate activity regulation because they play a critical role as key zzso assuring specific expression of target zzso In this work, we show that zzso zzso zzso have the potential to interact with a broad range of zzso response factor zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso by zzso (for zzso and zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso associated zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso The assembly with an zzso zzso causes degradation of their zzso via the zzso zzso as demonstrated for the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso proteins widely affects plant development and causes altered fatty acid contents in zzso zzso Overall, this work demonstrates a link between fatty acid metabolism and zzso zzso activities in plants and establishes zzso zzso zzso as key regulators in zzso processes that involve zzso family zzso
