zzso rich in alternating zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in a large number of zzso proteins involved in several cellular zzso According to the prevailing view zzso zzso function as protein interaction zzso thereby promoting the assembly of zzso cellular zzso Furthermore, recent data demonstrated that the zzso regions of several zzso zzso factors directly contact the zzso in a zzso specific but functionally important zzso Using a variety of zzso approaches, we now demonstrate that the zzso zzso of three zzso not directly associated with the zzso reaction, such as zzso b zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso associate mainly with nuclear zzso and that this association is conducive in retaining the proteins in a soluble zzso zzso by zzso prevents zzso association, yet it greatly increases the fraction of the proteins recovered in soluble form, thereby mimicking the zzso zzso Based on these results we propose that the tendency to zzso and form zzso is a general property of zzso zzso proteins and could be attributed to their zzso zzso zzso binding or zzso zzso prevents zzso and may serve to zzso the zzso domain interaction zzso
