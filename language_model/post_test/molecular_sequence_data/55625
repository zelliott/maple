The zzso virus zzso open reading frame 10 zzso protein is the zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso These are two zzso zzso proteins that have extensive zzso acid sequence identity in their zzso and middle zzso zzso however, lacks the zzso zzso zzso which is critical for zzso by zzso Earlier studies showed that zzso zzso does not form a zzso complex with the zzso regulatory element (where R is a zzso with which zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may not have zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, cell lines zzso expressing zzso complement the zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso function of zzso and enhance the de zzso synthesis of infectious virus following zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso like its zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein despite the absence of sequences similar to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso protein may be critical for efficient initiation of viral zzso
