We have used an zzso shuttle zzso zzso to investigate the capacity of zzso cell extracts to reproduce the in zzso process of zzso zzso We showed previously that when zzso zzso is zzso in these zzso bypass of zzso zzso occurs, resulting in base substitution zzso in the zzso gene of the zzso Here we report the DNA sequence characterization of a collection of 60 of these zzso zzso Most of the zzso observed are single or tandem double base zzso at zzso zzso of these, approximately zzso are zzso zzso zzso are observed predominantly at a few sites, in particular at positions 155 and 156 in the zzso zzso No dramatic differences in the zzso spectrum were observed when the orientation of the zzso gene was reversed with respect to the zzso origin of zzso suggesting that zzso fixation occurs similarly on both the leading and the lagging strands for DNA zzso Generally, the zzso hot spots observed in zzso are at the same sites as those observed when zzso zzso was zzso in human or monkey cells in zzso Thus, it appears that the replication and zzso of zzso templates in zzso cell extracts accurately reflects these processes in the intact zzso
