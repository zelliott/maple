zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso regulated zzso and zzso growth zzso It is expressed during the zzso period in a zzso dependent manner during zzso in the zzso In zzso it promotes zzso outgrowth from spinal zzso zzso and cell zzso It expression is strongest in the central nervous system, thus suggesting a function for this protein in neural zzso In this study, the role of zzso in zzso was examined in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from an embryonic library encompassing zzso and zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso was detected from the onset of zzso and throughout the stages of zzso in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is also an important growth regulator in zzso zzso To study the function of zzso in the development of the zzso junction zzso fusion proteins were made and their ability to induce the formation of zzso zzso zzso clusters in cultured muscle cells was zzso zzso coated with zzso strongly induce zzso zzso When zzso zzso were labeled with zzso made against the zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso was detected at the zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso another member of this growth factor family, zzso expression cannot be detected in the muscle but is present in spinal zzso zzso zzso with these in zzso data is the observation that zzso zzso is only localized in the central nervous system but the protein is deposited at the zzso junction where the zzso is located in zzso zzso applied zzso does bind to the zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso muscle zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the formation of zzso clusters in cultured muscle cells, binds strongly to zzso Bath application of zzso in conjunction with zzso results in a change in the pattern of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a zzso factor that zzso in the signal zzso process during zzso zzso
