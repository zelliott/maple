The zzso of the zzso gene have been implicated to play a zzso role in zzso syndrome, which causes zzso zzso To determine the zzso zzso in Japanese patients, facilitate zzso diagnosis, and allow zzso studies, we screened unrelated patients with zzso syndrome for zzso zzso from 6 Japanese patients were obtained and the sequence in the translated region of zzso was zzso We could not find the zzso reported zzso but found 17 sites of zzso change, consisting of 7 synonymous and 10 zzso zzso changes in our zzso Among them, two zzso zzso changes zzso and zzso are specific to our patients and these changes were not found in 53 healthy zzso In 4 patients out of 6, no specific zzso change for zzso syndrome could be zzso Our findings demonstrating no zzso change in the translated region of the zzso gene among two thirds of the small number of patients examined here imply that another gene other than the zzso may be associated with this disease, supporting previous investigations in Japan and other zzso
