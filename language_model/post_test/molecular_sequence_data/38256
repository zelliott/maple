zzso is an zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso fungus zzso zzso This element is present in about 15 copies in a particular strain zzso which was used for successful gene zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso in nitrogen zzso This zzso carries a copy of the zzso element in a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the gene product shows a significant similarity to the zzso protein of zzso zzso which is a regulator of nitrogen zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was shown to complement a zzso zzso of zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that the zzso zzso gene also encodes a regulator of nitrogen zzso which was named zzso zzso nitrogen regulator zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zzso gene to be identified by zzso gene zzso A general method for gene tagging using an zzso zzso zzso is zzso
