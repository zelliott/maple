Low molecular zzso zzso are structurally complex, heterogeneous, zzso and highly zzso charged zzso of zzso The direct characterization of zzso is a major challenge for currently available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool for the characterization complex biological samples in the fields of zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been applied to the analysis of zzso zzso separated by size zzso reversed phase zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso However, there have been limited applications of zzso for the direct characterization of intact zzso zzso zzso due to their structural complexity, low zzso efficiency, and zzso zzso Here we present a simple and reliable zzso transform zzso platform to characterize and compare two currently marketed zzso products using the zzso approach requiring no special sample preparation zzso This zzso system relies on zzso zzso rather than zzso chemistry, zzso highly resolved zzso zzso using a relatively high percentage of zzso in the mobile phase, resulting in stable and high efficiency zzso zzso software zzso zzso was used to automatically assign structures within zzso mass zzso
