zzso zzso zzso profiles of clinical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined by using zzso zzso and activity zzso All zzso zzso clinical zzso exhibited three closely zzso bands of activity as previously determined for laboratory strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a hybrid composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hart, zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso produced only one zzso activity, which migrated similarly to zzso of zzso zzso Southern analysis of eight zzso species identified only a single sod gene in each zzso A full-length sod gene was cloned from zzso zzso and determined to be more similar to zzso than to zzso of zzso zzso zzso this gene was designated zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was 92 and zzso identical to that of the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene expressed from a zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the protein formed a hybrid with zzso of zzso zzso Both hybrid zzso forms as well as the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein exist as zzso These data indicate that zzso is found only in zzso zzso and not in the zzso suggesting an important divergence in the evolution of this zzso and a unique role for zzso in zzso zzso
