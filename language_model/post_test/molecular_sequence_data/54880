The zzso family represents a new class of zzso regulators that is important in heart and skeletal muscle zzso However, the critical questions regarding how they are regulated zzso remain largely zzso We previously suggested that the zzso zzso activity of zzso a vital zzso regulator, appears to be regulated by zzso and that the possible hinge motion of the zzso zzso domain zzso might be central to the maintenance and release of the zzso However, the lack of direct evidence of the hinge motion has limited our further understanding of this zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of full-length zzso in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso at zzso zzso has a zzso structure with the zzso binding zzso located at the bottom of a zzso zzso formed between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso clearly suggests that the zzso can undergo a large zzso motion that defines two distinct zzso zzso adopts a closed zzso with the zzso partially blocking the zzso binding zzso in contrast, zzso appears to represent an open form, where the zzso swings out by zzso from the zzso zzso forming an open zzso with the active site completely zzso Overall, these findings provide novel structural insights into the mechanism that zzso the activity of the zzso proteins and support the observation that a zzso zzso such as by molecular zzso zzso is required to zzso the zzso
