A zzso zzso sequence spanning the zzso zzso zzso zzso and N genes and zzso regions of human respiratory zzso virus strain zzso representing zzso zzso B, was determined by sequencing cloned zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the previously reported sequences for strain zzso of zzso A showed that zzso zzso and N were highly zzso at the zzso level zzso 78 and zzso identity, zzso and at the zzso acid level zzso 87 and zzso identity, zzso The zzso signals were exactly zzso between subgroups, and the zzso signals contained only a single zzso substitution each in zzso and zzso In most cases zzso and zzso gene sequences that were not part of presumed zzso signals were much less well zzso zzso 50 to zzso than sequences that were part of zzso open reading frames (82 to zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the N gene and protein of the Long strain of zzso A were determined by sequencing zzso clones of zzso zzso the zzso sequence (representing all but the first 10 zzso of the zzso contained 15 differences from that of the zzso strain, but the deduced zzso acid sequences were zzso
