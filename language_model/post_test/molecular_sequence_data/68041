The zzso activity of zzso zzso corresponding to different regions of zzso disease virus zzso zzso has been assessed in zzso zzso The locations of the zzso used were: zzso two regions within the internal zzso entry site zzso involved in the regulation of the translation initiation of the viral zzso zzso each of the two functional zzso zzso zzso an internal sequence of zzso zzso and zzso a region at the 3' end zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso complementary to the second zzso resulted in a transient zzso of viral zzso expression in infected zzso zzso zzso ranging from 35 to zzso were obtained at 5 h zzso using zzso zzso of 125 zzso and zzso The extent and duration of this zzso seemed to be zzso by both a rapid transport to the nucleus and the short zzso of the zzso This zzso of zzso protein synthesis was correlated with a reduction of virus yield of about zzso as observed after the addition to the cell culture of an zzso zzso complementary to the second zzso
