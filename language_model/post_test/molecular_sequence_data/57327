zzso receptors activate zzso zzso beta zzso G proteins by zzso replacement of zzso bound to the zzso by zzso zzso in the C zzso of the zzso its zzso modification by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso directed against it, and peptides mimicking zzso zzso all inhibit zzso zzso of G zzso The logical zzso specific zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso can determine the abilities of individual G proteins to discriminate among specific zzso of zzso so far not been tested zzso Different hormone receptors specifically activate zzso or zzso whose zzso zzso zzso or alpha zzso stimulate zzso zzso C or inhibit zzso zzso zzso Here we replace zzso zzso acids of alpha zzso with the corresponding zzso of alpha zzso to create alpha zzso zzso zzso that can mediate stimulation of zzso C by receptors otherwise coupled exclusively to zzso A minimum of three alpha zzso zzso zzso including a zzso three zzso from the C zzso zzso to switch the zzso specificity of the alpha zzso zzso zzso We propose that a zzso turn, centered on this zzso plays an important part in specifying zzso interactions of G proteins in the zzso zzso
