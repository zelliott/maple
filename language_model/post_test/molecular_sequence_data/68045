A simple technique in which zzso zzso zzso are used to identify bacteria immobilized on zzso is zzso By using colony zzso bacteria are directly transferred from plates to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso from colonies can be applied to zzso by using a vacuum zzso under zzso zzso zzso cells are baked and zzso under stringent conditions by using standard zzso Treatment of zzso cells with sodium zzso zzso zzso formaldehyde, or zzso had no apparent effect on zzso zzso zzso to zzso from cells that had been stored zzso for 6 days was readily zzso however, fivefold more cells zzso zzso zzso were required to obtain zzso signals comparable to those generated by cells not subjected to zzso The sequences of zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a group probe identifying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso In conjunction with the colony lift zzso zzso bacteria isolated from river water were identified by using these zzso
