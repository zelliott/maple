We compiled zzso nuclear export signal zzso zzso zzso in a database named zzso We analyzed the sequences and three-dimensional structures of natural, zzso identified zzso and of zzso zzso that were generated from the database in order to identify properties that might distinguish the two groups of zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso sequence zzso and agreement with existing zzso consensus sequences revealed strong preferences for the zzso pattern and for zzso charged zzso acids in the zzso positions of zzso identified zzso but not of false zzso Strong preferences against certain zzso zzso acids in the zzso positions were also zzso These findings led to a new and more precise zzso zzso More important, three-dimensional structures are now available for 68 zzso within 56 different cargo zzso zzso of these structures showed that zzso identified zzso are more likely than the false zzso to adopt zzso zzso that transition to zzso at their zzso and more likely to be surface accessible within their protein zzso or be present in zzso or zzso parts of the zzso Such distinguishing features for real zzso might be useful in future zzso prediction zzso Finally, we also tested zzso of 40 zzso that were found in the 56 zzso We found that 16 of the zzso peptides did not bind zzso hence illustrating how zzso are easily zzso
