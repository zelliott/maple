zzso of the three-dimensional structures of protein targets from zzso data has the potential to accelerate researches pertaining to drug zzso Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with seven zzso zzso and is important in pharmaceutical targeting on pulmonary and cardiovascular zzso The human zzso zzso zzso has been found to play a very important role in the zzso of high altitude pulmonary zzso zzso In the present study, a high quality of protein zzso structure has been predicted for the human zzso zzso zzso sequence with primary zzso number zzso zzso template protein sequence with known zzso structure was identified and the zzso protein sequence validation was done by multiple sequence alignment zzso The zzso model was performed through zzso and depended on the quality of the sequence alignment by zzso template structure and the consolidated result performed by Gene zzso zzso The statistical zzso of the generated model was evaluated by zzso which revealed that the structure modeled through zzso to be of good quality with zzso of zzso in the most favored zzso zzso studies were carried out after modeling with two well known zzso namely zzso and zzso and the fitness score revealed that zzso has a higher fitness score than zzso zzso of binding affinity by zzso revealed that zzso had zzso binding affinity while zzso showed zzso binding zzso From the present study, it can be concluded that the generated model of human zzso zzso zzso can be used for further studies related to this zzso and zzso was found to have a high binding affinity with human zzso zzso zzso
