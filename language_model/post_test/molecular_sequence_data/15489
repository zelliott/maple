A novel zzso acid zzso strain zzso was isolated from crude oil collected at an zzso well in zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso and oval zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth was observed at 30 degrees C, pH zzso and 3 % zzso zzso zzso zzso produced acid from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid was the major end product from zzso The major cellular fatty acid was zzso : zzso The zzso zzso type was zzso containing zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene revealed that strain zzso was zzso as a member of the zzso acid bacteria of the zzso content zzso zzso the closest zzso of this zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with only zzso % sequence zzso On the basis of the zzso features and zzso position, a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed for strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
