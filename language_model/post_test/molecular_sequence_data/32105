zzso binding of interacting proteins generally depends on a limited set of zzso acid zzso located at the contact zzso We have applied a zzso screening method to simultaneously evaluate the role of multiple zzso of zzso zzso in zzso binding specificity towards two different zzso zzso Seven zzso of the two zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso were targeted for zzso The generated zzso library representing zzso zzso zzso was displayed on the surface of zzso zzso and selected against zzso inhibitor protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso panning zzso provided information on the occurrence of particular zzso acids at distinct zzso In particular, zzso at positions 124 zzso and 131 zzso were found to be critical for specific inhibitor zzso These zzso predictions derived from the zzso exploration of the thumb region and accompanying sequence analyses were zzso confirmed by testing the inhibitor sensitivity of a limited set of zzso expressed zzso zzso In addition, we successfully altered the zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso
