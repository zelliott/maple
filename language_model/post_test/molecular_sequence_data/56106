A human zzso with milk zzso specificity was obtained by transferring the zzso determining regions zzso of the mouse zzso zzso onto carefully selected human framework zzso The resulting reshaped human zzso zzso showed no difference in relative affinity for its zzso compared with the parent mouse zzso The minimum zzso recognized by both the mouse and reshaped zzso was demonstrated by zzso mapping to be zzso and consists of the zzso zzso In a replacement net analysis, in which each of the zzso acids was replaced in turn with the 19 other zzso it was determined that mouse zzso and zzso reacted with this series of synthetic peptides in an equivalent manner, indicating retention of identical fine specificity in the zzso zzso In contrast to other published reports, this was achieved without involvement of any framework zzso in the binding site zzso These data demonstrate that if zzso human framework regions are employed zzso the zzso only can be sufficient to zzso desired zzso to human zzso and can, indeed, provide human zzso of mouse zzso with virtually indistinguishable affinities and fine zzso relative to the mouse parent zzso
