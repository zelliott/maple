The zzso chain reaction was used to survey zzso type zzso genes in the North American zzso zzso zzso zzso The survey reveals 28 different zzso fragments possessing zzso zzso sequence similarity with zzso sequences in zzso and zzso B sequences in zzso zzso has one to four representatives of zzso zzso when fragments are assigned according to zzso acid zzso A zzso analysis including the zzso sequences and zzso mouse zzso B and zzso zzso sequences reveals several instances of zzso groupings of zzso zzso with a zzso or mouse gene as the sister zzso Under the current model of zzso cluster evolution, these results suggest that zzso has as many as four zzso type zzso This is the first evidence suggesting the presence of multiple clusters in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso in zzso suggest that the gene was present in the common zzso of zzso and zzso and has been lost in zzso
