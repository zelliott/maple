A zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the M protein of group A zzso zzso has previously been defined as the target of zzso zzso zzso analysis of seven field zzso from indigenous Australians living in an area highly endemic for zzso and five laboratory reference strains zzso nine unique zzso plus three zzso demonstrates that this region is highly zzso zzso identity ranging from 65 to zzso with six of the 12 sequences being identical to zzso Most of the sequence zzso is contained within the last seven zzso acids of zzso Competitive zzso demonstrates that human zzso specific for zzso cannot discriminate between zzso and synthetic peptides representing four from four of the zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso from endemic zzso was able to zzso each of the zzso zzso and free zzso as well as a zzso expressing a minimal zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso acids between positions 2 and 13 of zzso but not an irrelevant zzso were able to partially or completely inhibit zzso of all zzso and reference zzso Thus adult endemic zzso contain zzso which are zzso for multiple zzso zzso and which are specific for a sequence of 12 zzso acids contained within the zzso region of the M zzso
