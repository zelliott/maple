A gene library from the DNA of zzso zzso has been constructed in the zzso zzso zzso A particular zzso zzso reacted strongly with zzso zzso zzso in a number of different species of zzso This clone produced two abundant zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified two open reading zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The only zzso control element observed on the zzso side of the initiation zzso resembled a heat shock zzso This heat shock promoter was functionally regulated in zzso coli, since both proteins were produced by growth conditions at 37 degrees C and neither protein was detected at 23 degrees zzso There were four sequences from the literature that were highly zzso zzso than zzso to the zzso protein from zzso zzso Three were from zzso species and represent the zzso zzso of this zzso The other was from zzso coli, detected as a gene that zzso or suppresses a zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso protein was zzso it may serve as an zzso vaccine against zzso zzso and other zzso zzso that express the zzso zzso
