zzso gelatin of skate zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was found that the zzso hydrolysate exhibited the highest zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso Then, zzso hydrolysate was further zzso with zzso and separated by an zzso membrane zzso Finally, two peptides responsible for zzso zzso activity were identified to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the free zzso activity of the zzso peptides was determined in human zzso zzso In addition, the zzso mechanism of the zzso peptides was evaluated by protein and gene expression levels of zzso zzso The current study demonstrated that the peptides derived from skate skin gelatin could be used in the food industry as functional ingredients with potent zzso and zzso zzso
