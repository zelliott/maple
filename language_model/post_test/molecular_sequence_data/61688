The zzso develops from zzso and zzso zzso extensions at the zzso boundary in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is thought to occur from a pool of uniform precursor zzso While the genetic network controlling zzso zzso and differentiation has been the object of extensive zzso the corresponding mechanism leading to the zzso zzso is much less zzso Here, we report on the identification and zzso of a novel molecular marker for the early zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso pancreatic protein zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso By whole mount in zzso zzso it is detected as early as stage 39 in the zzso lineage of the developing zzso zzso reveals onset of expression as early as stage zzso
