zzso are economically important zzso zzso and zzso for several zzso zzso zzso rely heavily on pharmacological propriety of their saliva to get blood meal and suppress immune reactions of zzso Few reports cover immune zzso from zzso zzso zzso Three zzso peptides named zzso zzso have been identified and characterized from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and increase the zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso In the current studies, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso possibly by zzso the zzso production, and finally might facilitate the zzso of this zzso The current works will help understand the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso
