In order to meet the present increased demands, we have tried to improve the methods to produce human zzso zzso by using a zzso mouse grafted with human zzso zzso Initially, we gave an zzso zzso zzso to a zzso mouse to suppress the zzso activity, as a zzso Then, fifty million human zzso cells zzso from a healthy volunteer were injected zzso to the zzso mouse so as to construct a human immune system in the mouse zzso zzso We zzso the mouse with a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso four zzso The zzso cells taken from the zzso zzso mouse were fused with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were selected in zzso medium containing zzso and zzso Among 68 zzso wells, we obtained one zzso clone zzso which zzso a specific zzso to pep zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso was tested by zzso and the specificity of this zzso was confirmed by an zzso test with different kinds of zzso This paper is the first report of the successful production of zzso human zzso zzso by active in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso By this active in zzso zzso system using a zzso zzso human zzso zzso for any sort of zzso zzso may easily be made zzso
