zzso factors with an zzso zzso domain have been implicated in various cellular processes involved in plant development and stress zzso Of the 139 zzso genes predicted in rice zzso zzso we identified 42 genes in our current study that are induced by one or more stress conditions, including drought, high zzso low temperature, and zzso zzso zzso analysis of these 42 zzso zzso genes revealed the presence of six zzso zzso with distinct signature zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso representing zzso I and II, respectively, were functionally zzso Both genes were found to be induced upon 2 h of exposure to drought and zzso conditions but to differ in their expression profile upon exposure to low temperature and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in rice under the control of the zzso promoter zzso increased the tolerance to drought and high zzso at the zzso zzso Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by zzso to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth zzso In contrast, grain yield in zzso plants in the field was reduced by zzso to zzso compared with controls under both normal and drought stress zzso zzso experiments identified 10 and 38 genes that are zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, in addition to 37 genes that are commonly induced by both zzso Our results suggest that the zzso gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing zzso growth zzso
