The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso composition in adult zzso Each zzso contains four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain is zzso in alpha zzso while it is zzso in zzso zzso Given this peculiar conservation pattern, we studied its contribution to muscle zzso zzso by combining zzso with single-channel kinetic zzso zzso containing the zzso alpha zzso zzso as well as those containing the reverse zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show prolonged lifetimes of the zzso open channel resulting from a slower closing rate with respect to zzso zzso The kinetic changes are not equivalent among zzso the beta zzso being the one that produces the most significant stabilization of the open zzso zzso analysis of zzso of zzso channels activated by the zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso decrease in the closing rate, a zzso increase in the opening rate, a zzso increase in the gating equilibrium constant in the zzso zzso and a significant increase opening in the absence of zzso zzso at zzso showed that the structural bases of its contribution to gating is zzso zzso linear zzso relationships suggest an approximately zzso zzso environment for the zzso position at the transition state of zzso The overall results identify position zzso as a zzso zzso of channel gating and add new experimental evidence that gives support to the involvement of the zzso domain in the operation of the channel gating zzso
