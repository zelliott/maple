We have identified the fifth member of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The human and rat genes are largely expressed in skeletal muscle and at a lower level in zzso The deduced human and rat proteins designated as zzso zzso consist of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso respectively, and exhibit zzso zzso The sequence zzso of zzso proteins with known zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Unlike other zzso putative zzso proteins have large zzso zzso zzso containing long zzso zzso The data obtained indicate the existence of zzso unknown zzso (most probably zzso zzso in muscle zzso
