A zzso strategy has been used to isolate a full length zzso zzso a zzso zzso C from a sized zzso zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso The predicted protein sequence contains 875 zzso zzso with calculated zzso zzso and has marked similarity with zzso zzso including conservation of the zzso and zzso zzso It is unique in having a major zzso zzso A major protein of apparent zzso zzso estimated by zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso and identified by partial protein sequence analysis to zzso to the protein sequence predicted from the zzso zzso This protein has been shown to zzso zzso zzso It is not yet clear whether this represents the major zzso zzso in zzso zzso
