We have isolated and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso encompassing two complete and one incomplete zzso zzso zzso usage frequency shows extreme zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of each unit are identical to each other and the same as that deduced from a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso The upstream region of this zzso which contained some putative regulatory zzso was recovered by zzso zzso chain zzso amplification and zzso This upstream zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene in a zzso expression zzso and successfully applied to the establishment of an zzso transient zzso zzso zzso was performed by zzso and the optimal zzso was zzso zzso at zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso added into the zzso buffer increased the zzso efficiency by about zzso The zzso activity was zzso to the amount of DNA zzso and reached the peak level 48 h after zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene upstream zzso contains a functional promoter which is about zzso times as strong as a viral zzso promoter when driving zzso expression in zzso
