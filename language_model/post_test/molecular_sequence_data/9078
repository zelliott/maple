zzso from zzso to zzso zzso is largely zzso by a family of small zzso called box zzso zzso each of which contains one unique small zzso box zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso reaction is determined by the zzso interactions between the guide sequence of the box zzso zzso and the target sequence within an zzso zzso Thus, by creating a new box zzso zzso harboring an artificial guide sequence that zzso with the zzso zzso one can zzso introduce zzso into virtually any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso and so zzso zzso changes the properties of a zzso zzso and is likely to alter the role of its corresponding zzso in certain cellular zzso thereby enabling basic research into the effects of zzso zzso Here we take a zzso reporter gene (also known as zzso as an example, and we present a protocol for designing a box zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can result in early termination of translation by creating a premature termination zzso zzso however, zzso at the zzso can suppress this translation termination zzso zzso Thus, the experimental procedures described in this protocol may provide a novel way to treat zzso zzso This protocol takes zzso d to zzso
