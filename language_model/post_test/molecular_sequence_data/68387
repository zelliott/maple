The human zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat zzso contains two binding sites for zzso B in close proximity to three binding sites for the zzso zzso factor, zzso Previously, stimulation of the zzso zzso in response to zzso has been attributed to the binding of zzso B to the viral zzso In this report, we show that the binding of zzso B is not by itself sufficient to induce zzso gene zzso Instead, a zzso interaction must occur between zzso B and zzso bound to an adjacent zzso zzso both in DNA binding and in zzso zzso of zzso B and zzso was confirmed by zzso mobility shift gel analysis, zzso zzso chemical zzso and zzso studies in zzso With a zzso promoter, we find that the interaction of zzso B with zzso is dependent on orientation and position, and is not observed with other zzso including zzso zzso or zzso An increase in the spacing between the zzso B and zzso elements virtually zzso this functional interaction, which is not restored when these sites are brought back into the same zzso zzso Several other promoters regulated by zzso B also contain zzso B in proximity to zzso binding zzso These findings suggest that an interaction between zzso B and zzso is required for zzso zzso gene expression and may serve as a regulatory mechanism to activate specific viral and cellular zzso
