To zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and its zzso levels were zzso in the same zzso rat zzso samples after human zzso zzso using a binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso together with the zzso chain reaction zzso Treatment of the animals with 500 zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso zzso binding and the 90 zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso within 12 and 24 h respectively, followed by a transient partial recovery on days 4 and 5, while a distinct decline occurred only on day 7 in the zzso Northern blots of total zzso zzso as zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso domain of zzso full-length rat zzso zzso zzso revealed six major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was the most abundant, possibly encodes the 90 zzso zzso while the smaller species probably represent alternatively spliced forms of the zzso zzso zzso as also supported by the finding that zzso produced three zzso bands of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso derived from the N and C zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso and rat zzso total zzso as a zzso Treatment with zzso led to the zzso of all six zzso in a fashion parallel to the changes in zzso zzso No smaller zzso components capable of binding zzso zzso or zzso zzso appeared on the zzso or zzso prior to or during zzso or the subsequent transient period of zzso suggesting that the smaller zzso species are translated in minute amounts in zzso or are not translated at zzso zzso zzso analysis of the Northern blots revealed that the amounts of the four smallest zzso species increased during the period of zzso in relation to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased during the subsequent period of zzso indicating changes in the alternative zzso of the primary zzso The data suggest that zzso transient zzso of the zzso zzso results in part from zzso of its zzso levels, and that changes in alternative processing of the zzso zzso may play a regulatory role in the expression of functional zzso zzso during zzso and zzso
