zzso possesses an zzso property in the primary sequence in which zzso zzso are located at the zzso region from zzso to zzso A part of the zzso sequence was zzso off by zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso The affinity of zzso zzso for neutral zzso membrane was reduced to 1/3 that of zzso indicating that the basic zzso zzso and zzso are important in binding of zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso was extended toward the zzso end by connection of zzso zzso the membrane affinity of which was slightly higher than the zzso zzso but lower than zzso The leakage experiment of zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that the activities of zzso zzso and zzso in membrane zzso were much lower than zzso However, the zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso It is thus considered that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso play an important role in binding to the polar region of membrane for zzso but not for zzso zzso
