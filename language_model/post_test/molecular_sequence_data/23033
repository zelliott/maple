zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso proteins that both contain multiple zzso zzso The nature of these repeats is different: zzso has zzso repeats, while zzso contains its own unique zzso However, the suggestion was made from zzso data that the zzso may bind to multiple sites on the zzso zzso as was found for zzso We have used electron zzso and the zzso zzso real space reconstruction to zzso complexes of zzso with zzso fragments containing either three or six zzso and with the zzso fragment, containing five zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso fragments bind to zzso in a similar manner and in two distinct modes: in one mode zzso zzso 1 is bound, while in the second mode the binding bridges between a different site on zzso zzso 1/2 of one zzso and zzso 3/4 of an adjacent zzso zzso Taken together with published data about zzso zzso and zzso our results suggest that the ability to bind in multiple modes to the zzso zzso is a general property of many zzso zzso
