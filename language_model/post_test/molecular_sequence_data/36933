Very abundant and zzso satellite DNA has been found in the flour zzso zzso zzso representing zzso of its zzso zzso of 14 randomly cloned satellite zzso revealed a zzso zzso length of 142 zzso and an average zzso content of zzso zzso variation analysis showed that base zzso appearing with a frequency of zzso are zzso differences among satellite zzso The satellite sequence is unique without significant direct repeats and with only two potentially stable zzso zzso After zzso of satellite zzso on native zzso gel retarded zzso characteristic for curved DNA molecules are zzso The zzso profiles and DNA zzso axis trajectory are calculated on the basis of three different zzso These calculations predict that P zzso satellite DNA forms a left-handed zzso zzso zzso of described features with other satellite zzso reveals some striking similarities with satellite DNA from related species zzso zzso which belongs to the same family of zzso Both satellites are very abundant and zzso with the same, highly zzso zzso zzso although there is no zzso at the zzso zzso Their zzso as well as zzso exhibit very similar retarded zzso zzso The calculated zzso profiles predict two bend centers in zzso of each satellite, resulting in a model of left-handed zzso zzso of similar zzso
