An enriched zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA library was constructed for screening of zzso zzso and a positive clone was isolated from one plate of 3 zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso carried an insert of zzso base pairs zzso with an open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso protein of 188 zzso zzso The deduced zzso 86 zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso binding motif are identical to zzso zzso The full-length zzso protein is most closely related to human zzso zzso zzso with lesser zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso screening data also indicate other zzso genes in zzso at least one of which is also transcribed in zzso A zzso zzso transcript was found to be abundant in zzso from zzso through zzso and may be zzso zzso
