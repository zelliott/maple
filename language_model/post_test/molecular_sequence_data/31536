zzso have evolved a variety of zzso factors to zzso host plants zzso We previously identified the pepper zzso zzso reaction protein zzso as a regulator of plant zzso and zzso cell zzso Here, we identified the small zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as an interacting partner of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso specifically interacts with zzso in zzso The zzso tracker zzso zzso showed that the zzso complex zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain exhibited significantly increased surface adherence but reduced swarming zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tomato and pepper leaves, respectively, suggesting that zzso acts as a zzso factor in host zzso zzso expression of zzso and also zzso with zzso zzso proteins induced zzso cell death response through the interaction with zzso and suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in pepper significantly reduced zzso growth and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso retarded plant growth and triggered zzso cell death, resulting in altered disease zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso cell death, and suppresses zzso gene expression in host zzso
