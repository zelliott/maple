We report here the establishment of a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso from a child with zzso large cell zzso We characterized this cell line and show that: zzso zzso cells do not grow in soft zzso but infrequently produce a tumor or suppressed growth when injected into nude zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso virus zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso by in zzso zzso using an zzso probe derived from the zzso W zzso of zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction demonstrates the presence of an zzso zzso W sequence in DNA of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest an zzso role for zzso in the development of some cases of zzso zzso
