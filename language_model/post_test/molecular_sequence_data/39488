Gene regulatory networks that control the terminally differentiated state of a cell are, by and large, only zzso zzso In a zzso screen aimed at identifying regulators of gene batteries that define the differentiated state of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we have isolated a zzso zzso with a novel zzso zzso characterized by zzso of zzso fate in zzso zzso codes for a protein that functions in the nucleus of zzso to inhibit the expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso genes and putative zzso of the zzso gene zzso The zzso protein displays a highly unusual domain architecture, that combines two functionally essential zzso zzso zzso which are probably involved in zzso regulation, with a zzso zzso 2 zzso domain, normally found only in zzso regulators of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso has lost its zzso zzso function but maintains its zzso ancient ability to zzso zzso genetically interacts with several zzso factors and zzso zzso in the context of specific regulatory network zzso These network motifs zzso the system with properties that provide insights into how cells adopt their stable terminally differentiated zzso
