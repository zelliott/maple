We have investigated a zzso zzso white man with decreased functional, but not zzso zzso plasma levels together with prolonged zzso and zzso times, detected through routine zzso studies prior to a surgical zzso A new zzso single zzso deletion zzso at position zzso within the zzso gene was identified, which predicted changes of the corresponding zzso acids zzso by the subsequent portion of the zzso V and the appearance of a premature stop zzso at position 518 zzso zzso zzso The new dysfunctional zzso San zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso Mass spectrum examination of the abnormal zzso peak gave an estimated mass zzso zzso similar to that predicted by DNA analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and, after zzso zzso the truncated zzso was shown only in the zzso who also carried normal zzso In addition, mass spectrum analysis of the zzso digest of the abnormal chain confirmed the presence of a new and zzso zzso at the last position that was predicted to form a zzso bridge with human serum zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso San zzso zzso zzso but not normal zzso contained substantial amounts of zzso Present findings confirm that truncated zzso lacking part of the terminal domain may be incorporated into mature zzso molecules and normally zzso in the zzso
