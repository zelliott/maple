zzso hormone receptors zzso can repress or activate target genes depending on the absence or presence of zzso hormone zzso zzso This zzso gene regulation is zzso by the recruitment of zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso in its zzso Many zzso zzso have been characterized in zzso Among them is zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which zzso zzso zzso We are interested in investigating the role of zzso in zzso gene expression in zzso during zzso development by using zzso zzso metamorphosis as a zzso We first cloned the zzso zzso zzso and obtained two alternative zzso forms, zzso and zzso Both zzso are expressed throughout zzso supporting a role for these zzso during the zzso To investigate whether zzso zzso participate in gene regulation by zzso zzso analysis was conducted in zzso zzso where the effects of zzso can be studied in the context of zzso in zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso had little effect on zzso transcription, whereas zzso enhanced gene zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and b were recruited to the promoter by zzso zzso However, the binding of zzso zzso to the target promoter was reduced when zzso was zzso accompanied by a slight reduction in zzso zzso at the zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso zzso regulation during zzso development and that its function is regulated by alternative zzso
