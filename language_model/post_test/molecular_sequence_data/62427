zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants expressing a benign zzso of zzso mosaic virus satellite zzso zzso zzso were zzso The transformed plants did not produce symptoms when challenged with a zzso strain of zzso zzso The same plant lines initially were susceptible to necrosis zzso by a zzso strain supporting a zzso zzso of zzso zzso but a zzso of total recovery from the necrosis was observed in the newly developing zzso The features of the observed resistance were analyzed and are consistent with two different mechanisms of zzso In transgenic plants zzso with zzso strain, the zzso zzso was correlated to the zzso of zzso by zzso amplified from the zzso zzso as the first resistance zzso On the other hand, the delayed resistance to zzso in transgenic tomato lines was zzso by a degradation process that targets zzso in a zzso zzso Evidence is provided for a correlation between a reduced zzso level of transgenic zzso zzso the zzso of small zzso 23 zzso zzso with sequence zzso to zzso the progressively reduced zzso of zzso in infected zzso and the transition in infected plants from diseased to zzso Thus, events leading to the degradation of zzso sequences indicate a role for zzso zzso as the second mechanism determining resistance of transgenic tomato zzso
