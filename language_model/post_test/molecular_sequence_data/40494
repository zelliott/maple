zzso is an essential trace element that functions in a diverse array of zzso processes that include zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso oxygen zzso The zzso protein is a zzso zzso importer that is structurally and functionally zzso in zzso plants, fruit flies, and humans and that, in all of these organisms, is localized to the plasma membrane and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso in mice demonstrated a critical role for zzso in dietary copper zzso some controversy exists over the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso In this work, we assess the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells through two independent zzso Using zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso to the zzso membrane in zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso proteins from mice fed a control or a zzso diet showed elevated levels of both total and zzso membrane zzso protein in response to transient dietary copper zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells demonstrated that zzso in the levels of the zzso form of zzso in response to copper availability were a zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso across three zzso species and suggest that increased zzso zzso zzso in response to dietary copper limitation may represent an zzso response to zzso zzso zzso availability at the site of zzso copper zzso
