zzso zzso IV from zzso zzso zzso was zzso as two molecular forms of 84 and zzso by zzso zzso mapping and zzso sequence analyses indicated that both proteins might be derived from the same zzso and that the zzso zzso might be a truncated form from the zzso zzso at least at the zzso The zzso IV gene of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso harboring a hybrid zzso zzso with about a zzso zzso containing the zzso IV zzso was zzso with an activity recovery of zzso The zzso zzso also had the same two molecular forms, though the ratio of the two forms (about zzso was different from that of the native ones (about zzso The native and zzso zzso preparations had similar specific activities, suggesting that the 84 and zzso molecules are in an active form and have almost the same specific zzso The molecular mass, the zzso number, the zzso zzso and the effects of various zzso of the native zzso indicated that this zzso was a typical zzso IV and had properties similar to those of zzso zzso rather than zzso
