Expansion segments in zzso DNA zzso can show length variation at the level of the individual, yet our understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping this variation is zzso Previous studies of expansion segment zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso have examined this variation in six zzso however, it is not known if the variation documented at this locus is representative of variation across the zzso geographic zzso Furthermore, it is unclear whether length zzso found in multiple individuals share common zzso or were generated de zzso through zzso We zzso expansion segment length zzso zzso in zzso individual zzso zzso from 33 populations at 15 sites across the species range in the zzso and used a zzso approach to determine whether zzso continues to add to the standing crop of variation at this zzso We identified seven length zzso across the sampling range, which spans almost zzso zzso Based on the zzso distribution of length zzso in the expansion segment, we conclude that they are shared ancient zzso that have persisted despite the operation of molecular mechanisms that cause the concerted evolution of zzso families such as zzso
