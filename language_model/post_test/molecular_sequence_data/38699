zzso arthritis zzso is an inflammatory zzso genetically linked to zzso and related zzso zzso zzso tissue is characterized by T cell zzso and zzso of zzso cells, strongly implicating a T zzso cell zzso interaction in zzso zzso To investigate the nature of the zzso driving the T cell response, zzso tissue was obtained from a patient with chronic zzso and T cells were zzso These T cells were zzso by zzso zzso from the same zzso zzso The T cell lines were subsequently evaluated for responsiveness to zzso zzso and cartilage zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso which were enhanced by cartilage extract were zzso zzso zzso selection and zzso was used to identify zzso zzso pairs which appeared to respond to zzso in the cartilage zzso T cell clones derived from the same joint were shown to release zzso in response to the cartilage extract and expressed a related zzso With these experiments we have shown direct evidence that zzso T cells are found within the inflamed zzso zzso and, further, that the zzso driving these T cells are cartilage zzso Since the zzso recognized by these populations of T cells are found within cartilage our data provides evidence that zzso pathology could be related to a zzso zzso response to cartilage zzso
