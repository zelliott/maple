The zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso by the action of zzso which targets zzso for rapid degradation by the zzso zzso The zzso protein is also a potent zzso zzso that acts by binding to zzso and blocking zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso We have screened a series of overlapping synthetic peptides derived from the zzso protein sequence and found that a zzso corresponding to the first 20 zzso acids of zzso zzso 3) could bind human zzso The binding site for zzso 3 on zzso was determined by deletion mapping and lies adjacent to the binding site of the zzso zzso zzso which on zzso into cells can activate zzso zzso of a reporter zzso To determine whether zzso 3 could similarly activate zzso we expressed a fusion of green fluorescent protein and zzso 3 in zzso and zzso zzso cells and were able to demonstrate induction of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso 3 was able to block in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso Small peptides which are sufficient to block degradation of zzso could provide therapeutic agents able to restore zzso cell death pathways in zzso that retain zzso zzso zzso
