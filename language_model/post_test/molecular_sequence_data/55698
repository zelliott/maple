The zzso zzso which had been identified in a screen for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso strains bearing only a disrupted copy of zzso are temperature sensitive for zzso even at a low temperature, they grow extremely slowly and do not zzso zzso zzso This unusual temperature sensitivity can be reproduced in zzso extracts zzso of zzso are temperature sensitive for the second step of zzso The zzso protein has been zzso in active form in zzso coli and has been zzso to near zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso the zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso from zzso zzso From extracts depleted of the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso while no zzso can be zzso from extracts depleted of the zzso zzso zzso therefore appears to be primarily associated with the zzso zzso The zzso against zzso inhibit the second step of zzso zzso in zzso Together, these results imply that the zzso zzso plays a role in the second step of zzso and suggest a model for the action of zzso
