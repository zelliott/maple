A zzso pair region of rat DNA containing the zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso zzso gene has been cloned and zzso The gene consists of 12 zzso and 11 zzso and is predicted to zzso both beta and alpha forms of zzso zzso IV as well as the zzso zzso protein zzso The promoter zzso to generate the zzso zzso is located in zzso 1, whereas the promoter zzso to produce the zzso transcript is contained in zzso zzso The zzso promoter region which extends from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso zzso initiation site that contains two zzso zzso response elements zzso at zzso and zzso and has been shown previously to be inactive in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and Means, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso was zzso to the zzso reporter gene and used to generate transgenic zzso The promoter was expressed exclusively in zzso zzso where zzso was found predominantly in zzso zzso The cell and zzso specificity of zzso expression was very similar to the pattern shown by the zzso zzso Although the zzso promoter was silent in zzso zzso zzso expression could be restored in primary cultures of skin zzso by introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
