zzso zzso in the zzso A1 zzso is alternatively spliced to yield A1 and zzso two proteins that differ in their ability to zzso zzso zzso site zzso zzso the zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso revealed the existence of several regions of similarity to the corresponding human zzso In zzso zzso zzso indicate that an zzso region zzso decreases zzso to the zzso zzso zzso site in a zzso carrying the zzso zzso sites of zzso 7 and zzso In zzso the zzso element promotes zzso zzso skipping in zzso expressed from a zzso containing the zzso A1 alternative zzso zzso Using zzso zzso H zzso zzso we provide support for the existence of highly stable base pairing interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso site region of zzso zzso Duplex formation occurs in naked zzso resists incubation in zzso zzso and is associated with a reduction in the assembly of zzso zzso complexes to the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso secondary structure plays an important role in promoting zzso zzso skipping in the A1 zzso
