A zzso chain zzso method was used to identify and zzso the relative abundance of the different zzso zzso various zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso and Go alpha zzso in the zzso of rats unilaterally injected with zzso in the zzso zzso Thirty days after the zzso the zzso levels of the zzso and of the zzso 1 alpha zzso were increased by about 2-3 times, those of the zzso 3 decreased by about zzso and those of zzso 2 and zzso zzso The pattern of expression of the zzso alpha zzso zzso changed in a zzso fashion, being significant 20 days after the zzso The decrease in zzso 3 alpha zzso zzso levels was maximum 10 days after the zzso and tended to be reduced in magnitude with time while the changes in zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso being reduced at 10 days and increased at 30 days after the zzso These data suggest that the expression of the various G protein alpha zzso in the zzso are continuously regulated by factors originating from zzso zzso and surrounding zzso
