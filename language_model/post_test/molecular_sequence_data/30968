The zzso protein is one of the regulatory proteins zzso by the human zzso virus zzso It has been shown to zzso viral zzso and displays features typical of some zzso G zzso To define the zzso acid sequences involved in several of the properties of the zzso zzso the corresponding gene has been submitted to a series of zzso zzso The zzso have been evaluated using various parameters which seem to correlate with the biological properties of zzso As previously observed for some signal zzso zzso membrane zzso and correct folding are critical for zzso zzso Additionally, two zzso putative zzso and G zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso have been zzso
