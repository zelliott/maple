Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified three new zzso gene family member zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and all previously reported zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso contains 11 zzso zzso zzso and zzso seem to be zzso A deletion of an zzso in zzso results in loss of a zzso site, which is zzso throughout the zzso gene zzso We have previously suggested the number of genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to be 11, which together with this study indicates that the zzso gene family contains 22 genes in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso occupies the most primitive position within the zzso zzso being a sister group to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a fairly zzso group within the zzso zzso
