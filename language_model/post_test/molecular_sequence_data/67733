zzso zzso is a major form of zzso zzso isolation that restricts gene flow between zzso zzso rice zzso zzso zzso consists of two subspecies, zzso and zzso zzso hybrids are usually zzso We show that a zzso system at the zzso locus zzso by three tightly linked genes zzso Reading zzso 3 zzso to zzso regulates fertility in zzso zzso During female zzso the action of zzso zzso and zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso stress and produces normal zzso but zzso cannot prevent zzso stress, resulting in premature programmed cell death and leads to zzso zzso zzso transmission of zzso zzso results in segregation distortion in the zzso These results add to our understanding of differences between zzso and zzso rice and may aid in rice genetic zzso
