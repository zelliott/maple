The nuclear pore complex proteins zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were identified in zzso zzso as zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses found that zzso zzso exhibit zzso DNA damage zzso To understand this zzso further, we performed a genetic screen to isolate additional conditional DNA zzso zzso of zzso We identified two new zzso of zzso and four zzso zzso zzso that suppress the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso In addition, we identified zzso a previously zzso zzso zinc cluster protein involved with zzso and the DNA damage zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso zzso to zzso and partially zzso during zzso When the zzso organizer region zzso zzso zzso zzso and removal from the zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a mutually exclusive manner with zzso being removed from the zzso region and zzso being absent from the end of the zzso beyond the zzso This region of zzso is adjacent to a cluster of nuclear pore complexes to which zzso zzso last during its progression around the nuclear envelope during initiation of zzso The results genetically extend the zzso regulatory system to include a protein with selective large-scale zzso location observed during zzso The data suggest a model in which zzso and zzso its new zzso zzso might help to orchestrate global zzso states during zzso and the DNA damage zzso
