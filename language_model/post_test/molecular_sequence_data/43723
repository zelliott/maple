A data set of complete zzso zzso b and zzso zzso sequences is presented here for 17 representatives of zzso and zzso together with potential zzso zzso zzso two zzso two zzso four zzso and two zzso We include seven sequences not previously published from zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielding a total of nearly zzso zzso for both genes zzso zzso and zzso analyses of each gene indicate that 11 zzso are well supported, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso (with low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Neither the zzso b nor the zzso zzso genes resolve the relationships between these major zzso The combined analysis of the two genes suggests a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso fall outside this zzso zzso could represent the sister zzso of zzso as deduced from zzso studies among zzso zzso zzso includes five major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among which the zzso relationships are not zzso Thus, zzso do not appear to be zzso zzso their split into the zzso and zzso zzso An association between zzso and zzso is supported by the zzso b gene but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of divergence dates suggests that the zzso could have zzso from other zzso about 60 zzso
