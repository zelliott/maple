zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the last step of zzso synthesis and is expressed specifically in the liver of zzso zzso zzso of liver zzso is zzso and zzso regulated in coordination with other zzso cycle zzso The gene for the rat zzso was cloned and the structure zzso This gene is 12 zzso long and is split into eight zzso All of the zzso donor and zzso sites conform to the zzso zzso The zzso initiation site was determined by zzso zzso mapping and primer zzso A zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso sequence are present 27 and 60 bases upstream from the cap site, zzso zzso and downstream from the cap site, there are several sets of direct repeats and zzso repeats and several sequences resembling the zzso factor zzso binding sites, the zzso core zzso the zzso zzso binding sites, the zzso responsive zzso and the putative elements for zzso expression of zzso zzso A zzso sequence in the zzso region of the zzso gene is highly zzso with sequences in the zzso regions of the genes for rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and for human zzso zzso zzso zzso other two zzso of the zzso zzso
