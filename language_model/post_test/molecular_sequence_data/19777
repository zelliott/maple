zzso is an acute and contagious disease characterized by inflammation of the upper respiratory tract of zzso The zzso agent of zzso is the bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso group zzso zzso agents from the same group are frequently isolated from horses with zzso and may induce mistaken zzso Among the subspecies of zzso zzso the zzso features are almost zzso however, the zzso potential is widely zzso The aim of this study was to characterize zzso zzso zzso obtained from clinical samples of zzso by zzso tests and to analyze the partial sequences obtained from fragments of the zzso zzso In this work, 26 strains of zzso zzso isolated from horse clinical samples were zzso By zzso zzso 18 were characterized as zzso zzso zzso zzso five as zzso zzso zzso zzso two as zzso zzso zzso zzso and one as zzso zzso However 21 zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and five as zzso zzso zzso zzso by DNA zzso The sequencing of the partial zzso gene was demonstrated to be an alternative method to analyze and differentiate strains of zzso zzso In addition, this method can be useful as a zzso tool for characterization of zzso zzso
