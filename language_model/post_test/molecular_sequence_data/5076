zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso is characterized by fluid zzso and inflammatory responses in the infected zzso The inflammatory response provoked by zzso initially consists largely of a zzso zzso migration into the zzso zzso and the gut zzso The interactions between zzso and zzso zzso cells are known to play an essential role in inducing the inflammatory zzso Upon interaction with zzso cells zzso are able to elicit zzso zzso to zzso This zzso is recognized as a key zzso feature underlying zzso zzso However, the nature and mechanism of such zzso has not been clarified to zzso Here, we characterize zzso a novel zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso and present data zzso that zzso is zzso into zzso cells via a zzso zzso to promote fluid zzso and inflammatory responses in the infected zzso
