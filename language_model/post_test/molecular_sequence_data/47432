Six genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso were identified by sequencing the region surrounding the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso previously shown to catalyze the initial reaction in the zzso of zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso together with the zzso zzso span a DNA region of zzso zzso and are transcribed as a zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso The sequences of the deduced proteins zzso and zzso exhibit significant similarity to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which are involved in zzso degradation of aromatic zzso The predicted zzso gene product shows sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso and the deduced zzso protein belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene and the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of any of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso of a zzso resistance cassette abolished formation of the biologically active zzso I, J, X, and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso zzso production zzso I, J, X, zzso could be restored by feeding with zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso zzso exclusively produced novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contain zzso as the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to zzso function in the zzso zzso leading to zzso the putative activities of each of their products are zzso
