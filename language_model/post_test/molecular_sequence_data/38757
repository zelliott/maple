Many zzso contain both a soluble and a particulate methane zzso A unique zzso switch, zzso by copper zzso regulates the expression of these zzso When the zzso ratio of the cell is low, the soluble zzso is zzso and when the zzso ratio is high, the particulate zzso is zzso A model for the mechanism of this switch is zzso
