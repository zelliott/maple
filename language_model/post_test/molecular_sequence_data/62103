zzso zzso A and B zzso A and zzso are the major zzso in zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso or zzso of zzso peripheral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although these zzso are among the most widely studied zzso their integral association with the outer zzso membrane has deterred knowledge of their structures until recent work yielded the three-dimensional structure of zzso B zzso zzso zzso 9 (2002) zzso In our study, we compared the primary sequence in different regions of zzso B to those in selected proteins of known structure, including zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso zzso zzso 65 (2001) zzso we have identified three zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that appear to play a role in generating zzso active zzso zzso However, examination of models of the zzso B structure show that these zzso lie outside the zzso binding zzso Thus, it appears that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not directly affect the active site, but they could zzso activity through an independent function such as zzso binding of zzso during synthesis of the zzso B zzso zzso
