zzso encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso complex, an integral zzso zzso membrane protein complex required for zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso predicts a zzso protein with no obvious zzso signal sequence but with one domain of sufficient length and zzso to span a zzso zzso zzso directed against a zzso form of zzso were used to confirm the membrane location of zzso and that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso in zzso renders zzso cells temperature sensitive for zzso zzso cells accumulate some zzso precursors at a zzso temperature and a variety of precursors at the restrictive zzso zzso cells show defects in zzso complex zzso Because zzso cells affect the zzso of some, but not all zzso precursor zzso the role of zzso may be to interact with the signal zzso of zzso zzso
