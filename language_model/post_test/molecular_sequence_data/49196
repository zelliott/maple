Thirty-four zzso zzso zzso strains were isolated from decayed wood bark and a hot spring water sample based on their ability to degrade zzso acid under zzso zzso It was found that these bacteria were able to degrade a wide range of aromatic acids such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso pathways for the degradation of these aromatic acids at 60 degrees C were examined by using one of the zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso acids were detected as breakdown products from zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism was proposed to be responsible for these zzso The degradation of zzso and zzso acids was determined to proceed through zzso and zzso acid, respectively, for their ring zzso It is likely that a zzso mechanism is the case in the zzso acid zzso which involved zzso acid, zzso and zzso acid as the zzso Other strains zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have the same pathways as those of strain zzso except that strains zzso zzso and zzso had the ability to transform zzso acid to zzso acid, which strain B1 could not zzso
