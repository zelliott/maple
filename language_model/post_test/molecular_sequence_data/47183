zzso sequence of the bovine group C zzso zzso strain gene 3 was zzso zzso 3 is zzso zzso zzso in length and contains a long open reading frame zzso beginning at zzso 22 and terminating at zzso zzso This zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 83 zzso The deduced gene 3 zzso acid sequence shares zzso and zzso identities with zzso of the zzso zzso and human Bristol zzso zzso Lack of high zzso acid sequence zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and human group C zzso indicates that the zzso strain represents a new P zzso
