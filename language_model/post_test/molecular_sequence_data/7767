DNA zzso is an essential replication protein that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso DNA zzso consisting of two zzso zzso and zzso plays a key role in both the initiation of DNA replication and the synthesis of Okazaki fragments for lagging strand zzso We mapped the locations of human zzso of the genes coding for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso amplification using zzso of a panel of zzso hybrids, to zzso 1 and 6, zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected at zzso by zzso in zzso zzso using several zzso DNA zzso
