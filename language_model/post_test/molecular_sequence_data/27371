zzso zzso binding protein C zzso bound to the zzso zzso thick filament, plays an important role in the regulation of muscle zzso zzso is a large zzso protein that interacts with myosin, zzso and possibly zzso zzso in zzso are the most common known cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso plays an essential role in the normal cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso has 81 zzso and 73 zzso zzso presenting a major challenge for unequivocal identification of specific zzso zzso zzso mass zzso which directly analyzes intact zzso is a powerful technique to universally observe and zzso protein zzso modifications without a zzso zzso Here, we have extended zzso electron capture zzso mass zzso to zzso characterize mouse zzso expressed in zzso We have zzso identified all of the zzso sites in the truncated zzso zzso and full-length forms of zzso zzso zzso and characterized the sequential zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso approach, which ensures full sequence zzso Unit mass resolution and high mass accuracy zzso zzso have been achieved for a zzso protein (the largest protein zzso resolved to zzso zzso we discovered that zzso in zzso zzso even a seemingly minor one, can dramatically alter its zzso state, which is significant because truncated zzso proteins are routinely zzso for their full-length forms in crystal structure and functional zzso Our study provides direct evidence of zzso in the zzso state between the truncated and full-length zzso zzso which can lead to variations in structure and zzso
