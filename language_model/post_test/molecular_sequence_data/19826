zzso zzso represents an zzso zzso essential zzso modification with immense impact on a variety of cellular zzso In humans, zzso defects result in zzso syndrome, a severe zzso zzso muscular zzso associated with defects in zzso migration that produce complex brain and eye zzso In mouse and zzso loss of zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso initiate the assembly of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso family is classified into zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso distinct target zzso In contrast to other types of zzso signal sequences for zzso have not been identified to zzso In the present study, we identified signals that determine zzso zzso Using specific model zzso we demonstrate that in zzso zzso mediates zzso of zzso zzso zzso The nature of the zzso sequence is zzso as long as it is flanked by a zzso domain facing the zzso zzso zzso Our work shows that, in contrast to several other types of zzso zzso zzso signals are not just linear zzso primary structure sequences but rather are highly zzso Based on these findings, we performed in zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso and identified previously zzso zzso zzso This tool for zzso identification of zzso proteins is of general interest because several of these proteins are major players of a wide variety of cellular zzso
