zzso is zzso in zzso T cells, and zzso from the membrane to the zzso after zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that it is identical with zzso a putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso form of zzso exhibits zzso in the apparent molecular mass on zzso 50 and 52 zzso zzso and zzso and each zzso exhibits zzso in the zzso point, when examined by two-dimensional zzso When the two molecular mass zzso of zzso were zzso with alkaline zzso both zzso showed the same apparent molecular mass of 50 zzso on zzso but could be distinguished by their distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso revealed that the difference was limited to one zzso zzso zzso sequence and mass zzso analyses of these peptides showed that the peptides derived from zzso and zzso had the same zzso zzso acid sequence up to eight zzso but had distinct molecular masses, zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso zzso is the product of the previously cloned zzso and the reduction in the molecular mass of the zzso zzso could be explained by deletion of six zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
