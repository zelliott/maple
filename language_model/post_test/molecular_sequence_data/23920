The juvenile form of zzso zzso zzso disease) is a neurodegenerative zzso storage disorder caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of unknown function, which is mainly localized in zzso in zzso cells and in zzso in zzso zzso For this study we constructed zzso proteins of three zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso and zzso zzso of the reporter proteins zzso and zzso acid zzso to identify zzso targeting motifs and to determine the zzso transport and zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cell zzso We report that a novel type of zzso sorting zzso zzso present in the second zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for proper targeting to zzso The first zzso domain of zzso and the zzso of the zzso motif resulted in a partial zzso of zzso proteins to the plasma zzso At zzso zzso of the different zzso are present at the cell zzso Analysis of zzso zzso processing revealed that zzso acid zzso zzso containing the second zzso domain of zzso showed the highest rate of zzso delivery, whereas the C zzso of zzso was found to be less efficient in zzso zzso However, none of these zzso zzso zzso was able to interact with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These data revealed that zzso sorting motifs located in an zzso zzso domain of a zzso protein have different structural requirements for zzso binding than sorting signals found in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso membrane zzso
