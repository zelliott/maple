zzso oxide zzso is inhibited by zzso derivatives of zzso whose cellular levels are controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that through zzso of zzso zzso regulates the activity of zzso zzso we report the kinetic properties of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso demonstrated zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso and 154 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso This zzso activity was selective for free zzso and zzso and was incapable of zzso zzso incorporated zzso zzso studies performed to determine the effects of zzso oxygen and zzso nitrogen species on zzso activity demonstrated that low level zzso exposure had little effect on zzso activity and that zzso approaching zzso zzso were needed to zzso significant zzso of zzso zzso However, exposure of zzso to the zzso zzso product, zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity with zzso zzso observed at 10 zzso 50% zzso at 50 zzso and complete zzso at 500 zzso Mass zzso analysis demonstrated that the mechanism of zzso resulted from the formation of Michael zzso on His zzso which lies within the active site zzso zzso of zzso These studies were performed with zzso relevant zzso of this zzso zzso product and suggest that zzso activity can be impaired under conditions of increased zzso zzso Because zzso is the primary zzso involved in zzso zzso the loss of activity of this zzso would result in impaired zzso activity and reduced NO zzso
