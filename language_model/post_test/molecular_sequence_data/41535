The zzso zzso in the East African Great Lakes are a prime model system for the study of zzso zzso zzso the availability of an elaborate zzso framework is an important zzso Previous zzso hypotheses on East African zzso are mainly based on zzso and/or zzso zzso and, to date, no zzso zzso exists that is based on zzso DNA sequence zzso Here, we present the design of an extensive new primer set (24 nuclear zzso for East African zzso that will be used for zzso zzso analyses in the zzso The zzso are designed to work for both zzso sequencing and next-generation sequencing with the zzso zzso As a proof of principle, we validate these zzso in a zzso representative set of 16 zzso species from Lake zzso and main river systems in the area and provide a basic evaluation of the markers with respect to marker length and diversity zzso
