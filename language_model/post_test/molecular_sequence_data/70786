zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso Others have shown that expression of mouse zzso can complement the lack of responsiveness to zzso stimuli in two zzso cell zzso Here we report the isolation of a full-length human zzso zzso zzso translation of human zzso zzso predicts a zzso zzso protein which shares zzso identity and zzso similarity with the mouse zzso By sequence zzso we mapped the human zzso gene to zzso zzso We note that the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are arranged in a head-to-head orientation separated by no more than 800 zzso This map location is further supported by the sequence of an alternatively spliced zzso of human zzso zzso Thus, human zzso is an zzso gene closely adjacent to the zzso zzso
