The zzso zzso channel zzso belongs to a new class of channel proteins called the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso and in the control of blood pressure has been demonstrated recently by the identification of zzso in zzso beta and gamma zzso causing zzso The function of zzso in zzso zzso depends critically on its ability to discriminate between zzso and other zzso like zzso or zzso zzso is virtually zzso to zzso zzso and the molecular basis for its high zzso selectivity is largely zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso domain of the zzso alpha zzso zzso which when zzso allows larger zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to pass through the zzso The relative zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso is related zzso to the zzso radius of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso increase the molecular zzso of the channel by zzso the pore geometry at the selectivity zzso Proper geometry of the pore is required to tightly accommodate zzso and zzso zzso and to exclude larger zzso We provide evidence that zzso discriminates between zzso mainly on the basis of their size and the energy of zzso
