zzso does not bind zzso yet appears to be the major signaling partner for other zzso receptors by forming zzso complexes with zzso zzso or zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso of zzso at zzso A resolution reveals an activated zzso similar to that of the zzso when zzso with zzso and very different from that seen in the zzso forms of zzso or zzso The structure explains the inability of zzso to bind known zzso and suggests why zzso fails to form zzso Together, the data suggest a model in which zzso is already in the activated zzso and ready to interact with other zzso zzso zzso
