The zzso nature of the zzso of the four broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may imply that the sensitivity of zzso for these zzso remains fairly constant over the course of zzso Here, we demonstrate that viruses isolated early during the course of infection were mostly sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso although variation was observed in zzso sensitivity of zzso viruses to the different zzso as well as between viruses from different zzso zzso resistance to zzso developed relatively early during follow-up in three out of five patients, while early, zzso sensitive viruses in three out of five patients were replaced by zzso resistant zzso relatively late in zzso In contrast, viruses generally remained sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso over the course of infection, although zzso and/or zzso resistant zzso did emerge later in infection in four out of five zzso In most patients, zzso resistance to zzso or zzso did not correlate with zzso at critical zzso acid positions in their defined zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso were present throughout the course of zzso As viral resistance against zzso zzso generally developed when zzso serum zzso activity had faded, it seems unlikely that these changes are driven by escape from zzso zzso zzso
