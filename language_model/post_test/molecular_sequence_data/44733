The zzso fat zzso zzso gene is a zzso zzso necessary for the normal development of the eye and of the zzso stage zzso in the zzso Using a gene trap approach in embryonic stem cells we have isolated a zzso gene with extensive sequence similarity to the zzso zzso gene and called it zzso zzso zzso in zzso The putative mouse protein shows zzso and a high degree of sequence identity to the zzso protein over almost its entire length of zzso zzso zzso The two zzso sites characteristic of zzso zzso are very highly zzso between mice and zzso and this conservation extends to zzso zzso is expressed in a complex pattern during zzso zzso In zzso zzso detected zzso transcripts in the rapidly expanding cell populations of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso as well as in the zzso regions between the digits, indicating that it is not associated with a single zzso or cellular zzso The strong sequence similarity to zzso and the zzso regulated expression pattern suggest that zzso and the zzso zzso may play a role in determining cell fate in zzso as has been established for zzso
