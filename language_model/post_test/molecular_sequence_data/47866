The zzso relationships of zzso and zzso within zzso were investigated using nuclear pancreatic zzso A gene zzso The various kinds of zzso in the data zzso (15 zzso zzso 375 zzso were examined for zzso in order to apply a weighted zzso zzso zzso were derived by maximum zzso (weighted and zzso and maximum likelihood procedures, using a zzso zzso as zzso zzso likelihood gave the most robust zzso All analyses cluster some traditional zzso with a strong zzso such as three species of the zzso zzso two zzso Asian rats, and two zzso in each of the zzso and zzso zzso When analyzed with those of other zzso zzso representing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso gene suggest that zzso and zzso constitute a zzso zzso at the zzso level, zzso zzso The relationships between the six zzso of zzso appear poorly zzso except for a zzso uniting zzso zzso and zzso Within this zzso the sister group of zzso could not be identified, as the branch length defining a zzso + zzso cluster is extremely zzso The poor resolution of our zzso zzso is probably the result of two zzso factors, namely the limited size of the pancreatic zzso sequence and the probable short time intervals during the radiation of the six zzso zzso involved in this zzso
