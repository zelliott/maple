We have isolated three independent clones for nuclear zzso zzso genes from an zzso DNA library using a zzso probe generated by zzso Each of the coding sequences for zzso in these clones is identical and is interrupted by an identical 11 zzso long intervening sequence at the same position in the zzso loop of the zzso Their sequences differ at two positions from the zzso in a soybean zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA demonstrates that a gene family coding for zzso is dispersed at at least eight zzso in the zzso The zzso precursor zzso intermediate was detected by zzso analysis using an zzso probe complementary to the putative zzso zzso In order to know whether zzso commonly interrupt plant zzso zzso their coding sequences were zzso from the zzso of eight zzso separate plant zzso All 53 sequences determined contain 10 to 13 zzso long intervening zzso always positioned one base downstream from the zzso They can all be potentially folded into the secondary structure characteristic for plant zzso precursor zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso are always present at the zzso end of each zzso
