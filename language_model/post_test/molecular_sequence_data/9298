Plant defense responses are tightly controlled by many positive and negative regulators to cope with attacks from various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of powdery zzso resistance, and zzso zzso display enhanced resistance to powdery zzso zzso zzso To identify components acting in the zzso pathway, we screened for zzso zzso and identified a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso suppresses all zzso zzso including powdery zzso resistance, zzso cell death, and zzso zzso The zzso single zzso is more susceptible to a zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso virulent strain and to zzso strains carrying zzso or zzso than the wild zzso We show that zzso directly binds to the promoter region of zzso zzso zzso zzso a key component in zzso TO zzso zzso plant zzso Also, the zzso zzso suppresses the zzso zzso zzso which shows enhanced resistance to both zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso regulates zzso zzso by directly binding to the zzso zzso zzso promoter region in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is suppressed by zzso Our data indicate that zzso plays an important role in plant immunity and zzso signaling by directly regulating zzso and zzso
