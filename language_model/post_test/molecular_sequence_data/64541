zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was engineered in such a way that the zzso chain was divided into two, between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two proteins thus formed, zzso and zzso retained their zzso activity as zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the former and the latter, zzso Neither activity was dependent on zzso in sharp contrast to the complete reaction of intact zzso When assessed by gel zzso zzso zzso was found to exist either in zzso or zzso depending on the protein zzso while zzso + zzso occurred in zzso for the most zzso The two proteins do not associate spontaneously or in the presence of zzso Based on these zzso this paper discusses how the zzso structure of PC is built up and how zzso zzso the protein zzso
