A zzso analysis of zzso DNA variation was performed in order to test the hypothesis of a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso rivers from a zzso zzso Over 345 zzso specimens from European rivers covering most of the zzso native range were investigated using 600 zzso of the zzso b zzso zzso in European rivers belong to four highly divergent zzso groups zzso differing by mean divergence estimates from zzso to zzso These four lineages have a largely zzso distribution, zzso four geographical zzso two Mediterranean, and two zzso zzso This pattern provided strong evidence for: zzso the zzso of this species from most of Europe during maximum ice zzso zzso its survival in four zzso zzso side of the Balkans, eastern Greece zzso zzso southern tributaries of the Danube, and periphery of Black and Caspian zzso zzso a differential zzso zzso of zzso and northern Europe from the last two zzso only; zzso the occurrence of this zzso in two steps for the zzso zzso lineage that entered western Europe zzso zzso during the zzso zzso period and survived the last zzso there before colonizing zzso UK and German zzso up to the zzso during the zzso and zzso the occurrence of this zzso in a single step for the zzso zzso lineage that entered the Baltic area as far as the zzso in the zzso Both lineages came into contact in the River zzso without evident zzso
