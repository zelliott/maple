zzso is a genetic element found integrated in zzso zzso zzso and additionally in a replicating form in two zzso B3 and zzso The presence of the zzso replicating form in these zzso was the result of zzso located on zzso in the zzso zzso named zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene is not directly involved in zzso but its zzso led to the disappearance of the zzso free zzso therefore, it was considered as a replication zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were located in the zzso promoter and were shown to be point zzso that increase the promoter zzso The replication regulator role of zzso was demonstrated by the fact that its zzso expression in cells zzso zzso which is normally only zzso led to the appearance of the zzso replicating zzso Northern analysis showed that the zzso gene transcript can be detected only for the replicating zzso B3 and B4 and that the three adjacent genes zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed zzso As replication of zzso is not needed for its maintenance but is an indispensable stage of its transfer, the zzso zzso described formally as an zzso of zzso zzso is zzso involved in zzso zzso
