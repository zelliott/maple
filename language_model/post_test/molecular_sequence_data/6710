To provide tools for functional molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso marker for the zzso of the zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed zzso containing the zzso coding region flanked by untranslated zzso and 3' sequences of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments had revealed that zzso are highly sensitive to the zzso analogue zzso and do not survive in the presence of as little as 2 zzso zzso of circular zzso via zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso up to 100 zzso DNA and zzso analyses of resistant cells indicated that zzso the zzso DNA was not integrated into the zzso zzso but was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the copy number of the zzso and the expression of zzso zzso were zzso to the amount of zzso used for selection, and zzso under continuous selection, the zzso was zzso over an observation period of 6 zzso Moreover, the zzso could be zzso into zzso coli and was found to be zzso To investigate the use of zzso to zzso other genes in zzso zzso a second marker, the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene under control of an zzso zzso zzso gene promoter was introduced into the zzso zzso of the zzso with this construct also zzso zzso resistance and, in addition, allowed continuous expression of zzso activity in quantities corresponding to the amount of zzso used for zzso When selection was zzso zzso plasmids were lost as indicated by an exponential decline of zzso activity in zzso zzso
