We report the isolation of six different zzso genes in zzso zzso which are expressed during early zzso zzso clones of all of them were partially zzso including two from previously isolated zzso zzso zzso and found to contain zzso which share a high degree of zzso with the zzso protein zzso to 59 out of 60 zzso zzso We find a short region of zzso zzso zzso zzso Pro zzso zzso in four of the zzso which is also present in zzso and that may zzso to a bend region preceding the zzso Northern blots have been performed to show the zzso pattern through early zzso zzso Three of the genes are expressed only during a very narrow period of zzso reinforcing the view that zzso genes are zzso zzso
