Two zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso were zzso coupled to zzso and used as zzso to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to both peptides reacted with rat zzso but not the structurally similar zzso form as determined by zzso zzso zzso However, zzso to both peptides detected both rat zzso and zzso on zzso In addition zzso of human liver zzso revealed that both zzso recognized human zzso but not zzso zzso zzso generated against one of the peptides recognized rat zzso and zzso but did not detect human zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso zzso as a practical approach for the generation of zzso specific zzso
