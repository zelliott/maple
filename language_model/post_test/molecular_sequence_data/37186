zzso zzso proteins in most zzso have a zzso zzso zzso as well as more divergent zzso regions that are rich in basic zzso zzso in the zzso regions can affect zzso packaging, virus zzso and reverse zzso of the viral zzso To gain a further understanding of the roles of NC zzso regions in the zzso replication cycle, we generated and characterized zzso zzso expression zzso derived from zzso leukemia virus and zzso necrosis virus by replacing an NC zzso region from one virus with the counterpart from the other zzso We found that all four zzso were able to generate zzso package viral zzso and complete the viral replication zzso Two zzso had mild defects in virus assembly that correlated with a decrease in the zzso points of zzso suggesting that the basic nature of NC is important in virus zzso This finding indicates that, although the primary sequences of these zzso regions have little zzso the zzso sequences are functional both as part of the zzso zzso and as processed NC zzso
