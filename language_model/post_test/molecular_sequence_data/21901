The Toll zzso was originally identified as an indispensable zzso for zzso embryonic development and subsequently as an essential component of innate immunity from insects to zzso Although in zzso the zzso zzso processes the zzso protein to generate the Toll zzso during development, the identification of the zzso responsible for zzso processing during the immune response has remained elusive for a zzso Here, we report a zzso called zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso expression show no noticeable zzso processing and become highly susceptible to microbial zzso Furthermore, activated zzso can rescue zzso and lateral development in zzso lacking zzso showing the functional zzso between zzso and zzso These results imply that a single zzso signaling event can be zzso for different biological zzso such as immunity and development, by recruiting similar zzso zzso with distinct zzso zzso
