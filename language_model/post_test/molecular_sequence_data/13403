zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling through the association with the common gamma chain of the zzso receptors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Unlike other members of the zzso family, the expression of zzso is highly restricted in zzso zzso To zzso in zzso function of zzso zzso mice were generated by zzso zzso Mice zzso for zzso zzso zzso showed severe zzso specifically in zzso zzso B cell precursors in bone zzso zzso and both T and B cells in the zzso drastically zzso although these defects were significantly recovered as aging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso T cells, and zzso zzso gamma delta T cells were zzso zzso number of zzso stem cells in bone zzso from zzso mice and the similar capability to generate zzso and zzso colonies as zzso mice indicated specific defects in zzso stem zzso Furthermore, the abnormal architecture of zzso zzso suggested the involvement of zzso in the function of zzso zzso T cells developed in the zzso mice did not respond to either zzso zzso or zzso These findings establish the crucial role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso
