In order to study the role of individual zzso acids in the function of the zzso zzso zzso of retinal rod zzso zzso the following zzso were made: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of seven zzso zzso acids zzso zzso was also investigated, and the activity of all the zzso zzso gamma forms zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gamma genes was achieved by sequential in zzso zzso and zzso The results suggest that zzso gamma zzso zzso which is rich in basic zzso zzso and in particular zzso is essential for zzso gamma binding both to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein found in retinal rods that activates zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso in zzso zzso and in binding to T zzso but not in binding to zzso alpha zzso
