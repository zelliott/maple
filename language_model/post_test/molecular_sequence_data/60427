It has been proposed that zzso a highly zzso zzso is a candidate gene product related to the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso in zzso zzso However, no consensus has been reached as to whether this relationship is direct or zzso Recently the zzso for zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso zzso To learn more about the zzso of zzso we attempted to: zzso zzso zzso as a fusion protein in zzso zzso carry out its zzso zzso generate zzso zzso to study its expression and cellular zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine whether zzso affects zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso 

The open reading frame zzso of human zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso and established as a zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso Upon induction with zzso zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso fusion protein and zzso to zzso zzso zzso were raised in rabbits after zzso with zzso zzso zzso and its expression and cellular distribution in zzso zzso cells determined by Western zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso cells was carried out upon treatment of cultured cells with zzso solution up to 60 zzso and zzso expression measured by Northern and Western zzso zzso 

By Western zzso analysis or zzso zzso zzso recognized a main band of zzso in total cell extracts from zzso body or metabolically labeled zzso zzso zzso By indirect zzso zzso zzso stained the zzso of zzso in the intact zzso and the zzso region of cultured zzso zzso zzso When subjected to zzso treatment, zzso cells did not induce zzso of zzso protein from the zzso into the plasma zzso nor changes in zzso expression at the protein level, but did down regulate up to zzso the level of zzso zzso in continued zzso zzso 

These observations indicate that, contrary to previous suggestions, the zzso protein is not likely to be in contact with the plasma membrane of zzso zzso cells, and its influence on zzso zzso activity is more likely to be expressed zzso zzso through zzso zzso
