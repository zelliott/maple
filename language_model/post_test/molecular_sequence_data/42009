The zzso zzso zzso gene was recently cloned and a three zzso deletion removing zzso 508 from the coding region was identified as the zzso on the majority of zzso zzso zzso The frequency of this zzso varies among different geographic zzso In this study we zzso 25 Turkish families and have found the relative frequency of the delta zzso zzso zzso to be zzso This is similar to that reported in other Middle Eastern countries and contrasts with the considerably higher zzso encountered in Northern Europe and North zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso binding folds zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene with direct sequencing, has also shown that the other defined zzso in these regions of the gene do not occur in the zzso patients from the Turkish zzso One patient presenting with severe clinical features was determined to be a compound zzso for the zzso delta zzso
