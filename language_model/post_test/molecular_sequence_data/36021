Eight new zzso of zzso A, two new zzso of zzso and 30 hybrid peptides containing sequences from zzso and zzso have been zzso The lengths of the peptides have varied from 37 zzso (the length of zzso zzso to 18 zzso The peptides have been zzso for zzso of sheep red blood cells and for zzso activity against two Gram negative and three Gram positive zzso The best zzso of zzso A maintained the zzso coli activity of the parental zzso and were not zzso for red blood zzso zzso and its replacement zzso were all zzso for red blood cells, but an analog with zzso segments was zzso Several of the hybrid peptides were found to be both zzso and highly active against all test zzso The data were used to define the structural requirements for zzso zzso
