In order to investigate the symbiotic interaction between soybean and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso strain zzso was found to induce a strongly reduced number of ineffective zzso zzso analysis of the soybean zzso central tissue revealed the presence of numerous starch zzso and zzso in the infected zzso In addition, the number of zzso was extremely low, indicating an impaired interaction between the plant and invading zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso DNA region uncovered four open reading frames zzso lacking any data base zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso site, are zzso in the same reading zzso A zzso expression product in zzso coli indicated the presence of a common zzso called zzso zzso relevant zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso by combined zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of gene disruption zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were also required for effective zzso with zzso Further downstream the gene for a putative inner membrane protein zzso of unknown function was zzso on the opposite zzso zzso extension studies led to the conclusion that the organization of genes differed from the zzso zzso in this particular region of zzso zzso zzso
