The complement system has been discovered in zzso and zzso and plays a crucial role in the innate defense against common zzso As a central component in the complement system, complement component 3 zzso is an zzso between innate and zzso immune zzso In this study, a new zzso of zzso in the sea cucumber zzso zzso termed zzso was zzso Its open reading frame zzso is zzso and encodes for zzso zzso acids with a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso acid zzso The mature protein molecular weight of zzso was zzso It has a zzso zzso site and a zzso zzso where zzso is zzso into zzso and zzso chain during zzso zzso The expression patterns of two distinct sea cucumber zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso During the different development stages from zzso egg to juvenile of the sea cucumber, the highest expression levels of zzso and zzso genes were both found in late zzso In the adult, the highest expression of these two genes was observed in the zzso and followed by the body zzso zzso and zzso genes expression increased significantly at zzso after the zzso zzso These results indicated that these two zzso genes play a pivotal role in immune responses to the bacterial infection in sea zzso
