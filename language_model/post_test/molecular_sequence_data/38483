We determined the complete zzso sequence of the zzso DNA of the zzso crab zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso encodes the 13 zzso 2 zzso and 22 zzso genes typical for zzso The arrangement of these genes and about half of the sequence was reported zzso however, the sequence contained a large number of zzso which are corrected zzso The two strands of zzso zzso have significantly different zzso zzso The strand zzso most zzso proteins has zzso 25 times as many zzso as zzso and zzso times as many zzso as zzso This zzso bias zzso with the biases in zzso acid content and synonymous zzso usage in proteins zzso by different strands and with the number of zzso base pairs in the stem regions of zzso zzso The sizes of most zzso protein genes in zzso are either identical to or slightly smaller than those of their zzso zzso The usage of the initiation and termination zzso in these genes seems to follow patterns that are zzso among most zzso and some other zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso contains a potential zzso structure, and we found a similar structure in the zzso region of the published zzso of the zzso tick zzso zzso A simulation study was designed to evaluate the significance of these secondary zzso it revealed that they are statistically zzso No zzso comparable structure can be identified for the zzso ticks zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter two animals also share a zzso gene zzso and an unusual structure of zzso that is exactly the same association of changes as previously reported for a group of zzso This suggests that the changes observed are not independent and that the zzso structure found in the zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso may play the same role as that between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the role of lagging strand origin of zzso
