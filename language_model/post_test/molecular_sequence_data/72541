We have cloned and characterized a zzso zzso zzso a rat nuclear zzso zzso The zzso zzso was obtained by zzso screening of a rat zzso expression zzso The predicted zzso contains zzso zzso acids with a composition of zzso charged zzso and is highly zzso The zzso gene appears to be zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies with zzso fusion protein zzso show that the zzso protein zzso with nuclear pore complexes in zzso zzso The expression of zzso is about zzso times higher in rat zzso than in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso protein changes dramatically during male germ cell zzso from nuclear pore zzso zzso in zzso to whole nucleus zzso in zzso and finally to a nuclear surface zzso in mature zzso These changes are temporally and zzso related to nuclear reorganization during male germ cell zzso
