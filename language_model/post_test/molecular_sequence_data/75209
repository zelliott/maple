The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains two sets of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences physically separated by a 7 zzso DNA zzso We determined the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the known genes zzso and zzso (Don et zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso containing at least three zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso When the zzso gene of the zzso zzso was compared with gene zzso of zzso zzso which encodes the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso the two genes showed zzso zzso sequence zzso with zzso zzso in their zzso acid zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso the two genes zzso the zzso and the zzso showed a 4 zzso overlap spanning the initiation zzso of the zzso gene and the termination zzso of the zzso zzso The sizes of the zzso zzso by the zzso genes zzso and zzso are very similar and thus reflect their functional zzso
