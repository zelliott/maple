We have analyzed zzso sequence variation at the zzso zzso zzso locus from four populations of zzso zzso from four zzso All four population samples show a significant reduction in silent variation compared to the neutral zzso The levels of silent variation across all four populations are consistent with the predictions of the background selection zzso however, Zimbabwe has a remarkably low level of zzso In the face of dramatically reduced silent zzso an zzso acid zzso leading to the common zzso zzso at zzso remains in low to intermediate frequency in all zzso zzso In the Chinese population sample, the ratio of replacement to silent variation is significantly elevated compared to the neutral zzso The difference in patterns of variation across these population samples suggests that selection on zzso (or the zzso zzso has been different in the Chinese population than in the other zzso
