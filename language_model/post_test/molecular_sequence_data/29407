zzso binding to zzso zzso proteins zzso formation of signaling complexes at focal zzso zzso zzso with zzso at sites of zzso zzso and is zzso to serve as a zzso site for the assembly of zzso protein complexes involved in regulating cell zzso Recently, we identified a new member of the zzso family called zzso zzso is localized at focal zzso and zzso of zzso slows cell zzso In an effort to define the molecular mechanism by which zzso affects cell migration, the zzso zzso zzso was employed to identify proteins that directly bind to zzso This zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso interact with zzso a member of the zzso zzso This association is zzso by the zzso region of the zzso family members and the zzso zzso region of zzso Furthermore, the association between zzso and the two zzso family members was demonstrated to occur in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso family members may cooperate to regulate cell zzso
