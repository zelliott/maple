The genetic cause of male zzso due to impaired zzso is unknown in the majority of cases, but the general assumption is that it is a complex zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso occur in the zzso zzso gene in men with idiopathic impaired zzso The zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is located in zzso region zzso that has been shown to be associated with impaired zzso It is a member of the zzso gene family and is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso and round zzso where it is thought to affect zzso and signal zzso We identified eight single zzso zzso in our patient group of 153 zzso men by sequencing the zzso zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso did not occur in a control group of 143 zzso zzso The zzso zzso causes loss of a zzso zzso thereby affecting a putative site of zzso possibly required for zzso Interestingly, this zzso was inherited from the zzso The zzso zzso causes loss of one zzso zzso located in a zzso stretch at the end of the protein that is not a known functional motif or zzso Our data show that zzso G zzso zzso are not a frequent cause of impaired zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso detected suggests that in some men zzso in the zzso zzso gene can cause impaired zzso
