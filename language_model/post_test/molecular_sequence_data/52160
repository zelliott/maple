zzso with a novel zzso that is lethal when the cells are exposed to visible light were isolated from zzso coli zzso The zzso was mapped at 63 zzso on the linkage map of the zzso coli zzso and the zzso designated zzso was cloned and zzso From its map position and the evidence that the gene product zzso exhibits zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso gene was deduced to be identical to the zzso zzso which is a gene required for the zzso of zzso and is thought to be similar to the gene for zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to be due to the zzso of the zzso for the reaction zzso by the zzso zzso gene product because other zzso that block earlier steps in the zzso of zzso can reverse the zzso The accumulated zzso may produce active species of oxygen in the zzso bacteria upon zzso by visible light, and these active oxygen species may cause the death of the cells by a mechanism similar to that associated with zzso in zzso zzso
