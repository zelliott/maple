The zzso and gamma zzso of DNA zzso III zzso are both products of the zzso zzso Since zzso and gamma are required as zzso components of the zzso complex, a mechanism must exist for the cell to coordinate their synthesis and ensure that both zzso are present in an adequate quantity and ratio for zzso We have proposed that gamma is produced by a zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the use of zzso zzso in all three reading frames to demonstrate that zzso the shorter product of zzso is generated by zzso zzso to the zzso reading frame of the zzso within an zzso sequence that is followed by a sequence predicted to form a stable secondary zzso Immediately after zzso a stop zzso is encountered, leading to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence zzso zzso and partial disruption of the predicted zzso secondary structure severely zzso the zzso zzso of the expression of zzso fused to zzso zzso to the site of zzso in the zzso and 0 reading frames indicates that the efficiency of zzso is approximately zzso
