zzso in hooded seals is characterized by the rapid development of their zzso diving capacity and is accompanied by increases in zzso production but not zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso system of hooded seals develops as they transition from a zzso to an aquatic environment, we obtained the complete zzso sequence that encodes the zzso factor 2 zzso a central regulator of the zzso response, and compared zzso zzso and protein expression levels in muscle samples from zzso weaned zzso and adult hooded zzso along with zzso zzso levels and the zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VI zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the hooded seal is zzso zzso long and encodes a protein of 606 zzso acids with a zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso degradation zzso which are key for zzso function and zzso Although neither zzso zzso nor zzso nuclear protein content are higher in adults than in zzso zzso levels along with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso content increase with zzso suggesting that the potential for zzso removal increases with development in hooded zzso and that these zzso contribute to the regulation of the zzso zzso state and the prevention of zzso damage in these zzso zzso
