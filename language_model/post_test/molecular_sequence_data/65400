To investigate the significance of zzso protein expression and genetic zzso in two primary cell types in pulmonary zzso zzso zzso 

zzso protein expression in zzso cells and zzso cells in 19 patients with zzso was detected using zzso The two major cell types were captured using laser capture zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso were examined using zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing zzso 

zzso protein expression and gene zzso were observed in zzso zzso of zzso In these cases, zzso protein was expressed in the nucleus of both cell types, with higher expression levels and zzso rates in zzso cells than in surface zzso zzso Two cases showed zzso only in the zzso cells, while one case showed double zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was exhibited in zzso The zzso rate in zzso cells was higher than that in surface zzso zzso
