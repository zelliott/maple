The increasing ecological significance of zzso and the still limited knowledge of this group prompted us to obtain cultured zzso from the zzso of a treatment water recycling tank of a marine fish zzso zzso of strains from this group was assessed in the sediments and water column of the zzso Eleven zzso were obtained from the zzso sample by exploiting zzso natural resistance to several antibiotics and their capacity to degrade organic zzso Based on zzso characteristics and resistance to zzso zzso were zzso Their zzso affiliation was confirmed by the sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene that revealed the presence of a group of 6 zzso closely related to zzso zzso and a cluster of 5 zzso with zzso % of similarity to this species, which probably are a different species of zzso zzso profiles showed a higher discrimination within the two groups and allowed the identification of nine different zzso within the isolated zzso This work corroborates the association of zzso zzso with fish farm zzso
