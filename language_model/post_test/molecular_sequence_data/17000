zzso are zzso molecules that mediate a variety of biological zzso In this work, we identify and characterize a zzso from zzso zzso zzso with respect to its zzso properties and theoretical zzso Initially, from a zzso zzso zzso library, we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso a protein with high identity to snake zzso zzso A zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the zzso by affinity column and gel zzso This protein named zzso displayed zzso activity that was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso Mass zzso analysis and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso showed that zzso is a zzso zzso protein consisting of zzso with zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso deduced from its zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso sequencing and by zzso mass fingerprint zzso zzso shows similarity to other zzso zzso family zzso Modeling studies provide insights into zzso zzso structure and its structural zzso for zzso and calcium zzso
