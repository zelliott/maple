The product of the zzso zzso gene in zzso functions to provide the zzso units that are used to construct the structural components of the terminal stage of zzso In this report, we link a zzso zzso upstream zzso zzso to a zzso reporter gene in order to study the sequences that are involved in the zzso expression of the zzso Various deletions of the zzso fusion were then transformed into zzso zzso All deletion zzso from zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso showed the same zzso pattern of expression as the authentic zzso zzso as well as similar zzso zzso zzso of an additional 37 zzso resulted in nearly zzso decrease in activity, yet retained the normal zzso expression of zzso Analysis of DNA binding proteins with the gel shift zzso revealed a zzso pattern of proteins that bound to the zzso zzso A similar pattern of zzso expression of the binding proteins was observed with either the full-length probe or with zzso zzso that contained sequences that were identified as putative regulatory zzso Likewise, the full-length and zzso zzso demonstrated identical binding patterns during several steps of zzso of the DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso identified a 23 zzso zzso as the binding zzso
