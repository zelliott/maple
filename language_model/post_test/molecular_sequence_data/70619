zzso containing zzso zzso sequence motifs undergo three sequential zzso processing steps: modification of the zzso with either a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso group of the now zzso zzso A putative zzso protein zzso in zzso designated zzso was recently zzso In this study, a portion of a putative human zzso of zzso zzso was identified in a human expressed sequence tag data base, and the corresponding zzso was zzso zzso of zzso was detected in all zzso zzso Both zzso and human zzso proteins were produced in zzso insect cells by infection with a zzso zzso membrane preparations derived from the infected zzso cells exhibited a high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso so produced recognized both zzso and zzso proteins as zzso including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso activity was specific for zzso zzso because zzso peptides did not compete for zzso zzso zzso activity was also exquisitely sensitive to a zzso zzso analogue that had been previously described as a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso These data indicate that both the zzso and the human zzso gene products are bona fide zzso protein zzso and suggest that they play a major role in the processing of zzso zzso zzso
