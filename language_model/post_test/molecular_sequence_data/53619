The zzso growth factor zzso proteins zzso are a family of six zzso proteins with high binding affinity for zzso and zzso Information from zzso and zzso studies is advancing knowledge of the key zzso involved in these zzso zzso binding may be modulated by zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and by cell or zzso association of the zzso All six zzso have been shown to inhibit zzso action, but zzso effects have also been established for zzso zzso and zzso These generally involve a decrease in zzso affinity and may require cell association of the zzso but precise mechanisms are zzso The same three zzso have well established effects that are independent of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts these effects by signaling through zzso whereas zzso and -5 may have specific zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso The regulation of cell sensitivity to zzso zzso signaling may play a role in the growth control of zzso zzso
