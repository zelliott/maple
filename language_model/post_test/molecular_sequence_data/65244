The family of zzso zzso factors essentially regulates zzso gene zzso Recently, we isolated and characterized the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this ancient species also harbors another class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso contains both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In this study, we found that the zzso of zzso can recognize zzso crab and human zzso response elements and activate the downstream reporter in zzso thereby suggesting the evolutionary conservation of this zzso zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso which exhibits a dynamic protein profile over the time course of zzso Surprisingly, secondary infection zzso an zzso in zzso protein expression to a level which overrode the protein degradation at 12 h zzso These observations strongly suggest the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Secondary infection causes zzso the maintenance of a favorable zzso sequence context of the zzso gene and/or zzso the zzso or stabilization of the zzso transcript resulting from the primary infection to enable the more rapid expression and zzso of the zzso zzso reflecting apparent zzso zzso in a repeated zzso
