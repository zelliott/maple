Northern elephant seal zzso naturally endure a 2-3 month zzso fast that is associated with zzso of systemic zzso system zzso a decrease in plasma zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso are potential zzso factors of zzso while zzso may improve insulin zzso However, the effects of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso conditions in seals are not well zzso To assess the effects of prolonged food deprivation on systemic and local zzso and their potential contribution to zzso as they relate to an zzso condition, the zzso expressions of zzso and muscle zzso components and zzso molecules were measured along with plasma zzso zzso Mean plasma zzso activity and zzso II zzso increased by 89 and zzso respectively, while plasma zzso zzso decreased by zzso over the fast, indicative of systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with decreases in zzso and muscle zzso zzso expressions of 69 and zzso respectively, corresponding with decreases in tissue protein content, suggesting suppression of local zzso zzso Muscle zzso zzso and protein increased by 239 and zzso whereas those of zzso zzso decreased by 32 and zzso zzso zzso this study suggests that prolonged zzso activates a systemic zzso which contributes to an increase in muscle zzso and suppression of zzso zzso This targeted and zzso regulation of zzso and zzso is likely coordinated to zzso contribute to the development of an zzso condition, independent of local zzso zzso These data enhance our understanding of the zzso mechanisms evolved by elephant seals to tolerate potentially zzso zzso
