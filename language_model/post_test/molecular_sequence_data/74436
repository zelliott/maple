zzso zzso is a common, zzso human zzso pathogen that causes a variety of zzso and systemic zzso It exists in nature both in the zzso or the zzso phase, as well as in the free-floating or the zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular, display unique characteristics that zzso survival advantages over their zzso counterparts, such as their zzso to common zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso zzso formation and their attributes are poorly zzso In this study, we used a zzso approach to characterize the protein markers that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso in comparison to their zzso zzso Using tandem mass zzso analysis, we have identified a significant number of proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso stress defenses that are zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso findings were further confirmed by real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that a drug target for the new zzso agent zzso is abundantly expressed and significantly zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these data imply that the zzso mode, zzso compared with their zzso counterparts, exhibits traits that can sustain zzso stress zzso and thereby exert resistance to commonly used zzso
