Two zzso lineages of flowering plants possess an zzso inversion in the zzso zzso repeat zzso a region of the zzso from which there have been few previous reports of this class of structural zzso The size of the inversion zzso 200 zzso places it in a class not previously seen in the zzso zzso The two lineages with the zzso representatives of the orders zzso and zzso are not closely related and the inversion therefore probably arose independently in each zzso The inversion is bordered by short, but highly zzso zzso repeat motifs that were most likely associated with the inversion zzso A zzso structure that involves these motifs may play a functional role in zzso zzso It is seen in all optimal or nearly optimal predicted zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
