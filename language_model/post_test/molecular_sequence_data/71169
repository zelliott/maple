zzso transcribed zzso play the important role during early zzso Especially in zzso distribution of the maternal transcripts has a zzso relation to axis formation in the early zzso We compared the quantity of zzso among four zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the differential display zzso A novel zzso zzso was cloned by screening the zzso zzso library with an animal zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of the human zzso checkpoint gene zzso A transcript of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso a predicted protein of 330 zzso acids with six zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso were zzso distributed in the early stages of zzso but gradually localized to the animal hemisphere, especially in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the maternal transcripts of zzso were recruited into each zzso zzso closely with zzso zzso expression of zzso was widely detected in zzso zzso and was gradually restricted to the central nervous systems, eyes, and zzso arches by the zzso zzso This evidence contributes to understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the cell cycle and cell differentiation in the early zzso
