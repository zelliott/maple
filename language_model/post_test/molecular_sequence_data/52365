We have examined the role of zzso zzso proteins in transport from the zzso to the zzso complex in zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus to express zzso zzso zzso These zzso are within highly zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso binding and zzso found in zzso and all members of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in proteins which were potent trans dominant zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso transport between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that expression of zzso prevented delivery of zzso protein to the zzso zzso which resulted in zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso exchange or zzso of the zzso protein were also strong trans dominant transport zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit processing of zzso to the complex, zzso acid containing form diagnostic of transport to the trans zzso zzso We suggest that at least three members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso use zzso zzso to regulate components of the transport machinery involved in zzso traffic between early compartments of the zzso zzso
