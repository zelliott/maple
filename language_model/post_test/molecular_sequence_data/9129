zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso diversification by zzso zzso to zzso within zzso zzso However, it also generates zzso DNA zzso leading to zzso Though the zzso properties of AID have been zzso its zzso structure has not been zzso zzso to investigate the relationship between the primary structure and zzso characteristics of zzso we compared the properties of human and zzso fish zzso since these are most divergent in zzso acid zzso We show that zzso of various species have different zzso rates that are zzso and optimal at native zzso zzso zzso AID is zzso more zzso robust than human zzso while zzso AID is least zzso This disparity is zzso by a single zzso acid difference in the C zzso Using functional zzso supported by models of AID core and surface structure, we show that this zzso zzso activity by affecting zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso rates of fish AID result from increased zzso binding affinity at lower zzso Our work suggests that AID may generate DNA damage with variable efficiencies in different organisms, identifies zzso critical in regulating AID activity, and provides insights into the evolution of the zzso family of zzso
