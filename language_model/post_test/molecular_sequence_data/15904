zzso zzso zzso cells are unable to make zzso in response to inducing zzso This block disappears after zzso We have found that nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso cells contain a zzso activity which specifically recognizes a region within the human zzso 1 zzso This activity is absent from differentiated cell types, both of zzso and zzso zzso The binding of the factor in zzso zzso cells leads to dramatic changes in the overall protein binding pattern of the zzso promoter as compared with differentiated cells, and may be responsible for repression of the zzso zzso gene prior to zzso
