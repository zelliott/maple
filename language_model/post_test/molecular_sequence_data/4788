zzso zzso between an zzso and the zzso or protein that it encodes can be generated by in zzso translation of synthetic zzso that carry zzso a zzso zzso antibiotic, at their 3' zzso The stable linkage between the informational zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso of the resulting joint molecules allows a specific zzso to be enriched from a complex mixture of zzso based on the properties of its zzso zzso zzso between a synthetic zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso have been enriched from a pool of random sequence zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso should provide an additional route to the in zzso selection and directed evolution of zzso
