The zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso of 110 zzso zzso that forms specific complexes with zzso T zzso and the transforming proteins of several other DNA tumor zzso zzso with RB is thought to contribute to transformation by these viruses as demonstrated by genetic zzso To help understand the function of these zzso the regions of RB that are involved in binding to T have been zzso An in zzso protein synthesis system capable of producing full-length RB protein has been developed to facilitate the mapping zzso A zzso to zzso increase in zzso efficiency in the zzso zzso was obtained when the zzso zzso region of RB zzso was replaced with that of zzso zzso or a plant viral zzso alfalfa mosaic virus zzso zzso A series of zzso RB zzso produced from this system were zzso for T zzso Two zzso regions of the RB zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were found to be necessary for binding to zzso zzso in either region abolished zzso complex zzso These results are consistent with the finding that, in all the cases analyzed so far, zzso RB proteins in human tumor cells also failed to bind to T zzso due to deletions including at least one of the two required zzso Thus the regions of RB defined in zzso as necessary for interaction with T might be zzso relevant as well, and might play a fundamental role in normal RB protein zzso
