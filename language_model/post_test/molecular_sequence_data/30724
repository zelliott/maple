Three protein fragments of different sizes which contain the DNA binding domain of zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso have been expressed in functional forms in zzso zzso zzso I zzso and gel zzso zzso showed that the zzso proteins bound to the same DNA sequence on the zzso promoter as intact zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is necessary for maintenance of the zzso of the DNA binding domain of zzso as judged on zzso and zzso zzso as well as for specific DNA zzso
