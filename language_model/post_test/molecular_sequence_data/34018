zzso family proteins are key zzso of programmed cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso has been associated with tumor progression and zzso zzso zzso agents that neutralize the functions of zzso zzso family proteins have emerged as a promising new class of zzso zzso zzso analyses have demonstrated that small zzso zzso and some zzso proteins exhibit distinct binding preferences for zzso zzso While numerous structures of zzso proteins bound to zzso have been reported, the source of this selectivity is still zzso Here, we present a systematic analysis of a series of zzso zzso that contain zzso within the zzso zzso zzso The ability of these zzso zzso to interact with both small zzso zzso and zzso peptides was zzso These studies provide information on the contributions of specific zzso to small zzso inhibitor binding and shed light on the zzso selectivity of these zzso important zzso
