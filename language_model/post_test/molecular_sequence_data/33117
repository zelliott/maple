zzso sequence zzso the truncated zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso was extensively modified based on the zzso usage of rice zzso The overall G + C contents of the synthetic zzso coding sequence were raised to zzso with an additional bias of enriching for G and C ending zzso as preferred by zzso The synthetic gene was introduced into the Chinese zzso zzso zzso 11, by zzso zzso zzso rice plants harboring this gene were highly resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso larvae as revealed by insect zzso High levels of zzso protein were obtained in the leaves of transgenic rice, which were effective in achieving zzso mortality of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso expression in the leaves of these transgenic plants were up to zzso of the total soluble zzso The larvae of zzso zzso and zzso zzso could consume a maximum of zzso and zzso zzso of transgenic leaf area whereas the consumption of zzso leaves by these larvae was significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso transgenic plants indicated that the zzso was inherited by the progeny plants and provided complete protection against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
