The ubiquitous zzso protein zzso activates target zzso as a response to zzso zzso increases in a background of zzso zzso The potential influence of zzso competition is especially intriguing for the zzso domain of the protein which possesses the sites with the lowest zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso binding in the zzso domain of zzso was therefore studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso zzso The apparent affinity for zzso was found to be significantly decreased at zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso of an activated cell the zzso state of the zzso domain is therefore only zzso populated, indicating that for this domain zzso binding is intimately associated with binding of target zzso The data are in good agreement with a zzso model in which each site can bind either zzso or zzso The zzso binding interaction is slightly positively zzso resulting in a significantly populated zzso zzso The zzso zzso from this state is determined to be at least one order of magnitude faster than from the zzso zzso These two findings indicate that the zzso state is structurally and/or zzso different from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso constant and the zzso and zzso chemical shifts of the zzso state were calculated from zzso zzso The values of both parameters suggest that the zzso state has a zzso more similar to the zzso zzso and zzso states than to the zzso zzso zzso
