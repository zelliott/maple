The general pathways of zzso zzso zzso occur via zzso followed by 3' to zzso degradation or zzso although some zzso sites have been identified in zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso degradation in zzso zzso we mapped zzso zzso ends on zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, wherein zzso zzso zzso products are zzso This led to three important zzso First, only few zzso that undergo low-level zzso zzso were observed, suggesting that zzso are not a major contributor to zzso zzso zzso Second, independent of known zzso zzso we observed low levels of zzso zzso on some zzso suggesting that an unknown mechanism can generate zzso exposed ends, although for all zzso tested, zzso was the primary zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso demonstrating a significant discard zzso for zzso during the second step of zzso zzso which is a potential step to regulate gene zzso
