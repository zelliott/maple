A missing link in the understanding of the mechanisms of transport of the zzso zzso receptors has recently been discovered, following the identification of the protein zzso In association with zzso this protein is responsible for the return of the receptors from the late zzso back to the zzso zzso zzso the same protein called zzso was described as a zzso protein zzso years ago, and more recently, as a blood marker for human zzso cervical zzso The sequence of zzso displays not only a strong zzso with those of zzso and the zzso two proteins known to be involved in the zzso traffic of zzso droplets but also zzso is associated with the zzso How this ubiquitous protein could participate in processes as different as the zzso zzso receptors traffic and the formation and/or traffic of zzso zzso A tentative hypothesis is put zzso
