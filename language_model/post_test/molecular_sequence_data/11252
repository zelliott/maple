The zzso family of zzso are in higher zzso divided into 3 major zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In plants, however, the zzso family is restricted to one large family of zzso zzso From work with zzso zzso the zzso proteins are known to activate a zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso of zzso a process termed zzso zzso In plants a similar zzso burst is observed and plays and important role in its zzso against pathogen infections, suggesting a similar role for the plant zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso proteins are also involved in control of cell zzso and are also thought to mediate signals from cell membrane zzso In a broad search for members of the Ras zzso in plants, several new small zzso proteins were zzso We report here the identification and molecular cloning of 5 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins deduced from the zzso sequences all share zzso zzso but show considerably more diversity on the zzso level, indicating that this is an ancient gene zzso Four of the zzso genes were found to be expressed in all zzso zzso but one zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that the zzso gene family in zzso zzso consists of at least 10 different zzso
