zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso translation were performed with the zzso zzso zzso This zzso causes zzso male zzso when combined with the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso patterns were compared between the fertile wild species zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso line, an zzso zzso zzso zzso line and an zzso zzso zzso line with restored zzso The analyses were carried out to identify differences in gene expression and to investigate whether zzso in gene expression accompanied male zzso A difference in zzso patterns between the fertile zzso zzso and the zzso lines was found for the zzso zzso The zzso region was investigated further, since a similar zzso in zzso zzso has been observed in two other zzso zzso which are associated with zzso male zzso zzso The additional longer zzso transcript detected in the zzso lines in the present study was found to contain an open reading frame zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed that the ORF, zzso could zzso a protein with a predicted molecular weight of about 29 zzso In zzso analysis detected two proteins of 29 and 32 zzso respectively, which were found only in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the 32 zzso protein accompanied male zzso since it was absent in zzso plants restored to zzso The protein analysis might indicate that zzso is translated and causes zzso
