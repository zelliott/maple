zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is essential for many cell zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso proteins thought to organize zzso zzso and display a unique zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso track zzso plus ends in the cell body but bind along zzso in the zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso at multiple sites in the domain required for zzso plus end zzso Although complete zzso zzso both plus end tracking and association along zzso zzso we show that partial zzso of the identified zzso motifs determines whether zzso track plus ends or associate along zzso In addition, we find that expression of zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso lateral zzso interactions with the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially rescued by expression of zzso with zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso stabilization of peripheral zzso which likely occurs in the vicinity of focal zzso may be regulated by local zzso zzso
