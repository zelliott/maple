The resolving power of liquid zzso systems containing zzso zzso previously used to analyze basic zzso peptides related to zzso of zzso protein zzso has been studied with respect to zzso zzso A set of peptides zzso zzso and its five zzso containing one zzso acid were used as model zzso Complete resolution of all the peptides could be accomplished both with ethanol and zzso as organic zzso The separation of the various peptides within the set turned out to be only modestly changed under the conditions zzso These new results clearly demonstrate the potential of the zzso systems zzso
