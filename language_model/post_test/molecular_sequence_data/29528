The rat gap junction protein zzso zzso has a characteristic zzso and regional expression pattern, for which the exact regulatory mechanisms are not zzso To identify the molecular factors controlling zzso zzso its zzso promoter was zzso The zzso zzso promoter is the most zzso zzso region within the zzso known thus far and contains five potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso The binding of both zzso and zzso to each of these DNA elements was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso of the natural zzso zzso promoter or zzso derivatives in zzso zzso primary rat zzso zzso and zzso rat smooth muscle embryonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso mouse zzso zzso revealed that all sites are contributing to zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso in zzso Schneider line 2 cells demonstrated that zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso and additive zzso
