zzso zzso affecting biological function of proteins are constantly being rejected by zzso selection from the gene zzso The zzso substitution rate ratio zzso is a measure of selective pressure on zzso acid replacement zzso for zzso zzso Different methods have been developed in order to predict zzso changes affecting gene zzso However, none has considered the zzso of selective constraints acting on protein zzso Here, we have used zzso maximum likelihood models in order to estimate the selective pressures on the individual zzso acid zzso of a well-known model zzso zzso We demonstrate that the number of zzso under strong zzso selection in zzso is much higher than those that are strictly zzso during the evolution of the zzso In agreement with theoretical expectations, zzso that have been noted to be of structural zzso or in direct association with DNA, were among those showing the highest signals of zzso zzso zzso those changing according to a neutral, or nearly neutral mode of evolution, were observed to be irrelevant for protein zzso Finally, using more than 40 human disease zzso we demonstrate that zzso evolving under strong selective pressures zzso are significantly associated zzso with human zzso We zzso that zzso change on zzso acids showing zzso will most likely affect protein zzso The application of this evolutionary prediction at a zzso scale will provide an a zzso hypothesis of the zzso effect of zzso coding single zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso
