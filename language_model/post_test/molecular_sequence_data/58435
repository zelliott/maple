The zzso region of the zzso mosaic zzso zzso coat protein zzso contains an zzso motif that is zzso among plant and zzso viruses and implicated in binding the zzso during zzso To zzso the functional significance of this zzso motif in the zzso zzso a series of deletions encompassing the zzso motif was introduced into a biologically active clone of zzso zzso and their effect on zzso zzso and infection in plants was zzso Analysis of infection zzso zzso on zzso zzso revealed the importance of the first 19 zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with three viable zzso of zzso zzso lacking the first 11, 14, and 18 zzso zzso acids of the zzso resulted in the development of zzso local zzso and restricted the spread of infection to zzso zzso zzso analysis from symptomatic leaves revealed that, in each case, virus zzso was severely affected by the introduced zzso and each truncated zzso differed in its ability to package zzso zzso In contrast to these observations in zzso zzso none of the zzso zzso was able to establish either local or systemic infections in barley zzso The intrinsic role played by the zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso in packaging viral zzso and the interactions between the host and the truncated zzso in modulating symptom expression and movement are zzso
