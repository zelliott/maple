We report the isolation of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso related to the zzso cut gene product, called zzso for Cut like zzso In addition to the zzso three zzso acid repeats, the so-called cut repeats, are also zzso between Cut and the zzso counterpart described zzso This conservation suggests that the cut repeat motif may define a new class of zzso Both cloned and zzso zzso proteins are nuclear zzso proteins with very similar sequence zzso Western zzso analysis revealed several distinct zzso protein species in a variety of zzso and cell zzso The relative abundance of these proteins is regulated during mouse development and cell differentiation in zzso Interestingly, approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins predominate in early zzso and are zzso in committed zzso and zzso but zzso upon terminal zzso zzso zzso activity is correlated with the abundance of these zzso In contrast, larger zzso protein species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are detected mainly in adult zzso and in terminally differentiated zzso zzso experiments show that zzso proteins can function as zzso of zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso like their zzso counterparts, are candidate regulators of zzso zzso in diverse differentiation zzso
