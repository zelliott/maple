A zzso clone was isolated which codes for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene is interrupted by one zzso which divides the coding region into two zzso The first one codes for one zzso acid only, the initiation zzso while the second one encodes the residual 368 zzso acids of the zzso The zzso which is represented only once in the zzso is transcribed at high rates as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso blood zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso which is zzso zzso to known zzso zzso The protein was expressed in zzso coli cells in an zzso and zzso active zzso zzso raised against zzso acids zzso recognize a zzso protein band previously shown to protect monkeys against a zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso with zzso of different species, which confirms the strong conservation of this zzso during zzso The zzso could be localized in the zzso of the zzso as an active and soluble zzso An inactive form was found to be associated with the membrane zzso zzso data with zzso C suggest a membrane association of this zzso via a zzso zzso
