Both zzso type 1 helper T zzso cells and zzso zzso T zzso zzso play pivotal roles in protection against zzso tuberculosis zzso Here, we identified zzso and zzso zzso on a novel protective zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Mice were zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso by using a gene gun, and gamma zzso zzso production from the immune zzso cells was analyzed in response to a synthetic overlapping zzso library covering the mature zzso zzso In zzso mice, only one zzso zzso appeared to stimulate the immune zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso Further analysis with a zzso zzso permitted identification of a zzso zzso zzso In addition, a major zzso complex class I stabilization zzso with zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso or zzso indicated that the zzso is presented by zzso Finally, we proved that the zzso complex is recognized by zzso zzso In zzso mice, we observed zzso dominant and zzso zzso zzso by using zzso subset depletion analysis and zzso flow zzso The data obtained are useful for analyzing the role of zzso T cells in protective immunity and for designing a vaccine against zzso tuberculosis zzso
