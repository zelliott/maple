The upstream zzso region of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso bacteria, was amplified by the inverse zzso chain reaction method and cloned in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso coli zzso with a defective zzso synthesis mechanism with the cloned zzso and its DNA sequencing indicated the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso just upstream from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene could zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 51 198 zzso A zzso protein was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso gene in an in zzso zzso system using zzso coli zzso zzso These results indicate that the genes responsible for zzso synthesis and cell division are located as a cluster in zzso zzso similar to the zzso coli zzso zzso
