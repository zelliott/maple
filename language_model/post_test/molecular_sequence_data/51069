The zzso DNA zzso beta zzso zzso can be readily converted into two constituent zzso by mild zzso these zzso are represented in an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that binds both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two activities appear to be contributed by separate portions of the zzso since the zzso domain binds zzso DNA but not zzso DNA, and conversely, the zzso domain binds zzso DNA but not zzso DNA zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain at the zzso with zzso to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminated all zzso zzso This suggested that the zzso zzso capacity of the zzso domain may be carried in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso We used zzso to prepare a zzso zzso zzso zzso that spans the zzso zzso region of the zzso domain along with the zzso portion of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to have both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding properties for these activities are similar to those of the intact zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
