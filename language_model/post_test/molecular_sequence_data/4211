The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso is subject to zzso zzso To identify the minimal sequence necessary for promoter function, the zzso region of the zzso gene was screened for potential zzso zzso zzso of DNA, containing sequences upstream from the zzso initiation zzso were employed as zzso of zzso blots of total cellular protein from cells grown in media promoting repression and induction of zzso Two zzso zzso zzso with a promoter zzso one was present in greater abundance in zzso cells and a higher relative level of the second was witnessed in induced zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with labeled promoter fragments exhibited preferential interaction with proteins in the induced zzso The upstream sequence containing the putative zzso sites was fused with the coding sequence of the green fluorescent protein zzso The resulting zzso was introduced into the zzso of an zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso integration of the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso of the zzso were demonstrated by Southern and Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso
