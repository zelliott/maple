The zzso of electron transfer from reduced zzso zzso protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso bound to the zzso reaction center zzso from the purple sulfur zzso zzso zzso were studied under controlled zzso conditions by flash zzso zzso At ambient zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso where only the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are reduced, the electron transfer from zzso to zzso zzso zzso follows zzso zzso with rate constant k zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at low zzso zzso Upon increasing the zzso strength, k increases by a maximum factor of zzso 2 at 640 zzso zzso The role of zzso which lies on the external surface of zzso close to the zzso cluster and presumably on the electron transfer zzso to zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso completely prevents electron zzso zzso electron transfer is still observed upon substitution of zzso with zzso and zzso although the rate is decreased by more than 1 order of zzso These results suggest that zzso is located on a key protein surface patch essential for efficient electron transfer, and that the presence of an aromatic zzso zzso on the putative zzso zzso plays a critical zzso This conclusion was supported by protein zzso calculations, resulting in a structural model for the zzso complex, which involves a zzso site close to the LP zzso farthest from the zzso special zzso
