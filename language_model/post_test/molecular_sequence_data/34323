The zzso zzso sequence is a key element directing the translation to initiate at the authentic start zzso and also enabling translation initiation to proceed in zzso untranslated zzso regions zzso containing moderately strong secondary zzso zzso analysis of almost zzso zzso from the major bacterial zzso zzso revealed, however, a general absence of zzso zzso drop in zzso content and consequently reduced tendency to form secondary structures in zzso The experiments using the zzso zzso zzso expression system were in agreement with these findings: neither addition nor omission of zzso sequence in the zzso zzso affected the level of the reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso level in zzso zzso zzso contrary to zzso level in zzso coli, was five times lower when zzso sequence formed part of the secondary structure with a folding energy zzso zzso Also, the extended zzso sequences did not affect protein levels as in zzso zzso It seems therefore that a functional zzso interaction does not take place during the translation initiation in zzso zzso zzso and possibly other members of zzso zzso although the anti zzso sequence is present in zzso zzso genes of their zzso We thus propose that in the absence of the zzso sequence interaction, the selection of genuine start zzso in zzso is accomplished by binding of zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso as opposed to coding region which is zzso due to zzso secondary zzso Additionally, we found that sequence logos of region preceding the start zzso may be used as zzso zzso Depending on whether complete sequence logo or only part of it, such as information content and base proportion at specific positions, is used, bacterial zzso or families and in some cases even bacterial zzso can be zzso
