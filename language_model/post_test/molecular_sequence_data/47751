This article discussed the principles and practice of zzso with respect to protein assembly zzso zzso undergoing zzso motion in solution produce fluctuations in scattered light zzso We have described how the zzso correlation function of these fluctuations can be measured and how mathematical analysis of the correlation function provides information about the distribution of diffusion zzso of the zzso We have explained that zzso of the correlation function is an zzso problem and therefore that careful attention must be paid to the assumptions incorporated into data analysis zzso We have shown how the zzso relationship can be used to convert zzso of diffusion zzso into zzso of particle zzso In the case of zzso zzso this process allows direct determination of zzso zzso enabling nucleation and zzso rates to be zzso Finally, we have used examples from studies of A beta zzso to illustrate the power these quantitative capabilities provide for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the zzso reaction and for guiding the development of zzso zzso
