zzso with zzso zzso and zzso specificity were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso Their activities were monitored by zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso These zzso are located in the zzso zzso and in different zzso obtained during the preparation of brush border membrane zzso The activity of the zzso zzso increased with an increase in zzso Both the zzso and zzso activities are involved in the processing of zzso zzso zzso whereas an additional zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso zzso inclusion zzso The zzso zzso toxin was first zzso between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso generating a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain was resistant to further processing, with only a small amount of a zzso product appearing due to the action of a zzso zzso However, the zzso domain was very zzso and was further zzso to about 30 zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso the processing of the zzso zzso inclusion was very slow at neutral zzso Three zzso products were detected at zzso higher than zzso with an overnight incubation at 37 degrees zzso The zzso and zzso zzso peptides are zzso products of zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso has 27 zzso acids deleted from the zzso end by a zzso zzso
