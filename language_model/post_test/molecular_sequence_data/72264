With the aim of zzso the evolution of a zzso family, we constructed molecular zzso trees for 27 strains of zzso B virus zzso using both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All five gene regions, zzso C, zzso X, and zzso were used to construct the zzso zzso Using the zzso trees zzso we classified these strains into five major groups in which the strains were closely related to each zzso Our zzso reinforced our previous view that genetic zzso is not always compatible with conventional zzso determined by zzso zzso Moreover, constraints on the evolutionary process of zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso and silent zzso zzso because two-thirds of the open reading frame zzso zzso contains alternating overlapping zzso In our unique analysis of this interesting gene structure of zzso the most frequent synonymous zzso were observed in the zzso parts of the P and C zzso On the other hand, the number of synonymous zzso per zzso site for the S gene was quite low and appeared a strongly constrained zzso Because the P gene zzso the S gene in a different frame, the low rate of synonymous substitution for the S gene can be explained by the evolutionary constraints which are imposed on the overlapping gene zzso In other words, synonymous zzso in the S gene can cause zzso acid changes in its overlapping region in a different zzso Thus, the evolution of zzso is constrained zzso by the overlapping zzso We propose calling this mode of viral evolution zzso zzso The evolution of zzso represents a typical constrained zzso
