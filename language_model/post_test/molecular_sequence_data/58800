The human and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene families zzso a large number of closely related proteins which are abundantly expressed in the fetal zzso and zzso into the maternal zzso Although the presence of a well zzso zzso sequence His or zzso or zzso or zzso zzso similar to the zzso motif found in zzso zzso proteins hints towards a possible interaction with zzso zzso the function of this group of proteins related to the zzso zzso family is still zzso It is also not clear whether the various members of the zzso family exert the same zzso Here we describe the cloning of two zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso family member, which lacks the zzso consensus zzso zzso like most of the other zzso zzso members, is composed of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and and one zzso zzso domain zzso In contrast, zzso lacks the zzso domain zzso demonstrating for the first time that zzso zzso produced by alternative zzso also exist in zzso The zzso coding for zzso and zzso exhibit the same expression zzso during zzso development as found for two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contain the zzso zzso zzso starts after day zzso of embryonic development zzso and maximum zzso levels are reached around zzso as determined by zzso protection zzso At zzso zzso transcripts can be detected exclusively in the zzso of the zzso In addition, zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are also found in zzso from a pool of zzso zzso but are absent from a number of adult zzso tested zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, brain, zzso heart, zzso These results indicate that the various zzso zzso exert their zzso at the same time during zzso and embryonic zzso
