zzso protein zzso is a major synaptic zzso and zzso zzso protein first discovered in zzso and zzso zzso were subsequently identified from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is clear from the study of a zzso zzso in zzso that zzso is required for viability of the zzso and that it has a key role in neurotransmitter zzso In addition, other studies have directly implicated zzso in regulated zzso in zzso neuroendocrine and zzso cell types, and its distribution suggests a general role in regulated zzso An early hypothesis was that zzso functioned in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso however, must have an additional function as a direct regulator of the zzso machinery as changes in zzso expression modify the extent of zzso triggered directly by zzso in zzso zzso zzso possess a zzso domain that is highly zzso and zzso membrane zzso In addition, zzso have a zzso zzso domain that mediates binding to an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This and other evidence zzso zzso as molecular zzso in the zzso that are likely to control the correct zzso folding of one or more components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso include the zzso protein zzso and the plasma membrane protein zzso 1, the significance of which is discussed in possible models to account for current knowledge of zzso zzso
