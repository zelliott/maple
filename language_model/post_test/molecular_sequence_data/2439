We report the zzso of four proteins from zzso coli that stimulate or inhibit zzso and/or zzso zzso promoted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The proteins are identified as the zzso proteins zzso (27 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (24 zzso and zzso (16 zzso on the basis of zzso sequence zzso The zzso protein is found to be identical to H zzso an zzso coli zzso protein that is related to zzso zzso zzso and by virtue of zzso acid zzso The H zzso identity is based on zzso on zzso gels, heat stability, zzso acid analysis, and effects on zzso zzso These results are relevant to current studies on the structure of the zzso coli zzso Since the H protein has previously been found associated with the zzso coli zzso the results indicate that either zzso some zzso proteins serve a dual function in zzso coli, or, more zzso zzso zzso proteins can and are being zzso as zzso zzso
