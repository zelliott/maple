zzso zzso of the zzso gene significantly increase the risk of developing diverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be detected by zzso the zzso activity of the zzso protein in zzso zzso Here we describe a method starting with zzso that allows detection of zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis of zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso products are directly cloned into zzso expression zzso in zzso and subsequently tested for zzso activity in a simple growth zzso This technique, functional analysis of separated zzso in zzso zzso requires only a few steps, can be automated readily and should permit screening for zzso or zzso zzso zzso in any gene whose function can be monitored in zzso
