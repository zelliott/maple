Two alternate spliced transcripts of zzso zzso zzso gene derived from a common promoter have been reported zzso In the present study, we have examined the expression of alternative zzso zzso of zzso gene using zzso rapid amplification of C terminal end zzso in the zzso derived from mouse zzso zzso was performed to confirm the zzso zzso Here we report the occurrence of three transcripts containing a novel alternate spliced zzso we refer to as zzso zzso This new zzso is located upstream of the zzso start site identified by Klein et zzso zzso 208 zzso zzso in the zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso thus making a new alternate zzso end of the zzso zzso The molecular nature of the transcripts containing the new zzso appears to be highly zzso These results are interesting in that they are of potential importance in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
