Recently, the zzso of theoretical and experimental approaches in the structure determination of zzso has been zzso More accurate simulations are possible because of the advances in software and zzso Meanwhile, improvements in zzso techniques permit the measurement of numerous structural and zzso zzso either for the free state or for zzso zzso bound to zzso Several crystal structures of isolated or zzso zzso give new clues for modeling the zzso forces that drive the zzso
