A region spanning 25 zzso of zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso has been isolated from two zzso libraries in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Five zzso clones containing zzso gene have been zzso Gene zzso has been determined using restriction mapping and a partial sequencing the zzso and 3' zzso zzso The zzso gene includes 5 zzso the first of them coding for 64 zzso from the zzso untranslated zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso long, which is almost 16 times longer than the corresponding zzso The first zzso spans zzso zzso the second is the largest one and spans zzso zzso The zzso zzso region sequence has been zzso it contains a zzso box from zzso to zzso zzso somewhat different from the zzso zzso and a zzso box at zzso zzso
