A previously unidentified extension of an open reading frame from the zzso DNA of zzso rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein ID zzso has been identified as a zzso gene segment coding for the zzso signal zzso The signal zzso appears to direct a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso where it is processed into the mature form of zzso The start zzso of zzso begins 114 zzso upstream from that previously published for zzso A putative zzso zzso which may yield a mature zzso approximately 12 zzso larger than previously zzso has been identified within zzso between zzso and zzso The signal zzso sequence was amplified by zzso chain reaction using zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso end of the truncated zzso gene at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein extracts from zzso coli expressing zzso reacted with zzso zzso raised against zzso and revealed a protein of the expected molecular weight zzso zzso zzso translation of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso yielded a processed product approximately zzso zzso smaller than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants independently transformed with the zzso gene processed zzso and accumulated the mature form of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with natural, mature zzso extracted from rice seed when separated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso
