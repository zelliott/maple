Although zzso zzso shares many protein zzso with other zzso species, there is a degree of specificity in the T cell response to the zzso This is evident in the failure of zzso between zzso species and the specific zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso basis of this specificity is zzso but the zzso zzso zzso protein is one candidate because of its restricted distribution and the isolation of zzso zzso T cell clones zzso with the protein from zzso zzso zzso In the course of zzso the human T cell repertoire to zzso we have isolated further zzso T cell clones zzso with this protein from a subject who had never been exposed to zzso zzso These clones did not respond to other zzso including zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso In addition, they were zzso with the zzso tuberculosis zzso protein which has recently been shown to have limited zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both clones reacted with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the T cell response to which is restricted by zzso Although zzso for the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso the clones failed to respond to preparations of zzso zzso Both clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso zzso and were zzso against zzso targets zzso with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The nature of the zzso which stimulates this apparently zzso zzso response is zzso zzso the recognition of the zzso protein by individuals not exposed to zzso indicates that this protein may not be suitable as a zzso to distinguish between infection with zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
