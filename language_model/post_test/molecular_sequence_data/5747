zzso development of the limb is dependent on coordination between three distinct signaling zzso Recently, zzso growth zzso has been identified as a crucial zzso of zzso function, which directs limb bud zzso and Sonic zzso has been identified as a signaling zzso that mediates zzso function, which specifies zzso patterning in the developing limb zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso reinforce each other's expression via a positive feedback loop, providing a molecular basis for the coordination of limb bud outgrowth and zzso zzso The mechanisms by which these signaling centers come to occupy their normal positions in the zzso limb bud during development are not zzso Here we identify and characterize zzso a gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in several populations of zzso cells, including zzso cells in the anterior limb zzso and mice zzso for targeted disruption of the zzso gene have multiple zzso including zzso zzso The zzso is associated with the formation of an zzso anterior zzso as indicated by anterior expression of Sonic zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso The expression of other candidate regulators of zzso zzso information in the limb zzso including zzso and zzso is not altered in zzso zzso zzso By zzso mapping experiments, zzso is tightly linked to zzso zzso a zzso mouse zzso The results identify zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso identity in the limb and a component of a regulatory program that restricts zzso formation to the zzso limb bud zzso
