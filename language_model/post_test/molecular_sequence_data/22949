zzso with a zzso zzso zzso were prepared, starting from zzso The zzso route employs a zzso zzso as building block for DNA synthesis and involves zzso zzso zzso with zzso to generate zzso The zzso group of the zzso side chain was zzso to accelerate primer extension reactions involving the zzso zzso Three zzso groups were identified that decrease the zzso for zzso extension steps with zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso acid was found to accelerate primer extension reactions and to render them more selective than those of the control zzso With this zzso primer extension is also faster than previously measured for zzso systems involving template, zzso and a zzso helper zzso zzso zzso might become useful for zzso single zzso
