zzso growth factor zzso increases zzso gene expression in zzso cells, but the promoter zzso required for this response has not been clearly zzso We identified a zzso element - zzso - 87, - zzso - 67 in the rat zzso promoter that is essential for zzso signaling using deletion and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This element was active in either normal or zzso orientation when transferred to a zzso promoter zzso zzso We had previously identified this element as the zzso response element of the zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso are additive with the responses to insulin or zzso zzso that zzso activated zzso gene zzso by a mechanism different from insulin or zzso The zzso response element of the zzso promoter is a recognition sequence for the zzso family of zzso factors and zzso factors have been shown to bind this zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso which acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso factors, reduces zzso zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and insulin may signal through zzso zzso factors to activate zzso gene zzso at the same response element in the zzso zzso zzso
