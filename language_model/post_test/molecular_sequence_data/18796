The controversy surrounding the potential impact of birds in zzso transmission dynamics and their capacity to serve as a zzso has existed for a long zzso The majority of analyzed bird species are able to zzso zzso ticks with zzso zzso of infected ticks due to bird migration is a key to the establishment of new zzso of zzso zzso The dynamics of infection in birds supports the mixing of different species, the horizontal exchange of genetic information, and appearance of zzso zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were cultured from zzso minor larvae and four strains were isolated from zzso minor zzso collected from a single Carolina zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence analysis that included zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso region, a zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso and zzso separated 8 strains into 3 distinct zzso Additional zzso sequence typing of 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was used to resolve the zzso status of zzso zzso 

zzso of analysis of 14 genes confirmed that the level of divergence among strains is significantly higher than what would be expected for strains within a single zzso The presence of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was incorporated into zzso locus of strain, previously assigned to zzso zzso 

zzso diverse zzso strains are often found within the same tick or same zzso host, presenting a wide opportunity for genetic zzso We report the zzso zzso that led to incorporation of a zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain into a zzso locus of another zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso maintains a majority of sequence zzso within zzso populations because of the zzso of pre-existing sequence zzso Even if our findings of broad genetic diversity among 8 strains cultured from ticks that fed on a single bird could be the exception rather than the rule, they support the theory that the diversity and evolution of LB zzso is driven mainly by the zzso
