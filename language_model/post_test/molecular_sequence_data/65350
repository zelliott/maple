zzso zzso are associated with multiple zzso proteins to form zzso zzso zzso These proteins are important regulators of the fate of their target zzso In human cells, zzso and zzso zzso coded by two different zzso are zzso zzso proteins involved in several cellular functions including zzso zzso translation, and zzso Although 51% zzso these proteins are nevertheless found in different zzso zzso In addition, differential zzso events generate zzso zzso that only differ at their zzso zzso In this paper, we used a zzso approach to identify and compare the zzso targets of zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso zzso was identified by probing DNA zzso with zzso derived from zzso isolated from zzso zzso complexes following zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso of the cellular zzso expressed in zzso cells are found in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso zzso identifies a relatively low percentage of common zzso the percentage of common zzso highly increases when zzso in zzso and zzso zzso are zzso There is a predominance of zzso involved in cell zzso zzso transcription, regulation of cell zzso and zzso zzso All these zzso of zzso are mostly distinct from those associated with zzso or zzso although some zzso zzso zzso with a model of zzso gene regulation, our results show that zzso and zzso associate with distinct but overlapping sets of cellular zzso
