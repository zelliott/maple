The zzso of mouse zzso zzso C was cloned and zzso The coding region translates into a protein of zzso Da containing zzso zzso zzso The zzso includes 57 base pairs of a zzso region and a 3' untranslated region of zzso base pairs containing a zzso zzso zzso located 17 bases upstream from the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso and transformed into a zzso strain of zzso coli zzso that contained the zzso zzso and an integrated zzso zzso zzso that includes a single copy of the gene for zzso zzso zzso under control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for maximum induction of soluble zzso activity was developed to produce up to zzso units of soluble zzso activity per liter of growth zzso The zzso could be zzso to zzso with a yield of approximately zzso by a single zzso step on zzso
