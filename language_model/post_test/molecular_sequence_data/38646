We previously found that zzso zzso from the zzso zzso protein significantly enhances the binding of zzso peptides to zzso class II zzso Now a series of hybrids have been constructed linking zzso the active core region of the zzso zzso to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso T cell zzso stimulation by some of these hybrids is up to 250 times more potent than by the zzso zzso The biological activities of the hybrids were tested in terms of length and composition of the zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso bridge zzso were fully active in these hybrids which can enhance vaccination with zzso class zzso zzso
