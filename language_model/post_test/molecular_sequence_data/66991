zzso is the major zzso in zzso zzso zzso genes involved in the zzso of zzso will be of importance in understanding the process of wood zzso In this report, we investigated the possible role of zzso zzso a zzso belonging to family zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso from the hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso family zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is the only close zzso of zzso In zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene was expressed in developing primary zzso secondary zzso and zzso fibers of zzso and in developing secondary zzso of zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a type II membrane zzso and study of the zzso zzso demonstrated that fluorescent zzso zzso was located in the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a nearly complete loss of zzso signals in the secondary walls of fibers and vessels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso restored the secondary wall thickness and zzso content to the zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is functionally zzso with zzso and it is probably involved in zzso synthesis during wood zzso
