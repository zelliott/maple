We have investigated the molecular mechanisms zzso the zzso loop controls zzso zzso in zzso calcium zzso We demonstrate that the zzso loop is localized in a central position to control calcium channel activity through the interaction with several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso Several experiments reveal the crucial role of the interaction between the zzso loop and the zzso loop in channel zzso First, point zzso of two zzso acid zzso of the zzso loop of zzso zzso or zzso facilitate zzso zzso Second, zzso of the zzso loop, or injection of a zzso derived from this loop, produces a similar zzso behavior than the zzso zzso Third, the zzso zzso has no effect on channels zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, both point zzso and zzso of the zzso loop appear to act similarly on zzso by competing off the native interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso As they are known to affect zzso we also analyzed the effects of beta zzso on these zzso In experiments in which the zzso zzso is zzso the zzso zzso is no longer able to regulate channel zzso We conclude that zzso the contribution of the zzso loop to zzso is partly zzso by an interaction with the zzso loop and zzso the beta zzso partially control zzso by zzso this zzso These data provide novel insights into the mechanisms zzso the beta zzso the zzso loop, and the zzso loop altogether can contribute to regulate zzso in high zzso calcium zzso
