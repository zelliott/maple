zzso T zzso zzso recognize target zzso as short, processed peptides bound to major zzso complex class I zzso heavy and light chains zzso zzso beta zzso The heavy chain, which comprise the actual zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso can exist at the cell surface in different forms, either free, bound to beta zzso or as a zzso complex with beta zzso and zzso zzso chains are also known to zzso and zzso to the cell surface, and this has been suggested to be important in zzso zzso Whether zzso peptides also can zzso is not zzso We have investigated this by using both zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells loaded with zzso zzso by two different zzso First, peptides were zzso linked with zzso zzso alpha zzso at a position which did not interfere with zzso binding or zzso and zzso recycling tested with zzso zzso zzso By flow zzso a return of zzso zzso to the cell surface was found, after cellular zzso and cell surface clearance by zzso zzso This zzso recycling could be zzso from free zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso and low temperature (18 degrees zzso but not by zzso Second, specific zzso were reacted with zzso target cells after complete removal of surface zzso molecules by zzso and after different times of incubation at 37 degrees C to allow zzso By this zzso reappearance of target cell zzso was zzso The results are in agreement with a model for zzso zzso presentation by recycling through an zzso compartment similar to early zzso in certain zzso zzso
