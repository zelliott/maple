The mechanism of induction of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be different to the positively controlled zzso zzso of the enteric bacteria zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we report on the structure of the zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Comparisons of the zzso acid sequences zzso by these genes indicate that they are zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso binding protein and the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The analysis of zzso start points indicates that zzso could be transcribed from a single consensus promoter zzso Northern analysis of the zzso molecules pertaining to this region reveals that the transcript encompassing all these three genes is apparently zzso at a large putative zzso secondary structure, yielding two zzso zzso The smaller of these molecules would include only the zzso gene while a larger zzso spans through zzso and zzso The processing of zzso has not been reported in the zzso zzso zzso and may suggest either a less evolved or a divergent system for the control of gene expression of this zzso in zzso zzso
