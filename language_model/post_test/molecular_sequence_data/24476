The rice bacterial blight pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso is a vascular pathogen that elicits a defensive response through interaction with metabolically active rice zzso In leaves of zzso rice zzso the exposed pit membrane separating the zzso zzso from the associated zzso cells allows contact with bacterial zzso During resistant responses, the zzso secondary walls thicken within 48 h and the pit diameter zzso effectively reducing the area of pit membrane exposed for access by zzso In susceptible interactions and zzso controls, the zzso walls do not thicken within 48 zzso zzso secondary wall zzso is zzso and, in zzso zzso rice plants, the size of the pit also is zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously shown to increase in zzso vessel walls and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to demonstrate that zzso is produced in the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso The timing of the zzso is consistent with vessel secondary wall zzso The zzso gene is distinct but shares a high level of similarity with previously cloned zzso zzso in zzso zzso gene expression was induced as early as 12 h during resistant interactions and peaked between 18 and 24 h after zzso zzso during susceptible interactions was lower than that observed in resistant interactions and was zzso after zzso with water, after mechanical zzso or in mature zzso These data are consistent with a role for vessel secondary wall zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the defense response in rice to zzso zzso zzso zzso
