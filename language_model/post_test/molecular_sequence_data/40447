zzso zzso genes zzso were isolated from marine zzso isolate strain zzso (probably zzso zzso using shotgun cloning experiments and showed zzso similarity with previously reported zzso zzso In addition, a zzso gene zzso was found downstream of zzso although it was not zzso with any reported zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence possessed consensus sequences for zzso zzso proteins for binding the zzso zzso These car genes were arranged in the order of zzso but zzso and zzso genes were the opposite zzso zzso coli zzso cells harboring zzso zzso converted zzso to zzso at a ratio of zzso and the transformation ratio of zzso increased from 12 to zzso when zzso was added, indicating that zzso is the zzso component of the zzso system in strain zzso This is the first finding of a zzso zzso component in a zzso zzso zzso tests with aromatic compounds revealed that the strain zzso zzso showed activity with zzso aromatic zzso and zzso compounds and exhibited significant activity for zzso unlike previously reported zzso
