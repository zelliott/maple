The plant zzso zzso has both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the products of the zzso of zzso shows that zzso acts with retention of the zzso despite the absence of a zzso or stabilizing zzso To analyze the stabilization of a putative zzso zzso zzso the X-ray structure of zzso zzso with the inhibitor zzso was determined at zzso A zzso This structure supports the role of zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso group binds in the center of the active site, mimicking a reaction intermediate in which a positive charge at C1 is stabilized zzso by the zzso oxygen of the zzso group at zzso
