Previous studies have shown that zzso can be present at the cell surface either as a zzso zzso of zzso alpha or as a zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso zzso Here we analyzed the assembly and zzso transport of zzso with particular emphasis on the role of the zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso T zzso made by replacing the zzso domain of zzso alpha with that of the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso exhibited reduced ability to form zzso while a zzso of zzso containing the zzso alpha zzso domain zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso beta expressed alone was retained in the zzso zzso zzso Only a small amount of zzso beta formed zzso and these also remained in the zzso A zzso of zzso beta that zzso efficiently was also retained in the zzso thus proving that zzso retention of zzso beta is not due to its poor zzso Rather, the zzso domain of zzso beta requires interaction with that of zzso alpha to exit the zzso The zzso domain of zzso beta was also shown to participate in zzso retention by preventing exit of zzso zzso beta out of the zzso These findings demonstrate the role of zzso zzso in assembly and zzso transport of the zzso zzso
