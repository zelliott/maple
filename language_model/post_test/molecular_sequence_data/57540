Advances in our knowledge of the regulation of cardiac zzso zzso made possible by molecular cloning of the zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso of these genes in heart does not seem to require zzso or related proteins of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are under the control of zzso which stimulates zzso of the zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso production both in zzso and in cultured heart zzso The responsiveness of the genes to zzso varies in different zzso zzso The genes are most responsive in rat and zzso intermediate in sensitivity in calf and zzso zzso zzso and very resistant in the zzso The human zzso gene is zzso in zzso but the degree of response has not been zzso Introduction of zzso plasmids containing zzso zzso sequences of cardiac zzso genes fused to the zzso gene into cultured heart cells and transgenic animals has permitted identification of regulatory zzso Although the genes are closely linked in zzso DNA, they are controlled zzso The element within the zzso promoter responsible for induction by zzso is located approximately 160 base pairs from the zzso initiation zzso Additional zzso zzso located zzso upstream amplify the response to zzso probably by looping out intervening DNA zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene contains important regulatory zzso including those required for repression by zzso zzso zzso a zzso positive element, and a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
