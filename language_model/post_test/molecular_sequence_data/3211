zzso is a zzso protein that activates expression of several important zzso genes in the group A zzso zzso including those zzso M protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine the functionality of four potential zzso zzso motifs zzso identified within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso were introduced within each domain in a zzso fusion zzso and zzso proteins were zzso for binding to zzso promoter fragments zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso showed wild type zzso activity, an altered zzso domain resulted in reduced binding to the three promoters and an zzso zzso was devoid of zzso binding zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso from a zzso promoter zzso in the zzso zzso strain zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso expression correlated directly to the zzso activity observed for each zzso protein in zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso from their native zzso resulted in a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso expression in both zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to contain two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are required for direct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso
