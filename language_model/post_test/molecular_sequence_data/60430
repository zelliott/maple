The zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso encodes 348 zzso acid zzso and shares zzso identity with the zzso acid sequence of human zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the highest expression of the zzso zzso in zzso followed by lung and zzso The membrane zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso with the zzso showed specific zzso activities, with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with the zzso of guinea-pig BLT showed zzso zzso zzso indicating that the cloned zzso is zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and then to zzso a transformation considered as a major zzso zzso of the zzso Using the cloned zzso we zzso the zzso effects of zzso and these two zzso zzso is a much weaker zzso with a zzso value higher than that of zzso by three orders of zzso corresponding to a much weaker zzso zzso Although zzso is as potent as zzso in zzso zzso binding and zzso formation, it is less potent than zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the guinea-pig zzso The present study demonstrated that although zzso and zzso bind to the zzso with similar zzso they do differ in zzso zzso zzso
