Recently, a Texas, USA hospital isolated seven zzso zzso strains displaying dual resistance to zzso and zzso These zzso were resistant to the zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso pump and/or zzso zzso and resistant to zzso through zzso of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular events responsible for decreased zzso expression of zzso in these zzso zzso of zzso could only be detected in two of the zzso but expression was very low as indicated by the high number of zzso cycles required to amplify the zzso zzso was performed to amplify the zzso gene using zzso upstream of the promoter and downstream of the structural zzso zzso products were zzso and sequences were compared to zzso zzso zzso strain zzso Two zzso provided zzso products of the predicted size of zzso zzso but sequencing revealed a single base change within the structural gene resulting in a premature stop zzso The other five zzso provided zzso products that were zzso zzso larger than expected, suggesting the presence of large zzso zzso analysis indicated these zzso were novel zzso sequence elements zzso into different locations within zzso In zzso loss of zzso in all seven zzso was associated with zzso or insertions within zzso Although the point zzso that resulted in premature stop zzso would explain the loss of the zzso protein in two zzso This observation does not explain the observed decrease in zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso resistance occurring through zzso zzso of the zzso gene by IS zzso
