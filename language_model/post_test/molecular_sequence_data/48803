zzso zzso zzso results from partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients differ from zzso zzso carriers at the zzso zzso zzso the expression of which is modulated by single zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is present among patients, leads to correct zzso of zzso of the zzso and to alternative zzso of zzso the latter zzso being destroyed by zzso zzso An zzso zzso generates zzso correct and zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that under iron deficient conditions, the zzso zzso product was increased to zzso and 50% of total zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, respectively, both being zzso for zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso Iron zzso had less effect on the zzso zzso ratio in an zzso zzso cell zzso zzso similar to iron zzso were generated by zzso zzso of either zzso factor zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 6 zzso which interacts with zzso by zzso Based on these results, we propose that the availability of iron, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso This in turn, influences the relative amounts of correct and zzso zzso zzso zzso products and thus, regulates the zzso zzso zzso
