A zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample from a rice field in zzso Province, China, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and strictly zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 37 degrees C and pH zzso The zzso fatty acids of this soil isolate were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso formed a zzso zzso with the type strain of zzso zzso the two organisms shared zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso However, the two strains shared low zzso zzso zzso zzso was also readily distinguishable from zzso zzso zzso zzso by various zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso data suggests that the isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
