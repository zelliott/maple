As the first step toward a zzso zzso zzso approach for membrane protein structure zzso the packing of zzso zzso was modeled at the residual and zzso levels, zzso For predictions at the residual level, the zzso and zzso interactions were described by a set of zzso energy zzso For predictions at the zzso level, zzso force field was zzso To facilitate the system to overcome energy zzso zzso sampling was carried out by performing a random walk in the energy and zzso zzso zzso structures were predicted at both levels for zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, consistent results were obtained from simulations at residual and zzso levels for the same system, strongly suggesting the feasibility of a zzso approach for membrane structure zzso
