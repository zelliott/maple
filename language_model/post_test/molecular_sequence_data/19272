zzso is a recently identified gene located on human zzso 21 whose product has no similarity to any known protein and is of unknown zzso Analysis of expressed sequence tags zzso have revealed high human zzso expression in cells belonging to the diffuse neuroendocrine system zzso These cells may be the origin of neuroendocrine zzso zzso The aim of this study was to conduct an initial analysis of zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso coding sequence zzso was studied in 32 zzso tumors by zzso and sequence zzso A subtle alternative zzso was identified generating two zzso of zzso zzso differing in terms of the absence zzso zzso the first described zzso for zzso zzso or the presence zzso zzso of a zzso zzso When present, this specific zzso determines the presence of an zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 4 junction of the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso amounts were determined by quantitative relative zzso in 29 zzso tumors, 2 zzso tumors and 10 normal zzso A zzso analysis was performed to search for the existence of the two zzso zzso in other zzso 

The zzso zzso did not show differences compared to the reference sequence in any of the samples, with the exception of an zzso tumor arising in the neck zzso zzso analysis of this tumor identified a change in the zzso zzso position zzso instead of zzso leading to the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso tumor samples showed no significant difference in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression compared to control zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly more expressed than zzso zzso in zzso tumors as well as in control samples zzso zzso analysis revealed that only the zzso sequence of Pan zzso zzso is consistent with the possible existence of the two described zzso zzso 

A new zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the sequence and the expression of this gene were defined in a large series of zzso zzso
