The broad binding repertoire of zzso has permitted their use in a wide range of zzso However, some uses of zzso are precluded due to limitations in the efficiency of zzso zzso In zzso evolved binding zzso selected from zzso libraries generated around various alternative structural zzso are promising alternatives to zzso We have solved the crystal structure of a complex of an all zzso in zzso selected binding protein zzso bound to protein zzso an zzso zzso domain derived from zzso protein zzso The structure of the complex reveals an extended and complementary binding surface with similar properties to zzso zzso The surface region of protein Z recognized by the zzso is zzso similar to the one used for zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this surface contains potential zzso for zzso The implications of the selected zzso zzso for its application as a universal binding protein are zzso
