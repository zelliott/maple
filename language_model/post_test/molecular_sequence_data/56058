The zzso and zzso zzso located in the zzso class II region, zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Both genes display limited genetic zzso four different zzso zzso have been found in the zzso zzso Here studies on linkage zzso between zzso zzso and zzso class II zzso are reported, in an attempt to evaluate whether zzso zzso are associated with zzso diabetes zzso zzso As reported zzso a significant decrease of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 665 zzso zzso and zzso at 687 zzso zzso paralleled by an increase in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 665 zzso zzso and a stop zzso at 687 zzso zzso was found in both Finnish and Norwegian zzso patients compared to random zzso However, a strong linkage zzso between these zzso zzso and given zzso and zzso genes was observed among healthy zzso The frequent 665 zzso and 687 Stop zzso were in linkage zzso both with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which are strongly associated with zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are decreased among zzso patients, were associated with the 665 Ala and 687 zzso zzso Thus, when zzso and zzso patients and controls were zzso associations of the investigated zzso zzso and zzso were no longer zzso These data, therefore, indicate that the associations previously found between certain zzso zzso and zzso are secondary to a primary association between this disease and particular zzso alpha beta zzso
