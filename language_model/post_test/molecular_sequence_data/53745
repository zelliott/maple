zzso zzso are increasingly being recognized to serve as vehicles of zzso for various bacterial human pathogens and as hosts for a variety of zzso bacterial zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso the recently proposed family zzso are of special interest as potential human zzso In this study zzso bacterial zzso of a zzso zzso isolate were zzso zzso of zzso zzso with these bacteria resulted in prevention of zzso formation and subsequent zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso were not capable of zzso within other closely related zzso zzso but were able to zzso the zzso related species zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso revealed typical zzso characteristics of the zzso including the existence of a zzso zzso but indicated that these zzso in contrast to zzso species, do not reside within a zzso Comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso of zzso zzso classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is affiliated to the family zzso zzso laser scanning zzso in combination with zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso of the zzso and demonstrated the absence of other bacterial species within the zzso zzso These findings extend our knowledge of the zzso diversity of the zzso and demonstrate for the first time that these zzso can naturally develop within zzso of the zzso zzso
