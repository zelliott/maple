The gut of the zzso zzso zzso contains an interesting diversity of zzso and zzso zzso not found zzso These zzso produce many zzso zzso compounds, probably in cooperation with zzso zzso Regarding cellulose and zzso zzso in the zzso gut, much remains to be learned about the relative contributions of zzso zzso and zzso produced by different zzso Here we grew bacterial colonies from zzso gut suspensions, identifying 11 of them after zzso amplification of their zzso zzso zzso After constructing in zzso coli a zzso DNA library corresponding to all of the colonies zzso we performed functional screening for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This screen revealed a clone producing zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the cloned zzso DNA zzso contained three complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso organized in a putative zzso zzso The new zzso zzso identified with its regulators zzso and zzso belongs to zzso zzso family zzso The new zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso The zzso zzso shows zzso activity at pH zzso and zzso It also displays zzso zzso
