zzso our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of zzso is a critically important part of zzso The currently dominant theory is that zzso and similar molecules act by binding to zzso receptors in the zzso terminal of nerve cells and zzso or inhibit their zzso Although structures for some of the most important zzso channels have still not been determined, a number of important results have been derived from work on zzso zzso channels in zzso However, partly due to the lack of a nervous system in bacteria, there are a number of questions about how these results relate to higher zzso The recent determination of a structure of the zzso zzso channel, zzso is an important step toward accurate modeling of zzso channels, because it is more similar in function to human zzso receptors such as zzso or zzso One potential issue with using zzso to model other receptors is the presence of the large zzso zzso zzso positioned between all five zzso Here, we have performed a series of zzso molecular simulations to study how the dynamics and structure of zzso change in the presence versus absence of zzso When the zzso is removed, zzso move at least 2 zzso closer to each other compared to simulations with zzso zzso In addition, the pore radius shrinks to zzso zzso all of which appears to support a model where zzso binding between zzso zzso an open state, and that the relaxed zzso zzso might be suitable for modeling other zzso Interestingly, the presence of zzso also has an effect on the structure of the important loop C located at the zzso pocket, which might help shed light on its partial zzso zzso
