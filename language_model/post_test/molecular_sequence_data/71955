The temperate zzso zzso forms stable zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso product zzso which is responsible for maintaining the zzso zzso in the zzso state, has been zzso The zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso in solution, specifically binds to a zzso DNA zzso that contains two divergent zzso zzso and zzso These promoters mediate zzso from zzso and a putative zzso zzso Three similar, although not zzso zzso zzso repeated DNA segments zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso were found in this zzso zzso selectively interacts with zzso which is placed downstream from the zzso start point of the zzso zzso and with zzso and zzso which overlap with the zzso region of the two zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we have determined the zzso start points of zzso and zzso zzso exerts a negative effect on the in zzso zzso of zzso by repositioning the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso when bound to zzso and zzso enhances the positioning of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso protein regulates the zzso and zzso pathways of the zzso zzso
