To search for a zzso zzso of zzso a human liver zzso library was screened and a zzso clone was isolated, which encodes a protein with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso including conservation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using this zzso identified an abundant zzso zzso in all human zzso and cell lines zzso Southern zzso analysis using this same clone indicated that the corresponding gene exists as a single copy in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso detected this locus at the interface between bands zzso and zzso zzso strains lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso cycling agents and zzso and are zzso for zzso when grown in air, and expression of this human zzso zzso zzso in these strains restored growth on zzso zzso zzso strains lacking zzso are deficient in high affinity iron zzso and expression of zzso in these strains permits growth on zzso media and results in restoration of copper incorporation into newly zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a novel zzso expressed zzso which may play an essential role in zzso defense and copper zzso in zzso
