The chicken skeletal zzso gene promoter region zzso to zzso provides zzso zzso zzso This promoter contains partial zzso symmetry about an axis at zzso zzso and in zzso experiments is capable of directing zzso in a zzso zzso At least three different zzso initiation start sites, oriented toward upstream zzso were mapped 25 to 30 base pairs from zzso zzso The opposing zzso activity was zzso upon the deletion of sequences zzso to the zzso zzso start zzso Thus, sequences which serve to position zzso zzso for zzso zzso may allow, in their absence, the selection of alternative and zzso start zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso of embryonic muscle indicated that divergent zzso may occur in zzso but with rapid turnover of nuclear zzso Divergent zzso activity enabled us to define the 3' regulatory boundary of the skeletal zzso promoter which retains a high level of zzso zzso zzso The 3' regulatory border was detected when serial 3' deletions zzso the element zzso zzso zzso zzso which reduced zzso activity by zzso Previously we showed that disruption of its upstream counterpart zzso zzso zzso resulted in about a zzso decrease in zzso These element pairs, which we describe as zzso zzso repeats, are zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and may act in a cooperative manner to facilitate zzso in zzso zzso
