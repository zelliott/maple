zzso in zzso zzso can cause zzso dominant zzso kidney disease, which is a leading cause of zzso zzso The available evidence suggests that zzso acts as a zzso receiving signals from the primary zzso neighboring cells, and zzso zzso zzso is a large membrane protein that has a long zzso zzso region (about zzso zzso zzso with a zzso structure including 16 zzso zzso kidney disease zzso zzso which are targeted by many naturally occurring zzso zzso Nothing is known about the effects of these zzso on the zzso properties of zzso zzso Here we investigate the effects of several naturally occurring zzso on the mechanical stability of the first zzso domain of human zzso zzso We found that several zzso zzso alter the mechanical unfolding pathways of zzso resulting in distinct mechanical zzso Moreover, we found that these zzso also alter the zzso stability of a structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings, we zzso that zzso zzso may cause zzso dominant zzso kidney disease by altering the stability of the zzso zzso thereby zzso its ability to sense mechanical zzso
