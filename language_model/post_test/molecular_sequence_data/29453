zzso proteins are zzso cell surface proteins that catalyze both zzso or zzso zzso and protein zzso interchange and exhibit zzso zzso The two zzso activities alternate to generate a regular period length of about 24 zzso Here we report the zzso zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso is located on gene zzso with an open reading frame zzso 610 zzso zzso The activities of the zzso expressed zzso zzso with a period length of 22 zzso as is characteristic of zzso activities in zzso The activities are inhibited completely by zzso which represents a defining characteristic of zzso zzso zzso motifs identified by zzso zzso within the zzso portion of the zzso protein corresponding to the processed plasma zzso form include zzso zzso copper and zzso zzso binding zzso and two zzso essential for zzso zzso Four of the six zzso to zzso replacements retained zzso activity, but the period lengths of the zzso were zzso A single protein with two alternating zzso activities indicative of a zzso function is unprecedented in the zzso zzso
