Major zzso protein zzso genes were isolated from complementary zzso and zzso DNA libraries prepared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized at the zzso and zzso acid zzso levels, and their expression was zzso Three different zzso zzso and 2 zzso sequences were determined, each with an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso variation was detected at 30 positions in the zzso among all 5 zzso Conceptual translation of the full-length zzso sequences zzso 4 different zzso each of 126 zzso These predicted zzso differed at zzso positions 15 zzso zzso zzso 101 zzso zzso zzso 103 zzso zzso zzso and 126 zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA, zzso separately with various restriction zzso displayed multiple zzso zzso zzso bands for each zzso providing support for a zzso zzso Also, at the zzso level, sequence tracts consistent with a zzso zzso box sequence motif were identified within a region zzso to zzso zzso preceding the 2 zzso zzso In contrast to other species of zzso investigated to date, no zzso zzso factor binding motif was detected immediately upstream of the zzso coding zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in the males of both zzso larvae zzso and adults of zzso zzso zzso in pigs after zzso zzso The magnitude of expression in male zzso zzso raised in pigs in the presence of female worms was the same as in males in the absence of zzso Comparative analyses showed zzso sequence conservation among zzso from various zzso suggesting similar functional roles for these zzso
