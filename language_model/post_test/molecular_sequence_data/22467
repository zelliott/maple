The structure of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso zzso The structure is that of a typical zzso a zzso zzso structure with two zzso on either zzso The active site of the protein carries a zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of an zzso zzso The zzso zzso in this motif form a zzso zzso necessary for zzso zzso With high-resolution data available, it was possible to model numerous zzso side chains in alternate zzso and this includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso The sample was initially in the oxidized state and the use of zzso from an intense third-generation zzso source resulted in partial zzso of this zzso zzso zzso Comparisons with previously determined zzso structures indicate that zzso is most similar to the human zzso although the zzso of three zzso between strands zzso and zzso makes the corresponding turn longer and more flexible in zzso In addition, three significant zzso differences are identified on the protein surfaces near to the zzso zzso These zzso may contribute to the interactions that specific zzso form with their zzso zzso zzso
