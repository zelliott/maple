The crystal structure of zzso a zzso isolated from zzso zzso has been determined by molecular zzso The structure has been refined at zzso A resolution using zzso zzso procedures to a zzso residual of zzso The zzso zzso zzso has also been refined to zzso A resolution with residual zzso The protein is found to have a zzso zzso with nine zzso forming two mixed zzso The secondary structure is very similar to that observed in the other classes of zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso has approximately 20 zzso at the zzso that have no zzso in the other zzso a portion of these zzso forms the first zzso of the zzso The copper atom is located in a pocket between the zzso and is found to have four zzso zzso two zzso zzso one zzso zzso and, at a longer distance, one zzso zzso The geometry of the copper coordination is very similar to that in the plant zzso Three of the four copper zzso are located in the loop between zzso eight and zzso This loop is shorter than that in the other zzso having only two zzso each between the zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso structures are very zzso in particular, there is little difference in the positions of the zzso zzso with or without zzso One of the copper zzso a zzso lies close to the protein surface and is surrounded on that surface by seven zzso zzso This zzso patch is thought to be important as an electron transfer zzso
