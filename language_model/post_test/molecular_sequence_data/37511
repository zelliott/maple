To clarify the association of zzso B virus zzso in zzso and core promoter regions in patients with zzso failure and zzso zzso 

zzso and core promoter regions of 25 zzso zzso from the patients with zzso failure were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso direct sequencing zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were identified in 16 zzso of the 25 zzso The zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso were present together in 19 zzso of the 25 zzso while zzso and zzso existed in a mutually exclusive manner and more frequently in zzso failure with liver zzso group than in zzso failure with chronic zzso group zzso vs zzso Both zzso and zzso could be found frequently in zzso subjects zzso and zzso whereas zzso was more prevalent in zzso subjects than in zzso subjects zzso vs zzso 

The whole frequency of zzso in zzso and core promoter gene will become more frequent as zzso infection is to be zzso zzso to zzso may be useful as a marker for zzso zzso It requires further study whether the mixed infection of zzso and wilds will develop and affect the condition of zzso in serum along the progression of liver zzso
