In this paper we demonstrate that the organization of the zzso gene of zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso gene of both virus families consists of at least two large zzso zzso and zzso Four zzso of zzso zzso acid sequences have been identified in nearly identical positions in the 3' zzso of the pol gene of zzso and zzso The most 3' zzso domain which is still unique for these viruses encodes a zzso protein in zzso which is zzso from a precursor zzso zzso of zzso of the pol gene of both virus families occurs by zzso zzso A predicted zzso structure and zzso are zzso in the zzso overlap of zzso and zzso On the basis of these results we zzso that zzso and zzso are zzso more related to each other than to other families of positive stranded zzso zzso
