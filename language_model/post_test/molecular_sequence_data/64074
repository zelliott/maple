zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso was zzso and zzso While its native molecular mass was determined to be zzso zzso showed a single band of zzso on zzso zzso and two zzso chains zzso and zzso under reducing zzso These results were subsequently confirmed by mass zzso zzso Based on these results, we zzso that zzso is a zzso of the zzso which is held together by zzso zzso zzso modeling studies indicate that a zzso of zzso can be formed where the alpha chains are held together by zzso charges and beta chains via zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso without any zzso in a zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso effect was blocked by zzso zzso zzso is assumed to be a zzso protein which binds to the same or a closely related zzso site on zzso as zzso
