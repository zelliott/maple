The human zzso zzso protein zzso located 40 zzso downstream of the imprinted zzso zzso is zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized its mouse zzso zzso which maps to the zzso zzso region on mouse zzso zzso The promoter of zzso is a zzso island that is transcribed zzso but at different levels, in different fetal zzso zzso expression analysis revealed that both parental zzso are equally zzso Since the enhancers located between zzso and zzso had been shown to be involved in the imprinted expression of zzso zzso and zzso we asked whether they also influence zzso Analysis of mice with a targeted deletion of the enhancers demonstrated that they were not disrupted in the expression of zzso These findings indicate that zzso is functionally insulated from the zzso domain in terms of both zzso and zzso zzso
