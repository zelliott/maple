zzso B resistance is zzso with the zzso zzso resistance to antibiotics such as zzso being detected in many bacterial zzso Resistance is most commonly zzso by the production of an zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso We have undertaken a zzso analysis of the zzso protein from zzso zzso with the objective of developing a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of this zzso A zzso zzso that carried the zzso gene was zzso by either in zzso zzso zzso or passage through the zzso strain zzso zzso independently derived zzso were identified, nine of which had single point zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso produced stable but zzso zzso zzso and all had zzso acid changes within zzso zzso motifs that were important for either zzso binding or zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso zzso protein confirmed that the point zzso all involved zzso important for the structure and/or function of this zzso zzso These regions of the protein therefore represent potential targets for the rational development of zzso zzso
