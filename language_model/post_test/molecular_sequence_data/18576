A zzso zzso detection reaction zzso zzso using a molecular beacon probe was developed for the facile and rapid detection of point zzso present in low copy numbers in a mixed population of zzso zzso zzso zzso products generated in the zzso were captured on the surface of zzso magnetic beads for zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso were combined with a molecular beacon probe solution, and the suspension was directly flowed into a zzso The zzso were accumulated in a confined space within the zzso using a bar zzso The packed zzso sample was then scanned by a zzso scanning zzso to detect the presence of any zzso With the developed methodology, we were able to successfully detect one cancer zzso in a mixture of 400 zzso templates zzso test at zzso confidence zzso Furthermore, the zzso processing, typically the most zzso and time-consuming step in zzso zzso detection zzso could be carried out much more rapidly zzso 20 zzso This was enabled by the simple zzso and fluid zzso involved in the present zzso
