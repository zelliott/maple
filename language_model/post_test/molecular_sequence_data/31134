The zzso zzso syndrome is a genetically lethal human neurological disease that results from zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the complete DNA sequence of the human zzso gene locus has enabled the construction of multiple zzso primer sets for the simultaneous in zzso amplification of all nine zzso zzso The multiplex zzso chain reaction provides a facile zzso for the detection of zzso zzso deletions and the reaction products can be analyzed by direct automated fluorescent DNA sequencing to identify subtle zzso in the zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso genes from 15 independent zzso cases, and 10 zzso family studies were zzso The sequencing method uses solid supports and is sufficiently simple and sensitive to be a favored approach for zzso zzso zzso zzso can be diagnosed without reference to the affected zzso In addition, these procedures will be useful for zzso zzso zzso
