zzso is becoming a powerful animal model for the study of vision but the zzso organization and variation of its visual zzso have not been fully zzso We show here that zzso has two red zzso and zzso four green zzso zzso zzso and zzso and single blue zzso and ultraviolet zzso zzso genes in the zzso among which zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in tandem and zzso zzso zzso and zzso form another tandem gene zzso The peak zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso differed markedly among them: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 416 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rod zzso The quantitative zzso revealed a considerable difference among the zzso genes in the expression level in the zzso The expression of the two red zzso genes and of three green zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is significantly lower than that of zzso zzso and zzso These findings must contribute to our comprehensive understanding of visual capabilities of zzso and the evolution of the fish visual system and should become a basis of further studies on expression and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
