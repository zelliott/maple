In this report, we have characterized zzso zzso with respect to its ability to repair zzso zzso in zzso The zzso DNA zzso activity in zzso strain was minimal as compared with that in the zzso zzso The presence of zzso in DNA of zzso was zzso that of the zzso strain corresponding to a characteristically higher frequency of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is at least partially due to a spontaneous zzso of zzso resulting from a greatly reduced zzso DNA zzso zzso
