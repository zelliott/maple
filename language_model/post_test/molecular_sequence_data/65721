zzso bacteria such as zzso species play an important role in the global cycle of iron, zzso and trace metals and are useful for many zzso applications, including microbial fuel cells and the zzso of waters and sediments contaminated with zzso metals, and zzso Several alternative electron transfer pathways have been zzso for the reduction of zzso zzso subsurface zzso such as zzso zzso by zzso zzso One such potential mechanism involves the zzso of an electron zzso Here we identify for the first time zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso electron zzso produced by a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly correlated with growth and exceeded zzso zzso which was not exclusively growth associated but was zzso in the stationary phase of batch zzso zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso zzso but was not released by live zzso The zzso yields were similar under both zzso and zzso conditions, with total zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso per gram of cellular zzso respectively, after 24 h and were similar under zzso zzso conditions and when zzso was supplied as the sole electron zzso The zzso were shown to act as electron zzso and to promote zzso growth coupled to the accelerated reduction of poorly zzso zzso zzso The implications of zzso zzso by zzso cells living at zzso zzso where these mineral zzso can be significant electron zzso for growth, are zzso
