The zzso zzso from the fungus zzso zzso forms functional zzso zzso called zzso that facilitate spore formation and zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso occurs spontaneously at zzso zzso and the zzso further associate zzso to form zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso and zzso experiments to identify the region of zzso that drives zzso association and formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso this region into a zzso zzso enables it to form zzso We have also determined the structure and dynamics of an zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso Taken together, these data allow us to pinpoint the zzso changes that take place when zzso zzso at an interface and to propose a model for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
