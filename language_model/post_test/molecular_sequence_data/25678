The zzso sequence preferences of the DNA zzso zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied by using synthetic DNA duplex fragments and zzso gel zzso zzso These agents have structural features in common with the zzso activated zzso of zzso C zzso Like zzso they zzso zzso DNA duplexes containing the duplex sequence zzso For zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA duplexes, PAGE analysis of zzso fragmentation reactions revealed the zzso zzso to be zzso to zzso zzso again analogous to DNA zzso caused by zzso Unlike zzso zzso could be shown to zzso zzso a zzso zzso Furthermore, the impact of zzso sequence on the efficiency of zzso zzso at zzso was reduced for zzso with zzso and zzso being equally efficiently zzso zzso origins of the zzso sequence recognition common to all of the agents are zzso A model is presented in which the transition state for the conversion of zzso to zzso more closely resembles zzso DNA at zzso zzso
