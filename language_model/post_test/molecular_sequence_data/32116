zzso zzso and its zzso zzso play a major role in cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso are widely used to prevent graft or host rejection after zzso tissue zzso Although these zzso have been used for this purpose for many years, their common zzso within the zzso protein is zzso We screened a random zzso display library to isolate peptides specifically binding to zzso A striking zzso acid sequence motif was zzso This motif is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid positions 116 to 122 within the zzso domain of zzso suggesting that this is the zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding of selected zzso was specific, as no binding was observed to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding could be inhibited by the zzso zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso binding of zzso was abolished when two or more zzso acids of the suspected zzso were zzso In contrast, zzso binding remained unaffected in cells expressing zzso versions with zzso outside this zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso string within zzso is the zzso recognized by zzso and zzso This zzso zzso with the interaction site of zzso and zzso thus revealing the structural basis for the zzso of zzso binding by this class of zzso zzso
