Birth weight is an important indicator of both zzso and adult health, but little is known about the genetic factors contributing to its zzso zzso growth restriction is a leading cause of zzso morbidity and mortality and is also associated with adult zzso A significant correlation has been reported between lower birth weight and increased expression of the maternal zzso zzso in term zzso (the normal zzso pattern was zzso However, a mechanism that explains the zzso regulation of zzso on in zzso growth has yet to be zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso promoter region in 263 fetal DNA samples to identify zzso zzso We used a zzso reporter zzso to identify in the zzso promoter a zzso repeat sequence zzso zzso that significantly reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso was then performed in three independent white European normal birth zzso zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that maternal inheritance of zzso resulted in a significant zzso increase in birth weight zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, when the mother was zzso for zzso the influence on birth weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a similar magnitude to the reduction in birth weight caused by maternal zzso
