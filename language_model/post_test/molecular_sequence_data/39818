zzso regulatory T cells can differentiate from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso However, the impact of these two processes on size and composition of the peripheral repertoire of regulatory T cells is zzso Here we followed the fate of individual zzso zzso and T cells in zzso in T cell zzso zzso transgenic mice that express a restricted but zzso repertoire of zzso By utilizing zzso zzso analysis, we showed that zzso peripheral T cells were derived from zzso precursors that expressed a different zzso than zzso zzso zzso and zzso T zzso Furthermore, the diversity of zzso on zzso regulatory T cells exceeded the diversity of zzso on zzso zzso T cells, even in mice that lack expression of zzso zzso Our results imply that higher zzso diversity on zzso regulatory T cells helps these cells to match the zzso of zzso and zzso T zzso
