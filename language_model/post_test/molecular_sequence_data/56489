zzso zzso zzso zzso have been raised against the zzso zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso zzso This sequence possesses zzso zzso zzso AS zzso react with both the zzso and the free native zzso zzso 84, but not with the bound zzso 84 present in the zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso Both AS zzso and zzso zzso were shown to decrease zzso binding by zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso when added to 7 zzso zzso zzso convert them into 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together these data suggest that the zzso zzso sequence of zzso 84 is involved in the stabilization of the zzso zzso interaction, which is known to result in 7 zzso complex formation and in zzso zzso binding activity zzso Both zzso zzso and AS zzso destabilize this zzso
