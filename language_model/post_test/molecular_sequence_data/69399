A highly zzso zzso region plays a crucial role in the function of a family of regulatory proteins zzso by alpha zzso zzso The so-called zzso motif spans approximately 60 zzso and has been predicted to bind zzso This motif occurs in a number of other viral and cellular zzso many of which appear to be involved in some aspect of the regulation of gene zzso We have cloned and expressed in bacteria a portion of zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 that encompasses the zzso zzso and the equivalent regions from the zzso proteins of zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso All three zzso were zzso and found to bind zinc zzso None of the three zzso significantly with either DNA or zzso under our zzso zzso The zzso domain yielded zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso and analysis of nuclear zzso effects revealed its secondary zzso Starting from the N zzso this consists of an ordered but irregular loop, the first two strands of a zzso zzso zzso two turns of an zzso a second irregular loop, and the third strand of the zzso It appears that, taking the zzso and zzso zzso in turn, zzso zzso I, II, IV and V zzso one zinc atom while the zzso zzso and zzso zzso III, VI and zzso zzso a second zinc zzso This arrangement of secondary structure differs from that found in other characterized zzso zzso
