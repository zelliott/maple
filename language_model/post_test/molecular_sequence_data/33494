The zzso hormone zzso II exerts a wide variety of cardiovascular effects through the zzso of the zzso II Type 1 zzso zzso which belongs to the G zzso zzso zzso Like other G zzso coupled zzso the zzso zzso possesses seven zzso zzso that provide structural support for the formation of the zzso zzso The role of the fifth zzso domain zzso was investigated using the zzso zzso accessibility zzso All of the zzso within zzso to zzso region were zzso one at a time to zzso and after expression in zzso cells, the zzso receptors were treated with the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively with zzso free zzso groups of zzso or introduced point zzso zzso If a zzso is found in the binding pocket, the zzso modification will affect the binding zzso of the zzso zzso substantially decreased the binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which suggests that these zzso orient themselves within the zzso binding pocket of the zzso zzso Interestingly, this pattern of acquired zzso sensitivity was altered for zzso reporter zzso engineered in a zzso active zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso became more sensitive to zzso whereas zzso zzso lost some zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso causes an apparent zzso rotation of zzso as viewed from the zzso zzso
