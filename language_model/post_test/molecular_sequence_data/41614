A zzso named zzso zzso was isolated from a diseased zzso of the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a distinguishing feature in that its host range covered that of both zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso in cultured zzso It could replicate in cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells contained only a single zzso whereas they contained multiple zzso in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso including predicted zzso was determined and compared with the zzso sequence of its close zzso The comparison results showed that most of the zzso zzso zzso sequence was shared with zzso zzso zzso or zzso S1, but several regions seemed more similar to regions of zzso This observation might explain why zzso zzso covers the host ranges of zzso and zzso Further zzso virus infection experiments demonstrated that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso
