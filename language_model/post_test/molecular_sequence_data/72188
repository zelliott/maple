zzso B virus zzso transcripts contain a sequence known as the zzso regulatory element zzso This element was shown to facilitate the nuclear export of the S gene zzso to partially substitute for the human zzso virus zzso zzso element zzso and to bind two cellular zzso Within the genetically defined zzso zzso 450 zzso we identified a highly stable secondary structural element of 313 zzso in length termed zzso The energy values of the zzso are similar to those of the zzso of zzso and significantly lower than those of other portions of zzso zzso A comparison of human zzso zzso shows strong conservation of the zzso in terms of energy and structure, providing further evidence for the biological significance of the genetically defined zzso and the zzso in zzso The structural model for the zzso described in this study may help in identifying crucial components of the transport mechanism of transcripts of zzso
