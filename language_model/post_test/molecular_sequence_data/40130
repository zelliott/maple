The zzso III zzso with a total of zzso zzso is one of the zzso involved in plants starch zzso zzso from zzso zzso contains a putative zzso transit zzso followed by a zzso acid zzso domain zzso with three internal repeats and a zzso zzso domain of 450 zzso zzso Here, using zzso characterization techniques, we show that each of the three internal repeats encodes a zzso domain zzso Although the zzso from zzso zzso and its close zzso proteins show no zzso sequence similarity with characterized zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso known to be involved in starch binding are well zzso
