zzso lupus zzso zzso is a complex zzso disease characterized by zzso of the type I zzso zzso zzso Here we convincingly replicate association of the zzso regulatory factor 5 zzso zzso T zzso with zzso in four independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso transmission zzso test analysis zzso zzso zzso The zzso T zzso creates a zzso donor zzso site in an alternate zzso 1 of zzso allowing expression of several unique zzso zzso We also identify an independent zzso zzso associated with elevated expression of zzso and linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso associated with elevated expression and lacking the zzso zzso donor site do not zzso risk of zzso Thus, a common zzso zzso driving elevated expression of multiple unique zzso of zzso is an important genetic risk factor for zzso establishing a zzso role for type I zzso zzso genes in human zzso
