The results presented here locate the gene zzso an early, zzso zzso zzso protein of human and zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and provide additional evidence that this protein is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso major zzso protein zzso as proposed earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gibson, zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was used as a probe in Southern analyses done at moderate stringency as an approach to locating similar sequences in the zzso zzso The zzso K and zzso V fragments from the center of the long unique segment of zzso zzso with the zzso probe and were in turn used to identify corresponding sequences in the zzso D zzso of zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells directed the in zzso synthesis of zzso If the zzso was first zzso with the cloned zzso zzso D fragment, in zzso synthesis of zzso was specifically zzso Additional zzso in zzso translation experiments with zzso spanning the zzso D zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene is located in the left half of that fragment, approximately zzso by a zzso zzso zzso analyses identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso species expressed from this zzso A partial zzso sequence of the zzso region mapping within the boundaries of the zzso transcript, suspected to be the primary coding species, showed significant sequence similarity to the major zzso protein gene zzso identified in zzso zzso zzso
