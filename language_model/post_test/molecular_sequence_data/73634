zzso is a novel gene whose expression is associated with the experimental reversal of zzso of human zzso zzso The predicted protein product of the major zzso transcript shows striking similarity to the zzso zzso All known members of this zzso contain two or four characteristic motifs arranged as one or two symmetrical zzso zzso in contrast, contains 12 zzso zzso suggesting a zzso structure resembling a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso The structure of the zzso gene shows remarkable similarity to zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso equivalent protein structural zzso zzso is the first zzso member of the zzso zzso with a primarily zzso zzso Other parts of the predicted zzso protein sequence have weak similarity with filament or zzso zzso zzso is a good candidate for the putative zzso of zzso melanoma on zzso 6, possibly exerting its effects through interactions with the zzso
