The zzso region of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso contributes to the zzso regulation of gene zzso zzso is partly zzso by zzso zzso sequence elements zzso which serve as binding sites for specific zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso A treatment is dependent on regulatory sequence elements upstream of zzso We have performed northwestern zzso and filter binding zzso using cell extracts and zzso sequences containing or lacking zzso zzso and human T cell extracts zzso and zzso yielded two specific proteins of 93 and 94 zzso respectively, that were binding to sequences upstream of zzso Within this region, the human and zzso zzso do not share any obvious sequence identity, yet both are target sites for the binding zzso The smallest zzso fragments protected by the proteins from zzso A zzso were 44 in the zzso and 38 zzso long in the human zzso The binding activity of the 94 zzso protein derived from human zzso cells could be enhanced by zzso The interaction with regulatory zzso sequences and the responsiveness to zzso suggests that the proteins are involved in controlling zzso zzso zzso
