zzso of zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso which comprises the seven zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, has previously been observed to induce the proliferation of internal zzso zzso zzso In order to exploit this amplified membrane surface area for the accommodation of zzso zzso zzso we fused sequences coding for human zzso zzso zzso to sequences zzso the zzso zzso and expressed the hybrid genes in zzso The zzso hybrid proteins were targeted into strongly proliferated zzso as shown by electron microscopic and zzso zzso Fusion proteins zzso the whole zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity, whereas fusion proteins lacking the zzso 56 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso were inactive and appeared to be unable to incorporate zzso Similar amounts of zzso protein were detected in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso membrane anchor domain of human zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso also resulted in a functional fusion zzso which was able to interact with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
