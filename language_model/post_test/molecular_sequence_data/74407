zzso of zzso DNA damage in zzso was thought limited to zzso base zzso repair zzso replacing a single zzso However, certain zzso zzso cannot be processed by zzso Here we report that zzso zzso a major type of oxidized zzso site, zzso replication by zzso DNA zzso zzso gamma and interferes with zzso by zzso zzso zzso gamma during attempted zzso zzso However, repair of zzso was detected in human zzso zzso and we show that this repair is via zzso zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso 1 zzso not previously known to be present in zzso zzso was retained in zzso zzso and detected in zzso zzso that contain known zzso replication and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso studies were also consistent with the presence of zzso in the zzso of intact zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso activity of zzso extracts was strongly diminished in parallel with the removal of zzso although some activity zzso suggesting the presence of an additional zzso zzso Biological evidence for a zzso role in repairing zzso zzso DNA damage was provided by zzso interference experiments, with the extent of damage greater and the recovery slower in zzso cells than in control zzso The zzso zzso zzso likely plays important roles in repairing zzso zzso and other zzso zzso and perhaps in normal zzso zzso
