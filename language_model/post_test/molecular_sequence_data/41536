As the globally dominant group of zzso bees provide a key zzso service for natural and agricultural zzso Their corresponding global decline thus poses an important threat to plant populations and the zzso they zzso Bee conservation requires rapid and effective tools to identify and delineate zzso Here, we apply DNA zzso to Irish solitary bees as the first step towards a DNA zzso library for European solitary zzso Using the standard zzso zzso we were able to identify 51 of 55 zzso Potential problems included a suite of species in the zzso zzso which were recalcitrant to sequencing, zzso zzso and zzso flies, which led to the production of erroneous sequences from DNA zzso DNA zzso enabled the assignment of zzso zzso females of the zzso zzso zzso to their nominal zzso It also enabled correction of the Irish bee list for zzso zzso identified zzso However, the standard zzso zzso was unable to differentiate the recently zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our results show that DNA zzso provides an excellent identification tool for Irish solitary bees and should be rolled out to provide a database for solitary bees zzso
