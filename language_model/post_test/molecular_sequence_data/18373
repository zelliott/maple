Human zzso zzso 4, which zzso in the zzso system a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, space group zzso four molecules per unit cell, protein volume fraction zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure was solved by zzso methods using the structure of bovine zzso zzso 1 as a model and it has been refined at zzso A resolution to an zzso of zzso The root mean square zzso zzso between the zzso atoms of the two zzso is about zzso A while that between 31 zzso side chains is a surprisingly large zzso zzso The structure of the zzso binding zzso of zzso binding of zzso 4 is zzso well by zzso zzso 1 but with some notable zzso The latter transform the site from a zzso zzso to one which recognizes zzso and other zzso zzso The binding site of the observed zzso 4 structure is also compared with one that was zzso from the structure of zzso 1 of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the binding site of a zzso zzso make zzso pairs with zzso acid zzso in the binding site of another zzso in the zzso 4 zzso
