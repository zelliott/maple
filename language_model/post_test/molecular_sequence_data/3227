zzso zzso and zzso studies were conducted on two species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso collected in different fish hosts from the Mediterranean zzso The analysis of internal transcribed zzso 1 sequences of zzso DNA showed that zzso zzso specimens from zzso zzso were strongly divergent zzso from specimens of this species collected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso This high genetic variation was confirmed by the analysis of zzso structures and zzso which showed that zzso zzso specimens from zzso zzso can be distinguished from those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by several zzso zzso including body size, number and distribution of zzso zzso zzso shape, structure of the zzso pouch, and number of zzso Our results show that zzso zzso specimens isolated from zzso zzso represent a clearly distinct entity from zzso zzso found in the other zzso which has enabled us to describe a new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
