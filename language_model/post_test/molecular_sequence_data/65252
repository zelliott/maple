A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso referred to as zzso was isolated from the red zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a putative open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso but one stop zzso was present in the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that zzso exists as a single copy in the zzso From the order of gene arrangement of zzso zzso appears to be a zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso H were closely related to those of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso tree suggested that zzso zzso stands within the gypsy elements and outside the zzso zzso zzso is the first example of a zzso composition of zzso and zzso zzso genes in a single element, supporting the hypothesis that long terminal zzso zzso have evolved by fusion of ancestral zzso H and other zzso zzso
