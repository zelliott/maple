To study the process of zzso sex determination and in particular to further understand the mechanisms of zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso zzso pig zzso zzso zzso zzso To facilitate the in zzso analysis of these zzso we have generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso that expresses zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Via primer extension analysis on zzso from this cell line, a zzso start site for zzso zzso was identified at zzso base pairs zzso zzso from the translation initiation zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences retained full zzso activity compared with the zzso zzso fragment, but that zzso activity fell when further deletions were zzso zzso downstream of the zzso start site are important for promoter activity, because deleting transcribed but not translated sequences eliminated promoter zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso identified two potential binding sites for zzso at zzso and at zzso from the zzso To address the role of zzso zzso in zzso promoter activity, zzso studies of the potential zzso binding sites were performed and revealed that these sites were indeed important for zzso promoter zzso zzso studies in a zzso cell system zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that pig zzso was able to zzso the pig zzso zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed that the upstream site was recognized by mouse zzso zzso We conclude that two sites for zzso zzso exist within the pig zzso promoter, at zzso zzso and at zzso zzso and that the site at zzso zzso is zzso the most zzso
