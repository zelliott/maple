We present the results of zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations of a zzso bundle of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These simulations explore the dynamic properties of a model of a zzso bundle channel in a complete zzso zzso in an zzso zzso We explore the stability and zzso dynamics of the bundle in a zzso zzso We also investigate the effect on bundle stability of the zzso state of the ring of zzso side zzso If all of the zzso side chains are zzso the bundle is zzso if none of the zzso side chains are zzso the bundle is zzso zzso calculations suggest that either zero or one zzso zzso is present at neutral zzso zzso with the stable form of the zzso zzso The structural and dynamic properties of water in this model channel were zzso As in earlier in zzso simulations zzso et zzso 1996 zzso zzso zzso the zzso moments of water molecules within the pore were aligned zzso to the zzso zzso This contributes to the stability of the zzso zzso
