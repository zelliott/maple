The zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso was zzso zzso and localized on the right arm of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has a high similarity to zzso zzso zzso and has putative zzso binding zzso To investigate the effect of total loss of the zzso zzso we constructed a zzso zzso of this zzso zzso which has no zzso zzso activity and has an absolute requirement for zzso or zzso for the zzso This requirement is satisfied by a very low concentration of zzso zzso zzso or a higher concentration of zzso zzso zzso
