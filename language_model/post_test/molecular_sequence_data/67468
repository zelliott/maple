Investigation of protein changes as well as zzso of meat is particularly difficult in processed meat products due to their different zzso complexity and very often zzso The aim of this study was to check if the zzso differences in the expression of zzso light chain zzso zzso observed in raw meat were retained in meat zzso zzso from zzso of minced meat (16 zzso zzso and sausages (15 zzso made from zzso zzso chicken, zzso duck and goose were zzso by zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso were observed in all the zzso and processed meat zzso Relatively small degradation was observed in the zzso after zzso Image analysis enabled species identification of the meat in all samples when the content of meat of one species was not lower than zzso However, it was impossible to differentiate between all the six species under investigation on the basis of individual zzso It was possible when the combination of all the three zzso zzso light chain 1 fast, zzso light chain 2 fast and zzso light chain 3 zzso was zzso The results evidenced that zzso have potential to be used as markers in zzso of meat products made from the zzso six zzso
