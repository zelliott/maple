The zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso expression was investigated in order to identify species closely related to man which can be used as potential zzso zzso zzso animal zzso To this purpose, the zzso sequences of the zzso promoter region of eight zzso species representing four different orders zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso trees of the zzso promoter region sequences yielded two deeply separated groups, one including man zzso zzso nonhuman primates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cow zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso and the other including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso groups have been observed in putative zzso zzso regulatory elements and can be involved in the differences of pattern of expression between these two zzso zzso of the available zzso zzso sequences enabled us to root the tree with a zzso zzso and to perform a zzso zzso This analysis did not detect any base composition bias and supported zzso zzso Although a zzso attraction artifact cannot be completely zzso these findings zzso toward the recent statement zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso in zzso 10 involved in the most common zzso zzso in man is zzso in zzso These zzso analyses as well as anatomical and zzso data suggest that, once rabbit embryonic stem cells become available, the rabbit will provide a suitable tool for both gene transfer and pharmacological investigations and could lead to a better zzso model than the current zzso zzso
