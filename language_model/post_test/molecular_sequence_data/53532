The bacterial zzso of zzso emerged during the 1980s, in the French West zzso and zzso This new bacterial disease is presently wide spread and constitutes a serious limiting factor for commercial zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso of naturally infected zzso were characterized and compared with reference strains belonging to the zzso family, the zzso zzso and zzso and representative fluorescent zzso From artificial zzso 25 out of 29 strains were zzso on zzso zzso and zzso tests, fatty acid analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso zzso were zzso The 25 zzso strains on zzso were clustered in one zzso closely related to zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso zzso range zzso related to the strain zzso zzso and constituted a discrete DNA zzso group indicating that they belong to the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence and fatty acid analysis confirmed that this new species belongs to the zzso of zzso and to zzso zzso III, to the family of zzso and to the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso is proposed for this new zzso zzso The type strain has been deposited in the Collection zzso des zzso zzso as zzso zzso
