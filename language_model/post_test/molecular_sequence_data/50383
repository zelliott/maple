We have determined the zzso class II zzso zzso acid motif of the zzso (the site of contact between the zzso zzso and the major zzso zzso for a synthetic zzso composed of zzso zzso of pigeon zzso c zzso zzso 46 and 54 functioned as the zzso and zzso 50 and 52 functioned as the zzso (the site for contact between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In general, zzso and zzso function zzso Thus, substitution of zzso acids in the zzso does not significantly affect binding of the zzso zzso to a class II zzso On the basis of these findings, synthetic zzso vaccines against influenza zzso zzso virus were prepared by introducing seven zzso of the influenza virus zzso into the frame component zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso including the zzso for Ak or zzso previously determined on the zzso zzso These zzso vaccines induced both helper zzso responses and production of zzso that were specific for influenza zzso zzso but not for the major zzso complex binding frame in mice bearing Ak or zzso The zzso produced neutralize the zzso of influenza zzso in zzso The present findings should provide a basis for preparing potent zzso vaccines that function without producing side zzso
