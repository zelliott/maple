zzso zzso zzso is a leaf zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We have obtained two highly similar zzso for pumpkin zzso zzso and zzso It has been revealed that two zzso zzso might be produced by alternative zzso from a single type of zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso was found to have a targeting sequence into leaf zzso at the zzso suggesting that alternative zzso controls the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso proteins are localized in leaf zzso and the zzso zzso Moreover, indirect zzso zzso and analyses of transgenic tobacco cultured cells and zzso zzso expressing fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein zzso revealed the different zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso Both zzso were induced zzso and by light, but with quantitative zzso Almost equal amounts of the zzso were detected in pumpkin zzso grown in darkness, but treatment with light greatly enhanced the production of zzso zzso These findings indicate that light regulates alternative zzso of zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a novel mechanism of zzso zzso namely zzso alternative zzso in higher zzso
