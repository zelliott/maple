zzso zzso stores are used to maintain zzso zzso during zzso are a source of energy for muscle contraction, and are used to support a broad range of cellular activities in most zzso A diversity of signals accelerate zzso degradation that are zzso by zzso b zzso zzso which zzso and thereby activates zzso zzso zzso is among the most complex of the protein zzso so far zzso It has one zzso zzso zzso and three different regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso a molecular mass of zzso X 106 zzso and each zzso zzso is presumed to contain four molecules of each zzso The three regulatory zzso inhibit the zzso activity of the gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso via the delta zzso which is identical to zzso but remains an integral component of the zzso even when the zzso is lowered to zzso zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso also zzso zzso of the gamma zzso and thereby activates the zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso appear to be structurally coupled and are zzso In addition, zzso is activated in zzso by zzso limited zzso of the regulatory zzso and various zzso zzso and these may also be mechanisms of zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of regulation are currently poorly zzso but new insights are beginning to zzso This review discusses current knowledge and concepts of the structure, function and regulation of zzso
