A zzso attracting zzso zzso zzso related to zzso and zzso was recently characterized and termed zzso zzso zzso Here, we cloned the zzso of the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso from zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shares zzso identity with its human zzso It encodes a 100 zzso acid immature protein of zzso Da which contains a putative signal zzso of 21 zzso zzso The molecular mass of the mature protein was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso identity of the zzso and human zzso proteins is zzso zzso tree analysis of mouse zzso zzso places zzso together with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on an individual zzso A zzso sequence was obtained by zzso walking and zzso DNA fragments from a zzso clone containing zzso Like human zzso zzso contains 4 zzso with zzso boundaries at positions comparable to the human zzso Whereas zzso 2 and 3 are of similar length in the zzso and human zzso zzso 1 of zzso contains zzso zzso more than zzso 1 of the human zzso zzso 1 of zzso is also characterized by a zzso stretch with repetitive sequences of high cryptic zzso Using a zzso clone containing zzso this gene could be mapped to zzso 5 at position zzso Since human zzso is localized on zzso this result confirms the zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso
