Class I zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are important regulators of shoot zzso zzso function and leaf zzso by their contribution to dissected leaf zzso Palms are of particular interest as they produce dissected leaves generated by a distinct mechanism compared with zzso The question addressed here was whether class I zzso genes might be involved in zzso function and leaf dissection in zzso Here, we characterized the zzso gene from oil palm zzso zzso zzso and compared it with available sequences from other plant species using zzso zzso Gene expression pattern was investigated using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out by zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso and to zzso from zzso It was expressed in the central zone of both zzso and zzso zzso During leaf development, its expression was associated with zzso from which the leaflets zzso Different modes of leaf dissection are seen to involve a similar class of genes to control zzso activities, which govern the production of dissected zzso
