A bacterial strain capable of utilizing zzso with chain lengths ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso as a sole carbon source was isolated using a system for screening zzso able to grow on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso identified according to its zzso zzso sequence as zzso zzso was designated zzso zzso zzso Two DNA fragments zzso parts of zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso chain zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To study the roles of these two zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso and zzso disruption zzso Studies on the growth patterns of the disruption zzso using zzso with different chain lengths as sole carbon source demonstrated central roles for the zzso and zzso genes in zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Comparative analysis of these patterns also suggested different zzso preferences for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Because both single and double zzso were able to grow on zzso with chain lengths of zzso and longer, we concluded that yet another zzso for the zzso of these zzso must exist in zzso zzso zzso
