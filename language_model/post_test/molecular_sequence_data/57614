The zzso gene zzso a zzso toxin is poorly expressed in zzso zzso when cloned in a zzso zzso This weak expression is observed when the gene is cloned only with its promoter and its putative zzso zzso gene expression was analyzed by using deletion derivatives of a larger DNA zzso carrying the toxin gene and additional adjacent zzso The results indicate that a zzso DNA zzso located 400 zzso upstream of the promoter strongly enhances zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when the zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso between upstream regions of zzso and the zzso gene was zzso Analysis of the start sites, the sizes, and the amounts of zzso zzso shows that the enhancement occurs at the zzso level by increasing the number of zzso transcripts from the onset of zzso to about 6 h after the onset of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso and of the 700 zzso containing the promoter region and the zzso end of zzso were zzso No potential zzso sequences were found upstream of the zzso The major characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso is the presence of a zzso A + zzso zzso
