zzso zzso zzso zzso acts on the zzso to increase zzso of several proteins during the pregnancy recognition period in zzso One of these is a zzso zzso protein that has not been zzso Our hypothesis was that the zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that fragments upon freezing and zzso or treatment with zzso including zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso sequence that binds to cell surface zzso to promote zzso attachment and cell zzso Using zzso to zzso human zzso both zzso and zzso proteins were identified in zzso zzso from pregnant zzso by Western zzso A clone containing the entire zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was isolated by screening a Day 15 pregnant zzso zzso zzso library with a partial zzso zzso zzso In pregnant zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso after Day zzso In both zzso and pregnant zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was localized on unidentified immune cells within the stratum zzso of the zzso In pregnant zzso zzso zzso was also expressed by the zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso and/or zzso induce expression and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso during the zzso period and that zzso may induce zzso between zzso zzso and zzso to facilitate superficial zzso
