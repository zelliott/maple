We describe the cloning and characterization of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso lacks zzso signaling motifs in its zzso zzso Although zzso has the typical structural features required for zzso acid zzso no evidence for zzso recognition was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were raised to zzso and used to define its cellular expression pattern and functional zzso By flow zzso zzso was expressed specifically on zzso zzso cell zzso precursors in bone zzso zzso blood, and zzso zzso zzso of tissue sections showed that zzso was also expressed in a subset of marginal zone zzso in the zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using bone zzso zzso precursors that express zzso addition of zzso did not influence zzso production, either in the presence or absence of synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso motifs zzso In comparison, zzso functioned as an zzso zzso and zzso efficient zzso of zzso zzso By zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso we demonstrate generation of zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso may therefore be a useful way of delivering zzso to zzso precursors for zzso
