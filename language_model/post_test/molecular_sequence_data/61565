zzso zzso are used widely to deliver zzso genes into zzso In order to express three genes from a single zzso zzso a zzso zzso that contains two divergent internal zzso entry site zzso sequences has been constructed zzso To eliminate the high frequency of zzso within a zzso zzso zzso a zzso segment of a cellular zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were used, since these two zzso sequences have minimal sequence zzso After a single round of zzso most cells infected with this zzso zzso expressed the three genes while approximately zzso of cells infected with another zzso zzso zzso that contains two copies of an identical zzso sequence lost expression of the gene located between these two zzso
