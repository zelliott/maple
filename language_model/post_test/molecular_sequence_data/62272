zzso zzso is a zzso zzso present in the zzso of the zzso zzso It interacts with various zzso by binding via their attached zzso zzso To provide further insight into these zzso zzso we are investigating the interaction of zzso with various zzso We have earlier modeled the complex between zzso and the zzso zzso a zzso of the native zzso sugar zzso Here, we have systematically zzso the zzso implicated by the model in the interaction of zzso to its sugar zzso and zzso the role played by each of the zzso of zzso toward the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show any binding to the sugar zzso interacting with the zzso zzso demonstrating the great importance of these zzso in the zzso site of zzso Also, zzso and zzso showed weak affinity toward the zzso The zzso of zzso from the primary binding site of zzso zzso those interacting with zzso appears to be far less tolerated as compared to zzso in zzso that interact with the zzso zzso of the zzso Also, zzso failed to zzso asserting to the significance of the interactions between the primary binding site of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in generating specificity for this zzso These studies provide detailed molecular insight into the sugar binding specificity of zzso
