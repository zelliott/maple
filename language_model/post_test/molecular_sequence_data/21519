zzso and zzso two proteins containing zzso zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso and involved in several zzso Their zzso results from zzso and zzso zzso Alternative zzso of zzso 3, coding for a 13 zzso zzso zzso generates for each protein a long and short zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins showed that this motif acts as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and substitution zzso identified four zzso essential for zzso zzso and three zzso to stabilize the proteins within the zzso The short zzso are never found in the zzso whereas the long zzso are present in the zzso and the zzso For zzso only the zzso long zzso is zzso suggesting that this zzso targeting is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments have shown that the long zzso zzso zzso to the zzso component of the zzso and that zzso and zzso exchange rapidly between zzso The presence of this 13 zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso is responsible for the differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso of zzso and the various zzso zzso of their zzso may partially explain the various functions previously reported for these zzso
