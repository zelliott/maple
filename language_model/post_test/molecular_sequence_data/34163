In this study, the complete zzso sequence of a zzso disease virus zzso isolate collected from an outbreak in 1995 in chickens was fully characterized and compared with other zzso zzso The zzso was found to be zzso zzso long and to consist of six genes in the order zzso similar to other avian zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso a feature that is unique to some zzso zzso The isolate shows the zzso acid sequence zzso at the zzso site of the F zzso which is identical to a known motif for virulent zzso of zzso The zzso analysis of the coding region of the F gene indicated that this isolate belongs to zzso zzso more specifically to zzso zzso along with zzso from the other European countries zzso Switzerland and zzso The same zzso caused outbreaks in the Middle East and Greece in the late 1960s, and in Hungary, in the early 1980s, suggesting a common source for these zzso
