In an effort to study sequence space allowing the recovery of viable potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have developed an in zzso selection zzso method to produce and zzso by zzso large zzso zzso banks in which a short stretch of the zzso is zzso to zzso This technique was applied to two highly zzso 6 zzso regions of the zzso zzso the left terminal loop zzso zzso and part of the zzso stretch in the upper strand of zzso loop 1 zzso zzso In each case, zzso zzso was observed in a large fraction of zzso tomato zzso zzso of the progeny molecules showed the recovery of the parental zzso sequence in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, viable and genetically stable zzso zzso with zzso outside of the known natural zzso of zzso were recovered in both cases, although at different zzso In the case of the zzso region, zzso were recovered at five of the six zzso positions zzso zzso zzso 1 and 3 of the zzso while for the zzso region zzso were recovered at all six targeted positions zzso providing significant new insight on the plasticity of the zzso zzso
