zzso basic protein zzso is an important component of the zzso sheath surrounding zzso and it is directly affected in zzso zzso zzso contains a relatively large number of zzso modifications zzso which have been reported to play a role in multiple zzso while zzso from lower zzso have been reported to be incapable of inducing multiple sclerosis or allergic zzso This study reveals the extent of differences in zzso patterns for zzso and zzso zzso This included intact mass and de zzso sequence analysis of approximately zzso of zzso zzso the first zzso zzso to be zzso and of bovine zzso We identified 12 zzso at 11 sites in the five bovine zzso charge zzso which include both previously reported and novel zzso The most notable modification is an zzso of zzso zzso Other modifications found in bovine zzso include zzso zzso in components zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 19 in all five zzso all charge zzso having both a zzso and zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso in zzso 23 and 47 found only in component zzso zzso of zzso 96 and zzso in zzso 102 found in components zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 97 restricted to charge components C2 and zzso zzso in zzso 161 only found in component zzso zzso of zzso 120 was only observed in zzso All four zzso zzso and one zzso zzso were first zzso revealed in this study for bovine zzso zzso database searching combined with de zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso provided more than zzso sequence zzso A few zzso were also revealed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, snake zzso was found to undergo less modification than bovine zzso on the basis of the mass zzso of the intact zzso the bottom-up structure analysis, and the limited complexity of zzso zzso zzso The combined data from this study and information from previous studies extend the known zzso zzso and zzso unique to higher zzso are zzso
