zzso of three bovine zzso zzso were analyzed as a way of determining genetic zzso A total of 330 individual zzso cells from a zzso zzso bull were selected by means of a new method involving fixing the zzso cells into zzso zzso zzso The method is simple and very accurate with an efficiency close to zzso for picking zzso cells and producing zzso DNA templates, zzso the complicated statistical analysis mandated by automated cell zzso The DNA was amplified in a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to achieve the necessary high specificity of zzso In the first reaction, zzso zzso the zzso site at each locus were zzso The zzso product from the first reaction was then zzso in a second zzso using zzso that create zzso restriction sites zzso in the zzso products for two of the three zzso allowing the zzso to be determined by gel zzso No zzso were found among the 330 single zzso cells zzso giving a zzso score higher than 30 and proving a very strong linkage between bovine zzso zzso
