A zzso and two zzso clones zzso highly similar genes that zzso a protein with a zzso zzso domain were isolated from the resurrection plant zzso zzso The structure of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes consists of three putative zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso encodes a closely related protein of zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain present in zzso zzso of zzso animals and plants was localized in the zzso zzso of deduced zzso zzso and zzso proteins and zzso to the two zzso repeats found in zzso The zzso domain of zzso deduced proteins and a short stretch of zzso acids adjacent to this region are closely related to a zzso gene from zzso zzso which is expressed in response to zzso stress and zzso The rest of the deduced protein has no similarity to other reported zzso The zzso genes in the zzso zzso comprise a small gene family of zzso members as estimated by zzso with a bona fide zzso domain zzso Northern zzso experiments showed specific expression of zzso in zzso callus tissue zzso by zzso and expression of zzso zzso in roots zzso by zzso
