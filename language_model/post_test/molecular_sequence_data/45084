To present the results of molecular analysis of the zzso gene in a group of patients with zzso zzso from Mexican zzso origin, a previously zzso ethnic zzso 

Five unrelated affected zzso four pertaining to familial cases and one zzso were studied at the Institute of zzso zzso de zzso in Mexico zzso All patients underwent full zzso examination as well as zzso analysis in zzso DNA using a combination of zzso zzso amplification, direct sequencing, and zzso zzso Available affected relatives were also zzso 

Three novel zzso deletions were zzso a 15 zzso deletion in zzso nine that removes the last two zzso of the zzso and the first nine bases of zzso 10, including the zzso zzso zzso donor zzso a 14 zzso deletion in zzso six that introduces a premature stop signal 15 zzso downstream and a four zzso deletion in zzso seven, which introduces a stop signal 22 zzso zzso in three unrelated zzso Although zzso these three latter cases came from the same geographical area, strongly suggesting a founder zzso effect as the source of the zzso 

Our study provides the first molecular analysis of the zzso gene in Mexican subjects with zzso zzso identifies three novel zzso zzso zzso and suggests the occurrence of a zzso founder zzso effect in this zzso Our results also confirm the current notion that zzso zzso zzso are overwhelmingly associated with zzso regardless of their location in the zzso
