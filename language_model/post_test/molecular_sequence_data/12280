A zzso zzso zzso defective in taxis toward zzso but responsive to zzso was selected by the swarm plate method after zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso was fully zzso but failed to show zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also showed weaker responses to some other commonly occurring zzso acids than did the zzso strain zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso gene encodes a putative zzso of 629 zzso acids with a calculated mass of zzso A zzso plot of the predicted zzso suggested that zzso may be an integral membrane protein with two potential zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso showed high zzso with the enteric zzso zzso proteins zzso The most significant zzso acid sequence similarity was found in the region of zzso referred to as the highly zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso by zzso of a zzso resistance gene cassette into the zzso zzso resulting in the same observed zzso in taxis toward zzso acids as zzso In zzso zzso labeling experiments with zzso showed that this knockout zzso lacked an zzso with a molecular weight of approximately zzso
