zzso membrane trafficking plays an essential role in the zzso and maintenance of zzso Members of the zzso protein family are important components of the systems that regulate zzso zzso zzso We examine the function of zzso a novel rat zzso protein cloned from an zzso zzso library, by visualizing and identifying in living zzso cells the zzso that contain zzso Our results show that zzso is present in the trans zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso from trans zzso to zzso compartments takes place via small zzso zzso zzso containing zzso The formation of zzso in the trans zzso also appears to be regulated by zzso Additionally, our results suggest that zzso controls the transport of zzso from the trans zzso to zzso compartments that zzso in zzso zzso That zzso is involved in the transport of certain proteins from trans zzso to zzso is suggested by the evidence that certain proteins being targeted to the plasma membrane are first transported from trans zzso to zzso zzso
