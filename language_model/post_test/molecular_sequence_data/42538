The zzso zzso is one of the most frequent zzso abnormalities in acute zzso zzso and results in gene fusion between zzso on zzso 21 and zzso zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso contains a region of sequence zzso to the zzso zzso gene and the mouse zzso zzso binding protein zzso alpha zzso The zzso occurs within a specific zzso of the zzso gene and results in the formation of a zzso protein with the consistent feature that the region of sequence zzso of zzso is fused with almost the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be a zzso zzso factor from its sequence with zzso motifs and zzso zzso Thus the zzso is a fusion between two probable zzso zzso zzso
