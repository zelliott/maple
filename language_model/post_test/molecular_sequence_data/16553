The zzso zzso involving the zzso heavy chain locus and the zzso gene is the single most common zzso zzso in human zzso Recently we reported in zzso and in zzso chemical probing data indicating that the zzso major zzso region zzso which contains three breakage zzso zzso zzso as zzso I, II, and zzso has zzso character and hence a non-B DNA zzso Although we could document the non-B DNA structure formation at the zzso zzso the structural studies were limited to chemical zzso zzso in the present study, we used multiple methods including circular zzso to detect the non-B DNA at the zzso zzso We established a new gel shift method to detect the altered structure at neutral pH on shorter DNA fragments containing the zzso zzso and analyzed the fine structural zzso We found that the zzso region in the non-B DNA structure observed is stable for days and is zzso with respect to the Watson and zzso zzso It could be detected by zzso zzso a zzso modification zzso or a zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that two different non-B zzso exist at peak I in addition to the single one observed at peak zzso Finally we used zzso and base analogue incorporation to show that the non-B DNA structure formation requires zzso zzso These findings place major constraints on the location and nature of the non-B zzso assumed at zzso I and III of the zzso zzso
