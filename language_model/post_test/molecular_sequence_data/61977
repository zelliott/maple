The zzso zzso exerts a plethora of zzso activities critical in the zzso of systemic inflammatory zzso Recently, we reported on a zzso zzso zzso as a potent zzso for the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso Addressing the molecular mechanism accounting for zzso zzso antagonism by zzso zzso we found that a positively charged zzso acid at position 69 is zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso charged zzso acids switched the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso zzso zzso has recently been found to provide high affinity binding sites for zzso and its zzso form, zzso A zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids at positions zzso were deleted, zzso blocked zzso and zzso binding to zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso analog zzso zzso inhibited binding of the two zzso to zzso but not to zzso suggesting that the zzso core segment is important for high affinity binding to zzso Both receptors are zzso on human zzso and the human mast cell line zzso however, zzso expression on zzso is weaker as compared with zzso cells and highly zzso In contrast, no zzso expression was found on human zzso zzso is the first zzso that blocks zzso and zzso binding to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso making it a valuable tool for studying zzso functions and for blocking the biological activities of zzso and zzso in mice and zzso
