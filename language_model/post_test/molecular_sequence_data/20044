zzso zzso of zzso interactions are strongly affected by the zzso evolutionary potential, which in turn depends on population sizes as well as levels of zzso zzso and gene zzso Under similar selection pressures, the opponent with the higher evolutionary rate is expected to lead the zzso arms race and to develop local zzso Here, we use zzso DNA sequence data and zzso markers to assess the amount of genetic zzso and levels of gene flow in two zzso systems, each consisting of an zzso social zzso European zzso zzso zzso and the North American zzso zzso zzso its two main host zzso Our population genetic analyses revealed limited gene flow between individual populations of both host and zzso species, allowing for a geographic mosaic of zzso In a zzso comparison, we found less genetic zzso and more pronounced structure in Europe, where previous zzso studies demonstrated strong local zzso Within the European zzso system, the larger host species zzso zzso exhibited higher levels of both genetic zzso and gene flow, and previous field data showed that it is less affected by the social zzso zzso zzso than the smaller host zzso zzso which has genetically depleted and isolated zzso In North America, the zzso zzso zzso showed higher levels of gene flow between sites, but overall less genetic diversity than its zzso main host species, zzso zzso Interestingly, recent ecological and chemical studies demonstrated adaptation of zzso zzso to local host zzso indicating the importance of migration in zzso zzso
