zzso are zzso zzso plant proteins whose expression is zzso under conditions of zzso and cold zzso Their molecular function in ensuring plant survival is not yet known, but several studies suggest their involvement in membrane zzso The zzso are characterized by a broad repertoire of zzso and repetitive zzso out of which the zzso zzso has been implicated in membrane zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of these zzso we examined the interaction between zzso zzso and a zzso with a basic functional sequence zzso zzso zzso only zzso Our results show that zzso interacts zzso with zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a stronger binding to zzso with high negative surface zzso The membrane interaction lowers the temperature of the main zzso phase transition, consistent with zzso proposed role in cold zzso Moreover, the membrane binding promotes the assembly of zzso zzso into large and easily distinguishable zzso Using these zzso as binding zzso we identify three factors that regulate the zzso interaction of zzso in zzso zzso a pH dependent His zzso switch, zzso zzso by protein zzso C, and zzso reversal of membrane binding by zzso zzso
