In this study, we identified a novel zzso zzso of zzso heat shock zzso protein zzso while screening zzso expressed molecules in rat brain after chronic zzso zzso This zzso named zzso lacked 470 zzso of zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that zzso lacked the entire zzso 7 and zzso 8 of the zzso zzso zzso treatment with antidepressant, zzso or zzso induced a zzso or zzso increase in zzso levels in rat frontal cortex, respectively, when compared to zzso Western zzso analysis also revealed that the protein expression of zzso was increased after zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso may be one of the common molecules induced after chronic zzso zzso
