The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso factor required for establishment of a subset of zzso zzso the abdominal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with its role in development, during zzso zzso is expressed in each abdominal segment and in the zzso zzso Late in embryonic development, expression is refined to the abdominal zzso and zzso zzso zzso ring cells zzso When zzso expressed in zzso disc cells, zzso causes programmed cell death and loss of corresponding adult zzso zzso zzso expression is required for development of one set of zzso cells and is incompatible with development of another, emphasizing the specificity of zzso and the sensitivity of different target cells to its zzso zzso zzso in zzso affect zzso or zzso zzso acids in the zzso and zzso demonstrating the importance of these zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso
