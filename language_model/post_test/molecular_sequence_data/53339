The calcium channel zzso zzso was originally cloned from zzso zzso A new zzso zzso was recently identified in rat zzso of zzso and in human kidney by the zzso chain zzso The same zzso of zzso was detected in rat and guinea pig heart by amplifying indicative zzso fragments and by zzso using zzso zzso The apparent molecular size of cardiac zzso was determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells, this is smaller by 28 zzso The distribution of zzso in cardiac muscle cells of the conducting system and in the zzso cell line zzso was compared to the distribution of zzso a marker of neuroendocrine cells, and to the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso In serial sections from zzso and zzso regions of rat heart, zzso of zzso with zzso was detected in atrium and with zzso zzso in zzso fibers of the conducting system in both rat atrium and zzso The kidney is another organ in which zzso zzso hormones are zzso The detection of zzso in the zzso zzso of human zzso where zzso is stored and zzso led to the conclusion that the expression of zzso in rat heart and human kidney is linked to regions with zzso functions and therefore is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso hormones such as zzso and zzso
