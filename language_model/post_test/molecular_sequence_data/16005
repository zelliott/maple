To characterize zzso interactions involved in the initiation of zzso transfer replication we isolated and dissected the transfer origins zzso of the zzso zzso plasmids zzso and zzso Essential features of zzso are zzso zzso sequence repeats, the zzso site and a pair of potential promoter sites that allow for divergent zzso of two zzso zzso The relaxation zzso and the end of a 19 zzso zzso repeat are zzso by eight zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso is modified by an zzso zzso and the zzso is accessible to extension by DNA zzso zzso Transfer gene products essential for the formation of the initiation complex zzso of zzso DNA synthesis map adjacent to zzso Two of these products, zzso and zzso zzso specificity to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the only components of the zzso and zzso transfer machinery which cannot be zzso zzso and at least two additional zzso products are necessary for specific zzso The zzso zzso protein of zzso possesses zzso zzso The recognition sequence contains a zzso sequence located within the right arm of the 19 zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding site and the zzso site are located on one side of the DNA double zzso We zzso that this zzso structure is the initial complex in the zzso to the assembly of functional zzso
