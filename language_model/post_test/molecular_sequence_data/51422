zzso changes of the zzso zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso were analyzed over a range starting from cell zzso to 13 days after zzso during which time cells formed a zzso zzso It was found that the 40 zzso protein on zzso gel zzso remarkably increased in the zzso layer at about 9 days after cell zzso just before zzso This protein was highly zzso and was found to contain high amounts of zzso acid, zzso and zzso An internal zzso acid sequence of this protein was revealed to be zzso which showed zzso with the sequence of the zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso zzso and rich in zzso This protein zzso with collagen in gel zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, it showed high affinity to type I zzso
