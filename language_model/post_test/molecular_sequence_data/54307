zzso zzso the zzso agent of anthrax, is responsible for a serious and often fatal disease of zzso livestock and humans and is an important biological warfare zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a hot spring in western Himalayas and zzso zzso targeting zzso gene identified the strain as zzso zzso within zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso analysis of the partial zzso sequence from strain zzso indicated a close affiliation with zzso zzso and a few recently isolated strains of zzso zzso zzso strain Al Hakam and zzso zzso zzso analysis of two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded similar zzso This observation is further substantiated by zzso reconstruction using zzso sequences zzso zzso of the three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso features indicated a zzso affiliation for the strain zzso A novel strategy to distinguish among strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on whole zzso comparison was developed and tested for the identification of this environmental zzso zzso comparison was used to establish the identity of this unknown environmental zzso Group of replicate zzso gels for whole cell zzso were generated for each of the three species and strain zzso zzso spots unique to each group and those showing match between the groups, in a zzso comparison, indicated strain zzso as a member of zzso zzso This strategy can be used to assign strains of zzso zzso group to their respective zzso
