The availability of nitrogen is a limiting factor for plant growth in most zzso zzso and its degradation derivatives are a group of soil zzso nitrogen compounds that play an essential role in the zzso zzso zzso and storage of nitrogen in zzso zzso is a key zzso for zzso and degradation of these zzso zzso Here, we describe the isolation of two functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and black locust zzso zzso The proteins zzso by those genes were predicted to have a signal zzso for the zzso pathway, which is consistent with earlier zzso work that localized zzso activity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Their functions were confirmed by genetic zzso of a zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso The absence of nitrogen in the medium increased the expression of the zzso In zzso the addition of zzso to the medium as a sole source of nitrogen resulted in the zzso of the zzso zzso The black locust gene zzso was zzso regulated in zzso zzso and zzso during seed zzso and zzso growth, but was not expressed in root zzso In the trunk wood of a mature black locust tree, the zzso gene was highly expressed in the zzso region, but had no zzso expression in the zzso or zzso transition zzso In addition, the gene expression in the zzso region was zzso in spring and fall when compared with summer, suggesting its involvement in nitrogen zzso
