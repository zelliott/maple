zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso and its gene zzso in many animal, plant, and zzso zzso However, much less information is available on this zzso in zzso As a first step in investigating the zzso and molecular mechanisms by which zzso contributes to adaptations for flight zzso reproduction in insects, the zzso was zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding gene zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso interaction zzso the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso specific activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a single band on zzso PAGE zzso zzso but consisted of two zzso zzso acid sequences that differed in the first two zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited standard zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso molecular mass and zzso were similar to published values for zzso from a variety of zzso and two insect zzso zzso amplification of an internal sequence using zzso DNA followed by 3' and zzso zzso yielded a zzso sequence of the mature protein and translated zzso sequences that exhibited high similarity zzso and zzso zzso to sequences from insect and zzso zzso Two potential zzso start zzso were zzso Both zzso zzso sequences matched the zzso zzso consistent with both zzso forms being transcribed from the same zzso although these zzso could also be zzso by different zzso zzso analyses and differential zzso indicated that the majority, if not all, of the zzso is zzso The zzso exhibited high specific activity in fat body, head and gut, and a single band on native zzso
