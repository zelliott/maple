zzso was systematically modified by forming zzso bridges within the central region of the zzso to give zzso constrained zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso have been designed and zzso They are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso and zzso second zzso activities were determined by zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, using rat liver plasma zzso Most interestingly, zzso 1, 2, 3, and 4 were zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso 5 and 6 were partial zzso in the functional zzso All of the zzso zzso were found to have reduced binding zzso relative to zzso The structural features that might be responsible for these effects were studied using circular zzso zzso and molecular zzso These results demonstrated the significant zzso of both zzso binding affinity and zzso zzso zzso zzso that can accompany regional zzso constraints even in larger zzso zzso These studies suggest that the entire molecular zzso including the flexible middle portion, is important for molecular recognition and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso
