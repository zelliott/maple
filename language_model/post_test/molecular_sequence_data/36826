zzso zzso of zzso zzso a family of at least ten zzso proteins that can be grouped into three size zzso the large (about 1000 zzso intermediate zzso to 200 zzso and small (less than 100 zzso After zzso zzso proteins undergo a dramatic transformation to form a novel zzso zzso proteins accumulate in the central zzso of the zzso forming zzso complexes that appear as a network of smooth zzso and zzso beaded zzso When zzso protein complexes are zzso through the zzso zzso the fibers become oriented in parallel zzso when these parallel zzso of fibers emerge from the mouth of larvae they are an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene expression determines which zzso proteins are zzso thus, the composition of silk zzso At least two types of threads are zzso zzso silk is used to construct tubes for protective housing and assist with zzso zzso silk is used to construct tubes for zzso zzso zzso Variations in composition presumably contribute to different mechanical properties of zzso and zzso silk zzso Since the zzso physical properties of zzso silk most likely reflect the microscopic structure and interaction of zzso zzso it becomes important to learn the principles which govern zzso protein assembly at the molecular zzso Which zzso proteins interact and what are the sites used for zzso and zzso interactions during the assembly of this zzso All eight zzso proteins characterized thus far contain zzso repeated zzso sequences zzso from zzso zzso acids in zzso and/or a periodic distribution of zzso zzso These motifs appear to be zzso no other zzso has either the repeated zzso sequences or composite structure of zzso silk zzso The evolutionary conservation of motifs within repeats and among different zzso proteins suggests that the sequences and three-dimensional structures of the motifs may be important for assembly of zzso proteins into complexes, oriented zzso and silk zzso Further study of zzso protein assembly will bring us closer to understanding how this silk assembles in zzso By learning principles that nature employs to construct such a novel composite zzso it may become feasible to design and produce new classes of fibers or zzso materials with distinctive properties that are currently zzso
