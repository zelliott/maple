The sequence zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso genes of zzso coli was zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso shock protein zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso transcribed region are two open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso zzso oriented with respect to zzso These two zzso together with the adjacent zzso zzso may constitute a novel zzso zzso The zzso zzso region contains a complex zzso mosaic element, zzso The structure of this zzso element, which belongs to the zzso family, is zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso where Y and zzso are zzso units and the central 16 bases contain an L motif with an zzso consensus zzso DNA fragments containing the L motif of the zzso zzso element effectively bind integration host factor zzso while the Y zzso unit zzso of the same zzso element binds DNA zzso zzso Computer prediction of the zzso zzso secondary structure suggested that the transcribed zzso structures formed by the zzso region of the zzso transcript containing the zzso element can stabilize and protect zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso levels showed that transcripts with an intact zzso element are much more abundant than those truncated at the 3' end by deletion of either the entire zzso element or a single zzso sequence zzso Thus, the zzso zzso region containing the zzso element has an important role in the stabilization of the zzso zzso
