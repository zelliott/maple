To assess the relationship of the variation of zzso 20 of zzso zzso zzso gene to the zzso metabolism and fat distribution of the children with zzso 

zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso and zzso gel zzso were used to analyze the variation of zzso 20 of the zzso gene of the obesity zzso obesity zzso and the control zzso healthy zzso At the same time, all zzso serum zzso zzso density zzso zzso low density zzso zzso height and weight were measured, and their body mass zzso and fat zzso were zzso 

Three zzso of zzso 20 of zzso gene were detected in this zzso Compared with the control, the frequency of gene variation at zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The concentration of serum zzso and the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso obesity children were higher than those of the zzso zzso zzso but the level of serum HDL of the zzso children were lower than that of the zzso children zzso As to the zzso zzso children, only their serum zzso level was higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso 

The above findings indicated there were zzso in the children with zzso and those zzso might remarkably affect their zzso metabolism and fat zzso
