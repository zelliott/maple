We have previously shown that the zzso gene zzso zzso the alpha zzso of F1 zzso zzso is associated with DNA zzso and zzso transcript patterns in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we present a detailed characterization of this gene from both the normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to determine if it is involved in zzso zzso male zzso The normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso are virtually identical for zzso zzso including a zzso zzso open reading frame whose product is approximately zzso identical to other plant zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3' to the zzso coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso is located within a repeated sequence that has been associated with other zzso events in zzso zzso The previously identified transcript difference results from zzso originating upstream of this zzso zzso Although the presence of this transcript is affected by nuclear background, analyses in several different sterile and fertile nuclear backgrounds indicate that the presence of this transcript is not strictly correlated with male zzso In addition, normal levels of zzso zzso are present in sterile plants containing the zzso zzso
