The alternative, zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by traces of zzso in the zzso zzso carrying zzso located downstream of zzso copy II were able to express the alternative zzso even in the presence of high zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso of this region revealed six open reading zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso The gene products of zzso and zzso are zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso coli and represent an integral membrane protein and an zzso protein typical of zzso transport systems, zzso zzso and zzso exhibited no zzso to known zzso but a leader zzso characteristic of proteins zzso during export to the zzso is present in zzso indicating that zzso might be a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins showed a high degree of zzso acid sequence zzso to each zzso Both proteins contained a tandem repeat of a domain encompassing 70 zzso acid zzso which had significant sequence similarity to zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso Compared with that for the parental zzso deletion strain, the zzso zzso necessary to repress the alternative zzso were increased zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso was observed for zzso zzso double zzso The zzso of zzso by mod and mop zzso was estimated by measuring the activity of the conventional zzso zzso zzso transport was not affected in a zzso zzso double zzso whereas strains carrying zzso in the zzso transport system were impaired in zzso zzso
