A new member of the zzso protein zzso C zzso family, designated zzso is identified in this zzso The gene contains no zzso and is zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding region is zzso with respect to the zzso open reading frame, resulting in expression of an zzso regulatory domain without associated zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected in various mouse zzso and an zzso 45 zzso protein is present in zzso cell zzso zzso is shown to interact with the zzso protein and functions in the development of cell zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso and are maintained in a zzso state zzso by the absence of tight junctions and cell zzso zzso cells zzso a zzso zzso recruit zzso and other tight junction markers to zzso boundaries and adopt a zzso zzso in the presence of growth zzso The data demonstrate a regulatory role for zzso in the maintenance of cell transformation and the development of cell zzso
