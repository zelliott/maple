Analysis was made of the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Northern blots using a zzso zzso as a probe indicated that the amount of zzso corresponding to the zzso gene increased when expression was induced by starch or zzso The promoter region of the zzso gene was fused to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso indicating that the zzso gene was regulated at the level of zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso upstream of the zzso coding region was zzso A comparison of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso promoter with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed two regions with similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of these zzso regions indicated that both are essential for direct high-level expression when grown on zzso
