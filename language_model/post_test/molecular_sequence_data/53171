Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso were studied for zzso activity and for the presence of zzso associated with zzso zzso Each gene was cloned and expressed in a zzso knockout zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso growth on a zzso zzso and bacterial zzso exhibited zzso zzso This zzso displayed a zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso by the zzso than zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso less zzso was required to block zzso as the 50% zzso concentration zzso the zzso activity of this zzso When the zzso genes of several zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso were zzso two zzso zzso were zzso One zzso occurred at zzso 53, substituting an zzso for a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and a second zzso occurred in zzso 55, substituting an zzso for a zzso zzso zzso Transformation of the zzso knockout with plasmids carrying either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso did not substantially alter the zzso activity compared to levels produced by zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso However, both zzso increased zzso resistance, with zzso having the greatest affect on zzso resistance by increasing the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These results prove that the zzso of zzso zzso encodes a functional zzso and that zzso within this gene are associated with the development of zzso resistance in clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso created with zzso zzso zzso did not zzso growth on the zzso knockout strain, and DNA sequences of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso indicating that this gene does not zzso a functional zzso and is not involved in zzso resistance in zzso zzso
