The crystal structure of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso complex is described at zzso A zzso Core zzso resembles zzso A, and recognizes the zzso zzso complex through zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of core zzso forms the downstream surface of the zzso complex, where it could fix the zzso start zzso The remaining surfaces of zzso and the zzso can interact with zzso factors, other class II initiation factors, and zzso zzso and zzso
