zzso is a common site of zzso integration in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that integration at zzso occurs in a zzso island approximately 6 zzso upstream from a novel gene zzso zzso with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso result in increased expression of the zzso protein on the cell zzso The human zzso zzso was also cloned and mapped to zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso were detected at the zzso and protein level in both human and zzso indicating that zzso expression is zzso Some of the zzso are shown to likely represent zzso soluble forms of the protein produced by zzso incorporation or by zzso zzso In the zzso highest zzso expression occurs in liver and zzso with lower expression in kidney and zzso In humans, zzso is expressed at high levels in the zzso with moderate levels in the liver, brain, and zzso Within zzso cells, zzso expression is zzso Northern and Western analysis showed that zzso is expressed in selected zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso expression is tightly regulated during zzso zzso zzso these studies identify a new member of the zzso zzso family whose increased and zzso expression may lead to zzso leukemia by altering zzso normal ability to control the growth and/or differentiation of zzso zzso
