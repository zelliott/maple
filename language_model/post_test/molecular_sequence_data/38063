Members of the zzso family of zzso zzso factors have critical roles in a variety of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for proliferation and differentiation of several zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso activate cardiac and zzso gene expression zzso Two zzso zzso have recently been zzso zzso of zzso zzso interacts with zzso and is expressed principally in zzso zzso whereas zzso is expressed predominantly in heart and zzso Although gene targeting experiments are consistent with an essential role for zzso as an zzso of zzso function, reporter zzso in zzso cells indicate that zzso and zzso can act as zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso of zzso that is structurally most similar to zzso but is expressed predominantly in heart and brain, as well as the zzso blood island and adult zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso proteins can act as zzso in zzso in part through interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate the differentiation of red blood cells by modulating expression and activity of zzso and zzso We propose that the zzso proteins participate in the switch from zzso proliferation to red blood cell maturation and zzso
