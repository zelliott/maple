All zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso via a simple zzso zzso This is in contrast to the zzso and most zzso bacteria, which use the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso consisting of multiple copies of three component zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Until now no zzso activity has been found in the zzso although zzso has been discovered in the extremely zzso zzso and its gene sequence has been zzso In this paper, the discovery and sequencing of an zzso containing the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso gene are 3 zzso which show highest sequence identities with the zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso predictions of the proposed protein product of the zzso gene show a domain structure characteristic of the zzso component in zzso and zzso important zzso including the zzso to which the zzso acid zzso is zzso bound, are zzso Northern analyses indicate the zzso of the whole zzso but no zzso zzso activity could be detected in cell zzso The presence in the zzso gene of an zzso zzso to approximately 100 zzso not found in bacterial or zzso zzso zzso might be predicted to prevent zzso complex zzso This is the first detailed report of the genes for a putative zzso zzso complex in the zzso and the evolutionary and zzso consequences of these findings are zzso
