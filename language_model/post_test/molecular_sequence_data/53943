A novel zzso zzso inhibitor has been zzso to zzso from the skeletal muscle of white zzso zzso zzso The zzso was carried out by ammonium zzso zzso zzso heating treatment followed by column zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso The molecular mass of the inhibitor was 55 zzso as estimated by zzso and gel zzso It specifically inhibited a zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the skeletal muscle of zzso fish zzso zzso No zzso however, was detected toward other zzso zzso such as bovine zzso bovine zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from carp zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the sequences of zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso revealed high identity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity, suggesting the inhibitor is a protein closely related to zzso When rabbit muscle zzso was investigated, it also specifically suppressed the activity of zzso It thus strongly suggests that zzso is actually zzso and conversely, zzso is a specific inhibitor toward zzso zzso zzso
