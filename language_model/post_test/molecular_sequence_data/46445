The zzso zzso was originally discovered in zzso plant pathogens and was subsequently also found in a few other zzso zzso Using a secondary zzso zzso we have searched publicly accessible sequence databases for new examples of type III zzso zzso The more than 60,000 entries fulfilling the zzso were filtered with respect to folding and stability parameters that were zzso zzso This resulted in a set of zzso unique zzso of which 124 represent database entries of known zzso zzso from zzso plant pathogens and zzso zzso The remainder are 160 novel zzso candidates in 50 different zzso zzso With a few exceptions, the zzso were found either in repetitive DNA sequences or in zzso of protein coding zzso Our data, which is complementary to a study by De la zzso and zzso in 2010, indicate that the zzso is the most abundant small zzso zzso which, in view of no sequence conservation beyond the essential zzso likely has evolved independently in different zzso
