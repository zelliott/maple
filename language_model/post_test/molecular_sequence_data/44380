zzso zzso strains associated with zzso zzso are often zzso due to the copious production of zzso an zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression is zzso controlled by a gene cluster at 68 zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso alternative zzso factor zzso that zzso its own promoter zzso as well as the promoters of zzso zzso and zzso The other genes in the zzso cluster appear to regulate the expression or activity of zzso The goal of this study was to better understand the functional interactions between zzso and its zzso regulators during zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was made to zzso zzso zzso high zzso promoter zzso through increasing zzso in the cell by introducing a zzso clone containing zzso from zzso strain zzso However, the bacterial cells remained zzso if the zzso coupled zzso on the clone remained zzso This suggested that a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso may be required to control zzso factor zzso When the zzso and zzso initiation of zzso were measured with zzso zzso zzso production correlated with only about a zzso to zzso increase in zzso activity, zzso An zzso zzso fusion showed a zzso increase in zzso with zzso production under the same zzso A Western zzso analysis of total cell extracts showed that zzso was approximately zzso higher in strains that zzso zzso even though zzso expression increased less than zzso This suggested that a zzso mechanism may exist to destabilize zzso in order to control certain zzso promoters like zzso By Western zzso and zzso fusion zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was found to zzso to the zzso of the zzso Similar experiments suggest that zzso zzso to the inner membrane via one zzso domain with zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso These data were used to propose a model in which zzso interact via an inner membrane complex that controls the stability of zzso protein in order to control zzso zzso
