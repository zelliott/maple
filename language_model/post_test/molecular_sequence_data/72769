zzso elements in the chicken zzso promoter were tested for their ability to direct responses of reporter genes to metal zzso and zzso stress in zzso mouse cells and in transgenic zzso In addition, protein interactions with the promoter were analyzed by the zzso mobility shift zzso In transient zzso zzso and in transgenic mice, zzso of the chicken zzso promoter was sufficient to direct responses to zzso This promoter region also directed response to zzso stress in zzso cells and transgenic mice, but in transgenic mice, zzso responsiveness to zzso stress apparently involved other elements in the zzso promoter region zzso The zzso zzso of the promoter contains sequences zzso to a metal response element zzso zzso binding sites zzso and zzso and an zzso response element zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that metal response element binding activity was low in control zzso cell nuclear zzso but was induced zzso after 45 zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binding remained zzso and no evidence for specific binding to the core zzso response element consensus sequence was zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso elements zzso induction of zzso gene expression by metals and zzso stress are present in the chicken zzso promoter and suggest a role for increased binding of the zzso factor zzso to the metal response zzso
