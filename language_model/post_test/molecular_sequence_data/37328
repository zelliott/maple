zzso one of the major proteins on synaptic zzso is zzso expressed throughout the zzso zzso and zzso I, another synaptic zzso zzso are also expressed by zzso zzso zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells is sufficient to activate zzso of the zzso and zzso I zzso indicating that zzso differentiation and impairment of zzso zzso results in a similar gene expression zzso The zzso factor zzso a zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso has been shown to function via recruitment of zzso zzso to the zzso unit, indicating that zzso of the zzso structure via zzso zzso is of major importance for zzso function and zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso has been shown to be the major regulator of zzso expression of zzso zzso Here, we have identified a functional binding site for zzso in the first zzso of the human zzso gene indicating that zzso blocks human zzso gene zzso through an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter is, however, devoid of zzso genetic elements and directs zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso approach we have identified the zzso factor zzso as one of the regulators responsible for zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso
