Two zzso zzso were zzso from the sea cucumber zzso zzso by affinity zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso Their molecular masses were estimated to be zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso as well as human A, B, and zzso zzso but zzso zzso only rabbit zzso zzso by zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, only zzso zzso and zzso gave weak zzso of zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso may have high specificity for particular complex zzso on the surface of rabbit zzso zzso was activated at ten times lower zzso concentration than zzso Both zzso lost activity in zzso zzso while zzso appeared more stable down to pH zzso
