We have identified a zzso factor specifically expressed in the developing zzso zzso We named this gene zzso because of the high degree of sequence similarity to the recently described zzso Both in the human and mouse zzso zzso is localized in the vicinity of the zzso zzso This mapping assignment, together with the previously reported zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso indicates that the zzso and the zzso genes may be organized in zzso zzso has a remarkable expression domain confined to the zzso portion of the prospective neural zzso in zzso human, and zzso The zzso of either the zzso zzso or the human zzso in zzso zzso leads to an zzso eye zzso and, in particular, determines a zzso effect on the developing zzso The expression domain of the zzso factor zzso normally confined to the zzso developing zzso extends to the zzso region of the zzso after zzso of zzso On the other hand, the expression of zzso a molecular marker of the zzso zzso is strongly zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso a striking expansion of the zzso zzso a structure zzso from the zzso region of the eye zzso Altogether, these data indicate that zzso plays a crucial role in eye development and, in particular, in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
