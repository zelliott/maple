Several zzso zzso molecules were constructed as potential zzso for zzso P zzso P) and for zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Construction was affected by the T4 zzso zzso zzso of a mature zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso P and zzso zzso were both found to cleave the zzso zzso precursor model constructed from zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a reaction that was dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso or on some zzso imposed by the presence of this zzso the product had the same mobility as authentic zzso coli zzso on a zzso zzso By utilizing zzso precursor models zzso at zzso immediately preceding or following the putative site of processing, zzso of the zzso by both zzso zzso and the zzso was demonstrated to occur at the expected zzso zzso zzso The results obtained here suggest that the zzso separation of two zzso by zzso P is dependent on one or more structural features in the zzso of the zzso and thus are consistent with the report of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Altman, zzso zzso Science zzso zzso that identifies the T stem and loop as a possible recognition zzso
