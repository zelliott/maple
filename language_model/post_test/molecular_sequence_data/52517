zzso zzso drugs inhibit zzso bone zzso and also growth of zzso of zzso zzso apparently by interaction with the same zzso zzso Identification of the target in zzso therefore could also identify the target in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso inhibited conversion of zzso into zzso by cultures of zzso zzso One of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appeared to be the target for this zzso because conversion of zzso into zzso the immediate precursor for zzso zzso was inhibited in extracts of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso when the extract had been prepared from zzso of strains selected for having partial resistance to the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the values of zzso were increased to 700 zzso for zzso zzso zzso or 130 zzso for zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso was inhibited significantly by zzso or zzso but both of these zzso drugs, and all others tested, inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso strains of zzso indicated that there had been no changes in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso in the zzso zzso However, both zzso strains zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso is the zzso target for the zzso zzso
