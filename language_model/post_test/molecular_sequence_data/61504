zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso class II genes expression is an important field in zzso because these molecules play a crucial role in the function of the immune zzso zzso zzso genes expression is a complex phenomenon regulated at both zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso mechanisms accounting for zzso length zzso of zzso zzso We have first zzso the zzso DNA zzso the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified two competing zzso sites: a unique zzso donor site zzso located 20 zzso downstream from the stop zzso associated to two spliced zzso zzso approximately 165 and approximately 370 zzso zzso In addition, three zzso signals have been identified, respectively, at approximately zzso approximately zzso and approximately 855 zzso downstream from the stop zzso zzso we have analyzed zzso derived from zzso zzso in zzso B zzso cell lines by reverse zzso chain zzso We show that zzso length zzso of zzso zzso zzso results from a combination of differential zzso and alternative zzso Four zzso zzso zzso spliced zzso zzso at two distinct zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, and six zzso species (three spliced zzso zzso at two zzso zzso were generated by the other four zzso zzso advantages for cells to generate multiple transcripts previously zzso are zzso
