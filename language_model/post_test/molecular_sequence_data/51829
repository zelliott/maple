In the course of studies on local zzso zzso in the zzso of the adult zzso we have identified a new 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso zzso In mouse skin, this zzso pair is only expressed in zzso cells of adult mouse tail scale zzso which is characterized by the complete absence of a zzso layer and the formation of a remarkably compact stratum zzso A second site in which the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso pair is zzso expressed and whose zzso zzso to that of tail scale zzso is found in the zzso unit of the complex zzso zzso of mouse zzso The zzso relationship of the expression of the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso with this particular type of a zzso zzso zzso is emphasized by the suppression of the zzso synthesis of the two zzso during zzso acid zzso zzso conversion of tail scale zzso Apart from tail scale zzso and the zzso unit of the zzso zzso the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso pair is, however, also zzso with zzso alpha zzso in zzso cells of hair zzso and in zzso cells of the central core unit of the zzso zzso zzso The non zzso zzso of the two new zzso are rich in zzso and zzso zzso and lack the typical zzso into which zzso zzso of both types can be zzso This structural resemblance of the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso to zzso alpha zzso is supported by comparative flexibility predictions for their non zzso zzso zzso investigations then show that the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso pair has evolved together with hair zzso but has zzso from these during evolution to constitute an independent branch of a pair of zzso zzso In view of this exceptional position of the 65 zzso and 48 zzso zzso within the zzso zzso family, their expression has apparently been adopted by rare anatomical sites in which an zzso stratum zzso would be too soft and a hard zzso structure would be too rigid to meet the functional requirement of the respective zzso
