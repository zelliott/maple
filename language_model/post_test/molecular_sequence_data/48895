zzso the specificity of zzso enables prediction of their zzso and uncovering zzso functions in signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries are used to determine the zzso zzso In this study, a zzso method was developed to determine the specificity of zzso by taking the advantages of zzso zzso libraries and quantitative zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed by digesting proteins in total cell zzso followed with zzso of the resulting zzso After zzso the zzso libraries zzso zzso for in zzso zzso zzso stable zzso labeling based quantitative zzso was applied to distinguish the in zzso zzso generated by zzso By using the above approach, zzso zzso in zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso Those sites allowed the statistic determination of the zzso zzso In addition to the easy construction of the zzso zzso library, another significant advantage of this method over the method with zzso zzso libraries is that the identified zzso could be directly mapped to proteins for the screening of putative zzso zzso It was found that the confidence for zzso identification could be significantly improved by comparing the in zzso zzso sites with the in zzso sites identified by zzso analysis of the same cell zzso By applying this integrated strategy, 138 zzso from 105 putative zzso zzso of high confidence were zzso
