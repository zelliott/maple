We have determined the zzso sequence of gene zzso of zzso zzso which zzso resistant to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of zzso bases pairs corresponding to a protein with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso This value is in good agreement with that of zzso estimated by zzso gel zzso of a bacterial zzso coupled zzso zzso The zzso gene product exhibits zzso sequence zzso with the zzso resistance protein zzso of zzso The zzso are scattered throughout indicating that the two corresponding genes have zzso from a common zzso zzso from zzso is located an open reading frame that was partially zzso The deduced zzso sequence was 50% zzso to zzso alpha 1, a protein involved in the replication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso
