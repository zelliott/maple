zzso protection against a virulent challenge with zzso tuberculosis is induced mainly by previous zzso with living attenuated zzso and it has been hypothesized that zzso proteins serve as major targets in the specific immune zzso To identify and purify molecules present in culture medium zzso which are dominant zzso during effective zzso a zzso selection procedure was used to select zzso able to interact with T zzso and/or zzso induced by zzso with living bacteria and to zzso zzso interacting with the immune zzso induced by zzso with dead zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, present in zzso culture zzso has been previously identified and isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso recognize the very same zzso present in zzso tuberculosis culture medium zzso a project was undertaken to zzso zzso and sequence the corresponding gene of zzso zzso An zzso tuberculosis shuttle zzso library was transferred in zzso zzso and screened with a competitive zzso zzso zzso to detect the clones expressing the zzso A clone containing a zzso DNA insert was selected, and by means of zzso in zzso coli, a zzso zzso that coded for the molecules was zzso An open reading frame in the zzso sequence codes for a zzso protein with a consensus signal zzso of 39 zzso acids and a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The gene was referred to as zzso because of the high percentages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso total zzso DNA from zzso tuberculosis zzso strains zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso gene was present as a single copy on the zzso The zzso identity or zzso of the zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules and their similar global and deduced zzso acid compositions demonstrated the perfect correspondence between the molecular and chemical zzso The presence of a high percentage of zzso zzso was confirmed and explained the apparent higher molecular mass zzso zzso determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso resulting from the increased rigidity of molecules due to zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
