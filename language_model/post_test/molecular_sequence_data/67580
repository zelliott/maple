zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso isolated from zzso field zzso Although zzso is zzso close to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso it is unable to induce root zzso in zzso a zzso often used for testing zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is a single circular zzso zzso zzso in zzso with an average zzso content of zzso The zzso contains zzso potential zzso zzso one set of zzso zzso and 45 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure between zzso and zzso showed strong zzso however, the zzso islands present in zzso were absent in zzso whose zzso lacked a zzso gene cluster zzso for zzso regulation found in zzso A comparison of sequences around the zzso gene strongly suggested that zzso contains an zzso zzso that precedes the acquisition of a zzso island by horizontal gene zzso Although zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the organization, zzso and zzso of the genes in this cluster were more similar to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso than to those on the zzso island of zzso In addition, we found genes zzso a complete zzso system, many ABC zzso for zzso acids and zzso two types zzso and zzso of zzso multiple respiratory zzso and a system for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These features suggest that zzso is able to adapt to a wide range of zzso probably including zzso conditions, with multiple survival strategies in soil and zzso
