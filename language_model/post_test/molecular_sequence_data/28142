The zzso and zzso genes zzso the major outer membrane proteins of the zzso disease zzso zzso zzso The deduced translation products from the zzso and zzso genes were: zzso 273 zzso acids long with a molecular weight of zzso and zzso 296 zzso acids long with a molecular weight of zzso The two zzso proteins showed a great degree of sequence similarity indicating a recent evolutionary zzso zzso analysis and sequence comparison of zzso and zzso with other proteins revealed a sequence similarity to the signal peptides of zzso zzso These are the first sequences from zzso and provide interesting data on the evolutionary relationship between zzso and other species as well as providing potential for zzso zzso and zzso
