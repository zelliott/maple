The evolutionary zzso zzso complex controls zzso metabolism at multiple levels in zzso zzso zzso analysis of not zzso in zzso identifies a negative role in transcription, which is dependent on core promoter zzso To obtain direct support for this we targeted individual core zzso of the human zzso complex to promoters in transient zzso of human zzso In this experimental setup we found that the zzso and zzso zzso act as zzso of reporter gene zzso Interestingly, recruitment of other zzso zzso did not affect the reporter zzso The major repression function of zzso is localized in a specialized protein zzso the zzso This zzso motif is present in all zzso zzso and surprisingly also in zzso zzso zzso by the zzso was sensitive to treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso In addition, zzso of a zzso zzso enhanced zzso Our experiments show for the first time direct regulation of promoter activity by components of the zzso zzso
