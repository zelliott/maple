Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from bonito zzso zzso was obtained from liver, while the others were from zzso Their zzso acids were zzso as zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Their zzso zzso activities were measured for synthetic zzso The zzso of these peptides were estimated to be 82, 79, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were considered to be essential for their expression of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso was presumed to inhibit zzso after the removal of a zzso from zzso with zzso zzso zzso original proteins of these peptides are zzso
