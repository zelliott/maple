A soluble zzso binding zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the heart of Capra zzso Its metal independent nature, preferential affinity for zzso and zzso zzso with zzso recognition domain of previously reported zzso confirmed its inclusion in zzso zzso The secondary structures of the deduced zzso acid sequences were generally zzso with previously reported zzso Exposure of the zzso protein to varying temperature and zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso and zzso resulted in significant changes in zzso zzso fluorescence, CD zzso zzso and zzso zzso transform zzso zzso zzso thus strongly emphasizing the vitality of regular secondary structure of zzso for maintaining their active zzso zzso studies zzso the results obtained in wet zzso Our findings based on zzso properties, zzso zzso and structural analysis of the goat heart zzso suggests significant implications in potential biological and clinical zzso
