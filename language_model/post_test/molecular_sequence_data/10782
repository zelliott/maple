We report the zzso cloning and characterization of an zzso N from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso that binds zzso an zzso crystal protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso information derived from this zzso zzso zzso N was used for the cloning of an zzso N from the zzso zzso membrane of zzso zzso an insect species of which some populations acquired resistance against zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso was used to isolate a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso On zzso blots the zzso zzso protein discriminates between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Internal zzso acid sequences from the zzso protein were used for the design of zzso zzso From a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as template, a DNA zzso was obtained which shows similarity to zzso and zzso zzso N zzso This zzso zzso was used to screen zzso libraries of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso From the zzso zzso zzso zzso library a zzso zzso sequence was zzso The zzso of the sequence encodes a zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso The zzso zzso region zzso to a zzso signal sequence and the zzso zzso region is typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso library with zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled the isolation of a zzso sequence with an zzso zzso a zzso zzso This zzso N zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso and contains a zzso signal zzso for zzso anchor zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contain four zzso zzso which are highly zzso among zzso zzso N zzso Treatment of zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso C demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is attached to the insect cell membrane by a zzso zzso
