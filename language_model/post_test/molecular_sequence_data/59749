The zzso N zzso zzso has been used successfully for the zzso synthesis of a wide variety of zzso zzso However, when it is used to incorporate consecutive zzso zzso a zzso linkage can form between the two adjacent zzso zzso of unprotected zzso during the synthesis of peptides with multiple zzso zzso has been studied as a function of zzso conditions and the absence or presence of intervening zzso acid zzso The zzso side reaction is more severe with increased zzso times and/or repetitions of zzso and occurs only when the zzso zzso are directly adjacent to one zzso
