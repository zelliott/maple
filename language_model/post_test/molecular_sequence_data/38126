Based on the findings that two cellular proteins of 45 zzso zzso and 62 zzso zzso serve as the putative zzso molecules for binding of zzso zzso protein zzso to human zzso B zzso and zzso we examined whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso share the putative zzso proteins zzso and zzso In zzso zzso surface zzso zzso the zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso from clone zzso like the zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso from clone zzso was binding to zzso and zzso By affinity zzso zzso zzso formation of stable zzso and zzso complexes were confirmed, and the interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso is quite strong with a fast association rate and a slow zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso have the common putative cellular zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the binding of zzso to human zzso and zzso could be based on the interaction between zzso and zzso and zzso
