Three strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso which were isolated from human zzso zzso were subjected to a comprehensive range of zzso and zzso tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous zzso The strains were zzso and produced zzso and zzso acids in large zzso and zzso acid in moderate zzso as the end products of zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso protein sequence analyses revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the zzso zzso most closely related to zzso zzso but sharing only 8 % zzso zzso with the type strain of that zzso zzso a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate these zzso The DNA zzso content of the type strain is 70 zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
