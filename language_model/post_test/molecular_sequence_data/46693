We have identified and cloned a human nuclear protein that dramatically increases DNA binding of zzso factors that contain a basic zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso We show that this zzso enhancing factor zzso functions as a molecular zzso zzso stimulates DNA binding by recognizing the unfolded zzso zzso and promoting the folding of zzso zzso to zzso the elevated concentration of the zzso zzso then drives the DNA binding zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso by zzso proteins in zzso Our results reveal protein folding in the nucleus as a step at which zzso DNA binding proteins can be zzso
