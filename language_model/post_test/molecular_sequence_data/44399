Four zzso zzso showing zzso with a previously described zzso zzso locus zzso were identified and zzso By fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell hybrids, and zzso zzso the zzso members of this small family of sequences zzso all map in zzso while the Y members map in zzso These zzso contribute to the overall similarity of the two zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso contain an internal zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso display extensive length zzso in two of the zzso members as well as in the Y zzso In addition, common sequence zzso are found in the portions zzso the zzso in two of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that, during the evolution of this family, length variation on the Y zzso was accumulated at a rate not slower than that on the X zzso Finally, these sequences represent a model system with which to analyze human populations for similar zzso and zzso zzso
