To isolate and characterize bacteria to degrade zzso zzso 

We used enrichment culture to isolate and characterize bacterial strains based on the observation of zzso and zzso characters and analysis of zzso zzso gene zzso We determined the concentration of zzso zzso zzso of strain cells and cell surface zzso zzso in pure culture zzso 

We isolated a zzso able to effectively degrade zzso from zzso zzso of zzso plant and assigned it as strain zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene showed the similarity of zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso In pure culture with zzso as the sole carbon and energy source, zzso of zzso at initial concentration of 50 zzso zzso was zzso in 5 zzso Thin layer zzso (TLC) analysis of the culture extracts revealed presence of a zzso zzso and zzso analysis confirmed the retention time of the zzso zzso zzso corresponded with zzso acid zzso zzso The method of zzso adhering to hydrocarbon zzso was used to analyze strain zzso of the highest zzso of zzso 

The results showed that strain zzso belonged to zzso zzso which showed zzso and capacity to degrade zzso to zzso
