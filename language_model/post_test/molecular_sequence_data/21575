The three-dimensional structures of two zzso binding proteins zzso and one zzso protein zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were resolved zzso The results show that both zzso and zzso are classic zzso whereas zzso belongs to zzso zzso which are considered as the zzso zzso in this zzso The structural differences between the two zzso and between zzso and zzso are thoroughly zzso and the structural and functional significance of the divergent zzso regions zzso the prolonged zzso region in zzso and the additional pair of zzso in zzso are zzso The zzso analyses with zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicate that two zzso are specific to zzso whereas zzso which are more abundant than zzso and detected in both male and female zzso expresses zzso across different zzso also describe the zzso of the zzso zzso types in zzso zzso and compare them to 19 species of zzso zzso There are 11 types of zzso in the zzso and zzso segments of antennae in both male and female zzso Seven of them, including zzso zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two types of zzso wall pore zzso zzso and zzso and two types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso are zzso zzso In comparison to zzso specialists, the highly zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso possess more diverse zzso types which are likely related to their broad host ranges and complex life zzso Our zzso study demonstrated that each of the seven zzso zzso with at least one zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is specifically labeled in zzso whereas the zzso shows a broad spectrum of zzso toward four different zzso zzso SP, zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso is zzso toward SP, zzso and zzso Interestingly, a cross zzso pattern between zzso and zzso is documented for the first zzso Given that the numbers of zzso and zzso in many insect species greatly zzso their zzso zzso types, it is germane to suggest such phenomenon could be the rule rather than the zzso
