The present communication documents attempts to produce the mature form of human zzso protein B zzso by modification of the zzso and 3' regions of the zzso and expression of the truncated zzso after zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso end of a zzso for human zzso zzso base zzso was reconstructed through the zzso of synthetic zzso to an internal zzso site in the zzso zzso This construction coded for the initiation of protein synthesis at a Met zzso adjacent to a zzso for the zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso amounts of the 3' end of the human zzso zzso were deleted with zzso bean zzso and zzso zzso The resulting zzso 3' fragments were then zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso designed to create a stop zzso The modified zzso and 3' ends were zzso to a short zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso and inserted into the expression zzso zzso In zzso translation of sense zzso derived from the truncated zzso zzso yielded zzso of appropriate molecular zzso as indicated by zzso - sodium zzso zzso - zzso gel zzso of either intact or zzso reaction zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis for the zzso corresponding to the truncated zzso in appropriately transformed bacteria induced with the zzso analog zzso Western zzso analysis using rabbit zzso prepared against bovine zzso confirmed the presence of mature zzso in zzso extracts of transformed zzso coli, but the amounts were very zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
