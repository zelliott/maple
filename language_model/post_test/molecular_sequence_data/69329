The zzso zzso protein gene consists of four zzso that code for a major zzso protein of rat zzso zzso Analysis of its potential zzso zzso regulatory elements revealed that a large zzso 1 region zzso had stronger zzso response element zzso activity than did the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso and its most active zzso zzso functioned as zzso but not zzso response elements zzso zzso several zzso partial zzso sequences are present in zzso and it bound both zzso receptors and zzso receptors in mobility shift zzso A cluster of three zzso sequences contained within a zzso pair sequence of zzso had both ARE and zzso activities when analyzed as an isolated zzso suggesting that other elements within zzso determined its ARE zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso contains putative response elements for the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso and direct zzso The ARE specificity of zzso observed in zzso cells was diminished in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso with an zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression zzso together with an zzso reporter zzso however, the ARE activity of zzso was greater than its zzso activity in these cell zzso Interestingly, a zzso pair zzso of zzso retained ARE specificity in all three cell zzso
