zzso box genes zzso putative zzso factors that play important roles in plant and animal zzso In plants, zzso box genes are involved in the early step of specifying floral zzso identity as well as the later step of determining the fate of floral organ zzso Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new zzso box gene from zzso designated zzso Although zzso zzso does not accumulate during zzso growth, it accumulates to high levels in the zzso zzso zzso as well as in the zzso stem and zzso zzso zzso zzso is excluded from the young flower zzso that arise on the zzso of the zzso zzso but later accumulates in the walls of the developing zzso The lack of zzso zzso in floral zzso is due in part to the action of another zzso box zzso zzso because zzso zzso does accumulate in zzso zzso flower zzso
