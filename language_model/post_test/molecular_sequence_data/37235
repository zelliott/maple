Several reports have described zzso zzso zzso producing more than one protein through alternative zzso initiation at multiple zzso zzso There are 2 such zzso in the zzso region of our recently cloned zzso gene where 2 open reading frames overlap by 34 zzso The deduced protein translated from the first zzso contains 33 zzso zzso lacks a signal zzso and has no obvious effects on the zzso zzso zzso We found that the second zzso is more effective as a zzso initiation site than the first zzso and yields a zzso protein of 182 zzso acids with the same activity as products made with full-length zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed that the longer zzso protein is produced by mature T zzso in zzso and zzso as well as by zzso zzso and zzso duct cells in healthy zzso Properties of zzso zzso were determined, revealing it to be a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the potential for zzso Although the longer zzso protein is structurally and characteristically related to type I zzso its production is uniquely regulated by translation as well as zzso
