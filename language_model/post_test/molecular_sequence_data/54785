Plant zzso are involved in plant defense and zzso In rice zzso zzso 14 genes zzso putative zzso have been isolated and zzso However, only limited information is available on the function of these zzso zzso In this study, we report a detailed functional characterization of one of these zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso carrying no zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in zzso leaf zzso and leaf zzso zzso using real-time zzso zzso analysis, and a zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter indicated that zzso was mainly expressed at the late zzso early zzso and middle zzso stages in the zzso To zzso the role of zzso we suppressed expression of the zzso gene by zzso interference in transgenic zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in male zzso The zzso mother cells appeared to be normal in zzso plants, but zzso degradation was disrupted around the zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso plants at the early zzso zzso zzso the release of the young zzso into the zzso zzso was delayed, and the zzso began to zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso is essential for timely zzso degradation in the process of zzso zzso
