zzso strain zzso was isolated from zzso roots of zzso zzso growing in its natural zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growing isolate was characterized by using a zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso However, zzso values in a zzso zzso analysis with closely related strains were between zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed a zzso type based on zzso with partial substitution of zzso acid by zzso zzso acid zzso The isolate contained zzso zzso and zzso as major respiratory zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as zzso fatty zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso and three unidentified zzso Based on its zzso and zzso traits, as well as zzso results, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
