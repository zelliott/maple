zzso represents a class of zzso agents with a zzso activity against various zzso infections, including malaria, zzso and zzso zzso In malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso electron transport at the level of the zzso zzso complex and collapses zzso membrane zzso In addition, this drug is unique in being selectively toxic to zzso zzso without affecting the host zzso zzso A better understanding of the structural basis for the selective toxicity of zzso could help in designing drugs against infections caused by zzso zzso To that end, we derived nine independent zzso malaria zzso lines by zzso treatment of mice infected with zzso zzso these zzso exhibited resistance to zzso collapse of zzso membrane potential as well as zzso of electron zzso The zzso were also resistant to the synergistic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso b gene placed these zzso into four categories, three with single zzso acid changes and one with two adjacent zzso acid zzso Of the 12 zzso changes seen in the nine independently derived zzso 11 replaced zzso zzso with zzso zzso possibly because of zzso oxygen species resulting from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid positions on the recently solved crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex revealed a discrete cavity in which subtle variations in zzso and volume of the zzso acid zzso may determine zzso zzso and thereby selective zzso These structural insights may prove useful in designing agents that selectively affect zzso zzso functions in a wide range of zzso zzso
