The zzso origin of DNA replication from human zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two binding sites for the zzso protein zzso both of which are required for DNA replication and which are separated by an zzso zzso We have tested the functional significance of the zzso spatial and sequence characteristics of this zzso element by constructing a series of zzso origin sequences and zzso their replication zzso Changes in the sequence composition of length of the zzso resulted in dramatic decreases in replication zzso Furthermore, in contrast to what has been observed for zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso of a complete zzso turn of DNA into the zzso also resulted in zzso of origin zzso These data suggest that the arrangement of zzso sites in zzso zzso is zzso constrained in terms of spacing and intervening zzso
