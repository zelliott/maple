zzso by the zzso zzso at a pair of zzso signal sequences creates two coding ends and two signal zzso The zzso proteins can integrate these signal ends, without sequence zzso into an unrelated target DNA zzso Here we demonstrate that such zzso events are greatly zzso zzso specifically targeted zzso and other distorted DNA zzso The mechanism of target selection by the zzso proteins thus appears to involve recognition of distorted zzso These data also suggest a novel mechanism for the formation of alternative zzso products termed hybrid zzso in which a signal end is joined to a hairpin coding zzso We suggest that hybrid zzso may arise by zzso in zzso and propose a new model to account for some zzso zzso zzso found in human zzso According to this model, zzso can join zzso zzso zzso to partner sites that lack zzso signal sequence elements but bear particular structural zzso The zzso proteins are capable of zzso all necessary breakage and joining events on both partner zzso thus, the zzso zzso may be far more zzso for zzso zzso than has been zzso
