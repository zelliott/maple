Among the proteins zzso by zzso zzso of zzso one protein is much more abundant than all zzso In zzso birds, and zzso this protein is zzso a zzso of identical zzso zzso In this study zzso zzso from zzso zzso and toads incubated in zzso were found to zzso and zzso one zzso zzso However, this consisted of one single zzso zzso zzso It was expressed throughout zzso zzso Part of its zzso acid sequence was determined and used for construction of zzso for zzso chain zzso The amplified DNA was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated and zzso The derived zzso acid sequence for the zzso protein was 183 zzso acids long, including a zzso acid zzso The calculated molecular weight of the mature protein was zzso zzso comparison with other proteins showed that the protein belonged to the zzso zzso Its expression was highest in zzso zzso much lower in other brain areas, and absent from zzso Since no zzso was detected in proteins zzso from zzso zzso zzso abundant synthesis and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso must have evolved only after the stage of the zzso
