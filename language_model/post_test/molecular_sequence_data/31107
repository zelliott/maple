The zzso acid zzso proteins are ubiquitous zzso of most zzso and zzso synaptic transmission in the zzso In July 1987 two reports appeared describing the molecular cloning of a pair of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and one zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These papers sparked wide interest and led quickly to the concept of a zzso zzso channel zzso that includes zzso zzso receptors as well as certain zzso acid zzso The identification of additional zzso of each zzso zzso with the recent cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso only the zzso zzso remains zzso Several disciplines have been brought to bear on these zzso zzso including in zzso zzso and functional expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In this review we compare cloning strategies that have been used for zzso acid receptors and discuss structural similarities among the zzso zzso Two findings that have arisen from molecular cloning and expression of these receptors receive special zzso First, the molecular zzso of zzso receptors is larger than expected from pharmacological studies of native zzso Second, although the native receptors are thought to be zzso much like the model proposed for the zzso zzso some individual zzso acid zzso zzso can form functional zzso channels, presumably in a zzso zzso This review zzso therefore, on what we have learned from cloning efforts about zzso acid receptors and what might lie ahead in this zzso
