zzso libraries are increasingly popular in protein engineering and other biomedical research zzso Statistics of the libraries are useful to guide and evaluate zzso library zzso Previous works only give the mean of the number of unique sequences in the library, and they can only handle equal zzso ratio of the four zzso at a small number of zzso zzso We derive formulas to calculate the mean and zzso of the number of unique sequences in libraries generated by cassette zzso with zzso of arbitrary zzso zzso Computer program was developed which zzso arbitrary zzso precision software package to calculate the statistics of large zzso The statistics of library with zzso in more than 20 zzso acids can be calculated zzso zzso show that the zzso ratios have significant effects on these zzso The more skewed the ratio, the larger the library size is needed to obtain the same expected number of unique zzso The program is freely available at zzso
