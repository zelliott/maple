The presence of zzso sequences specific for each of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso was zzso These sequences were applied for dot zzso zzso and for zzso for rapid DNA diagnosis of zzso zzso These sequences were found by molecular cloning of zzso fragments after zzso of DNA by zzso zzso The type zzso sequence was found around the zzso end of zzso zzso in the L region of type 1 DNA zzso to alpha gene 27, zzso zzso and the type zzso sequence was around the junction region of the L and S of type 2 DNA zzso to zzso zzso Both simple dot zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso employing these zzso zzso zzso were proven to be much more useful than zzso in terms of zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
