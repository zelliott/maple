Exposure to zzso radiation during childhood markedly increases the risk of developing zzso zzso zzso We examined zzso from 26 Ukrainian patients with zzso cancer who were younger than 10 years of age and living in contaminated areas during the time of the zzso nuclear reactor zzso We identified zzso zzso driver zzso in all 26 cases through candidate gene zzso and next-generation zzso zzso We found that 22 tumors zzso fusion zzso that arose primarily through zzso zzso Altogether, 23 of the zzso drivers identified in this cohort zzso activate zzso zzso including the 2 zzso zzso resulting in fusion of zzso factor zzso zzso 6 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso type 3 zzso and fusion of zzso zzso zzso with zzso Two other tumors zzso distinct zzso leading to zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso Fusion zzso were less prevalent in tumors from a cohort of children with pediatric zzso zzso that had not been exposed to radiation but were from the same geographical zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a paradigm of zzso driven by fusion zzso that activate zzso signaling or, less zzso a zzso zzso zzso
