The surface of the insect stages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is covered by abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso One type of zzso the zzso zzso is predicted to have zzso zzso zzso repeats in its zzso domain and is zzso by multiple zzso Because of the similarity of the zzso zzso sequences and the zzso of their zzso zzso it has been impossible to separate and characterize these zzso by standard protein zzso zzso To facilitate their structural and functional zzso we used a combination of zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso to analyze the entire zzso repertoire expressed on the zzso zzso This analysis, which required removal of the zzso anchors by zzso zzso acid treatment and zzso at zzso bonds by mild acid zzso provided precise information about the zzso state and the number of zzso repeats in these zzso Using this methodology we detected in a zzso zzso clone the zzso products of the zzso gene and two different products of the zzso gene zzso and zzso Furthermore, only low amounts of the zzso products of the zzso and zzso genes were zzso Because all zzso genes are transcribed zzso the latter finding indicates that the expression of the zzso and zzso genes is zzso zzso This is the first time that the whole zzso repertoire from zzso zzso has been characterized at the protein zzso
