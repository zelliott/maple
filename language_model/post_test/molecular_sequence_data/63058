The zzso coli zzso promoter zzso regulates the zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso that are required for de zzso synthesis of zzso a precursor for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso is subject to growth zzso control zzso Here we show that the zzso sequence located between positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso start site stimulates zzso from zzso approximately 8- to zzso and, in common with other UP zzso requires the zzso domain of the zzso zzso alpha zzso for zzso Like the zzso zzso UP element, the zzso UP element contains two independently acting zzso located at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso and can stimulate zzso when placed upstream of the zzso zzso We reveal a novel role for the zzso UP element by demonstrating that it is required for zzso The involvement of the UP element in zzso also requires the participation of sequences located at least 100 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso These sequences are required for zzso of zzso activity at lower growth zzso
