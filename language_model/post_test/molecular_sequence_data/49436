So far some nuclear receptors for zzso acids have been zzso However, no cell surface zzso for zzso acids has yet been zzso We found that a novel G zzso zzso zzso is responsive to zzso acids as a zzso zzso zzso acids specifically induced zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the increase of zzso zzso binding in membrane zzso and zzso zzso production in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing zzso Our quantitative analyses for zzso zzso showed that it was abundantly expressed in zzso in human and zzso Treatment with zzso acids was found to suppress the functions of rabbit zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso We prepared a zzso cell line expressing zzso by zzso a zzso zzso into zzso cells that did not express zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acids suppressed the zzso productions in the zzso cells expressing zzso whereas it did not influence those in the original zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is implicated in the suppression of zzso functions by zzso zzso
