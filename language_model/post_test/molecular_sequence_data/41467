zzso variation is an essential means of evolution and adaptation in many organisms in response to environmental zzso Certain DNA zzso can be carried out by zzso zzso zzso that fall into two families: the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are seldom found in zzso A gene zzso to a zzso zzso zzso has been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso The sequence is highly zzso among five other members of zzso 

The predicted open reading frame encodes for a zzso zzso protein containing a zzso domain including the putative zzso zzso zzso active site zzso zzso The zzso has the typical zzso bundle and potentially a mixed zzso domain resembling that of zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso during the zzso zzso zzso life zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso of DNA from zzso or synthetic origin were used to identify potential DNA targets after sequencing or zzso zzso Interestingly, the sequences captured also included highly variable zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with DNA were carried out to verify zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso were created in order to investigate the biological role of zzso 

Our data identify for the first time a malaria zzso gene with structural and functional features of zzso zzso may bind to and alter DNA, either in a sequence specific or in a zzso fashion, and may contribute to programmed or random DNA zzso zzso is the first molecular player identified with a potential role in zzso plasticity in this zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso is viable showing no zzso impact on blood stage development, which is compatible with such zzso
