zzso a zzso zzso functions in the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of the hypersensitive response from zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is remarkably similar to that of zzso of zzso species, the first member of a recently described protein zzso Other proteins of the family are zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso genes or cells of zzso coli containing the cloned zzso gene cluster with zzso zzso produce but do not export zzso When similar cells with functional zzso genes were grown at 25 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C, zzso was exported to the culture zzso zzso evidence that zzso is involved in the zzso of a zzso protein has been zzso Two other zzso of the zzso gene cluster are involved in the regulation of zzso and four other zzso also are involved in the zzso of zzso Since zzso and other proteins likely to be zzso by the zzso family of proteins lack typical signal zzso their zzso mechanism is distinct from the general protein export zzso
