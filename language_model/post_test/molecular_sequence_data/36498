zzso growth zzso zzso zzso can inhibit or zzso zzso zzso The biological activity of zzso is determined by many factors, including its abundance in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in human plasma are highly zzso They are increased after acute zzso and in diabetes, and are rapidly reversed by zzso and insulin treatment, zzso Similarly, zzso zzso is increased in the liver of severely diabetic and zzso rats and decreased after 4 days of insulin zzso zzso rapidly decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso The present study asks whether the increase in zzso zzso in diabetic rat liver reflects increased gene transcription, whether insulin decreases zzso zzso through a zzso or zzso zzso and whether this decrease is sufficiently rapid to account for the dynamic fluctuations in plasma zzso zzso were injected zzso with 100 zzso zzso and used 7 days later when they were zzso and failed to gain weight, but were not zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso greater in diabetic than control liver and decreased to the low levels in zzso controls within 1 h after insulin zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso greater in zzso from diabetic than control liver and decreased to low control levels by 1 h after insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso diabetic animals did not require restoration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso also were increased in the kidney of diabetic zzso zzso We propose that the dynamic regulation of zzso gene zzso in diabetes and after insulin treatment, by determining the availability of zzso in zzso and zzso may be a critical factor in the zzso of zzso zzso
