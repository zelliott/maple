A rare form of human zzso zzso containing the optional long zzso region, is produced as a zzso zzso zzso through a novel zzso zzso of two zzso zzso transcribed from zzso 1 and zzso To investigate its function, we express the zzso zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells and show that it can produce a larger zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 56 zzso on zzso in addition to the normal, zzso zzso zzso which is produced from the zzso zzso without the optional long zzso zzso To produce the zzso zzso zzso sequences located at both zzso 7 and 1 are zzso The zzso zzso can be recognized by specific zzso prepared against the predicted additional zzso acid sequence located upstream of the zzso of the zzso The translation initiation zzso for the zzso protein is zzso which encodes for zzso as deduced by zzso analysis and mass zzso Similar to the zzso zzso when expressed alone, the zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso and is zzso zzso The zzso zzso is present in native human cells, including human zzso zzso Our current results show that the function of the zzso zzso zzso is to increase the zzso zzso diversity by producing a novel zzso To our knowledge, our result provides the first zzso example that a zzso zzso produces a functional zzso
