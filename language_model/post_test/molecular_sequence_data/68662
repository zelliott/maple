The behavioral regulation of zzso factor function in zzso a brain region activated by novelty and important for information storage, has not been previously zzso Sixty zzso after a 4 zzso exploration of a novel space by adult zzso rats, zzso mobility shift zzso revealed a selective increase in specific binding to particular consensus recognition zzso For both zzso and zzso an upper and lower band were observed in the zzso mobility shift zzso The upper band showed increased binding restricted to the 60 zzso time point after exploration; no increase was observed 30 zzso or less, or 120 zzso or more after the novel zzso Increased binding to the lower of either zzso or zzso was observed at 30 and 120 zzso When the time of exploration was increased from 4 to 15 zzso no zzso in either the upper or lower band were observed in the zzso factor binding to either the zzso or the zzso zzso Since the animals ceased to explore the environment after 10 zzso the lack of binding may reflect behavioral zzso leading to zzso factor zzso We conclude that brief, zzso stimulation can activate brain zzso factors in a zzso fashion, suggesting zzso control of zzso zzso We propose that promoter elements of target genes critically involved in the storage of information are turned on by zzso zzso zzso
