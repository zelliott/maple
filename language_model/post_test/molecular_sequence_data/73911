The rat zzso transmitted zzso has been previously described as a minor zzso zzso composed of a zzso transmitted factor zzso and the zzso zzso class I zzso We compared the DNA sequences of the 13 zzso open reading frames from different rat strains and identified four coding zzso that correlated with this zzso We used synthetic zzso peptides spanning the zzso to sensitize appropriate target cells in zzso zzso and found that the zzso is derived from an internal region of zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso 6 17 zzso zzso zzso could sensitize zzso target cells at zzso zzso and, when present on such cells, could compete fully with the natural zzso in zzso competition zzso Comparing the zzso zzso with the known zzso requirements of zzso suggested two possible binding zzso placing either an internal or a zzso zzso in the F pocket of the zzso zzso Arguments favoring a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso bound into their zzso pockets, are zzso
