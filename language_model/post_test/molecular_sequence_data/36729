zzso zzso efficiently inhibit gene expression in zzso however, the successful therapeutic application of this technology in zzso will require the development of improved delivery zzso In this report we describe a technique that efficiently delivers zzso zzso into cells using molecular zzso This technique, which was initially developed for the delivery of zzso zzso is based on the construction of zzso complexes that are recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso led to the formation of 50- to zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso molecular complexes (3 zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells genetically modified to express both the zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso expression by zzso which was completely blocked by excess zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity with zzso zzso alone was observed at a 30 zzso zzso Furthermore, examination of the cells using indirect zzso for the presence of zzso protein showed zzso of cells exposed to the molecular zzso lacked any zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso alone showed a highly variable zzso pattern, and only a few of the cells were completely void of zzso zzso Together these data demonstrate that molecular zzso provide a highly specific and efficient system for the delivery of zzso zzso
