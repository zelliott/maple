The tad locus of zzso zzso encodes genes for the zzso of zzso zzso which allow the zzso to adhere tenaciously to surfaces and form strong zzso Although tad zzso zzso zzso are widespread among bacterial and zzso species, very little is known about the functions of the individual components of the zzso zzso zzso Here we characterize the mechanism by which the zzso zzso is processed to the mature zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is both necessary and sufficient for zzso maturation of zzso zzso was also found to be required for maturation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which we term zzso Using zzso zzso we show that processing of zzso zzso and zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso of a highly zzso zzso acid zzso at position zzso of zzso relative to the zzso site, resulted in a processed zzso that was blocked in zzso In contrast, identical zzso in zzso or zzso had no effect on zzso formation, indicating that the mechanisms by which zzso zzso and the zzso function are zzso We also determined that two zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso are critical for function of the zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso protein is a member of a novel zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso
