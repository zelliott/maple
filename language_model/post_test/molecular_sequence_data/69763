A DNA sequence coding for human muscle zzso has been constructed using 16 chemically zzso zzso The zzso long DNA sequence has been cloned in the zzso zzso coli expression zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso In both cases a high level of expression of zzso has been zzso The zzso proteins have been zzso to zzso and zzso in comparison with the natural zzso using zzso as a zzso and zzso as a competitive zzso The zzso zzso expressed in the two zzso maintain the kinetic properties of the natural zzso In addition, zzso analysis shows that the gross fold of the two zzso zzso is zzso
