A few zzso zzso are characterized by their ability to tightly bind a zinc zzso In the case of zzso coli zzso zzso a zzso of 21 zzso zzso having a stable 3-D structure in solution is responsible for zinc binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso which belongs to a region connecting the two halves of the zzso domain of zzso zzso is likely to form a modular domain close to the active center of the zzso In this study, two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are shown to contribute to the stabilization of the transition state of the reaction leading to the zzso of zzso Moreover, another zzso zzso located at the surface of the zzso domain, is found to possibly guide the zzso zzso stem toward the active site of the zzso during zzso The available data indicate an important functional role for the zzso module of zzso zzso as well as for other zzso connecting zzso secondary structure elements in the zzso zzso zzso The relation between the occurrence of such variable zzso zzso and the expression of both zzso specificity and zzso efficiency is zzso
