The defective von zzso Factor zzso in type zzso von zzso disease zzso has decreased binding affinity for zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso while in type zzso zzso the abnormal zzso has increased affinity for this zzso zzso of zzso 28 of the zzso gene were amplified by the zzso chain reaction and zzso in two patients with type zzso and two patients with type zzso zzso One type zzso patient showed an zzso to zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso zzso in the mature zzso and the other patient had a zzso to zzso change at zzso zzso Including these two new cases, zzso at zzso zzso and zzso now account for more than half of the documented zzso in patients with type zzso zzso One patient with type zzso zzso showed an zzso to zzso change at zzso acid zzso This substitution has been reported in another patient with type zzso zzso The other patient showed a novel zzso to zzso change at zzso zzso The C to T zzso transition which causes the zzso acid change was not found in over 100 normal zzso tested by zzso specific zzso zzso and was linked to type zzso zzso in the zzso This potential zzso is more zzso in the zzso zzso than other reported zzso in type zzso zzso It is apparent that zzso associated with type zzso zzso are not as tightly grouped as defects in type zzso zzso supporting the evidence that the type zzso zzso zzso is generated by diverse zzso
