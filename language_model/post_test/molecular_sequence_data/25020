Heat shock factor 2 zzso is a member of the heat shock zzso factor family, which appears to be activated during differentiation and development rather than on cellular zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the human zzso gene and its zzso zzso The zzso unit of the human zzso gene consists of 13 zzso dispersed over 33 zzso of zzso DNA on zzso zzso The zzso zzso is transcribed from multiple start sites, and initiation from the major site results in a transcript of zzso zzso A functional promoter, as determined by the ability to direct expression of a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso resides in a zzso upstream region of the human zzso zzso zzso of the core promoter sequence revealed a high zzso content and lack of a zzso zzso zzso This feature seems to be common among various species, as comparison of the zzso zzso promoter sequences from human, zzso and rat showed distinct zzso zzso Moreover, the overall architecture of the human zzso gene is similar to its mouse zzso A comparison between human zzso gene and other zzso genes showed striking similarities in zzso zzso However, the zzso are assembled in an zzso zzso
