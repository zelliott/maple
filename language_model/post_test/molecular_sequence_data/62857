zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a key zzso growth factor which regulates zzso embryonic zzso adult physiology such as wound healing and reproduction as well as many human zzso To understand the evolution and regulation of this gene in zzso we have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso gene and compared it with zzso genes of human, mouse as well as an in zzso isolated zzso zzso from zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso gene is organized similarly to zzso and zzso zzso zzso with eight zzso interrupted by seven zzso However, zzso zzso zzso are generally larger than zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso are much zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso 6 zzso has a unique sequence while zzso zzso 6 is highly zzso to the zzso zzso Alternative zzso generates multiple zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso as the dominant zzso in adult and zzso as the dominant zzso in early zzso The zzso zzso containing zzso zzso is only detected in heart, muscle, and early zzso while another zzso zzso is only detected in zzso Furthermore, no zzso zzso zzso sequences between zzso and zzso were observed while numerous zzso regions exist between human and mouse in this zzso These results suggest both zzso and zzso functions of zzso from fish to zzso since the separation of these two groups from their common zzso about 450 million years ago and a zzso regulation of this gene since the separation of zzso from zzso These data will be valuable for future studies of zzso gene regulation and function in different zzso
