Previously, spontaneous genetic zzso in mice, Arabian zzso and recently in Jack Russell zzso have been ascribed to defects in zzso zzso zzso of the DNA dependent protein zzso zzso In severe combined zzso zzso zzso a 5 zzso deletion at zzso zzso results in a zzso and a 967 zzso acid deletion from the C zzso (including the entire zzso zzso zzso and an unstable zzso zzso In zzso mice, a single base pair zzso results in a premature stop zzso and deletion of 83 zzso zzso as in zzso zzso the zzso protein is zzso Here, we define the zzso within the canine zzso gene that results in zzso In this case, a point zzso results in a stop zzso at zzso zzso and premature termination at a position 517 zzso acids before the normal C zzso resulting in a functionally zzso zzso Thus, this is the third documentation of a spontaneous zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso Emerging data zzso DNA repair factors as potential tumor zzso Here, we have zzso the carrier frequency of the defective zzso genes in Arabian horses and in Jack Russell zzso Our data indicate (in good agreement with a previous zzso that the carrier frequency of the zzso zzso zzso is approximately zzso in contrast, the carrier frequency of the canine zzso zzso is less than zzso We also assessed the frequency of the zzso zzso zzso in a series of 295 tumors from Arabian zzso We find a statistically significant correlation between the development of a zzso induced tumor zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso These data provide further support for an emerging zzso that zzso may normally act as a tumor zzso through its caretaker role in maintaining zzso zzso
