The reduction of zzso and nitrate in zzso bacteria shows similarities and zzso zzso zzso and nitrate zzso both belong to the zzso zzso family of zzso and have a common zzso zzso zzso zzso There are two types of zzso nitrate zzso With respect to their zzso zzso zzso is more similar to the zzso zzso nitrate zzso However, the zzso unlike the zzso respiratory nitrate zzso is not able to use zzso zzso zzso zzso is more similar to respiratory nitrate zzso since these zzso have analogous zzso zzso by analogous zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso nitrate zzso activities are induced under zzso conditions in the presence of zzso and nitrate zzso During microbial zzso reduction, molecular oxygen is zzso This is not the case for nitrate reduction, although an zzso reaction in zzso reduction linked to oxygen formation has been described zzso zzso oxygen production during reduction of zzso may enhance zzso of pollutants under zzso zzso
