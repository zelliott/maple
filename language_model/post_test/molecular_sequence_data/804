zzso is a zzso acid frequently found in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso by an zzso allows the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso are usually prepared using zzso synthetic zzso We show here that zzso peptides can be assembled zzso and without zzso using unprotected zzso fragments by zzso reaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The reaction was performed in a zzso mixture and the control of apparent pH permitted the clean formation of the zzso bond in the presence of zzso zzso We show also that this novel zzso method, called zzso zzso can be used for the assembly of zzso For this, zzso zzso were reacted with a zzso zzso in the presence of silver zzso This zzso method allows incorporation of zzso zzso zzso that are incompatible with standard zzso zzso synthesis procedures, and more generally should be of interest for the modification of peptides by sensitive zzso zzso
