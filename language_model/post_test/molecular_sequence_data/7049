zzso two-dimensional zzso gel zzso with immobilized pH zzso zzso in the first dimension zzso was zzso for the separation of zzso wheat grain zzso associated with zzso asthma zzso The resolved zzso were zzso onto a zzso zzso zzso membrane and incubated with the pooled zzso from four zzso zzso Bound zzso was demonstrated by alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso Major zzso binding was detected in the 27 zzso 37 zzso and, to a lesser extent, in the zzso zzso area of the zzso zzso zzso Since the main purpose of our study was to determine the zzso zzso acid sequences of the major wheat grain zzso zzso sequencing was performed for six out of a total of zzso major zzso located in the 27 zzso area, for one out of two 37 zzso zzso and for two out of four zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed that two of the 27 zzso zzso are clearly related to several zzso zzso zzso of barley and rice, whereas no significant zzso were found for the remaining four 27 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the 37 zzso zzso appeared to be blocked so that no sequence information was zzso while the two zzso zzso zzso analyzed were identified as members of the wheat zzso zzso
