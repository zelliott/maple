The genetic support for zzso an emerging zzso resistance zzso was studied in two strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso both isolated in Italy from patients with zzso Two completely different zzso genetic zzso sharing only a zzso segment barely larger than the zzso were found in the two zzso The one from strain zzso was zzso and aside from an zzso zzso it closely resembled a zzso island recently described in an zzso zzso Chinese human isolate in zzso organization, and zzso zzso The zzso genetic element from strain zzso was zzso (at a low zzso and, though apparently zzso following zzso C treatment, displayed a typical zzso organization and was named zzso Its full sequence was determined zzso zzso the highest zzso score being zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a unique combination of zzso and heavy metal resistance zzso Besides zzso it contained a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso gene having a deleted leader zzso and a zzso cadmium zzso zzso The zzso zzso closely resembled the one recently described in zzso zzso zzso and zzso These resistance genes found in the zzso zzso scaffold differed from, but were in the same position as, cargo genes carried by other zzso zzso The zzso integration site of zzso was at the 3' end of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This site, known to be an zzso hot spot for mobile elements in zzso zzso might play a similar role in zzso zzso
