The zzso zzso is packaged as zzso with zzso zzso its basic structural unit, but the detailed structure of zzso and its dynamic zzso in terms of individual zzso positions has not been completely defined zzso for any zzso We used zzso sequencing to map the zzso of individual zzso throughout the zzso zzso before and after a zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso zzso Nearly zzso of the zzso is covered by positioned zzso occurring in a limited number of stereotypical patterns in relation to transcribed regions and zzso factor binding zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso was typically associated with the zzso appearance, or repositioning of one or two zzso in the promoter, rather than broader zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso tends to increase the accessibility of binding sites for zzso factors that mediate zzso zzso However, specific zzso zzso were also evident at promoters even when there was no apparent zzso change, indicating that there is no simple, globally zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our study provides a detailed, zzso dynamic map of zzso zzso across the zzso zzso and its relation to global zzso zzso
