zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso In this work a convenient and sensitive zzso system for zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso detection is zzso zzso plate zzso whose surface had been coated with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are incubated with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso of product by zzso extension of the zzso chain is detected by the zzso plant zzso zzso album zzso The standard curve for correct zzso of zzso activity is completed after running standard zzso with no zzso or known quantities of zzso zzso zzso formation detected in this manner is zzso to zzso activity and the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso In accordance with the known specificity of zzso no zzso conversion of zzso into zzso was observed using this zzso Human zzso zzso were isolated using a zzso affinity zzso and their specificity was zzso Relative to the application of these natural zzso as zzso zzso the zzso proved to be more zzso
