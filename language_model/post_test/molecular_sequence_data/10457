We have identified an essential zzso zzso gene zzso that encodes a member of a recently identified zzso of zzso (the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso to zzso This evolutionary conservation between zzso related species suggests that this family of zzso proteins possesses a zzso yet unknown, cellular zzso In this report, we describe the isolation and sequence of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein displays striking similarity to the zzso family of small, zzso zzso zzso both in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and throughout the zzso zzso domain that is found in many members of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso demonstrating that this gene is essential for cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein levels remained constant throughout the zzso zzso cell zzso
