In dosage compensation of female zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of one zzso zzso action is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso whose full-length zzso product is complementary to zzso zzso in zzso While previous work showed that zzso zzso blocks the zzso of zzso zzso it is still unclear whether this repression requires the zzso zzso product or whether the zzso zzso movement is zzso A better understanding of potential mechanisms requires zzso of zzso zzso structure and determination of zzso zzso copy number relative to that of zzso zzso Previous work indicated that at least some of zzso zzso is spliced and that human zzso zzso within the 3' end of zzso Here, further characterization and zzso of zzso zzso zzso reveal three new findings: first, in zzso embryonic stem cells, zzso zzso is present at zzso zzso excess over zzso zzso Second, only zzso of zzso zzso is spliced at known zzso zzso The nearly equal abundance of spliced and zzso species leaves open possible roles for both zzso Finally, zzso is spliced zzso at the zzso end and most zzso zzso zzso exhibit only a zzso zzso region of zzso between sense and zzso zzso zzso for zzso possible mechanisms of action are zzso
