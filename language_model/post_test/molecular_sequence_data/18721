zzso species zzso usually relies on singular data, primarily zzso for detecting putative species and individual assignment to putative zzso Given the variety of zzso mechanisms, singular data may not adequately represent the zzso zzso and ecological diversity relevant to species zzso We describe a zzso framework combining zzso and zzso techniques that uses zzso zzso and ecological data to detect and assign individuals to putative zzso Our approach recovers a similar number of species recognized using zzso qualitative zzso approaches that are not detected when using purely genetic zzso Furthermore, our approach detects groupings that zzso qualitative zzso approaches do zzso This empirical test suggests that our approach to detecting and assigning individuals to putative species could be useful in species zzso despite varying levels of differentiation across zzso zzso and ecological zzso This work highlights a critical, and often zzso aspect of the process of statistical species zzso detection and individual zzso zzso of the species zzso approach used, all downstream processing relies on how individuals are initially zzso and the practices and statistical issues surrounding individual assignment warrant careful zzso
