zzso zzso zzso has a long zzso extension fused to the zzso binding fold that occurs at the zzso end of the zzso E coli zzso We examined the contribution of this zzso region to the activity of the zzso by creating several internal deletions in zzso which preserve the correct reading zzso The results show that 185 zzso acids are zzso for activity and zzso zzso of the next 5 zzso affects the activity of the zzso The effect is more pronounced on the zzso zzso steps than on the zzso formation zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso are zzso indicating that the global structure of the zzso is zzso The zzso for zzso increased slightly by a factor of 3, which indicates that the positioning of the zzso on the surface of the zzso is not zzso There is, however, a great effect on the zzso of the zzso zzso of the 3-D structure of the zzso E coli zzso zzso indicates that the zzso acid region preceding the zzso binding fold does not participate directly in the zzso zzso It could, however, act at a distance by zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding region of the E coli zzso has recently been zzso By zzso of the zzso equivalent region in the zzso zzso we could identify zzso that alter specifically the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso provides a van der zzso contact that is critical for the recognition of the zzso zzso
