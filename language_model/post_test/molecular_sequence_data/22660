The SAM domain of the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso has a high affinity towards zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso We present the zzso zzso X-ray crystal structure of the zzso SAM domain in its zzso state, and the zzso solution structure of this domain in its zzso zzso Both structures reveal a zzso five zzso SAM domain flanked by additional secondary structural elements at the N and C zzso The two structures are essentially zzso zzso that no major structural zzso occur upon zzso zzso zzso chemical shift changes map the zzso site to a shallow, basic patch at the junction of zzso zzso and the loop connecting zzso zzso and zzso
