In zzso zzso zzso genes are transcribed in the zzso where the zzso consists of zzso linear DNA zzso We have isolated clones of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso nova, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in an effort to determine if they possess molecules of similar size for a given coding function, and also to determine the size range of zzso DNA present on these zzso Our results indicate that while the length of their zzso DNA can vary slightly, both between different zzso and within the gene family of a single zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules are similarly zzso The sizes observed for these molecules support the hypothesis that each zzso zzso encodes a single zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso molecules show a much wider size range and generally are much longer than necessary to zzso the zzso zzso We therefore zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso nova to determine if it might possibly zzso additional gene zzso zzso data reveals the presence of nine open reading frames zzso greater than 100 zzso in zzso however, Northern zzso analysis of the products of this DNA zzso reveals only a single zzso
