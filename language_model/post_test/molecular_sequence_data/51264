We report zzso mass zzso of test zzso of six zzso DNA zzso The segments range in size from 8 to 60 zzso zzso weight range zzso to zzso zzso The best mass zzso were obtained by zzso laser zzso of thin frozen films of an zzso solution of the mixture from an oxidized copper zzso These mass zzso are dominated by the zzso peak for each DNA segment, and show little evidence of zzso peak broadening or cluster zzso In contrast, mass zzso obtained using zzso laser zzso from an zzso acid zzso yield broad zzso with evidence of zzso and DNA segments longer than 26 zzso are difficult to zzso
