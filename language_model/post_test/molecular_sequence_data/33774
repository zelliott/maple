zzso cells zzso play a critical role in innate and zzso immunity through the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We recently showed that the activities of zzso zzso are zzso regulated by zzso retained zzso zzso and we provided evidence that this zzso acts as a specific regulator of mouse mast cell zzso zzso Here, we show that in zzso bone zzso mast cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indirectly by inducing differential expression and zzso promoter binding of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression zzso over zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the opposite is zzso zzso expression zzso and binds to the zzso promoter at the expense of zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and, zzso with zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso This suggests a novel model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains a zzso domain in an zzso zzso that is zzso for gene zzso
