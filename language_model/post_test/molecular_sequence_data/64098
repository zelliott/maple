In this study, a new gap junction zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated from the neural tube of chicken zzso zzso zzso and cloned by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The open reading frame of the gene encodes for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with strong similarity to highly zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso we denominated it as zzso zzso analysis allocated the zzso to the zzso of zzso gene zzso The zzso expression of zzso was detected by zzso and Northern zzso in several zzso of chicken, including different parts of central nervous system, heart, liver, zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso analysis of chicken brain showed strong expression in zzso of zzso layers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed strong expression of zzso in the atrium of the heart, the external layer of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso moderate expression was found in the zzso of the zzso
