The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso pol II in zzso zzso is known to be an important zzso of zzso under a variety of zzso zzso In zzso zzso is essential for cell viability while zzso zzso strains are temperature sensitive at low and high zzso The zzso zzso strain also shows zzso in zzso and a predisposed state of zzso zzso We show here that, apart from zzso zzso the zzso zzso from other lower zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can complement for the absence of zzso zzso This is the first report where we have shown that both the zzso and zzso zzso are functional zzso of the zzso zzso We also show that high expression levels of zzso zzso and its zzso rescue the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but only some of them cause significant enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso and its zzso show a high degree of conservation in the overall zzso This study indicates a structural and functional conservation of different zzso across species and also a zzso role of zzso in the zzso with respect to nutritional zzso
