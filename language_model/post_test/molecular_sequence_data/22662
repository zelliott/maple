A natural zzso hotspot in the zzso gene of zzso coli accounts for over half of the zzso that zzso this zzso which can be selected by resistance to the zzso zzso This T to A zzso at base 131 of the coding zzso occurs within a 17 zzso zzso zzso To clarify the mechanism of zzso we examine here zzso and zzso factors affecting zzso zzso hotspot activity at its natural location on the zzso zzso zzso a zzso mechanism for zzso an zzso that strengthens zzso between the zzso repeat DNA sequences surrounding the hotspot zzso zzso and, conversely, zzso that weakened pairing reduced hotspot zzso In addition, consistent with the idea that the hotspot zzso is zzso from DNA synthesis from zzso strands of the zzso repeats, zzso of multiple sites within the zzso was observed as predicted from the DNA sequence of the corresponding zzso Surprisingly, inversion of the zzso zzso on the zzso did not abolish zzso hotspot zzso indicating that zzso at this site occurs during both leading and zzso zzso Loss of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a marked increase in the hotspot zzso rate, indicating a zzso unknown and redundant zzso effect of these repair zzso zzso zzso did not require the zzso replication zzso factor and hence must not require fork zzso after the zzso zzso zzso in the two major 3' zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso hotspot zzso zzso and extended the zzso zzso indicating that these zzso normally abort a large fraction of zzso zzso The high frequency of zzso zzso suggests that zzso occurs readily during zzso zzso
