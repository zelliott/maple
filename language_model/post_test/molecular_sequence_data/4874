Vitamin D plays a major role in bone mineral zzso by promoting the transport of calcium and zzso to ensure that the blood levels of these zzso are sufficient for the normal zzso of type I collagen zzso in the zzso In contrast to classic vitamin zzso zzso a number of vitamin zzso zzso syndromes are caused by acquired and zzso defects in the zzso zzso of the vitamin to its hormonal form, zzso D3 zzso or in the subsequent functions of the hormone in target zzso The actions of zzso are zzso by the nuclear vitamin D zzso zzso a zzso which binds the hormone zzso affinity and regulates the expression of genes via zinc zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso In zzso zzso vitamin zzso zzso zzso natural zzso in human zzso that zzso patients with tissue zzso to zzso are particularly zzso in revealing zzso structure function zzso These zzso fall into three zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso hormone binding and zzso zzso with zzso X receptors zzso That all three classes of zzso zzso generate the zzso zzso is consistent with a basic model of the active zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Vitamin D responsive elements zzso consisting of direct zzso repeats with a zzso of three zzso have been identified in the promoter regions of positively controlled genes expressed in bone, such as zzso zzso beta zzso and vitamin D zzso The zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso and specific, high affinity zzso zzso whereas the zzso for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is capable of suppressing zzso zzso by diverting zzso to form zzso However, initial zzso zzso of a zzso zzso renders it competent not only to recruit zzso into a zzso but also to zzso silence the ability of its zzso partner to bind zzso zzso and zzso the zzso Additional probing of zzso interactions has revealed that zzso also binds to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and, in the presence of zzso an zzso zzso complex can be created in zzso Moreover, for zzso zzso by zzso both zzso and zzso require an intact short zzso zzso known as zzso positioned at their extreme zzso Because the zzso zzso participate neither in zzso zzso nor in zzso association, it is hypothesized that they zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso zzso such as those of the steroid zzso zzso family, zzso yet a third zzso interaction for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso alters the zzso of the zzso binding domain such that it: zzso engages in strong zzso with zzso to facilitate zzso zzso zzso influences the zzso zzso binding domain such that it is resistant to the binding of zzso zzso but active in recruiting zzso to its zzso and zzso presents the zzso region in zzso for zzso zzso The above events, including bridging by zzso to the zzso binding protein and associated factors, may position zzso such that it is able to attract zzso and the balance of the zzso zzso II zzso machinery, culminating in repeated zzso initiation of zzso vitamin D target zzso Such a model would explain the action of zzso to elicit bone zzso by stimulating zzso and zzso precursor gene zzso while zzso triggering the termination of its hormonal signal by inducing the zzso zzso zzso
