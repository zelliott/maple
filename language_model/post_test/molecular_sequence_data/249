A zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a freshwater lake at zzso University in zzso South zzso zzso from zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was zzso affiliated with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed sequence similarity values of zzso % to the type strains of recognized zzso zzso The zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed the highest zzso zzso gene sequence zzso was zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The results obtained from this study, with a zzso zzso approach, suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
