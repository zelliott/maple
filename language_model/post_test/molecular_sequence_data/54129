A zzso zzso zzso strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang province, zzso China, and subjected to zzso zzso zzso The isolate grew in the presence of zzso zzso zzso but not in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso had particular zzso properties, forming aerial zzso that had long spore chains and zzso zzso spore zzso at zzso zzso was the zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso and the zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso zzso clustered with the zzso zzso The sequence similarities between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso differences, and zzso analysis, a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso analysis placed the zzso zzso together with strain zzso zzso within the order zzso as an independent zzso clearly distinguished from other described zzso of the class zzso zzso based on zzso zzso the zzso zzso together with the newly proposed zzso zzso are proposed to be classified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
