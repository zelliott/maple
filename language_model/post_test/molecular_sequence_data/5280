The synthesis of long zzso molecules zzso the complete zzso of zzso viruses has recently been zzso this major improvement has numerous practical applications such as construction of infectious zzso clones or study of sequence zzso at the level of a single zzso zzso Using zzso C virus zzso as a model, we established an zzso technique for amplification of zzso fragments with a length of about 5 zzso The zzso reaction was carried out with a zzso zzso zzso virus reverse zzso lacking zzso zzso H zzso For zzso reactions an zzso mix containing zzso and zzso DNA zzso was zzso Hot start and addition of zzso zzso were also important to efficiently achieve long zzso zzso About zzso zzso zzso zzso in serum were needed in order to amplify the zzso zzso in only two zzso fragments covering about zzso of the complete zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso is also possible by this method as shown by sequencing of the zzso region 1 zzso after cloning of zzso The integrity of the long zzso clones was proven by zzso restriction zzso zzso partial sequencing and zzso expression of respective gene zzso In zzso transcribed zzso were translated in rabbit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were identified by zzso using patient zzso These results suggest that the two zzso clones zzso a complete and functional open reading frame of zzso
