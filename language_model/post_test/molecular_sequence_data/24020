Death by infection is often as much due to the zzso reaction as it is to the direct result of microbial zzso Here we identify genes in both the host and zzso that are involved in the zzso of infection and disease in zzso zzso challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso causes a lethal systemic infection when injected into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso bacterial effect or zzso zzso zzso an acute and lethal infection to one that is persistent and less zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso zzso stimulate the fly and thus cause an immune response that is damaging both to the bacteria and, zzso to the zzso In support of this model, we show that zzso in the fly gene zzso a zzso zzso delay the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso flies die from a condition that resembles zzso zzso collapse in zzso This idea provides us with a new model to study zzso biology in a genetically zzso zzso In addition, it allows us to study the difference in pathways followed by a zzso when producing an acute or persistent zzso
