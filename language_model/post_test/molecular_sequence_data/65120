Mass zzso identification of the components of affinity zzso protein complexes after zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso digest has become very popular for the detection of novel protein zzso As an alternative, the entire protein complex can be subjected to zzso zzso followed by zzso separation of the zzso Based on our earlier report of a method using affinity zzso zzso of zzso peptides to zzso proteins present in an affinity zzso of the zzso zzso complex, we here evaluated the use of one-dimensional zzso gel zzso for analysis of the same zzso complex zzso Using zzso and tandem mass zzso analyses of zzso peptides from zzso zzso proteins we identified the components of the zzso zzso complex along with 23 other proteins that were all likely to be zzso binding proteins and mainly different from the proteins detected in our previous zzso We compare the alternative strategy with the affinity zzso method that we described earlier and show that the zzso method enables more proteins to be zzso We also evaluated the use of a more stringent zzso buffer for the zzso zzso to zzso zzso binding and identified 52 proteins along with zzso in three independent experiments suggesting that the choice of zzso buffer had no significant effect on the extent of zzso zzso zzso binding was inconsistent and involved various types of proteins underlining the importance of zzso and control experiments in zzso zzso
