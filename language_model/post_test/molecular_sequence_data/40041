The zzso properties of bovine zzso zzso were investigated by demonstrating the association of zzso activity with zzso prepared from bovine zzso zzso zzso to the zzso interface was investigated using surface zzso zzso In whichever way the zzso films were obtained zzso injection or zzso the zzso exhibited a significant affinity for the zzso zzso The zzso obtained 180 zzso after protein injection into a pH zzso zzso was similar to the zzso obtained after spreading the same amount of protein onto the same zzso indicating that bovine zzso zzso molecules adopted a similar arrangement and/or zzso at the zzso zzso the zzso pH from zzso to 8 resulted in changes of the protein zzso These zzso which could zzso to the small zzso zzso changes observed by zzso zzso zzso were discussed in relation to the pH influence on the zzso zzso Adding zzso acid, the zzso zzso to the zzso tested the stability of the zzso properties of zzso The presence of zzso acid in the zzso did not modify the protein zzso and allowed zzso binding to a zzso film of zzso at pH zzso the optimal pH for the zzso zzso Such effects of zzso acid were not observed when the zzso was constituted of pure water, a medium where the zzso activity was zzso These influences of zzso acid were discussed in relation to the zzso structure of bovine zzso zzso where a zzso region was proposed to be opposite of the zzso zzso
