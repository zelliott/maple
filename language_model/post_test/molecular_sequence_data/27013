Ten zzso strains that form chains of spiral or zzso spores were isolated from soil and zzso samples in zzso They contained zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as a characteristic zzso sugar, zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso and zzso as the major cellular fatty acid and showed zzso DNA zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the isolated zzso strains consistently formed a zzso cluster with zzso zzso zzso zzso and a separate line of descent in the zzso cluster of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained zzso and zzso in addition to zzso This genetic and zzso evidence revealed that the zzso strains could be clearly differentiated from the other members of the family zzso and that they warranted separate zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso should be assigned the status of the type species of a new zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, we conclude that the ten new zzso should be assigned to the novel species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
