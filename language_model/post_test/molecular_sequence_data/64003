zzso zzso disease virus zzso is a zzso virus with an zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso and zzso that derive from the processing of the zzso zzso The zzso contains zzso the viral zzso which is both free and zzso linked to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the virus assembly process was studied further with the zzso expression zzso While expression of the zzso zzso was not found to be self-sufficient to give rise to zzso particles zzso deletion or replacement of the five zzso zzso of zzso was observed to promote zzso zzso Indeed, the single deletion of the zzso zzso acid was sufficient to induce zzso zzso Moreover, fusion of various peptides or small proteins (a green fluorescent protein or a truncated form of zzso at the C zzso of zzso also promoted zzso zzso suggesting that assembly required screening of the negative charges at the C zzso of zzso The fused zzso zzso the effect of zzso which interacts with zzso to promote zzso zzso The zzso segment of zzso was found to contain two functional zzso While the very last five zzso of zzso mainly controlled both assembly and zzso architecture, the five preceding zzso constituted the zzso (and possibly the zzso binding zzso Finally, we showed that zzso formation is associated with zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso is involved in the virus assembly zzso
