While performing molecular confirmation of zzso identified zzso zzso zzso we zzso a few zzso as zzso zzso This led us to the present zzso investigation of zzso zzso zzso All zzso identified zzso blood zzso during October 2008 through to December 2009 at our advanced zzso zzso were included for molecular identification by sequencing of the internal transcribed zzso and zzso regions of zzso After identifying a large cluster zzso zzso cases, a zzso study was carried out zzso to zzso potential risk factors for zzso zzso zzso typing of the zzso was performed using a fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso testing was performed as per the zzso protocol of zzso zzso zzso of 148 zzso identified zzso zzso were confirmed as zzso by sequencing and zzso By zzso analysis, zzso was significantly associated with the zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed that all zzso zzso had zzso zzso The zzso and zzso had good in zzso activity against zzso though zzso of the zzso had zzso of zzso for zzso zzso The response to zzso therapy could be evaluated in 27 patients and zzso of patients recovered after zzso zzso The present study reports the largest cluster of zzso zzso from a single zzso The study also stresses the need for accurate identification of clinical zzso zzso
