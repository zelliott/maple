Based on the molecular theory of protein structure the de zzso protein was designed in order to obtain the zzso fold which has not yet been observed in natural zzso namely zzso zzso zzso covered by two zzso The gene coding for this protein (named zzso was chemically zzso cloned in zzso with zzso zzso promoter and expressed in zzso zzso translation zzso An approach was developed to study zzso using only zzso amounts of radio zzso protein without previous zzso The preliminary analysis of its structure by zzso zzso zzso and limited zzso revealed zzso and stability of the de zzso zzso
