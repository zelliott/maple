Our structural studies of zzso necessitated the production of over 100 zzso of a zzso perfect zzso DNA for use in the zzso of perfectly symmetrical zzso core particles for detailed X-ray zzso zzso The propagation of zzso DNA DNA sequences by bacterial culture is hindered by the instability of these sequences during bacterial replication and zzso While the loss of some zzso sequences can be eliminated by the use of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso coli, not all zzso plasmids are faithfully maintained by these zzso The production of large quantities of zzso DNA that involves production of zzso containing multiple copies of the repeating unit of the zzso which are isolated by restriction zzso and zzso in zzso to form the zzso zzso The procedure has resulted in the production of over 20 zzso of a zzso DNA zzso in 2 zzso
