zzso zzso factor zzso zzso its effects on cells of the zzso lineage by inducing formation of a zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso has not yet been determined, therefore we used molecular modeling to identify regions of the zzso that were likely to be involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was aligned with all the available sequences of the zzso and growth hormone zzso families and a model of the zzso zzso zzso domain was constructed, based on the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso substitution zzso was performed on zzso and individual zzso that were predicted to bind zzso zzso receptors were expressed in zzso zzso cells and assessed for proliferation response and zzso zzso Six zzso were identified that significantly reduced zzso function, with zzso in the zzso loop having the greatest zzso These zzso formed a binding face on the zzso model resembling the growth hormone zzso site, which suggests that the model is zzso However, zzso analysis of the model provided further evidence that the mechanism of zzso zzso is different from that of the growth hormone zzso
