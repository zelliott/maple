Silent information regulators are zzso zzso that display differential specificity toward zzso zzso This report provides first evidence for zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso The protein is highly zzso in zzso The zzso protein zzso removes the zzso group from zzso bovine serum zzso In the absence of zzso or when zzso was zzso with zzso zzso was zzso We isolated gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produces zzso from zzso The highest zzso level was detected in cells from the exponential phase of growth, and then decreased in transition and stationary zzso of zzso zzso zzso loses the ability to transfer zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso required zzso zzso and zzso Using specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found relationship between level of zzso and zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is involved in regulating the zzso level of zzso and consequently its zzso It was found that zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit the zzso activity of zzso
