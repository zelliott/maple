The zzso zzso which contains seven zzso zinc fingers of the zzso exerts its effects on gene expression by binding to specific targets in zzso small nuclear zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Here, we have investigated the interaction of the zzso zinc finger domain with the optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Generation of a series of zzso containing increasing numbers of zzso zinc fingers tested in binding zzso by interference techniques and by binding site selection served to zzso the mode of interaction between the zinc fingers and the zzso zzso Our results provide strong evidence that zinc fingers 3-6 represent the minimal zinc finger region for high affinity binding to zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the binding of zzso is achieved through a broad spectrum of close contacts between zinc fingers zzso and zzso optimal sites or between zinc fingers 3-6 and the zzso zzso zzso DNA major groove contacts contribute to the interaction with zzso that associates more closely with the zzso than with the template zzso Based on these findings and the structural information provided by the solved structures of other zinc zzso complexes, we propose a model for the interaction between zzso zinc fingers and the zzso optimal and zzso zzso
