zzso single zzso zzso zzso in zzso the gene for zzso of zzso acid type A zzso zzso have been associated with schizophrenia zzso and zzso correlated to zzso expression and alternative zzso 

zzso of the zzso 10 region of zzso from zzso zzso revealed this region to be an zzso zzso zzso that readily gave rise to differently spliced zzso depending on zzso zzso This led to a search in human brain zzso libraries, and the discovery of two novel zzso zzso and zzso bearing variations in the neighborhood of zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis of zzso brain samples showed increased zzso expression and decreased zzso expression in both zzso and bipolar disorder zzso compared to zzso zzso differences were significantly correlated with zzso zzso in zzso males for both zzso and zzso expressions, and significantly correlated with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso males for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso indicated that zzso a potential zzso site in zzso played a key role in determining the time profile of the zzso zzso current zzso 

This study therefore provided experimental evidence for the importance of zzso sequences in the zzso region in zzso with respect to zzso zzso diversity and the zzso of zzso and zzso
