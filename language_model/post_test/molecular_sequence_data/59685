DNA zzso I is an zzso involved in several processes related to DNA zzso Despite the zzso importance, the regulation of zzso gene expression has not yet been investigated in zzso In order to monitor the possible correlation between levels of zzso transcripts and the zzso state of the cell, two partially overlapping zzso zzso DNA zzso I from zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso library, using an zzso zzso probe, and from a zzso library spanning the zzso region of the zzso transcript, which was constructed using an zzso specific zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso predicting a protein of 90 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed a similarity of 51% with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis, performed under moderate stringency conditions, showed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso level revealed, besides a zzso expression in zzso carrot zzso an induced expression related to cell zzso
