A zzso of zzso zzso zzso which appeared to be defective in the production of the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso had been isolated previously following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso DNA from either side of the zzso zzso site was zzso and the sequence was zzso The zzso gene had strong identity with the zzso zzso zzso components of zzso zzso zzso from other bacterial zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was defective in the zzso zzso of zzso preventing assembly of a functional zzso zzso activity in zzso cell extracts was restored when extract from an E1 zzso was zzso On the basis of this evidence, zzso was identified as an zzso or zzso zzso A second zzso zzso which is likely to zzso the E1 component of zzso was identified upstream from zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are expressed as a zzso zzso transcript from a promoter upstream of zzso An zzso region of 146 zzso was located between zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso transcript that originated from a promoter in the zzso region was zzso DNA fragments upstream of zzso and zzso were shown to have promoter activities in zzso zzso although only the zzso promoter was active in zzso zzso It is likely that the apparent zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a consequence of zzso of the growth medium due to zzso of zzso acid in the absence of functional zzso
