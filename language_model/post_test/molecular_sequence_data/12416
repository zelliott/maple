zzso resistance in zzso is an emerging therapeutic zzso Resistance is not always detected by standard zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso were designed to target amplification of defined regions of genes of the zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso These zzso correctly identified 30 zzso zzso tested (17 zzso 7 zzso and 6 zzso zzso No amplification was observed with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso and Southern zzso we found that all 17 zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in the same sequence and that the zzso distances in the zzso segments were the zzso The described methods should be zzso to the rapid detection of the different zzso resistance zzso in zzso
