zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso gene is implicated in the zzso and zzso effects of zzso in cell zzso Earlier studies identified a 96 base pair zzso regulatory region upstream of the zzso gene that zzso zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso gene linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region was further narrowed to a 67 zzso zzso by 3' zzso This 67 zzso zzso contains several sequence elements of potential interest, including a 14 zzso sequence zzso to the zzso sequence found in zzso genes and two zzso sequences zzso I and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso sequence identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso expression of zzso zzso involved cooperation between two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso II (but not zzso zzso Either element alone with its zzso sequence was inadequate in zzso an zzso response to zzso reporter zzso Two zzso protein factors interacting with these two elements were zzso The factor binding to the zzso region was induced with a slower zzso required new protein zzso and reacted with zzso to zzso The factor interacting with the zzso II region appeared rapidly after treatment with zzso independently of new protein zzso and its binding to DNA probe was blocked by zzso to zzso factor, reported to bind to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
