The spread of drug resistance has been a major obstacle to the control of zzso The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in malaria seem to be complex and zzso The current literature on multiple drug resistance against zzso has documented zzso an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso as an important zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso there are several ABC zzso some of which could be putative drug transporting zzso In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance, characterization of these zzso is zzso The aim of this study was to characterize and zzso putative ABC zzso 

In the zzso database, 16 members of the zzso zzso ABC family can be identified, 11 of which are putative transport zzso A zzso analysis of the aligned zzso of the zzso genes was zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated, affinity zzso and used in zzso to zzso the proteins in the asexual stages of the zzso 

The ABC family members of zzso zzso were zzso into zzso The ABC B zzso was the largest and contained seven zzso Other family members that could be involved in drug transport are zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression and zzso of three ABC transport proteins was zzso zzso zzso and zzso are localized to the plasma membrane in all asexual stages of the zzso 

In conclusion, 11 of the 16 ABC proteins in the zzso zzso zzso are putative transport zzso some of which might be involved in drug zzso Moreover, it was demonstrated that three of these proteins are expressed on the zzso plasma zzso
