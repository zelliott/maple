The binding protein zzso has been implicated in zzso folding of nascent zzso and in the recognition and disposal of zzso zzso To zzso the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso we have characterized the protein in pumpkin zzso during seed maturation and zzso zzso zzso zzso from maturing pumpkin zzso contained a significant amount of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and internal fragments of this protein exhibited a high identity to the sequence of zzso zzso analysis with specific zzso raised against the zzso zzso showed that the amount of zzso in a zzso increased markedly at the middle stages and then zzso The increase was accompanied by the synthesis of storage proteins and the development of the zzso zzso in the zzso at the middle stage of seed zzso Most of these storage proteins zzso dramatically between 2 and 5 days after seed zzso and the degradation was also accompanied by a rapid increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso of the 4-day-old zzso showed a high zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso It is possible that zzso might be involved in the synthesis of seed storage proteins during maturation and in the synthesis of zzso zzso responsible for the degradation of the storage proteins during seed zzso
