A small cryptic zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso and its complete zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso analysis revealed four putative open reading zzso Based on sequence analysis two zzso could be zzso First, the replication module consisted of a sequence coding for a replication protein zzso and its corresponding target site, and two putative zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated the possible synthesis of an zzso zzso that might regulate zzso zzso A putative zzso initiation site was also found, suggesting that zzso replicates via a rolling circle zzso The second module of zzso consisted of a sequence coding for a putative zzso protein and its corresponding zzso zzso Since the zzso sequence of the replication module showed zzso identity to the similar region on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence of the zzso module had zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso it is concluded that zzso originated by modular exchange between two such plasmids by zzso zzso zzso zzso sites where crossover might have taken place were also zzso
