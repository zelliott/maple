zzso zzso are essential electron transfer components of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso Several Rd genes associated with zzso zzso or Rd zzso genes were cloned from zzso and zzso organisms able to grow on zzso zzso zzso tests in an zzso coli zzso containing all zzso zzso zzso genes necessary for growth on zzso except Rd 2 zzso and sequence comparisons showed that the zzso can be divided in zzso and zzso zzso All zzso strains contain zzso zzso which are able to replace the zzso Rd 2 in zzso zzso Most strains also contain zzso zzso which do not complement the deletion zzso but are highly zzso among zzso and zzso zzso Common to most zzso are the two zzso zzso zzso All zzso possess four zzso charged zzso that are not zzso in other zzso The zzso zzso can be distinguished from the zzso zzso by the zzso of an zzso downstream of the second zzso zzso In addition, the zzso in the two zzso motifs are usually replaced by other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in either the zzso or the zzso zzso but not between both types, shows that zzso is unable to transfer electrons to the zzso zzso mainly due to the zzso of the zzso whereas the exchange of the zzso in the two zzso motifs only has a limited zzso
