zzso zzso is the core component of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene family has been analyzed in various plant zzso however, there is no report about zzso in the well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine zzso plant, zzso zzso 

Through a zzso analysis, we identified ten zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso of all zzso were subsequently cloned and zzso These zzso were characterized using a comprehensive zzso zzso features, gene structures and zzso zzso were analyzed by the comparison of zzso and zzso zzso relationships among zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and rice were zzso The expression levels of zzso genes in various zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The results implied that some zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso probably played similar roles as their counterparts in zzso whereas the others could be more zzso It suggests the conservation and diversity of zzso in zzso Additionally, we identified a total of 24 hairpin structures, representing six zzso gene families, to be zzso zzso Using the modified zzso method, we confirmed that zzso and zzso were targeted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It suggests the conservation of zzso and zzso regulatory zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 

This is the first attempt to explore zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The results provide useful information for further zzso of gene zzso pathways in zzso zzso
