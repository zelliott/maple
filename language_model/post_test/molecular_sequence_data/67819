zzso translation is crucial for cells to rapidly adapt to changing zzso While zzso signaling via the zzso is known to induce zzso translation, stress conditions, such as zzso deprivation or zzso often activate alternative modes of translation, zzso via internal zzso entry sites zzso As the effects of inflammatory conditions on translation are only poorly zzso we aimed at identifying zzso zzso targets in inflammatory zzso For this purpose, we zzso breast tumor cells with zzso medium of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling and zzso analysis identified early growth zzso zzso to be regulated at the level of zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso contains an zzso within its zzso zzso which facilitated enhanced translation upon CM zzso We further provide evidence that the activity of zzso was induced by zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we identified several potential zzso zzso factors zzso such as zzso tract binding protein zzso and zzso that directly bind to the zzso In zzso our data provide evidence that zzso expression is zzso regulated via an zzso element, which is responsive to an inflammatory zzso
