Thirty one cultures were established in zzso medium from the zzso zzso of 29 patients, including 18 with Crohn's disease, five with zzso zzso and six zzso zzso disease zzso All cultures grew either acid fast zzso or zzso zzso zzso from these cultures were coded and zzso blind for M zzso and M zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso DNA zzso elements specific for these two zzso Six Crohn's disease cultures and a single zzso zzso disease control were positive for M zzso A further six cultures were positive for M zzso zzso zzso of which two each were from Crohn's disease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease zzso The intensity of the zzso signals indicated very low numbers of M zzso organisms and bore no relation to visible zzso or zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that M zzso isolated from man exists in a form which hardly replicates if at all when cultured in zzso medium in zzso and are consistent with the involvement of this known animal enteric pathogen in a proportion of chronic zzso in zzso
