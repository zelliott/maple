The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each contain two zzso zzso zzso and an zzso region consisting of zzso and zzso type zzso zzso We describe the cloning and characterization of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare the structure, alternative zzso tissue distribution, and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well their ability to associate with the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Overall, these three zzso are structurally very similar, sharing zzso zzso acid zzso Multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to be generated by zzso alternative zzso of up to four zzso segments that zzso peptides of zzso zzso located in both the zzso and zzso zzso Alternative usage of these peptides varies depending on the tissue zzso zzso Short zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso delta were also detected that contain only four of the eight zzso type zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso and zzso zzso are broadly distributed whereas zzso delta expression is largely restricted to brain, as is the short zzso zzso zzso containing only four zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit similar in zzso zzso activities and all three interact with zzso which has been zzso to recruit zzso to focal zzso Thus, these closely related zzso may perform similar functions in various zzso
