The zzso of zzso signaling zzso are critically involved in the regulation of cellular zzso survival, and zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso DNA zzso contributes to zzso in various zzso zzso and zzso Recently, we showed an alternative loss of zzso function due to deleterious zzso zzso in a major subset of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso line zzso and a zzso zzso deletion in zzso line zzso For both cell lines our previous data demonstrated retarded zzso degradation and sustained zzso action leading to enhanced DNA binding of zzso Here, we zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of classical zzso zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso in zzso cells of eight of 19 zzso samples and in three of five zzso zzso zzso cell lines by sequencing zzso Moreover, we found a significant association between zzso zzso of isolated zzso cells and nuclear zzso zzso in zzso cells of zzso tumor tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings support the concept that zzso and zzso share many overlapping features, and that defective tumor zzso gene zzso triggers an zzso zzso operative in both zzso
