Three single chain zzso were designed based on the zzso of human zzso and zzso relationships of the zzso zzso In each single chain, the zzso end of the human zzso beta zzso is connected via zzso repeats to the zzso end of the alpha zzso In addition, two of the single chains have truncated zzso The three zzso were expressed in zzso zzso In zzso binding of two of the three zzso to the human zzso zzso was found to be comparable to zzso zzso In contrast, both the zzso binding and the in zzso zzso of the zzso with truncated alpha and beta zzso in which the zzso zzso bond cannot be formed, are lowered relative to zzso zzso The fact that this zzso still displays biological activity shows that the zzso arrangement proposed by Isaacs and zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Morgan, zzso zzso & Isaacs, zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso is important but not essential for zzso binding and biological activity in the context of single chain zzso Single chains in which zzso zzso are combined with truncated zzso provide an attractive approach towards the design and generation of novel, biologically active zzso
