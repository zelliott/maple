zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by zzso zzso in the zzso gene that result in a wide spectrum of manifestations including short zzso sparse hair, zzso zzso zzso immune zzso and increased zzso of zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso has implications for management, zzso zzso and genetic counseling of affected patients and their zzso We report 20 novel zzso in 36 patients with zzso and describe the associated zzso zzso Given the high zzso zzso (62 zzso reported to zzso the high frequency of variations in the region zzso single zzso zzso in and around zzso and the fact that zzso is not translated into zzso prediction of zzso zzso is zzso We addressed this issue by a comparative zzso approach and aligned the zzso sequences of zzso gene in the entire class of zzso We found that putative zzso zzso are located in highly zzso zzso whereas zzso are located in zzso zzso We conclude that the abundance of variations in this small gene is remarkable and at odds with its high conservation through zzso it is unclear whether these variations are caused by a high local zzso rate, a failure of repair mechanisms, or a relaxed selective zzso The marked diversity of zzso in zzso and the low zzso rate in our patient population indicate that zzso is more common than previously estimated, but may go zzso because of its variable clinical zzso Thus, zzso molecular testing may be indicated in individuals with isolated zzso zzso zzso or immune zzso
