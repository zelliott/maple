Through alternative zzso human zzso acquire longer or shorter 3' untranslated regions, the latter typically associated with higher transcript stability and increased protein zzso To understand the dynamics of zzso site zzso we performed zzso mapping of both binding sites of 3' end processing factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 3' end processing sites in zzso zzso We found that although binding sites of these factors generally cluster around the zzso sites most frequently used in zzso zzso and zzso proteins have much higher zzso specificity compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced a systematic use of zzso zzso sites, indicating that changes in relative abundance of a single 3' end processing factor can zzso the length of 3' untranslated regions across the zzso and suggesting a mechanism behind the previously observed increase in tumor cell zzso upon zzso zzso zzso
