In zzso zzso there is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that exhibits significant sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso but does not zzso zzso zzso zzso that, like zzso cannot zzso zzso are represented in a highly divergent set of bacteria (including an zzso zzso zzso and zzso yet are missing from other bacteria, including zzso and certain zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso family suggests that the zzso proteins form a zzso group that zzso outside the zzso bacterial zzso zzso These observations are consistent with a model in which the absences of zzso from bacteria are due to its loss during zzso It has recently been shown that zzso from zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso are required for catalyzing the first reaction in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences shows zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences are zzso and that the partition of the zzso associated with the zzso of zzso zzso to that based on zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that horizontal gene transfer played an important role in the evolution of the regulation of zzso zzso
