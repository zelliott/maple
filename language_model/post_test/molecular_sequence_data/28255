The tax protein of zzso increases the level of zzso zzso produced from the zzso long terminal repeat zzso and also activates zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso promoter, which is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is also zzso by the tax zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso by tax, we analyzed zzso promoter deletion zzso to determine zzso sequence requirements for zzso of this zzso Our results show that removal of different upstream regions within the promoter does not result in loss of zzso indicating that tax does not appear to interact with a single DNA binding protein to activate the zzso zzso In addition, tax and zzso together activate the zzso promoter in a greater than additive fashion, suggesting that these proteins function zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso by the tax protein are zzso
