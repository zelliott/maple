The avian zzso zzso gene product blocks the surface zzso and, as a result, cells become immune to related zzso zzso On the other hand, the same sequence can be included in the zzso zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso However, since the complete zzso gene sequence was not known, the comparison of zzso zzso sequences was not zzso Therefore an avian zzso zzso with an intact zzso gene was cloned from a chicken gene bank and the regions coding for the C zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins were zzso zzso of this sequence with those of other zzso proved that one of the zzso viruses associated with zzso is a cross between avian zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso zzso and, especially, zzso zzso are traditionally of the most developed models of viral zzso Many zzso zzso are implicated in zzso transformation of the zzso For instance, zzso mouse zzso tumor virus of some zzso lines appears to be the only zzso agent in these zzso zzso Other even zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso acute zzso zzso Some zzso zzso are implicated in the zzso or zzso of cellular zzso Our interest in zzso viruses is based on their ability to make cells resistant to zzso zzso zzso of their major envelope zzso leads to cellular surface zzso zzso and zzso immunity to infection by the related leukemia zzso This problem is quite elaborated for chicken zzso virus zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
