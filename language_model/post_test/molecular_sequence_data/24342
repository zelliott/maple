zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are an important cause of acute zzso in zzso While zzso have been genetically classified into three major genetic groups consisting of 17 genetic subgroups, a zzso of zzso into comparable genetic groups remains to be zzso In an attempt to zzso both zzso and zzso zzso the sequences of 2 zzso strains newly detected from French infants were zzso together with the published sequences of 9 zzso and 19 zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were conducted on the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' open reading frame zzso zzso overlapping the zzso zzso and 3' untranslated region zzso The zzso showing frequency distribution of zzso distances and the zzso of the zzso tree demonstrated that zzso and zzso could be classified zzso on the basis of the entire zzso sequences and that the 11 zzso strains could be genetically classified into 3 major genetic groups, zzso I, II and III, comprised of 5 genetic zzso The differentiation of the 11 zzso strains into these genetic groups was also maintained in the 4 remaining zzso regions, while the sequences at the junction between the zzso zzso and zzso genes were shown to be zzso
