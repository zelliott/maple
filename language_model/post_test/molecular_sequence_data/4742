The human blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso member of the zzso family of adhesive molecules and is the only zzso zzso by genes physically linked in the zzso Because studies on the normal and abnormal expression of any gene require a thorough understanding of its organization, the initial goals of the current study were to determine the size and complete the zzso organization for the zzso zzso We now report the isolation of the entire zzso gene in a single zzso zzso and for the first time have linked the first and second zzso on a zzso zzso of zzso Using zzso gel analysis, we determined the full size of the zzso gene to be 63 zzso and show a large zzso zzso first zzso based on this information, we propose a uniform zzso system for the zzso zzso We have completed the zzso zzso structure and generated a long-range restriction zzso The promoter and the zzso end of the first zzso were found to have approximately 50% sequence identity with a region of the avian zzso gene known to possess functional zzso zzso Analysis of three different zzso regions led to the identification of a sequence in the zzso of the human zzso zzso which shares zzso identity with the avian gene and which bound nuclear proteins in zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso this sequence caused a zzso reduction in reporter gene zzso In these studies we have zzso determined the full length and zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso identified a large region of zzso between the zzso regions of the avian and human zzso and zzso identified a sequence in the zzso that zzso gene zzso Knowing the zzso structure of zzso has permitted the uncovering of new mechanisms of zzso causing zzso zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso and our findings will be valuable for such genetic analyses as well as for studies on the zzso regulation of zzso and other zzso zzso
