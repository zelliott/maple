zzso zzso 65 zzso produces zzso acid, the main zzso neurotransmitter in adult zzso zzso Previous experiments, performed in brain, showed that zzso gene possesses two zzso zzso although the significance is zzso Here, by rapid amplification of zzso ends method, two distinct zzso zzso zzso transcribed from two independent clusters of zzso start sites were identified in zzso rat zzso zzso results revealed that the two zzso zzso had distinct expression patterns during zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso gene expression was regulated by alternative promoters at the zzso zzso By using zzso zzso western zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso 69 zzso acids truncated form of full-length zzso zzso was zzso expressed during zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso gene expression in zzso may also be regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein was presented in zzso cells of Day 1 zzso primary zzso and zzso of zzso of Day 90 zzso The above results suggested that zzso gene expression is zzso regulated at multiple levels during zzso zzso zzso
