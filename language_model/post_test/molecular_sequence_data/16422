The regulated assembly of zzso is essential for bipolar zzso zzso Depending on cell type, zzso zzso through two different zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso dominates in cells lacking zzso 

Human zzso zzso for zzso zzso was originally implicated in zzso zzso but has since been shown to associate with zzso and play a role in astral zzso pole integrity in zzso zzso We have identified the zzso zzso of human zzso as a zzso protein that plays a role in focusing zzso poles and is essential for efficient zzso nucleation during zzso assembly without zzso zzso associates both with zzso a complex required for zzso nucleation and with zzso a protein required for zzso nucleation and zzso pole zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleation in a process that may require coordinate zzso of zzso and zzso
