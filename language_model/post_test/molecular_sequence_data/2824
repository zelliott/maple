Several strains of cucumber mosaic virus zzso have been zzso and zzso acid zzso data indicate that these strains differ widely in zzso zzso We have constructed zzso clones of the coat protein coding regions of zzso strains C and zzso and have compared the zzso sequences of the zzso 3 zzso region, coat protein zzso and 3' untranslated region with published zzso sequences from the same regions of the zzso D and Y zzso These comparisons show that the C and zzso strains belong to different zzso subgroups, and that the zzso are more closely related in sequence than suggested by previous zzso acid zzso zzso
