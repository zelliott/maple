The zzso zzso and the truncated zzso were tested for zzso in zzso extracts of zzso and M zzso or by zzso zzso Our results indicated that a zzso zzso at zzso acids zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso during the entry of zzso while the zzso zzso site at the middle zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso II during zzso zzso Our results also showed that there was possibly another zzso zzso at site other than the middle portion of zzso zzso zzso during the entry of cells into zzso The demonstration of the characteristic changes in zzso of zzso during the cell cycle implicates important role of zzso in the control of the fate of zzso and cell zzso
