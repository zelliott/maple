During body zzso precisely coordinated cell movements and cell shape changes organize the newly differentiated cells of an zzso into functional zzso Here we describe two zzso zzso and zzso whose activities are necessary for initial steps of body zzso in zzso zzso In the absence of zzso and zzso activities, cells differentiate properly but fail to become zzso The external zzso cells fail to spread over and zzso the zzso and instead cluster on the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for egg laying and for proper zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso to cell boundaries and appear to directly zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso with zzso zzso implicated in binding the small zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso that interacts genetically with zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso may function at cell boundaries to regulate cell zzso and cell shape changes required for proper zzso and zzso
