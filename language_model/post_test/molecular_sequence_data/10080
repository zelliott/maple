In prior work we showed that a zzso is zzso from dog zzso cells and directly activated by zzso mast cell zzso The current work identifies the zzso as a canine zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso determines the sites zzso by zzso and explores the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso To obtain a zzso zzso the complete sequence of zzso zzso B, a zzso zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso predicts a zzso acid protein zzso identical to human zzso zzso zzso thought to be critical for active site zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso are entirely zzso zzso of zzso B by zzso dog zzso yielded an approximately zzso product that contained two zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso predicted zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso B at the zzso and zzso zzso Like zzso cells, the C2 line of dog zzso cells zzso zzso zzso B which is activated by zzso By contrast, zzso C1 cells zzso a zzso B (which remains in its zzso only in response to zzso Whereas zzso stimulation of zzso cells produced a approximately zzso increase in zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso its expression by approximately zzso Thus, zzso stimuli may regulate the amount of mast cell zzso B expressed by mast zzso These data further support a role for mast cell zzso in tissue zzso involving zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso
