To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation of the zzso gene deletion zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso which is located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso from individuals with the zzso zzso and compared it with the sequences of wild type zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence (up to 324 zzso from the zzso site in zzso 9) of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso is identical to that of the wild zzso zzso However, the zzso sequence zzso from 325 zzso from the zzso site in zzso 9) of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso is identical to that of the wild zzso zzso indicating that the zzso region of zzso and the zzso region of zzso linked directly eliminating the whole zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso specific to the zzso gene and the zzso and zzso genes confirmed that all DNA samples obtained from 7 individuals carrying the zzso zzso possessed the same break zzso These results indicate that the zzso of the zzso gene deletion lies in the zzso region of the zzso and zzso zzso
