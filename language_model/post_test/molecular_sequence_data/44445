A diesel zzso zzso was zzso in zzso by the injection of zzso zzso and zzso and nutrients in order to stimulate microbial zzso After zzso years of zzso an zzso sample was excavated and the material was used zzso to isolate bacterial strains able to grow on selected zzso under zzso conditions and zzso to construct a laboratory zzso column in order to simulate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Five bacterial strains isolated from the zzso sample were able to grow on zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso and nine bacterial strains grew on zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and strains zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso differences were also reflected in small sequence zzso in domain III of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analyses of the zzso zzso of one isolate zzso and zzso of each group revealed a close zzso relationship for both groups of zzso to organisms of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting the experimental zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso group, and zzso zzso were used to investigate the significance of zzso zzso zzso in the laboratory zzso zzso The number of bacteria in the column determined after zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells g of zzso zzso About zzso (in the zzso zone of the zzso to zzso (in the zzso zone of the zzso of these bacteria were zzso by using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso are significant members of the indigenous zzso More than zzso of the total number of bacteria were zzso by using zzso targeting higher zzso zzso zzso zzso of these bacteria belonged to the beta subdivision of the class zzso zzso and 10 to zzso belonged to the zzso zzso of the zzso were present in high numbers zzso only in the zzso zone of the zzso
