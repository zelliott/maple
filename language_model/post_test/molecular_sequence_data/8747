zzso has been implicated in the embryonic and fetal development of the mouse and as an zzso in zzso breast zzso We describe a procedure to purify the product of the mouse zzso gene and show it to be a potent zzso for some zzso cell zzso Using a zzso binding competition zzso zzso was shown to bind with high affinity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and with a lower affinity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso approximately 9 zzso No competition for the binding of zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells containing individual zzso receptors showed a pattern of response in agreement with the zzso binding zzso A comparison of two zzso zzso cell lines showed a marked difference of potency and dependence upon zzso in their response to mouse zzso suggesting a complex interaction between the zzso and its low and high affinity zzso
