We describe here the cloning and sequence characterization of the absolute zzso of several zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The 3' protruding strand of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the sequence zzso zzso This zzso sequence is adjacent to zzso repeated blocks of zzso sequence consisting of variable numbers of the zzso repeat zzso variable numbers of an zzso repeat zzso and a single zzso zzso in that zzso A number of zzso more zzso zzso sequences were found adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that some of these zzso adjacent sequences are found on all zzso zzso zzso some are more abundant on certain zzso of zzso and some are unique to individual zzso
