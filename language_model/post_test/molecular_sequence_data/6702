zzso zzso C was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to rescue zzso zzso cells deficient in zzso zzso zzso This suggested that zzso C might play a role in cell cycle control, but progress toward understanding the function of this zzso has been hampered by the lack of information on a potential zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a human protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso that is likely to be a zzso partner of zzso zzso A specific interaction between zzso and zzso C could be demonstrated after translation of zzso and zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso C could be detected in zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells, indicating that the two proteins form a complex also in zzso The zzso C complex is structurally related to zzso a zzso pair recently shown to be part of the zzso zzso II zzso of zzso zzso zzso we propose that human zzso C might be functionally associated with the zzso zzso apparatus, perhaps involved in relaying zzso zzso
