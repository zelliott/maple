zzso and zzso nuclear zzso form a complex that regulates zzso from promoters containing zzso protein zzso binding zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso are necessary for formation of the zzso that binds to zzso zzso zzso in the basic region of zzso or zzso can influence the binding of the zzso to DNA, zzso a symmetrical binding zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibit increased affinity for zzso and are capable of suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in the basic domain of zzso which prevent binding to DNA in association with zzso do not significantly diminish the ability of the zzso zzso to bind to zzso These dominant negative zzso are functional in zzso and can be exploited to study the role of zzso and zzso in normal and transformed zzso
