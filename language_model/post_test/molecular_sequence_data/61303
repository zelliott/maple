zzso and zzso cell hybrid panels have earlier demonstrated extended zzso conservation between human zzso 3 zzso and pig zzso 13 zzso In the present study, eight human genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spread along the length of zzso were chosen for expanding the comparative map between the two zzso Using human and rat zzso or zzso and zzso zzso products as zzso 8 zzso zzso clones were zzso After zzso and partial sequence determination, identity of the clones with regards to the specific genes was zzso The eight type 1 markers thus obtained were zzso labeled and FISH mapped to pig zzso zzso All zzso clones localized to zzso In combination with the zzso published mapping data of coding sequences on zzso a preliminary comparative status depicting the relative organization of this zzso with respect to zzso was zzso The comparative map thus obtained bears significance in searching for candidate genes of economically important traits mapped to zzso
