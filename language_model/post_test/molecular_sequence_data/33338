zzso insertions occasionally occur in the promoter regions of plant zzso many of which are still capable of being zzso However, it remains unclear how zzso of such promoters is able to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into various genes of zzso zzso can zzso leaky zzso without its zzso These zzso named zzso zzso often contain zzso in their promoter zzso Two zzso at different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both contain zzso at a similar position immediately upstream of the promoter zzso however, these insertions had different zzso zzso Under conditions where the inserted zzso is zzso the zzso line produces pale red zzso whereas the zzso line produces no zzso These pigmentation patterns are correlated with the level of transcripts from the zzso or zzso zzso and these zzso activities are independent of DNA zzso in their promoter zzso In zzso zzso is inserted in an orientation that results in the 3' end of zzso adjacent to the zzso region of the gene coding zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso in the opposite zzso Four of five different zzso genes that are also zzso zzso and contain zzso within the promoter region share the same zzso orientation as zzso The different zzso activities dependent on zzso orientation in the zzso promoters were consistent with expression of zzso reporter zzso introduced into zzso zzso but not with transient expression of these zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that for zzso to sustain stable zzso activity in various promoters it must be embedded in zzso
