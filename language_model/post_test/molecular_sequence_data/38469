The systemic lupus zzso syndrome in zzso mice involves zzso zzso zzso particularly antinuclear zzso that target zzso DNA, and zzso zzso Although T cell help is required for the generation of antinuclear zzso the zzso recognized by such helper T cells are zzso To address this question, we isolated and zzso self peptides bound by zzso class II molecules from zzso zzso We identified a number of peptides that are not seen in similar preparations from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso donors include zzso a protein component of a small nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso processing zzso We zzso that the peptides from these donors are T cell zzso required for the generation of the most frequent antinuclear zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso
