zzso resides in the outer nuclear membrane zzso and binds the zzso membrane protein zzso to form zzso zzso junctions in zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression during zzso results in the zzso of two additional binding partners, zzso and zzso Here, we map the zzso of zzso responsible for zzso targeting and partner zzso zzso targeting requires both the zzso signal zzso sequence and the zzso zzso domain of zzso The zzso signal zzso sequence may anchor zzso in the zzso by bridging to the inner nuclear zzso A region encompassing the zzso domain is sufficient to bind zzso zzso and zzso bind to distinct regions in the zzso tail of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells causes a growth zzso in low zzso that is rescued by additional copies of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grow faster than zzso zzso cells in limiting zzso zzso deleting the zzso domain of zzso abrogates the zzso zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso from the zzso possible by affecting the trafficking of zzso zzso to the plasma zzso
