zzso is cloned from zzso as a zzso to deliver copper to the zzso of assembly for zzso c zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a key zzso for cellular zzso and a zzso in its function is associated with severe zzso or infantile zzso zzso and early zzso Recently, we found that zzso is not only required for zzso zzso zzso but also is essential for embryonic growth and development in zzso zzso zzso To investigate its zzso features, zzso human zzso was zzso and zzso without a zzso zzso It specifically binds zzso at a zzso copper content of zzso under reduced conditions and significantly activates the zzso zzso in zzso Although the zzso complex was maintained between pH values from zzso to zzso zzso was completely released from zzso at pH zzso An acute exposure of excess amount of copper zzso to mouse cells resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso whereas copper zzso maintained the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the stringent selectivity of zzso for copper is required for zzso zzso to prevent copper overload, or promote the supply of zzso
