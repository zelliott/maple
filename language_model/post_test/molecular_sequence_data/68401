The binding zzso and pharmacological selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in serial frozen sections from rat zzso prior to ultraviolet zzso zzso in conditions of zzso zzso analysis of zzso binding experiments indicated that zzso binds to both a high zzso zzso zzso zzso and a low zzso zzso 38 zzso affinity zzso zzso to the zzso site was no longer zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this site zzso to zzso zzso This interpretation was further supported by the zzso zzso of the binding of zzso by zzso zzso zzso to the zzso site was totally zzso in a zzso fashion, by a variety of zzso drugs among which zzso zzso showed the highest order of zzso It is concluded that, in the zzso range, zzso constitutes a highly selective tool for zzso labeling of zzso receptors in rat brain zzso
