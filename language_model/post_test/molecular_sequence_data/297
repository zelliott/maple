A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of the zzso gene were amplified separately and fused by overlap extension zzso The fused product was cloned in zzso expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso were selected on zzso zzso plate and their ability to produce the zzso was evaluated in flask zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso the zzso zzso into the medium and produced the high level of zzso activity zzso zzso after 96 h of zzso The zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso showed maximum activity at pH zzso and temperature 60 degrees zzso The zzso zzso did not exhibit any zzso activity and hence it could be potentially used for zzso of paper pulp before zzso
