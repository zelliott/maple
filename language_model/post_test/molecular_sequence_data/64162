A number of zzso that finely regulate immune response have been implicated in the zzso or protection of type 1 diabetes and other zzso zzso It is, therefore, of pivotal importance to examine a family of proteins that serve as signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which regulate the zzso of a variety of zzso We report here a defective gene zzso located on zzso 11 within a previously mapped zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso diabetic zzso zzso Our sequencing analysis revealed a unique zzso zzso that results in a zzso to zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso is zzso in all identified zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling predicted that the zzso zzso has a weaker DNA zzso which was confirmed by zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso regulation ability of the zzso zzso is proved by decreased levels of zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were shown by Western zzso to have lower levels in zzso compared with normal B6 zzso These proteins have been implicated in immune regulation, zzso zzso cell death, and control of zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a key molecular zzso in zzso zzso
