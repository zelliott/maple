To clarify the zzso difference of the zzso zzso zzso we determined the complete zzso sequence of the genes zzso the constant portion of mouse zzso of a zzso as well as b zzso zzso A comparison of the sequences revealed that there were 12 zzso zzso 2 zzso changes in zzso and zzso 3 in zzso and 7 in zzso Five of them were silent changes, but seven resulted in zzso acid zzso Although the silent changes are scattered through zzso to zzso the zzso zzso were found only in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso that conventional zzso detect most likely reflects an zzso acid zzso in zzso and/or zzso
