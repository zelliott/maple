zzso virus encodes an zzso zzso required during DNA replication for zzso viral DNA zzso to yield zzso viral zzso The zzso junctions contain zzso repeat sequences that can be zzso as zzso yielding Holliday zzso Previous work indicated that zzso can cleave Holliday junctions in zzso To investigate the mechanism of action of zzso we have zzso reaction conditions and characterized the sequence specificity of zzso We found that addition of zzso zzso zzso product formation zzso resulting in improved sensitivity of zzso zzso To analyze zzso zzso we took advantage of mobile Holliday zzso in which branch migration allowed sampling of many DNA zzso We found that zzso zzso favors zzso at the sequence zzso downward zzso and so is much less sequence specific than its zzso coli relative, zzso Analysis of the reaction products revealed that zzso zzso to leave a 3' zzso at the zzso zzso zzso
