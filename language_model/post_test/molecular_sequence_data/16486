zzso zzso on the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso offer the possibility of comparing the appearance of zzso proteins at different zzso zzso We raised a zzso zzso that recognized a 130 zzso zzso designated zzso zzso analysis of isolated zzso showed that zzso is heavily accumulated in a specific zzso called zzso ring 3; only occasionally is zzso abundant in one or two additional zzso on other zzso The zzso was sensitive to zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso is associated with nascent zzso As shown by zzso zzso zzso is distributed along the active zzso zzso The full sequence of zzso was determined by zzso zzso The protein comprises zzso zzso acids and contains three WW zzso in the zzso half and six zzso zzso in the zzso half of the zzso The protein is zzso from zzso zzso to zzso the human zzso is known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the abundance of zzso in zzso is connected with the exceptionally high level of zzso in this locus and that zzso adjusts the zzso rate to the numerous zzso events taking place along the gene to ensure proper zzso
