zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulates dramatic changes in the pattern of protein zzso This shift is brought about entirely through selective translation of the large pool of maternal zzso zzso and stored during zzso My laboratory has identified zzso clones to more than 20 different zzso maternal zzso These have been used to determine whether the complementary zzso are translated in zzso or zzso and to analyze the zzso status of the zzso at different zzso For 14 of the zzso zzso overlapping zzso clones were isolated, and the complete sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso Of these 14 zzso half are from the subset that is translated in growing and zzso zzso but not in zzso These 7 zzso have zzso tails before zzso The other 7 are from the subset that is not translated at any time before zzso and has very short zzso tails in zzso After zzso these zzso are recruited onto zzso and extensively zzso The sequence data from the two classes of maternal zzso was compared in an attempt to identify consensus sequences that could regulate translation directly, or zzso by controlling zzso or secondary structure zzso Two features of the sequences correlate very well with the translation and zzso of the different zzso identity of the base immediately preceding the zzso start zzso and the presence of the sequences zzso and zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso
