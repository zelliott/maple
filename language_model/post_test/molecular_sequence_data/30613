The partial zzso heat capacities of various peptides and various organic compounds that model the zzso acid zzso or their parts in zzso solution have been determined by precise scanning zzso in the temperature range from 5 to 125 degrees zzso This provides an estimate of the partial zzso heat capacity of the zzso and the zzso of all zzso acid zzso The values obtained are compared with the values found for these substances in the gaseous phase, in order to define the zzso zzso It has been shown that the partial heat capacity of the zzso groups is positive at low temperature (5 degrees zzso and decreases with increasing temperature, while for the polar and charged groups it is negative at low temperature, becomes zero at room temperature and increases further with increasing zzso This leads to a zzso scale of the zzso acid zzso based upon the temperature zzso of their heat zzso Due to the observed specificity in the temperature zzso at room temperature, the heat capacities of zzso acid zzso correlate well with the zzso surface zzso
