The Mr zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso is part of a bacterial zzso zzso The zzso transfers the zzso group from zzso zzso to the second zzso in the zzso DNA sequence zzso We have used the zzso zzso analog zzso zzso to identify peptides at the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso analog zzso The zzso zzso in the absence of DNA for the analog and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso and zzso values, obtained with the zzso DNA zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso occurs upon zzso with ultraviolet light and is inhibited by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso generated several zzso zzso zzso sequencing from independent zzso experiments revealed two zzso peptides containing zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso peptides precluded assignment of modified zzso zzso
