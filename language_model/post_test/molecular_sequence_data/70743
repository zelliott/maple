The Nuclear Factor I zzso family of zzso proteins is essential for zzso DNA replication and the zzso of many cellular zzso zzso have four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has only a single zzso zzso and zzso have zzso To assess the relationship between members of this unusually small family of zzso factors, we mapped the zzso locations of the four zzso zzso genes and analyzed the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The four zzso zzso genes are on zzso 4 zzso and zzso 8 zzso and 10 zzso suggesting early zzso of the genes and zzso throughout the zzso The zzso zzso of all four zzso genes are zzso by large zzso zzso zzso with identical zzso zzso and donor sites in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso gene has four phased zzso interrupting this zzso zzso zzso and the last zzso extends zzso zzso past the zzso site used in all four zzso zzso In addition, the zzso present in zzso zzso zzso are missing from the zzso genes of zzso and all zzso zzso zzso This analysis of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes indicates that the zzso genes were probably generated by zzso of a zzso zzso ancestral zzso but that significant changes have occurred in the zzso organization of either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes during zzso
