The characterization of a novel zzso factor, zzso is zzso The zzso gene was identified by a zzso that causes zzso in a zzso strain lacking the nuclear zzso complex zzso zzso is similar in sequence to zzso proteins that have zzso and zzso acid repeat sequences characteristic of a family of zzso zzso We show that zzso is a component of zzso zzso zzso and is essential for zzso zzso The composition of zzso zzso zzso is altered in zzso zzso zzso zzso of these strains are unable to support any of the defined steps of zzso unless zzso zzso is zzso Although the in zzso zzso in zzso zzso reporter zzso in a zzso zzso strain is comparatively mild, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso site or zzso sequences is more defective in the zzso strain than in zzso zzso By use of reporters that have two competing zzso zzso sites, a loss of efficient zzso to the cap zzso zzso site is observed in zzso cells, analogous to the zzso seen in strains lacking zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso from zzso but not from zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction, and that this interaction contributes to normal zzso zzso site zzso
