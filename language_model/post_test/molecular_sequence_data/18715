During embryonic development of zzso zzso environmental stresses induce the zzso zzso phenomenon, required to resist zzso and regulate cell cycle zzso The small zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein modifier, plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso regulates multiple cellular zzso including development and other biological zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso zzso termination and the role of zzso in this processes and in early zzso development of zzso zzso still remains zzso In this study, the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso sumo zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso from zzso zzso were zzso The zzso expression patterns of zzso sumo zzso zzso zzso B and the location of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso E proteins were analyzed during different zzso stages of the zzso of zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso was used to verify the function of zzso in zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso a 92 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso a 245 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso B zzso was zzso zzso zzso a 133 zzso acid zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso B were highest at the 10 h stage of embryonic development, and zzso zzso showed its highest expression at 0 zzso The expression of zzso showed no tissue or organ zzso Western zzso showed high expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso E at the 10 h zzso The zzso caused abnormal development of the zzso with increased zzso and zzso zzso is a crucial regulation and modification protein resumption of embryonic zzso and early zzso development of zzso zzso
