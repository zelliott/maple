The transcripts of the zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso protection zzso primer extension zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso end of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso revealed that there were two zzso zzso with the zzso ends located at 16 zzso and 307 zzso upstream from the zzso coding zzso Since these two zzso might represent two species of zzso transcribed from two different promoters or a single transcript that was processed to give two zzso an in zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to distinguish these two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of two transcripts initiated from the same zzso indicated by zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified zzso coli zzso zzso sequences immediately upstream from both zzso start points zzso The first promoter zzso zzso had the core sequence zzso was 6 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso and was centered at 37 zzso upstream from the coding zzso The second promoter zzso zzso had the core sequence zzso was 7 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso and was centered at zzso zzso upstream from the coding zzso This is the first demonstration of multiple promoters in this zzso zzso zzso which has implications concerning zzso zzso
