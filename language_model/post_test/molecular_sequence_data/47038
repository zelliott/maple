zzso is an zzso protein that is either absent or zzso in patients affected by the fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of mental zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein has suggested that zzso binding is related to the presence of two zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso However, no attempt has been so far made to map the zzso sites along the protein sequence and to identify possible differential zzso zzso In the present article, we describe work done to dissect zzso into regions with structurally and functionally distinct zzso A zzso approach was followed to identify four zzso an zzso stretch of 200 zzso zzso the two zzso regions, and a zzso zzso Each region was produced as a zzso zzso zzso and zzso for its state of folding by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso show formation of secondary structure with a strong tendency to zzso Of the two zzso zzso zzso only the first one is folded whereas the second remains unfolded even when it is extended both zzso and zzso The zzso is, as expected from its zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were then performed using the zzso zzso Our results show that only the first zzso domain but not the second binds to zzso and provide the first direct evidence for zzso binding of both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binding for the zzso could not be predicted from sequence analysis because no known zzso motif is identifiable in this zzso Different sequence specificity was observed for the zzso both the zzso of the protein and zzso bind zzso to zzso The zzso region, which contains the zzso box, is zzso as it recognizes the bases with comparable zzso We therefore conclude that zzso is a protein with multiple sites of interaction with zzso sequence specificity is most likely achieved by the whole block that comprises the first approximately 400 zzso whereas the zzso provides a zzso binding zzso
