zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso amount of zzso and with zzso resulted in the specific labeling of one zzso protein which migrated very close to the position of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso in two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso of protein zzso in this zzso system was zzso by correlation with its position in the standard two-dimensional zzso gel zzso after its specific zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was dependent on the presence of zzso and could be attributed to zzso binding from the results of chase experiments and zzso zzso this binding being very likely responsible for the slight shift in the zzso position of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in the absence of zzso induced the release of the bound zzso
