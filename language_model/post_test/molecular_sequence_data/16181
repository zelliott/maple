A genetic locus is described that specifies two zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso The genes specifying the two zzso are separated by only 67 base pairs and are transcribed in the same zzso The product zzso contain 128 and 190 zzso and are designated zzso and zzso zzso These zzso resemble zzso of other zzso in nuclear zzso and possession of a zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso is related in sequence to previously described zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso exhibit properties consistent with zzso organization and hydrogen bonding to zzso species, suggesting possible roles in zzso zzso The zzso species zzso with zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is associated with a zzso zzso Gene disruption in zzso followed by replacement of the zzso zzso reveals that zzso is essential, whereas zzso is zzso
