zzso is unusual in having zzso zzso of Mr 260,000 zzso two zzso chains (Mr zzso each of which is a zzso of eight zzso linked zzso of about Mr zzso The zzso acid sequence of one of these zzso zzso has been zzso It has 147 zzso and Mr of zzso including zzso zzso alignment revealed zzso identity with zzso whale zzso whereas other zzso and zzso zzso had between 13 and zzso zzso However, a much higher percentage of zzso has a similar side chain character, suggesting that the domain E1 is very similar to other zzso in showing the zzso zzso zzso model building based on the known three-dimensional structure of zzso further supports this zzso zzso the differences between E1 and other zzso are believed to reflect differences in the packing of the zzso first in a zzso zzso zzso containing eight zzso and subsequently by association of two of these zzso as zzso These findings provide further evidence for the versatility of the zzso zzso
