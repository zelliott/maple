Our laboratories are interested in characterizing genes involved in the myriad of zzso diseases affecting the domestic dog, zzso lupus zzso and in development of detailed genetic and physical maps of the canine zzso Included in these efforts is examination of conservation of the genetic organization, structure, and function of gene families involved in diseases of the canine skin, zzso and zzso To that end, study of the highly zzso zzso gene family was zzso zzso belong to the zzso of intermediate filaments and are the major structural proteins of the zzso hair, and zzso The zzso are highly zzso throughout zzso evolution both at the DNA and zzso acid sequence zzso zzso in genes zzso zzso zzso are known to cause various diseases in humans, and similar zzso presentations have been reported in the zzso The zzso are divided into two groups, type I zzso and type II zzso In the human, the genes zzso the zzso and basic zzso are clustered on zzso 17 and 12, zzso The same genetic arrangement is seen in the mouse with the zzso and basic zzso gene clusters found on zzso 11 and 15, zzso zzso here are the zzso zzso of zzso and basic canine zzso genes as well as supportive sequence zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso experiments with clones isolated from a canine zzso library suggest that the zzso zzso gene cluster resides on zzso and the basic zzso gene cluster is located on zzso
