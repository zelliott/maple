The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso which contains the genes zzso the zzso zzso protein and the reaction center complex of the purple zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso which consisted of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a new variety in zzso bacteria in the sense that zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso of the reaction center deduced from the zzso sequence revealed that this zzso contains only three possible zzso zzso the zzso motif of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso was not zzso This is the first exception of the zzso zzso family in purple bacteria and green zzso zzso The zzso sequence also revealed that the sixth zzso zzso to zzso and zzso irons were not present in the zzso zzso This zzso was actually detected in membrane preparation as a zzso protein and shown to associate functionally with the zzso reaction center as the immediate electron donor to the zzso special pair of zzso This new zzso should be useful for studies on the role of each zzso in the zzso zzso of the bacterial reaction center and the evolution of proteins in zzso electron transfer zzso
