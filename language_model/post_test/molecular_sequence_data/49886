The replication zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and used in zzso I protection zzso in zzso zzso protected a zzso region of the origin of replication of zzso This region, which lies immediately downstream of the zzso box, contains four copies of the sequence motif zzso zzso analyses identified this sequence as the binding site specifically recognized by zzso (the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso boxes was ordered and zzso with the box closest to the zzso binding site zzso 1) occupied first and the most distant boxes zzso 3 and 4) occupied zzso However, only boxes 1, 2, and 4 were essential for origin activity, with box 3 playing a lesser zzso zzso the spacing between box 1 and the other three boxes affected binding of zzso in zzso and origin activity in zzso indicating that the zzso molecules bound to zzso interact with one zzso
