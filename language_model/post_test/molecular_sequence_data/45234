zzso and zzso are closely related proteins of the zzso zzso zzso that mediate feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by zzso binding to the following two membrane zzso the escort protein zzso thus preventing zzso processing of zzso regulatory zzso zzso and the cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus inducing the zzso and zzso degradation of the zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso in zzso which zzso the fourth zzso zzso at the zzso side of the zzso zzso is essential for its dual zzso When zzso was zzso to zzso the zzso zzso lost the ability to bind to zzso and, thus, was unable to suppress the zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso The zzso zzso was ineffective also in accelerating zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution of the corresponding zzso acid in zzso produced the same dual zzso These studies identify a single zzso acid zzso that is crucial for the function of zzso proteins in regulating cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso
