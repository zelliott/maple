A zzso zzso region of the bovine ephemeral fever virus zzso zzso located zzso zzso downstream of the N zzso has been cloned and zzso The region contains two long open reading frames zzso which are bounded by putative consensus zzso and zzso zzso sequences and are separated by an zzso region of 53 zzso zzso zzso corresponding to each zzso have been zzso The first zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was identified by zzso sequencing as the zzso G zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the G protein includes putative signal and zzso zzso and five potential zzso zzso The second zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids which also has characteristics of a zzso zzso including putative signal and zzso zzso and eight potential zzso sites, and appears to zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 72, zzso A database search indicated that both the G and zzso proteins share significant zzso acid sequence zzso with other zzso G proteins and with each zzso zzso zzso scores for each protein were with zzso virus and zzso zzso virus zzso
