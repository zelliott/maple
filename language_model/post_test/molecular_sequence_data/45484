zzso peptides zzso have diversified from a single zzso in zzso and zzso to multiple zzso in zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso and/or up to four zzso zzso 2, 3, and/or 4) have been zzso To trace the evolutionary diversification of zzso in fishes, we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso believed to be the most primitive extant zzso fish, for the presence of any zzso by a zzso method using zzso that amplify all zzso zzso identified to zzso We have cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the heart and three zzso zzso 3, and 4) from the zzso An extensive search for zzso from the brain was not zzso The zzso of zzso zzso presented an zzso signal as in zzso fish zzso The zzso zzso zzso had zzso repeats in the zzso region as observed in all zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso had a long zzso zzso sequence extending from the zzso ring as does zzso zzso The three zzso zzso are structurally similar to each zzso counterpart and are grouped after molecular zzso zzso zzso was most abundantly expressed in the atrium, zzso in the zzso and zzso was expressed in both atrium and zzso The three zzso are most abundantly expressed in the brain, and zzso transcripts were found in small amounts in the zzso and zzso Taken together, it is clear that all major zzso exist prior to the whole zzso zzso that occurred in the zzso zzso Furthermore, this is the first observation that zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose genes are zzso in the same zzso coexist in a single fish species including zzso thereby confirming that zzso is not an zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso genes were generated by tandem zzso from the zzso zzso
