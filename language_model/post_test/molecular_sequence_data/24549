The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family 1, has been zzso at a molecular level using predictions from known protein sequences and structures and through zzso zzso Three critical zzso were identified and zzso to create zzso with altered and broadened zzso for use in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso sequences were expressed as zzso fusion proteins in zzso coli, with an added zzso to allow zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso orientation towards zzso the single zzso zzso enhances zzso specificity zzso and decreases zzso activity zzso without greatly altering its activity towards other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed towards zzso and zzso respectively, more dramatically impair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity than for other zzso resulting in two zzso with greatly broadened zzso zzso These include the first examples of zzso tailoring in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and high utility of these broad specificity zzso zzso in parallel synthesis were demonstrated by the formation of libraries of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Man in zzso preparations at 50 degrees C in the presence of organic zzso that could not be performed by zzso
