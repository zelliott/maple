zzso structure prediction by using zzso can involve sequence similarity searches, multiple sequence zzso identification and characterization of zzso secondary structure zzso zzso accessibility zzso automatic protein fold recognition, constructing three-dimensional models to atomic detail, and model zzso Not all protein structure prediction projects involve the use of all these zzso A central part of a typical protein structure prediction is the identification of a suitable structural target from which to extrapolate three-dimensional information for a query zzso The way in which this is done defines three types of zzso The first involves the use of standard and zzso zzso If a structural template remains zzso a second approach using zzso methods is zzso If a target fold cannot be reliably identified because inconsistent results have been obtained from zzso data zzso the project falls into the third type of project and will be virtually impossible to complete with any degree of zzso In this article, a set of protocols to predict protein structure from sequence is presented and distinctions among the three types of project are zzso These methods, if used appropriately, can provide valuable indicators of protein structure and zzso
