A novel human cellular structure has been identified that contains a unique zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso This complex was discovered using an zzso serum from a patient with motor and sensory zzso and contains a protein of 182 zzso The gene and zzso zzso the protein indicated an open reading frame with zzso zzso repeats and a single zzso recognition zzso Both the patient's serum and a rabbit serum raised against the zzso zzso protein zzso discrete zzso zzso designated as zzso bodies zzso that do not overlap with the zzso complex, zzso zzso or zzso The zzso associated with zzso represent a clustered set of transcripts that are presumed to reside within the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso complex is involved in the zzso regulation of gene expression by zzso a specific subset of gene transcripts involved in cell growth and zzso
