The satellite DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studied in a previous paper, is organized as zzso repeated zzso zzso in the three species showing high sequence zzso In the present paper, a zzso element zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso inserted into satellite DNA from zzso zzso are zzso The study of zzso element, of its zzso and the putative zzso that it would zzso suggests that it could be an active zzso zzso elements inserted into zzso elements have also been zzso It is the first time, to our knowledge, that a zzso has been described in zzso and it is also the first time that a zzso element inserted into a zzso has been zzso A zzso element, inserted into satellite DNA from zzso zzso and in zzso zzso also has been zzso The results seem to indicate that zzso events have participated in the satellite DNA zzso and zzso
