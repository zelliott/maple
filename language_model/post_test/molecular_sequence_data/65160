Although the control of zzso translation in the zzso zzso zzso has been studied zzso the mechanism of termination remains zzso Ten zzso isolated in a genetic screen for zzso of premature stop zzso in zzso genes were localized in the zzso gene zzso the zzso release factor zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso in contrast to other zzso caused a zzso zzso that correlated with decreased expression of zzso genes as well as a reporter zzso gene inserted into zzso zzso The zzso levels of several zzso zzso zzso but not their zzso were dramatically decreased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso models of zzso were constructed, allowing zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and offering an insight into the possible mechanism by which these zzso change the zzso translation termination zzso zzso of zzso translation in zzso and zzso correlated with the three-dimensional zzso of the zzso zzso close to the zzso motif presumably involved in the recognition of stop zzso in zzso zzso
