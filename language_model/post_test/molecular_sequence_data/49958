zzso zzso zzso zzso take up zzso fixed carbon from plant roots and zzso it to their external zzso Previous experiments have shown that zzso zzso zzso from zzso in the root is one form of exported zzso In this study, an analysis of the labeling in storage and structural carbohydrates after zzso zzso was provided to AM roots shows that this is not the only zzso for the flow of carbon from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso zzso and zzso during the development of the zzso are consistent with a significant flux of exported zzso The zzso among expressed zzso of putative sequences for zzso zzso zzso branching zzso zzso zzso and for the first zzso in zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso is zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso gene expression within zzso roots, zzso spores, and zzso are consistent with labeling observations using zzso zzso and zzso both of which indicate that zzso is zzso by the fungus in zzso spores and during zzso zzso of the labeling analyses and gene sequences for the regulation of zzso metabolism are discussed, and a zzso role for zzso in the AM zzso is zzso zzso of zzso taken from the host, long-term storage in spores, zzso from zzso zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso levels throughout the life zzso
