The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assemble to form the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is believed to mediate zzso synaptic transmission between zzso zzso fibers and the hair cells of the zzso In addition zzso and/or zzso expression has been described in zzso root zzso zzso zzso skin zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that selectively block the zzso channel could be valuable tools for zzso its role in these diverse zzso This study describes a novel zzso from the Western Atlantic species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is a zzso specific blocker of the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of the zzso family; sequence and zzso specificity comparisons between zzso and previously characterized zzso toxins indicate that the zzso acids in the zzso half of zzso are responsible for its preferential zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
