zzso A zzso from zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso family 26, was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso Analysis of the zzso course of zzso zzso by zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso carbon was retained on zzso of the middle zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso general zzso zzso By zzso cluster analysis zzso two zzso and two zzso zzso were shown to be zzso in all of the zzso zzso family 26 zzso zzso In addition, zzso suggested that family 26 was related to the zzso clan zzso 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 35, 39, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso which led to the prediction that zzso and zzso constitute the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of these zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to replace the two zzso with zzso and zzso while the two zzso zzso were changed to zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso properties were zzso The data showed that neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic decrease in zzso activity, suggesting that the two zzso zzso did not play a pivotal role in zzso In contrast, modification of either of the zzso zzso to zzso caused a dramatic decrease in zzso against carob zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not alter the apparent zzso zzso of zzso against these zzso while zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso against zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso showed that there was a rapid burst of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that there were no significant differences between the structures of the zzso and zzso forms of zzso These data are consistent with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
