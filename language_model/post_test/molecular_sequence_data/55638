The zzso recognized by helper T cells specific for the site E region of zzso zzso influenza virus zzso zzso have been defined by examining the zzso of zzso clones with sets of overlapping peptides of various lengths covering the zzso Two overlapping zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the minimal zzso for four of five representative zzso These sequences are located within a loop of the zzso closed by a zzso bond and presumably require zzso of this bond for interaction with the class II major zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso recognized by the fifth clone was dependent on the presence of an intact zzso bond for its expression and could not be represented by a synthetic zzso zzso of the linear zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso within all field strains of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, recognition of these sequences by the zzso clones is affected by the zzso pattern of the zzso and by zzso lying outside the minimal zzso Three distinct clones directed towards the sequence zzso were remarkably similar in their pattern of response to a set of synthetic zzso of the zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso other than those zzso the minimal zzso may be responsible for the different zzso observed for these clones with different field strains of zzso
