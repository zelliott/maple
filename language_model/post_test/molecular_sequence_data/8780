zzso zzso plays a central role in the growth and differentiation of zzso and contributes to several disease states including zzso zzso evidence suggests a role for zzso as an zzso agents that increase zzso zzso levels have been shown to inhibit production of zzso predominantly produced by T helper zzso 1 cells such as zzso and zzso gamma zzso In contrast, the production of zzso predominantly produced by zzso cells, is actually enhanced by these zzso In this report, we have performed transient zzso experiments with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso to investigate the key regulatory regions necessary for zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the mouse zzso line zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate the critical importance of two sequences within the zzso zzso region for zzso by these agents in zzso zzso one, a highly zzso zzso pair element present in genes expressed by zzso cells, called the zzso zzso element 0 zzso located between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and the other, two overlapping binding sites for the zzso factor zzso (but not zzso between zzso and zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso via the unique sequence combination zzso results in selective expression of the zzso gene in response to elevated levels of zzso zzso
