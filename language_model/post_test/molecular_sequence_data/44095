The zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso factors that arise from zzso zzso of a single zzso They influence the growth, zzso survival and fate of several cell zzso We have now discovered a set of new zzso growth factors, which we call zzso zzso these are zzso by their own gene and exhibit a distinct expression pattern in adult brain and developing zzso Like zzso the zzso domain of the new zzso binds to both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso stimulates different zzso zzso profiles from zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso mediate distinct biological processes by acting at different sites in zzso and zzso different zzso responses in zzso
