The location of zzso zzso zzso within zzso acute zzso leukemia linked to drugs targeting zzso II and infant acute leukemia zzso are biased toward the zzso zzso 12 region of zzso although lacking a comprehensive zzso To address this, blood samples were taken from breast cancer and zzso patients receiving zzso II inhibitor zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to interrogate the zzso 12 region of zzso for zzso Eleven of 19 observed zzso showed zzso junctions restricted to a single 5 zzso location within zzso zzso A similarly restricted distribution zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells exposed to either zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso The zzso hotspot was at the zzso edge of a zzso tract matched with a perfect zzso 101 zzso zzso A high stringency zzso II consensus sequence binding site was noted at the geometric zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to screen zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of DNA breaks adjacent to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the 3' zzso We propose a model zzso zzso II zzso the organization of zzso secondary structures, stabilized by zzso association, which are prone to zzso
