Trace metal zzso is tightly controlled in the brain, as even a slight zzso may severely impact normal brain zzso This is especially apparent in Alzheimer's disease, where brain zzso of trace metals such as copper and iron is zzso As it is known that iron and copper metabolism are linked, we wanted to investigate if a common mechanism could explain the increase in iron and decrease in copper seen in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso protein precursor zzso has been implicated in copper zzso from the zzso Furthermore, it was shown that iron regulatory proteins zzso which regulate iron zzso can block zzso zzso zzso In a zzso study we have therefore compared brain regional copper levels and zzso expression in mice with a targeted deletion of zzso Compared with controls, six week old zzso mice had significantly less brain copper in the zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso and whole brain, while zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed a trend toward zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that iron regulatory proteins affect brain copper levels, which has significant implications for neurodegenerative zzso
