The signal zzso networks that initiate zzso development in bacteria remain largely zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso regulates entry into its zzso zzso program using a novel zzso a cascade of zzso zzso known as zzso binding proteins zzso The zzso in the cascade function in sequential stages of early development, and several lines of evidence indicate that the cascade is zzso when zzso that function at one stage of development directly regulate zzso of an zzso gene important for the next zzso zzso We also show that the regulatory cascade is designed in a novel way that extensively expands on the typical use of zzso Instead of using only one zzso to regulate a particular gene or group of zzso which is the norm in other bacterial systems, the cascade uses multiple zzso to regulate zzso genes that are positioned at key transition points in early zzso Based on the locations of the putative zzso promoter binding sites, several different mechanisms of zzso zzso are possible, including the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso uses an zzso zzso strategy to make expression of zzso genes that zzso zzso transitions responsive to multiple signal zzso zzso which provide information that is important for a coordinated decision to advance the zzso zzso
