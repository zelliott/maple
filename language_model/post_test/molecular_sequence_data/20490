The two internal transcribed zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso DNA tandem repeat were examined in zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Although the DNA sequence of the ITS region zzso zzso core features of the zzso secondary structure of the zzso and zzso segments are zzso The results demonstrate that structural conservation of zzso zzso regions is facilitated primarily through zzso base changes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso although zzso of the zzso strand is potentially an additional mechanism for maintaining zzso zzso The major conclusion of the structural analysis of both ITS segments is that two factors appear to be involved in limiting the type of changes zzso a high zzso bias for both zzso and zzso and structural constraints at the zzso zzso
