The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso involved in both zzso regulation and cell cycle zzso Although a great deal is known concerning the structure, function, and regulation of the highly zzso zzso protein zzso little is known concerning these relationships in regard to zzso In this study, we constructed a series of zzso zzso to map the zzso of the zzso zzso that is critical for function of zzso in repression of acid zzso zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have identified numerous zzso critical for either zzso of the zzso zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Finally, analysis of zzso analogous to those previously identified in either zzso or zzso of zzso zzso suggested that the zzso of zzso activity in mechanistically different from that seen in the other zzso zzso
