It is zzso that the zzso organization of plant lateral zzso is based on two crossed zzso the zzso and the lateral zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression and function of which are dependent on the lateral zzso is reported in this zzso In the zzso zzso growth of the lateral zzso is zzso and although the size and shape of the zzso and zzso zzso are normal, the cell files at the lateral margins are zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso gene functions independently of the zzso of both floral organ identity and floral zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso factor with a zzso was shown to be required for cell zzso zzso gene expression is zzso and temporally unique and is expressed in a restricted number of zzso cells at the lateral regions of flower zzso floral organ zzso and young leaf zzso Our study strongly suggests that the zzso gene is involved in the molecular mechanism of lateral zzso development of lateral zzso in zzso
