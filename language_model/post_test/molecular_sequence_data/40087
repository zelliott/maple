zzso diseases are neurodegenerative disorders in humans and various animals associated with a zzso infectious zzso designated zzso zzso species seem to be resistant to the infection and no natural prion disease has been documented in zzso The zzso within the open reading frame of the prion protein gene are associated with the zzso of the species, and species zzso to prion zzso In the present study, the open reading frame of the prion protein zzso gene from 16 zzso dogs was cloned and screened for zzso One zzso zzso zzso was zzso the G to C zzso substitution results in a zzso to zzso acid change at zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso gene showed the highest zzso with that of zzso zzso when compared with other zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso 107 in canine prion protein genes were replaced by zzso and zzso respectively, in all the prion protein genes zzso These zzso might in turn affect the potential zzso interactions critical for zzso transmission of prion disease and might influence the canine zzso to prion zzso
