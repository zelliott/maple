zzso growth is highly zzso so that zzso bone and antler skin zzso develop together, at a rapid rate and in a manner reminiscent of their development in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both bone and skin, and is therefore a candidate to effect zzso between these zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the expression of zzso and its principal zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in antler zzso of zzso red zzso Using zzso and in zzso zzso intense and overlapping expression of zzso and its zzso was seen in developing zzso structures and in the underlying layers of velvet zzso zzso was located on both the cell surface and within the zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso acting via the zzso and possibly other zzso mechanisms, plays a central role in the zzso regulation of cell division and differentiation of developing antler bone and zzso
