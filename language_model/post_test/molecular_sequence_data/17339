To establish an improved zzso gene sequence database as part of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso project and to overcome the drawbacks of zzso identification systems and publicly accessible sequence databases, both strands of the zzso end of the zzso zzso DNA zzso of 81 type and reference strains zzso all zzso described zzso zzso were zzso Assuming a normal distribution for zzso distances of all unique zzso sequences and choosing a reporting criterion of zzso or zzso similarity for a zzso zzso a statistical error probability of zzso was zzso To evaluate this database, a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso coli positions 54 to zzso of 55 clinical zzso zzso (including those of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and analyzed by the zzso zzso Of these zzso 54 zzso had a similarity score above the proposed threshold using zzso 48 zzso of the sequences gave a perfect match, whereas zzso were found by searching National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso database zzso In contrast to zzso which showed four ambiguities at the species level zzso concerning zzso zzso versus zzso zzso the zzso database search yielded 18 zzso ambiguities and showed numerous matches exhibiting redundant or unspecified zzso Comparing molecular results with those of zzso procedures, ID 32 zzso zzso Marcy zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso failed to identify 13 zzso and 19 zzso zzso respectively, due to incorrect identification and/or categorization below acceptable zzso In contrast to zzso methods and the zzso database, the novel high-quality zzso sequence database provides excellent identification of zzso including rarely isolated species and zzso zzso
