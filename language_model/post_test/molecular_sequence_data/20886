zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso B yields several zzso zzso with substantially increased zzso zzso To better understand the structural and functional consequences of protein zzso zzso we have applied protein engineering and zzso zzso to zzso one of the most active zzso zzso Our initial investigation has focused on the role of an extended surface loop, created by linking the native zzso and zzso on protein zzso zzso zzso of the loop partially compensates for observed losses in secondary structure and the zzso temperature of zzso zzso the improvements are accompanied by zzso changes from zzso to zzso The crystal structures of one truncated zzso zzso Delta 7) in the zzso determined at zzso A resolution and with a bound zzso inhibitor at zzso A resolution confirmed the formation of a zzso by swapping of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Separately, the new protein zzso at zzso acid positions zzso convert the narrow access tunnel to the zzso zzso into a broad zzso for accelerated zzso entry and product exit while preserving the native zzso zzso for optimal zzso zzso
