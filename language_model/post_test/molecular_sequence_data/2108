zzso of zzso zzso by the viral regulatory protein zzso has been proposed recently to overcome a block to zzso zzso II zzso in zzso imposed by zzso leader zzso Interestingly, however, only full-length zzso rather than prematurely terminated zzso zzso are zzso in most zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe an in zzso system in which induction of a highly efficient zzso zzso II termination or zzso zzso processing event creates short zzso zzso with 3' ends that map to a region immediately downstream of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso is sequence dependent, generating short zzso zzso of zzso zzso that resemble in zzso transcripts observed in the absence of zzso and a zzso longer transcript of approximately zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso downstream sequences results in the loss of a discrete zzso but also fails to restore zzso transcription, indicating that termination actually is specified at the promoter and occurs at a site positioned by one or more elements located immediately upstream of the 3' end of the short zzso zzso with zzso zzso promoters and zzso zzso indicate that this event involves a concerted interaction between the promoter and zzso leader sequences and that zzso secondary structure formation may also be zzso These data provide direct evidence for zzso zzso transcripts and an in zzso approach to understanding the roles of cellular and viral regulatory proteins that mediate this process at the zzso zzso
