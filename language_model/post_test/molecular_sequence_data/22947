The zzso theory has been widely used in the studies of zzso and zzso of biological zzso Recently, introduction of the efficient generalized Born approximation has greatly extended its zzso to areas such as protein folding simulations where highly efficient zzso is zzso However, limitations have been found in the folding simulations of a well-studied beta hairpin with several generalized Born zzso and different force zzso These studies have raised the question whether the underlining zzso theory, on which the generalized Born model is zzso is adequate in the treatment of polar interactions for the challenging protein folding zzso To address the question whether the zzso theory in the current zzso might be insufficient, we directly tested our efficient zzso zzso zzso in the zzso folding zzso Good agreement between simulation and experiment was found for the zzso equilibrium structures when the zzso zzso zzso and a recently improved generalized Born zzso were zzso In addition simulated zzso properties also agree well with experiment in both zzso Finally, an overall agreement on the zzso folding mechanism was found between the current and previous zzso Thus, our simulations indicate that previously observed limitations are most likely due to imperfect zzso in previous generalized Born models but not due to the limitation of the zzso zzso
