The ability of zzso zzso leukemia virus to accelerate zzso in E zzso transgenic mice is frequently associated with zzso integration within a locus zzso zzso This locus contains not only the zzso gene implicated as a collaborator with zzso in zzso but also just upstream an unknown gene zzso zzso The zzso sequence reported here for zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences reveals that this widely expressed gene comprises at least 7 zzso and potentially encodes a zzso of 195 zzso acid zzso Computer searches with this zzso sequence revealed no close zzso in the databases, nor any zzso zzso and it is unrelated to the product of the zzso zzso which lies just upstream from the zzso zzso zzso
