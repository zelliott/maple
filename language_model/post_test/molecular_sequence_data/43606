To determine the frequency of zzso in the regulatory domain of the gap junction protein zzso 43 in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso screening of the terminal 200 base pairs of zzso gene coding sequence in a series of patients from zzso care zzso 

48 patients with zzso zzso attending UK Regional zzso zzso zzso 

No changes from the published zzso consensus sequence were found in any of the 48 patients zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso sites in zzso regulatory domain of the zzso gene are rare in patients with zzso zzso
