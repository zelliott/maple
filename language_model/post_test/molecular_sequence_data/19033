Drug resistance emerges in an ecological context where fitness costs restrict the diversity of escape zzso These pathways are targets for drug discovery, and here we demonstrate that we can identify zzso zzso that zzso target resistant zzso Combining zzso and zzso zzso may prevent the emergence of competitively viable zzso We tested this hypothesis with a clinically derived zzso zzso malaria zzso and with zzso derived by in zzso selection with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We screened a chemical library against zzso and zzso lines and discovered a zzso compound zzso that was potent only in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, in zzso selection of zzso zzso resistant to zzso restored zzso sensitivity, thereby indicating that zzso might once again be useful as a malaria zzso In parallel experiments, we selected zzso zzso lines resistant to structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both selections yielded resistant lines with the same point zzso in zzso We discovered a compound zzso more potent against zzso than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso yielded a zzso to the zzso protein sequence and zzso although the zzso sequence was zzso zzso selection with a combination of zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso did not yield resistant zzso These two examples demonstrate that the compromise between resistance and evolutionary fitness can be exploited to design therapies that prevent the emergence and spread of resistant zzso
