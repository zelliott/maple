Previous studies have shown that camel and sheep strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in zzso We examined 208 zzso zzso and 40 zzso samples of zzso zzso from various hosts in Kenya using restriction zzso length zzso analysis of a segment of zzso DNA amplified by the zzso chain zzso This was in an effort to determine whether additional strains of zzso zzso occur in Kenya, to examine the level of genetic zzso within the zzso and zzso strains previously identified, and to map out their intermediate host range and geographic distribution in zzso We confirmed the existence of the two strains in Kenya and showed that the distribution of the camel strain appears restricted to the zzso region, where camels are kept as zzso The intermediate host range for both strains seems to be similar except that humans appear zzso to infection with the camel zzso We have also shown that although the zzso patterns of the two strains overlap both geographically and in intermediate and definitive zzso the strains maintain their homogeneous genetic zzso
