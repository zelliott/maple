There exist conflicting data regarding the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso production from zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides mediate their actions through zzso zzso receptors zzso Whether or not zzso are present in the tumors remains zzso To zzso this paradox, gene expression of zzso was examined by Northern zzso analysis and competitive zzso chain reaction in zzso and zzso portions of zzso and in normal adrenal zzso from patients with zzso cell zzso The results of Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of zzso zzso acid zzso of three zzso in all adrenal zzso including zzso The zzso expression of zzso gene transcripts in zzso was type A zzso type B zzso and type C zzso The levels, but not the proportions, of type C and possibly type B zzso zzso were lower in zzso and zzso portions of zzso compared to those in normal adrenal zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso type B zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso levels of type C, rather than type A or type B, zzso were correlated with the percentage of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion we have demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso the three zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
