zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently classified into three zzso Two groups require a single zzso protein to form a zzso or zzso The third group requires two zzso protein components for the zzso To zzso the molecular architecture of the zzso zzso system, we studied a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso In the present study, we solved a crystal structure of the zzso at zzso zzso The zzso adopts a zzso form composed of two zzso and two structural zzso By connecting the structural and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we could convert the zzso to a zzso that maintains the broad zzso specificity that is one of the characteristics of zzso zzso Meanwhile, a deletion of six zzso acids in a zzso loop abolished the zzso activity even on a zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso architecture is not a major factor responsible for the difference of zzso specificity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Rather, the structural basis for the broad zzso specificity is built into the zzso zzso zzso zzso
