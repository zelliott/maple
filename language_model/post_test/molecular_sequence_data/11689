zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant disease due to genetic zzso at the C1 inhibitor zzso zzso within the C1 inhibitor gene are responsible for the molecular zzso in type II zzso Most of the dysfunctional proteins result from zzso involving the zzso (the zzso site of the zzso zzso or zzso acids zzso to the zzso zzso 

We have studied a Spanish family with type II zzso by using zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify the zzso eight of the C1 inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso zzso product was zzso and transformed into competent zzso After overnight cultures, we extracted the cloning zzso from the positive colonies and zzso both strands of the zzso product from each patient and healthy members of the zzso 

We show that affected individuals in this family have a zzso zzso changing an zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso This substitution changes zzso at the zzso site of the zzso center to a zzso This zzso generates a new restriction site, recognized by zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first molecular zzso characterized in a Spanish family with type II zzso and to date, this is the first reported zzso at the zzso site of the zzso center in individuals with type II zzso This new zzso located at the zzso center emphasizes once more time the enormous zzso of this zzso
