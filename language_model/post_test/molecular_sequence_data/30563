The zzso zzso a member of a family of steroid zzso has been cloned and zzso The zzso pair zzso zzso designated zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso flanked by 43 and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso regions, zzso The zzso acid protein zzso by the open reading frame is zzso and zzso similar in sequence to zzso and zzso which are other members of this zzso zzso In common with these forms, the zzso protein contains regions characteristic of a signal zzso and a zzso domain at the zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso sites are not present in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso zzso has a zzso size of 50 zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The expressed zzso zzso testosterone and zzso although its activity towards these two zzso is about zzso less than that of zzso This low activity appeared to be a bone fide property of the zzso and was not due to lower amounts of protein zzso or increased rates of protein zzso Northern analysis and zzso sequencing demonstrated that zzso is zzso by two zzso species which differed in the lengths of their zzso zzso The zzso to the longer transcript has a zzso zzso region which contains a segment that is zzso similar to the rat zzso sequence zzso family of repetitive DNA zzso These data indicate that zzso is another 17 zzso zzso that is zzso by two zzso transcribed from a single zzso
