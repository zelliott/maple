Patients with zzso zzso zzso a zzso inherited bone zzso failure syndrome, have abnormalities in zzso biology, including very short zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso but approximately zzso of DC patients lack an identifiable zzso With the very short zzso zzso and a highly zzso rare disease model, a linkage scan was performed on a family with zzso DC and no zzso in zzso zzso or zzso Evidence favoring linkage was found at zzso and zzso and this led to the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and her five affected relatives and zzso zzso in three additional unrelated DC zzso including one with zzso zzso a fifth DC zzso had a zzso zzso zzso zzso were not present in unaffected relatives, DC zzso with zzso in zzso zzso or zzso or zzso control zzso We demonstrate that a fifth zzso zzso is zzso in classical DC and, for the first time, in zzso zzso This represents the first zzso complex zzso linked to human disease and confirms the role of very short zzso as a diagnostic test for zzso
