zzso peptides constitute one of the main classes of molecular weapons deployed by the innate immune system of all zzso organisms to resist microbial zzso A good proportion of all zzso peptides currently known, zzso hundreds of zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso Nevertheless, very little is known about the zzso and the zzso of action of zzso zzso peptides on intact bacteria, especially when they are used at zzso zzso and under conditions closer to those encountered in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso a linear zzso encompassing the first 18 zzso of the full-length zzso rapidly kills zzso coli at the minimal zzso zzso The lethal event is zzso with the zzso of the outer and inner bacterial zzso This is in contrast to what is found for many host defense zzso which do not destabilize zzso at their minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has a limited ability to modify the zzso protein expression profile, at either zzso or zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of an zzso zzso from zzso skin on the zzso of its bacterial target, and underscores the fact that the bacterial membrane is the major target for the killing mechanism of zzso rather than zzso zzso
