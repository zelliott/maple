An zzso chemical synthesis of a zzso zzso corresponding to the DNA binding domain zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso factor is zzso The application of zzso solid phase zzso synthesis zzso with a protocol modified respect to the standard one allowed obtaining the desired zzso zzso in a short time with high quantity and optimal zzso zzso methodology was thus demonstrated as a valuable alternative to zzso methods to obtain protein zzso Considering that recent findings suggest an involvement of zzso in the zzso of diabetes zzso we also performed circular zzso studies both on zzso folding and its interaction with zzso recognition element zzso on insulin zzso From our results, it was evicted that a disorder to order transition occurs after zzso interaction with insulin zzso which is zzso by specific structural elements on the zzso of the zzso
