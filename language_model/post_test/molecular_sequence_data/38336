The functional unit of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso is a zzso composed of three zzso exterior zzso and three zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso interactions has hindered the production and characterization of zzso homogeneous envelope zzso zzso Here we report three modifications that stabilize soluble forms of zzso envelope zzso zzso disruption of the zzso zzso site between zzso and zzso introduction of zzso that form zzso zzso bonds, and addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso by zzso and zzso methods indicates that these stable zzso retain structural zzso The efficacy of the zzso sequences in stabilizing the zzso the formation of zzso zzso bonds between appropriately placed zzso and the ability of the zzso to interact with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso support a model in which the zzso zzso coiled zzso exists in the envelope zzso precursor and contributes to zzso interactions within the zzso The availability of stable, soluble zzso envelope zzso zzso should zzso progress in understanding the structure and function of the zzso envelope zzso zzso
