zzso zzso zzso group 2 zzso is a group of zzso zzso bacterial strains isolated from various human zzso As determined by zzso tests and analyses of fatty acid compositions, these organisms form a homogeneous group that appears to be distinct from but related to other zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on a set of 13 zzso strains from various clinical sources and geographic locations in the United States and Canada to determine their relationship to the zzso zzso Control strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso similar to zzso Nearly complete zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing of eight zzso strains showed a high level of sequence similarity zzso within the group, and a zzso search of zzso placed the zzso cluster in close proximity to zzso species (95 to zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of 13 of the zzso strains showed all to be related at the species level, with zzso zzso under stringent conditions and a divergence within the group of less than zzso None of the zzso control strains zzso at zzso with any of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso represents a new zzso species, the first isolated from human clinical zzso A new species, zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated in Pennsylvania from zzso of a 77-year-old male with zzso
