Following zzso damage, the zzso of DNA replication is zzso with onset of DNA zzso this zzso is essential to avoid zzso and zzso zzso To investigate these phenomena, we have zzso proteins that interact with zzso which is required for both DNA replication and zzso One such protein is zzso which zzso DNA replication through its interaction with zzso while allowing repair to zzso We have identified an interaction between zzso and the structure specific zzso zzso which is involved in DNA zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso and zzso bind to the same region of zzso Within zzso and its zzso a small region (10 zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso which contains an 8 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso This motif shares critical zzso with the zzso region of zzso A zzso binding zzso from zzso competes with zzso peptides for binding to zzso zzso the zzso complex in replicating cell zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso Competition between zzso regions of zzso and zzso for binding to the same site on zzso may provide a mechanism to zzso the functions of zzso in DNA replication and zzso
