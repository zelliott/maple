zzso of the zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso were obtained by limited zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso of the intact zzso and its zzso fragments to zzso zzso zzso was zzso First eight zzso zzso acids are important for zzso binding because protein zzso lacking these zzso acids exhibits reduced zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso of the zzso chain between zzso 36 and 37 completely zzso zzso zzso zzso of these data with recently determined structure of protein zzso from zzso zzso suggests the nature of interactions which can determine specific and strong association of the protein zzso with zzso zzso
