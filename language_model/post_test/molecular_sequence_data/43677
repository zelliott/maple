The global zzso zzso a highly zzso response regulator in zzso bacteria, is required for the production of zzso and secondary zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was isolated and its role in zzso gene expression was zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in delayed and reduced formation of the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso which is known to positively regulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso on a zzso zzso caused precocious and enhanced production of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso gene dosage markedly influenced the zzso formation of the zzso compounds zzso and cyanide and the zzso zzso However, the zzso of another known zzso signal of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not always match zzso zzso A model accounting for these observations places zzso function upstream of zzso and zzso in the complex, zzso zzso zzso regulating several zzso and zzso factors of zzso zzso via zzso
