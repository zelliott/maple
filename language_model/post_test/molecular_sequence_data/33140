Although most human zzso are zzso both inactive and active zzso drive zzso evolution and may influence zzso through various zzso In humans, three zzso families are still active, but one of these, zzso remains zzso Here we report the identification of a new zzso of zzso which apparently formed after an alternative zzso event where the first zzso of the zzso gene spliced into an zzso zzso and subsequently zzso Additional examples of zzso zzso upstream zzso due to zzso into zzso were also identified in other zzso zzso After molecular and zzso experiments, we found a number of functional 3' zzso sites within many different transcribed zzso across the human and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso construct containing an zzso we observed zzso in cell culture, along with zzso zzso events that introduced premature termination zzso zzso These data imply that an zzso residing within an zzso in the same orientation as the gene may alter normal gene zzso either by zzso or by introducing zzso through zzso possibly creating differences within and across zzso
