The reductive removal of aromatic zzso functions plays an important role in the zzso metabolism of many zzso zzso We describe a new zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso plays a role in the zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other aromatic compounds of which zzso is an zzso The zzso is therefore induced only under zzso conditions with these aromatic zzso but not with zzso or under zzso zzso A similar zzso which zzso zzso zzso is induced during zzso growth with zzso The soluble zzso zzso zzso was zzso It has a molecular mass of 260 zzso and consists of three zzso of 75, 35, and 17 zzso The zzso composition is likely to be zzso The zzso contains 12 zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso and exhibits a typical zzso spectrum of an zzso zzso The reaction requires a reduced electron donor such as reduced zzso zzso no other zzso are required, the product is zzso and oxidized zzso The zzso is rapidly zzso by zzso The zzso by low zzso of cyanide or zzso in a zzso time course suggests that it may contain a transition metal in an zzso state which zzso with these zzso zzso zzso represents a type of zzso which is common in zzso aromatic metabolism of zzso zzso A similar zzso is demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso grown with zzso The biological significance of reductive zzso of aromatics and a possible reaction mechanism similar to the Birch reduction are zzso
