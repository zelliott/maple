The protein designated as insulin zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso for the insulin zzso zzso zzso Since zzso defects in the insulin zzso zzso are a common feature of Type 2 zzso diabetes zzso we have cloned the human zzso gene in order to study the role of genetic variation in this gene in the zzso of diabetes zzso As a first step in these studies, we have mapped the zzso gene to zzso 2, bands zzso and identified a simple tandem repeat DNA zzso in this gene that will be useful for genetic zzso
