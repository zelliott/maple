With respect to the functional importance attributed to the zzso part of the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso we report here on the structural arrangement and functional dynamics of zzso zzso zzso II and III and the adjoining loop zzso Information on membrane topography was obtained by analyzing the residual mobility of zzso zzso spin label and by determination of collision zzso of the zzso with oxygen and a polar metal zzso complex using electron zzso resonance zzso zzso The studies suggest that zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are part of TM II while zzso and zzso are located at a zzso interface probably forming the zzso cap of the zzso Also zzso and zzso are at a zzso zzso suggesting a location close to the zzso ends of zzso II and III, zzso zzso between these zzso is clearly in a zzso loop zzso loop zzso Spin labels attached to positions 80, 86, and 91 show zzso properties typical for a TM location zzso zzso zzso may be part of a structured loop region while zzso is clearly located in a zzso loop zzso loop zzso Finally, spin labels attached to the positions of zzso and zzso are clearly on the surface of the zzso and are directed into an zzso zzso These findings strongly support the recently proposed zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Quick, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso II and III of the zzso are formed by zzso acids zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso In addition to the zzso analysis, it is shown that binding of zzso and/or zzso to the zzso alters the mobility of the zzso group at the positions of zzso and zzso From these findings, it is concluded that binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that involve at least parts of TM II and the preceding zzso zzso
