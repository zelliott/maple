Of the two known types of specific receptors for zzso zzso the function of the type II zzso zzso zzso is still zzso zzso is allegedly devoid of signaling capacity and is therefore thought to act by zzso and zzso zzso To directly assess the functional role of zzso a human zzso cell line has been zzso zzso with a zzso coding for zzso and its responsiveness to zzso has been compared with that of zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso and are responsive to low doses of zzso whereas zzso cells zzso zzso both in its membrane and soluble form, and show a dramatically impaired response to zzso Selective block of zzso restores the ability of zzso zzso to respond to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is in fact uniquely responsible for their zzso to zzso The main mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso appears to be the capture and zzso of zzso by the soluble form of zzso
