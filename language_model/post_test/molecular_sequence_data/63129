Recently, we identified the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nervous system zzso of the American lobster zzso zzso using zzso laser zzso transform mass zzso zzso Given that zzso zzso is the only species thus far shown to possess this zzso and that a second zzso zzso zzso is broadly zzso in other zzso including another zzso the zzso zzso zzso we became interested both in confirming our identification of zzso via molecular methods and in determining the extent to which this zzso is zzso within other members of the zzso zzso Here, we present the identification and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate via zzso the presence of zzso in a second zzso species, zzso zzso In contrast, only the zzso zzso was detected in the other zzso investigated, including the lobster zzso zzso a member of the same family as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which represent members of each of the extant families of freshwater zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso possess an internal zzso site, zzso raising the possibility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso was not detected via zzso in any of the investigated species, and when applied to the isolated zzso of zzso zzso possessed little zzso relative to the full-length zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso zzso and zzso are the sole zzso zzso of this zzso family in clawed zzso and freshwater zzso
