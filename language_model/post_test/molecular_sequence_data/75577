The human zzso molecules zzso alpha and zzso zzso are zzso zzso from zzso precursor to zzso biologically active zzso During the course of studies of zzso modifications of human zzso we have observed that although zzso induced the production of both zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta in human zzso zzso labeling of these cells revealed that zzso precursor of zzso alpha zzso zzso to be zzso at least zzso more than zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso could be detected in the zzso processed zzso alpha and zzso zzso Analysis by TLC revealed that the major zzso site occurred at zzso zzso The zzso was incorporated into multiply zzso precursors of zzso zzso which appeared in the absence of zzso zzso Since the smallest Mr zzso alpha that was labeled with zzso was 22 zzso the zzso zzso zzso is presumably located adjacent to a sequence of four basic zzso acids located in the zzso region at the zzso zzso of the zzso precursor of zzso zzso This zzso zzso might also be a major zzso site for a zzso protein zzso This hypothesis was substantiated by the demonstration that a synthetic zzso analogue of this region zzso 84 to zzso could be similarly zzso in zzso by a zzso protein zzso Furthermore, a truncated zzso alpha zzso 64 to zzso and a zzso protein containing zzso protein A and an zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso 1 to zzso but not mature zzso alpha zzso 113 to zzso could also be zzso by zzso protein zzso There is no comparable zzso acid sequence in zzso beta which could be expected to be zzso by a zzso protein zzso The zzso relevance of zzso of zzso alpha was zzso The data showed that zzso of truncated zzso alpha greatly enhanced its zzso to zzso by zzso and promoted the conversion of zzso alpha to the more biologically active zzso Although the precise role of the rather selective zzso of zzso alpha is not known, our findings do suggest that the zzso of zzso close to zzso zzso acid sequence functions to facilitate the processing and/or release of zzso zzso
