An important hallmark in embryonic development is characterized by the zzso transition zzso where zzso zzso is activated by a zzso controlled zzso zzso and zzso regulation is critical for this transition and has been investigated in considerable detail at the gene zzso We used a zzso approach using zzso labeling of zzso to zzso assess changes in protein expression levels before and after the zzso By combining stable isotope labeling of fruit flies in zzso with high accuracy quantitative mass zzso we could zzso zzso proteins of which about half changed in abundance during this zzso We show that approximately 500 proteins increased in zzso providing direct evidence of the identity of proteins as a product of embryonic zzso The group of zzso proteins is dominated by maternal factors involved in zzso control of maternal and zzso zzso zzso a direct comparison of transcript and protein levels showed that the zzso levels of zzso proteins remained relatively constant, indicating a zzso control mechanism specifically targeting these zzso In addition, we found evidence for zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso which became activated during the zzso as evidenced by the loss of its zzso zzso zzso protein was shown to be processed at its zzso tail, thereby losing one of its zzso zzso zzso this quantitative zzso study provides a dynamic profile of known and novel proteins of maternal as well as embryonic zzso This provides insight into the production, stability, and modification of individual zzso whereas discrepancies between zzso profiles and protein dynamics indicate novel control mechanisms in zzso zzso during early fly zzso
