zzso studies of the insulin zzso indicate that an insulin B chain domain zzso zzso zzso is involved both in binding to the insulin zzso zzso and in insulin zzso formation, suggesting that this domain might also interact with a structure resembling the insulin zzso interface in the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with a deletion of the region corresponding to zzso 2 of the zzso gene produces a protein devoid of zzso activity, although the zzso protein is processed appropriately to zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso domain is zzso at least in part by zzso zzso Within this region of the zzso zzso the sequence zzso fulfills the structural criteria for a zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso with zzso for zzso 88 or 89 show that the presence of zzso at position 89 is essential for full binding zzso
