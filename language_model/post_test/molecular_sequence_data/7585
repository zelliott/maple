zzso virus 40 large tumor zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that a hierarchy exists among these zzso zzso since vigorous zzso responses against zzso I, zzso and IV are detected following zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso By contrast, a weak zzso response against the zzso zzso V was detected only following zzso of zzso mice with zzso loss zzso zzso cells, which have lost expression of zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the lack of zzso zzso zzso activity in bulk culture zzso correlated with inefficient expansion and zzso of zzso zzso zzso precursors in zzso We examined whether defined genetic zzso of T zzso might improve processing and presentation of zzso V to the zzso zzso zzso clone zzso in zzso and/or overcome the zzso nature of zzso V in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso I and zzso from T zzso did not increase target cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso clones in zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso which species an zzso zzso binding motif and was found to induce zzso in zzso mice, did not further reduce zzso V presentation in zzso when inserted within T zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives which retained zzso I and zzso or zzso IV did not induce zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso derivatives in which zzso V replaced zzso I failed to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso complexes by multiple independently derived zzso zzso zzso clones was rapidly and dramatically reduced by incubation of target cells in the presence of zzso A compared with the recognition of the other zzso zzso zzso by zzso specific zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso complexes either are zzso or are present at the cell surface at reduced zzso Our results suggest that processing and presentation of zzso V is not dramatically altered zzso by the presence of zzso zzso zzso in T zzso and that the zzso nature of zzso V is not determined by zzso acids which flank its native location within zzso virus 40 T zzso
