Several clones zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso and adult flea zzso expression libraries by zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a protein of approximately 45 zzso which had significant sequence similarity with the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The thirteen zzso clones isolated to date zzso zzso zzso which share a primary structure that includes a nearly identical constant region of about 360 zzso zzso followed by a zzso variable region of about zzso zzso zzso The variable zzso sequences zzso most of the zzso site loop zzso and are generated by mutually exclusive alternative zzso zzso which may zzso unique zzso selectivity to each zzso zzso of an alternative zzso zzso mechanism has been verified by sequence analysis of a flea zzso zzso clone and adjacent zzso zzso zzso expression patterns of the cloned genes have been examined by Northern zzso analysis using variable zzso zzso Several putative zzso have been zzso using the zzso clones in zzso coli and zzso expression zzso Two zzso zzso zzso proteins have zzso zzso acid sequences identical to the respective zzso native mature flea zzso indicating that appropriate zzso processing occurred in the zzso insect zzso
