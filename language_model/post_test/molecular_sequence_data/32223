We previously demonstrated that the gene for a member of the zzso zzso zzso family is zzso expressed in the zzso legs of the American zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso zzso To identify candidate zzso involved in tail zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso from adult zzso serum and cloned its zzso Although zzso gene expression was not induced in the zzso tails, we isolated a zzso for an zzso protein zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso gene expression was significantly increased in the zzso tails, suggesting its role in tail zzso Although both zzso and zzso belong to a recently identified zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso exhibit distinct zzso gene expression from two other known zzso members, both of which are expressed principally in the embryonic stage, whereas the zzso and zzso genes are predominantly expressed in the adult and zzso zzso zzso respectively, suggesting multiple functions of zzso family zzso Thus, the presence of zzso zzso zzso family and the induction of the member gene in zzso zzso are zzso among insects and zzso
