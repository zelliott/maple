zzso zzso zzso zzso the bacterial second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by specific zzso zzso levels control the transition of bacteria from a zzso to a zzso zzso These bacterial communities are highly resistant to zzso treatment and represent the zzso lifestyle in most chronic zzso zzso zzso serve as starting point for the development of novel zzso interfering with the second zzso network in zzso In previous studies, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the interaction of various zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the model zzso zzso from zzso zzso We observed strong zzso resonance energy transfer between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an enhanced direct zzso zzso upon interaction with zzso We assessed the affinity of zzso to zzso by performing competition zzso with zzso We conducted an zzso acid alignment of zzso with the earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and found high similarities in the zzso site of zzso In zzso zzso activity zzso with zzso resulted in the identification of new zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, the analysis of interactions between zzso zzso and zzso provides a new basis for the identification and development of zzso zzso and allows insights into zzso zzso
