The zzso X zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso significantly involved in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, certain zzso zzso such as zzso have been shown to readily induce human and rabbit but not zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso Because drugs of divergent chemical structures seem to be similarly affected, we hypothesized that specific zzso acid zzso or zzso in rat zzso affect zzso zzso by certain human zzso zzso To identify such a zzso an array of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a tandem zzso zzso were created using a random zzso zzso zzso characterization of these zzso revealed a discreet segment within the zzso domain of rat and human zzso to be essential for the zzso zzso Within this region, the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso of human and rat zzso respectively, were found to be important for zzso zzso zzso modeling derived from the recently determined crystal structure of human zzso indicates that these zzso acids are located within or neighboring the flexible loop that forms part of the pore to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity was zzso to rat zzso when zzso was converted to zzso whereas zzso of sensitivity was observed when zzso of human zzso was replaced with zzso zzso our data provide compelling new insight into the importance of the zzso acids zzso the pore to the zzso cavity as a critical zzso of zzso zzso
