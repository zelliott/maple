In several plant species, zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso that are produced by alternative zzso of a zzso Two forms of zzso corresponding to the longer, zzso alpha and the zzso beta forms were detected zzso in cotton zzso zzso zzso leaves, but their zzso differed in 4 of 14 zzso The zzso for the alpha and beta forms of cotton zzso zzso throughout the translated and zzso regions, including variations that accounted for the differences in zzso zzso acid zzso Analysis of zzso DNA confirmed that separate genes zzso the alpha and beta forms of cotton zzso Separate zzso genes were also detected in zzso species of cotton containing the different zzso zzso of the cultivated zzso indicating that the occurrence of separate zzso and zzso genes in cotton predates the merger of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the two forms of cotton zzso exhibited zzso identity and both forms were active after expression in zzso zzso The zzso alpha and beta forms exhibited similar affinities for zzso and only minor differences in zzso but their zzso specific activities zzso The results show for the first time a plant species with two forms of zzso that are structurally and functionally equivalent to the alternatively spliced alpha and beta forms in other plants, but that are zzso by separate zzso That cotton still expresses both forms of zzso even without alternative zzso suggests that each form has a required function in zzso
