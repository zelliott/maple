The zzso + zzso + zzso charge states of native and reduced zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso For most charge states, zzso parking was used to increase the number of parent zzso over that yielded directly by zzso zzso zzso transfer reactions were used to reduce product zzso charge states largely to zzso to simplify spectral zzso Both forms of the protein show charge state dependent fragmentation zzso The native zzso which contains four zzso zzso shows almost no evidence for fragmentation within the regions of the protein linked by zzso zzso However, at the lowest charge states zzso evidence for zzso of a least one of the zzso bonds was evident in the appearance of a zzso zzso The highest charge states of native zzso showed several prominent zzso zzso to zzso zzso As the charge state zzso however, preferential zzso at zzso zzso acid zzso became zzso The reduced form of the protein did not show particularly prominent zzso at zzso zzso However, many of the same preferential zzso at zzso zzso acid zzso noted for the native protein were also observed in the same charge states of the reduced zzso The reduced protein also showed additional zzso from regions of the protein that are zzso protected by zzso linkages in the native zzso
