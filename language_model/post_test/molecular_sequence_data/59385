The zzso zzso system from zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso sequence zzso The gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli zzso alpha zzso and the zzso sequence of the gene was zzso The zzso gene coded for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso The zzso restriction zzso zzso gene was analyzed by inverse zzso chain zzso The zzso gene coded for a protein of 375 zzso acid zzso zzso mass, zzso zzso The two genes had the same orientation separated by two base zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows significant similarities to the family of zzso zzso However, the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso did not have as much zzso in the zzso zzso when compared with those of the other restriction zzso already zzso
