We have used high resolution zzso and thermodynamics to characterize the secondary structure and stability of the zzso zzso sequences zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These sequences are members of the two classes of zzso recently identified with two distinct structures capable of directing zzso incorporation into proteins in zzso zzso melting experiments showed a single cooperative and zzso transition for each zzso which indicates the presence of stable secondary zzso Despite their large size, the zzso gave well resolved zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Using zzso the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso of all of the zzso base pairs were zzso In addition, a number of zzso base pairs including the zzso zzso pairs were zzso The zzso zzso allowed definition of the zzso structure of the zzso providing an experimental model of the secondary structure of these zzso The derived secondary structures are consistent with several features of the predicted models, but with some important differences, especially regarding the zzso sequence zzso
