We have previously shown that the zzso protein zzso is present on the outer surface of the gas zzso can be zzso removed and rebound to the surface, and increases the critical collapse pressure of the gas zzso The zzso zzso which contains five partially zzso repeats of 33 zzso acids zzso sandwiched between 18 zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso is present in a ratio of zzso with the zzso zzso which forms the ribs of the gas zzso By using zzso techniques we have now made modified versions of zzso that contain only the first two, three or four of the zzso zzso All of these proteins bind to and strengthen gas zzso that have been stripped of their native zzso zzso proteins containing three or four repeats bind in amounts that give the same ratio of zzso zzso zzso as the native zzso and they restore much of the strength of the gas zzso the protein containing only two repeats binds at a lower ratio zzso however, and restores less of the zzso zzso proteins with only two, three or four of the zzso repeats would have been functional in strengthening the gas zzso but the progressive increase in number of repeats would have provided strength with increased zzso
