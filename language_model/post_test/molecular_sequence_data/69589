Little is known about the mechanisms that target transcripts for rapid degradation in zzso In zzso cells, sequences with a high zzso content and multiple zzso motifs have been shown to cause zzso instability when present in the 3' untranslated regions of several zzso This zzso coupled with the poor zzso of zzso foreign transcripts in plants zzso zzso zzso prompted us to test whether zzso sequences could destabilize transcripts in zzso To address this question, we made a set of zzso containing sequences with high zzso content inserted into the 3' untranslated regions of reporter zzso The stability of the corresponding transcripts was then zzso in zzso transformed cell lines of zzso These experiments showed that a zzso sequence containing 11 copies of the zzso motif zzso zzso markedly zzso a zzso reporter transcript compared to a zzso control or a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso Another sequence with an identical zzso content had little zzso The same results were obtained when each sequence was zzso within the 3' untranslated region of a zzso reporter zzso In zzso transgenic plants, the zzso repeat decreased the zzso of the zzso transcript by approximately zzso compared to the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso repeat is recognized as an instability zzso in plant cells and that the effect is due to the sequence of the element, not simply to the high zzso zzso
