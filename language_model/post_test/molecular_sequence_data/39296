A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was most closely related zzso % zzso to the type strain of zzso marina, which belongs to the family zzso within the order zzso of the class zzso A zzso approach was used to clarify the zzso position of strain zzso During the course of this study, a second species was described by others as belonging to the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso it showed a somewhat higher level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with respect to strain zzso zzso zzso and was also taken into zzso The fatty acid profiles, zzso and zzso data and DNA zzso content zzso zzso support the zzso of strain zzso as a member of the zzso zzso The characteristics of the novel strain were sufficiently distinct to indicate that it represents a separate zzso To confirm this conclusion, zzso zzso were zzso low values (between zzso and zzso zzso were obtained in all zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type zzso
