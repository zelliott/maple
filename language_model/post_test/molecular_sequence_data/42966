The zzso protein is a cell cycle regulator whose precise function remains to be zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso It encodes a 9 zzso protein showing a strong similarity with its human counterparts and to a lesser extend with its zzso zzso The expression of zzso in maturing zzso was shown to be tightly cell zzso The abundance of the zzso transcripts is high in zzso and zzso zzso but drops dramatically upon exit from zzso after zzso The zzso of zzso synthetic zzso into embryonic zzso delayed the cell cycle clock, thus zzso the perfect cell cycle zzso exhibited by the zzso of early zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso delaying effect was significantly reversed when zzso B zzso were zzso with zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso offer a quite valuable model to study cell cycle zzso Moreover, they support the existence of a negative control exerted by zzso on the cell cycle traverse in a higher zzso
