zzso zzso zzso zzso is caused by infection with zzso zzso zzso has been reported primarily in northern California, where E zzso is transmitted by the tick zzso zzso Reports of zzso and the emergence of human zzso zzso in Minnesota prompted a zzso study of E zzso in horses of Minnesota and zzso zzso zzso zzso endemic areas of Minnesota and Wisconsin were compared to zzso regions of zzso zzso fluorescent zzso was used to detect the presence of serum zzso to E zzso zzso samples from healthy horses, 375 samples from I zzso endemic counties, and zzso samples from zzso counties were screened at a 1:40 zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso of zzso in endemic areas versus zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA from 2 samples was successfully amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso base pairs were zzso The DNA sequence of 1 zzso strain differed from the zzso strain zzso of E zzso at positions 84 and zzso and from the zzso strain of E zzso at position 84, and was identical to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The 2nd zzso strain was identical to the 1st with the exception of a substitution of zzso at position 453 that is not present in E zzso E zzso or zzso agent strain zzso Based on the results of this study, we concluded that E zzso is present and causes infection in horses in Minnesota and zzso The occurrence of infection is higher in tick endemic zzso
