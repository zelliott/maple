We have investigated how the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acids zzso zzso or zzso are involved in regulating the different zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Whereas changing the zzso of zzso to that of zzso has little effect on zzso zzso introducing the zzso zzso to zzso leads to the formation of larger than zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso This shows that the zzso zzso can zzso regulate zzso depending on the heavy chain zzso zzso which is engaged in zzso zzso bonds in zzso is not crucial for the difference in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso forms more large zzso than zzso Also, zzso with zzso zzso in the five zzso acids zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso similarly as zzso wild zzso Thus, zzso appears to have an inherent tendency to form zzso and zzso that is partially regulated by the zzso while the zzso region has only a minor zzso We also show that complement zzso by zzso is sensitive to zzso in the zzso structure, while zzso is inactive in classical complement zzso even for zzso such as zzso and zzso
