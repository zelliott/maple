zzso breakage syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso and predisposition to zzso zzso The clinical and cellular zzso of zzso substantially overlap those of zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a member of the zzso complex, a zzso protein complex also containing zzso and zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex functionally zzso Both zzso and zzso cells exhibit zzso radiation zzso sensitivity and defects in the zzso S phase checkpoint, resulting in zzso DNA synthesis zzso failure to suppress DNA replication origin firing after zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in response to zzso and this event is required for zzso of the zzso S phase checkpoint (the zzso zzso We derived a zzso model of zzso the zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso identical to those established from zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso lethal with zzso zzso We propose that the zzso complex DNA damage response zzso is essential and that zzso or the zzso complex serves as a zzso to additional components of the zzso
