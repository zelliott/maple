Plants contain a variety of the zzso box genes that zzso regulatory proteins and play important roles in both the formation of flower zzso and the determination of floral organ zzso We have characterized two zzso zzso from rice, designated zzso and zzso The zzso displayed the structure of a typical plant zzso box zzso which consists of the zzso domain, I region, K domain, and zzso zzso These genes were classified as members of the zzso gene family based on sequence zzso The zzso and 8 proteins were most zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and 8 transcripts were zzso primarily in zzso and also zzso in zzso During flower development, the zzso genes started to express at the young flower stage and the expression continued to the late stage of flower zzso The zzso and 8 genes were mapped on the long arms of the zzso 8 and 9, zzso To study the functions of the zzso the zzso clones were expressed zzso using the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso tobacco plant zzso zzso plants expressing the zzso genes exhibited the zzso of early flowering and zzso The strength of the zzso was zzso to the levels of zzso expression and the zzso were zzso with the zzso resistant gene to the next zzso These results indicate that zzso and 8 are structurally related to the zzso family and are involved in controlling flowering zzso
