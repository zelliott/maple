The zzso or Really zzso New Gene represents a family of zzso sequences that bind zzso zzso zzso and participate in zzso processes involving zzso zzso Although found in over 400 different zzso very little is known regarding the zzso properties of these zzso because of the zzso problems associated with zzso zzso To augment this data set, we report an unusual 36 AA zzso sequence of an zzso zzso zzso shell zzso zzso that exhibits partial zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso termed zzso binds zzso zzso and other zzso zzso but does not zzso a zzso zzso scheme for binding such as that found in zzso zzso finger zzso Moreover, unlike zzso zzso finger and zzso zzso this 36 AA can fold into a relatively stable structure in the absence of zzso zzso This folded structure consists of three short zzso segments zzso B, and zzso with segments A and B separated by a 4 AA type I zzso region and segments B and C separated by a 7 AA zzso zzso Interestingly, the putative zzso region, zzso experiences slow zzso exchange between two structural states in solution, most likely in response to zzso ring zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso calculations reveal that the zzso molecular surface possesses a zzso region near its zzso which lies adjacent to the 30 AA mineral modification domain in the zzso zzso Given that the zzso sequence does not influence zzso it is probable that this zzso zzso region is zzso by the zzso protein for other tasks such as zzso interaction within the zzso shell zzso
