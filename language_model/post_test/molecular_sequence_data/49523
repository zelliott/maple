The complete sequence and secondary structure of the large zzso of nuclear zzso zzso were determined for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso sequence was shorter (by 18 zzso than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the only other species within the zzso for which a complete zzso zzso sequence has been zzso zzso differences in sequence were greater in the 12 D zzso compared with the core zzso with the secondary structure being maintained by partial or complete zzso base pair zzso The magnitude of zzso sequence difference in each D domain (except for zzso and zzso was similar, suggesting that several zzso contain zzso genetic markers for zzso studies of the zzso zzso at different zzso zzso The zzso zzso may also provide zzso markers for the identification of some zzso zzso of veterinary and medical zzso
