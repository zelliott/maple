zzso play important roles in zzso zzso Here we report isolation of six genes zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which catalyze the zzso step of zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be zzso in infected roots and mature zzso zzso analysis demonstrated expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and was especially high in the vascular zzso of zzso When zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso and developing zzso and later it was expressed only in the vascular zzso of mature zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference reduced levels of zzso zzso affected plant development and accelerated zzso degradation during zzso leaf zzso Compared with the wild type, zzso plants produced fewer infection threads and zzso In addition, expression of downstream zzso zzso factor genes zzso zzso and zzso decreased dramatically in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates the zzso zzso pathway, affecting zzso initiation and thereby influencing the number of infection threads and zzso zzso of zzso activity and observation of zzso structure showed that zzso zzso are required for full development of the infected cells in mature zzso by preventing early zzso zzso our results indicate that the zzso gene product is required for zzso initiation and development, and does not appear to be involved in early infection zzso
