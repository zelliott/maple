The design of artificial functional zzso proteins has long been a goal for several research zzso The zinc finger zzso which typically contain many fingers linked in tandem fashion, are some of the most studied zzso zzso The zinc finger zzso tandem arrangement and its the ability to recognize a wide variety of DNA sequences make it an attractive framework to design novel zzso zzso Our laboratory has zzso several design strategies to create novel zinc finger peptides by zzso the zzso zinc finger motif of zzso factor zzso Some of the engineered zinc fingers have shown zzso and zzso functional zzso Based on these results, we present the design strategies for the creation of novel zinc zzso
