Our previous studies conducted in zzso cells have demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso temperature 32 degrees C leads to growth arrest at the zzso phase of the cell zzso To identify novel zzso genes that are responsible for the zzso zzso arrest, we conducted zzso zzso zzso The array results indicated that the zzso level of protein regulator of zzso zzso was significantly decreased when the zzso zzso activity was turned on, suggesting that zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso In this study, we have extensively examined the functional role of zzso in the regulation of zzso a cell cycle protein that plays important roles during zzso We demonstrate that increased expression of the zzso zzso either by zzso zzso or chemical induction results in reduced zzso and protein expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we show that the decreased zzso expression is accompanied by the appearance of zzso cells, indicating the process of cell division after zzso being zzso By isolation and characterization of a 3 zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region and part of zzso 1 of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso directly suppresses zzso gene zzso We further locate the zzso sequence to the zzso promoter region zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso The in zzso interaction of zzso with zzso gene promoter is further demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these new findings suggest that zzso may have important roles in the regulation of zzso through controlling the zzso of zzso
