zzso zzso zzso of zzso A with zzso allowed the isolation of a zzso zzso This zzso has been zzso to zzso and its molecular properties have been zzso The sequence of the 54 zzso zzso acid zzso has been determined by automated zzso zzso This sequence is identical to that of the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso part of the zzso A zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso This zzso can produce channels in zzso zzso zzso of the same size as those formed by zzso zzso However, the zzso for opening and closing was drastically altered in the zzso zzso zzso The latter, in contrast to zzso A channels, remained open over a wide range of zzso Large negative zzso were required to close the zzso zzso channels although opening took place in the same zzso range as for zzso A zzso zzso
