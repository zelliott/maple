The majority of zzso envelope zzso characterized to date are typical of type I viral fusion zzso having a zzso binding zzso associated with a fusion zzso The fusion zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a very zzso domain organization and zzso features of secondary structure, making them suitable for zzso zzso Such zzso along with sequence zzso reveal evidence of numerous zzso events in which zzso have acquired envelope zzso from zzso zzso Thus, the envelope gene zzso can have a history separate from that of the zzso gene zzso which is the most commonly used gene in zzso analyses of zzso Focusing on the fusion zzso of the zzso listed above, we describe three distinct types of zzso envelope zzso which we refer to as zzso avian zzso and zzso By tracing these types within the zzso zzso provided by zzso zzso we show that they have surprisingly distinct evolutionary histories and zzso with important implications for zzso transmissions and the generation of novel zzso These findings validate the utility of zzso sequences in contributing zzso signal that zzso our understanding of zzso zzso
