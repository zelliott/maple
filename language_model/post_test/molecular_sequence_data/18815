The zzso protein from zzso zzso is a protein of unknown zzso zzso sequence analysis predicted that it was a zzso from the presence of a motif zzso amongst the zzso which are zzso that contain a single, zzso zinc zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso acid within the motif zzso The zzso protein was chosen by the Joint Center for zzso zzso for crystal structure determination to explore novel protein sequence space and zzso function zzso 

The crystal structure confirmed that the zzso protein consisted of a single, zzso zzso zzso The zzso a structural feature thought to be important for a zzso because it zzso the active site, is zzso and its stabilizing role may have been zzso to the zzso zzso In our zzso model there are two molecules in the zzso unit and from zzso zzso the protein zzso in zzso A water zzso is present in the putative zzso site in one zzso which is replaced by one of two observed zzso of zzso in the zzso 

The zzso protein is structurally related to the zzso It contains the minimum structural features of a member of this protein zzso and can be described as a zzso zzso There is a striking parallel with the structure of a zzso which represents the minimum structure of a zzso (a zzso in which the third zinc zzso is a zzso zzso Rather than being an ancestral state, zzso analysis suggests that the zzso are derived from larger zzso
