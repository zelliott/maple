The present study reported the isolation and characterization of a novel human zzso zzso named as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso by the hypothetical gene zzso 2 open reading frame 7 zzso that contains signal zzso in its zzso without zzso domain, except for PA domain in its zzso Western zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso into culture medium in the zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular zzso whatever zzso zzso zzso or zzso (30 zzso forms, are larger than that of the zzso To define whether the zzso was important process for its zzso zzso H zzso zzso and zzso F zzso zzso were employed to evaluate the effect of zzso types on zzso of zzso Interestingly, the zzso forms were primarily sensitive to zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso that complex zzso could be required for the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was confirmed as potential crucial process for the zzso protein via zzso zzso zzso All data will be contributed to the understanding of molecular functions of zzso
