Here, we investigated the genetic zzso of zzso floral zzso in zzso a zzso with zzso zzso The variable presence of zzso features in other floral zzso zzso with distinct adaptations to insect zzso wind zzso zzso cells are present in zzso or zzso of zzso species, and in zzso We characterized a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso responsible for zzso cells, from three species with distinct floral zzso representing two zzso zzso Genes were cloned by zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses were conducted by quantitative zzso and in zzso zzso followed by functional studies in transgenic zzso The cloned genes zzso zzso zzso proteins closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by in zzso zzso zzso areas of zzso zzso zzso in tobacco zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso and significantly increases the height of zzso zzso zzso We have described the first zzso of zzso outside the core zzso likely ancestral to the zzso zzso The zzso role in zzso cell zzso results in zzso cells, zzso markers for zzso This adaptation to attract insect zzso was apparently lost after the evolution of wind zzso in zzso
