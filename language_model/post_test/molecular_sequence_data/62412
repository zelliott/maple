The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso through its binding to the specific zzso zzso zzso Immediately downstream of zzso lies zzso the zzso of which is tightly zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso in its zzso Thus, zzso is next to zzso on the zzso zzso signaling zzso An zzso zzso deletion was introduced into the zzso zzso which rendered it inactive by eliminating the majority of the coding region, including the zzso zzso zzso No significant change was observed with the Delta zzso zzso with respect to the timing or amount of zzso zzso production, or the zzso differentiation on solid media, indicating that zzso neither zzso in zzso zzso zzso nor in zzso In contrast, analysis of zzso production in the Delta zzso zzso revealed that production of both zzso zzso and zzso S occurred immediately after zzso zzso production, 2-3 h earlier than in the zzso strain, indicating that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso production after zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of several genes surrounding zzso by the Delta zzso zzso indicated that zzso plays a negative regulatory role, directly or zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso located upstream of zzso
