zzso containing the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso have been isolated from a zzso library using the zzso zzso as a zzso We have shown that the human zzso zzso as a zzso We have shown that zzso human zzso gene is composed of 11 zzso and 10 zzso stretching over approximately 17 zzso and is located within the zzso region of the zzso and zzso zzso in the vicinity of the zzso Analysis f the zzso zzso region revealed multiple zzso initiation sites as well as potential binding motifs for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although this region lacks a zzso zzso Using the human zzso zzso as a probe to perform zzso in zzso zzso additional signals were identified in the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso located on zzso 16 and 10 were completely zzso Although they are similar to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso none of these copies encodes a functional zzso none of them contains sequences zzso to the zzso zzso region or zzso 1 of the zzso zzso and the remaining zzso have been zzso by various point zzso and zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso gene is located at zzso and zzso in the long arm zzso region, and that four zzso zzso are located on zzso zzso zzso and zzso probably dispersed as the result of zzso during zzso
