The expressed sequence tag zzso was originally isolated from a screening for zzso expressed transcripts during the zzso stage of the white truffle zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso increased dramatically during zzso body maturation compared to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tools, zzso analysis and expression studies were used to support the hypothesis that this zzso named zzso is the first zzso zzso coding gene isolated in zzso zzso of this zzso all defined as zzso for hypothetical zzso in public databases, were exclusively found in zzso zzso and in zzso Although complete (or almost zzso zzso zzso and zzso collections of some zzso and zzso are already available, zzso proteins appear to be represented only in zzso A new and previously zzso zzso signature pattern was identified and proposed to zzso database as the main distinguishing feature of this new group of zzso zzso studies provide experimental evidence of a transcript induction of zzso during cellular zzso 

zzso pattern and sequence similarities to known plant zzso indicate that zzso is the first characterized zzso protein in zzso The high similarity of zzso with zzso coding sequences implies the existence of a novel zzso group of zzso Class II proteins characterized by a previously zzso signature zzso
