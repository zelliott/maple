The structure of the zzso nucleus is a major area of current interest in cell zzso It is thought likely that the nucleus is zzso around some form of structural zzso and that this zzso will play a role in processes as diverse as zzso replication and the integration of gene zzso However, the structure of the zzso within the nucleus has remained zzso largely because attempts to define it have been dogged by technical problems arising from the great complexity of this zzso This situation is now being changed by the application of in zzso analysis and of molecular genetic zzso which are opening up this zzso intractable zzso
