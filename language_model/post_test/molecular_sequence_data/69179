The zzso genes of zzso zzso are regulated by the interaction of zzso and zzso factors which facilitate activated zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso By selecting zzso that allow expression of a defective zzso hybrid promoter, we have identified a novel zzso zzso which is required for zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso that in the presence of a zzso background resulted in a zzso relief of zzso repression for the zzso zzso This compared with a zzso and negligible relief of repression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter showed a correlation between the number of zzso binding sites and the relative level of zzso zzso Relief of zzso repression by zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso but was independent of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity was seen for a promoter construct containing independent zzso binding zzso These results suggest that zzso acts to inhibit zzso function in zzso zzso We have cloned zzso by zzso and found that it contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso which could zzso a protein with a molecular weight of zzso
