zzso zzso primarily zzso cells of zzso lineage and can cause zzso in the skin, zzso and visceral zzso depending on both zzso and zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that catalyze the formation, reduction, and zzso of zzso bonds of proteins in zzso Although four zzso zzso genes are functionally zzso from zzso in the zzso zzso only two of them have been expressed as active proteins to zzso The functional relationship among various zzso zzso remains largely zzso In this study, we expressed and partially characterized all four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the sequence identity between zzso zzso (New zzso zzso and their counterpart zzso sequences from zzso major (Old zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso characterization indicated that while the 15-, zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins displayed both insulin zzso and zzso activities, the zzso protein had only zzso activity with no zzso zzso zzso All four zzso proteins were recognized by zzso from zzso zzso mice and were sensitive to zzso by standard zzso zzso This study describes the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggests a role for these proteins in zzso zzso
