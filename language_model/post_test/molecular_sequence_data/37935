zzso proteins zzso facilitate zzso transport inside the zzso and decrease the zzso zzso leading to heat zzso Until now, the presence of zzso or other zzso zzso had not been detected in zzso of zzso a species where evidence for the presence of brown zzso tissue has only been provided in 2-3 month old zzso In the light of the improving knowledge on the zzso family, we decided to examine both zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso Using zzso we have successfully cloned a partial zzso sequence and a complete zzso zzso zzso open reading frame zzso shares 90, 89 and zzso similarity with zzso human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso In 3-5 day old zzso these genes are expressed in zzso tissue and in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles, without any effect of muscle zzso zzso This is in good agreement with the measurement of the same membrane potential in zzso isolated from both types of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is more expressed in zzso than in zzso zzso These genes may be involved in the control of the energy metabolism of the zzso
