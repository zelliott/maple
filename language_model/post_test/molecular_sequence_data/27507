The zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso includes four members zzso zzso of the structurally related zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso interact directly with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso sodium zzso channels and regulate the functional properties of sodium channel zzso zzso zzso among the zzso is thought to zzso specificity to this zzso Here, we demonstrate that the two zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate currents produced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso both zzso and zzso current zzso In contrast, zzso of an zzso zzso lacking the zzso increased zzso current zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso localized at the zzso initial segment, and deletion of the zzso abolished this zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is required for targeting and functional regulation of zzso channels, suggesting an important function for zzso alternative zzso in regulating zzso zzso
