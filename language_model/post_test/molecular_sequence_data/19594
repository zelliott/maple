The ABC protein zzso formerly named zzso L inhibitor zzso is one of the most zzso proteins in evolution and is expressed in all organisms except zzso Because of its fundamental role in translation initiation and/or zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso Its molecular mechanism has, however, not been zzso In addition to two ABC zzso zzso zzso contains a unique zzso region with eight zzso zzso predicted to coordinate zzso zzso Here we present detailed information on the type and on the structural organization of the zzso clusters in zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso genetic zzso zzso harbors two essential zzso zzso clusters with different electronic zzso one zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso and one unique zzso cluster zzso zzso at positions 1, 2, 3, and zzso zzso only seven of the eight zzso zzso zzso the zzso clusters are essential for cell zzso zzso of the zzso at position 6 yielded a functional zzso with the zzso zzso cluster in a zzso zzso zzso zzso a lethal zzso of the zzso at position 4 can be rescued by zzso swapping with an zzso extra zzso zzso among all zzso
