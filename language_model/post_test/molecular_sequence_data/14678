zzso zzso zzso is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's zzso A zzso difference in the primary structure of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in distinct assembly pathways and toxicity zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso studies of zzso and zzso assembly resulted in zzso zzso size zzso consistent with experimental zzso Here, a large ensemble of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was subjected to fully zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations using the zzso force field combined with two water models, zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso were slightly larger, less zzso had similar turn and lower zzso zzso than those predicted by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso populated zzso similar free energy zzso In contrast, the free energy landscape of zzso zzso indicated a larger zzso zzso in comparison to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by an increased flexibility in the zzso region zzso and a larger zzso exposure of charged zzso acids relative to zzso zzso Of the three positively charged zzso zzso zzso was the most and zzso the least involved in salt bridge zzso This result was independent of the water model, zzso and assembly zzso Overall, salt bridge zzso increased upon zzso zzso An exception was the salt bridge propensity of zzso which decreased upon formation of zzso zzso and was significantly lower than in zzso zzso The potential relevance of the three positively charged zzso acids in zzso the zzso zzso toxicity is discussed in the light of available experimental zzso
