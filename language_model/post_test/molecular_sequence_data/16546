zzso activated forms of zzso are zzso through de zzso and salvage pathways and serve as zzso for the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso in higher zzso A zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso about zzso from pea zzso zzso zzso sprouts by conventional zzso The apparent molecular mass of the zzso zzso was 67,000 zzso The zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso from respective zzso zzso in the presence of zzso as a zzso indicating that the zzso has broad zzso specificity toward zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso occurred at pH zzso and at 45 degrees C in the presence of 2 zzso zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by reverse zzso zzso appears to zzso a protein with a molecular mass of zzso Da zzso zzso zzso and possesses a zzso site, which has also been found in a human zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso can be zzso in a group together with zzso from zzso and rice, which is distinct from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso the formation of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso with efficiency similar to that of the native zzso These results indicate that the zzso is a novel type of zzso zzso which zzso the formation of various zzso at the end of salvage pathways in higher zzso
