We cloned zzso of human zzso migration zzso factor zzso from a zzso line zzso 116 zzso acid zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso zzso specifically bound zzso zzso constant zzso 600 zzso and the protein was effectively zzso by an zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso was homogeneous on zzso and the molecular weight was calculated as zzso zzso The molecular weight was in excellent agreement with that of the primary structure assumed from the zzso On the other hand, the molecular weight in the native form calculated by zzso zzso gel zzso was zzso zzso which suggested that zzso formed a zzso zzso To further confirm the native molecular weight, we carried out zzso zzso This precise zzso analysis revealed that the native molecular weight was zzso zzso which confirmed that zzso existed as a zzso zzso
