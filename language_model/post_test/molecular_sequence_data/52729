The zzso eggshell is a specialized zzso zzso that forms between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells during the latter stages of zzso Largely zzso the eggshell is a highly organized multilayered structure with regional zzso designed to perform a variety of zzso zzso of a functional eggshell features: zzso the differentiation of zzso of zzso cells in response to zzso signals, zzso directed zzso of the zzso cells within the developing egg chamber, zzso expression of eggshell structural genes by the zzso cells in a defined zzso and spatial order, zzso zzso modifications of the eggshell proteins including several temporally regulated zzso zzso events, and zzso regulated trafficking of several eggshell proteins in the assembling zzso By exploiting the genetic advantages of zzso and using evolution as a guide, the eggshell provides an excellent experimental system to study, in zzso molecular mechanisms used to regulate zzso interactions throughout the assembly of a complex zzso architecture in a developing zzso
