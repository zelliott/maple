A functional zzso gene zzso has been identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso It is expressed in the late phase of virus replication in insect zzso High levels of both zzso and zzso activity were detected by 12 zzso zzso and remained stable throughout zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared using zzso material prepared in zzso This was used to demonstrate that a product of approximately 58 zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells showed that most zzso was located in the zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso from zzso cells confirmed that zzso initiated from a zzso late start site zzso 14 zzso upstream from the putative translation initiation zzso The predicted protein sequence of the zzso zzso shares extensive sequence similarity with zzso from bacteria and, in particular, the zzso zzso zzso A zzso identical zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso or an ancestral zzso acquired the zzso gene from a zzso via horizontal gene zzso
