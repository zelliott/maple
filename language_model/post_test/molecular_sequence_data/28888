A combination of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments, and zzso zzso gene cloning analysis was applied to investigate zzso development of zzso bacteria zzso community structure and in zzso zzso production activity within a zzso growing under zzso conditions zzso oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid was in the range of 0 to 100 zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso showed that oxygen penetrated 200 zzso from the surface during all stages of zzso zzso The first zzso production of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was detected below zzso 500 zzso in the 3rd week and then gradually increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 8th zzso The most active zzso production zone moved upward to the zzso interface and intensified with zzso This result coincided with an increase in zzso populations in the surface layer of the zzso The numbers of the probe zzso and zzso zzso populations significantly increased to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso respectively, in the surface 400 zzso during an zzso zzso while those populations were relatively unchanged in the deeper part of the zzso probably due to zzso transport zzso Based on zzso zzso gene cloning analysis data, clone sequences that related to zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso were most frequently zzso Different molecular analyses confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the zzso important members of zzso in this wastewater zzso
