zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso did not activate visceral muscles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a group but rather showed a selective action on the muscles of the zzso This organ showed a zzso response to all of the zzso at 3 zzso zzso M that was zzso above the mean level of spontaneous zzso The maximum response for each zzso was recorded at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso were zzso to zzso less sensitive than the zzso and each of the former required more than zzso M to elicit a zzso zzso The heart, by comparison, did not respond to any of these zzso zzso The zzso caused a protracted zzso of zzso events in the zzso that lasted for more than 60 zzso Moreover, all four peptides evoked zzso from zzso after membrane zzso with 158 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso receptors for the peptides exist in visceral zzso
