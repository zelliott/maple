Within this chapter, various techniques and instructions for characterizing primary structure of proteins are zzso whereas the focus lies on obtaining as much complete sequence information of single proteins as zzso zzso in the area of protein production, mass zzso detailed protein characterization plays an increasing important role for quality zzso In comparison to typical zzso applications, wherein it is mostly sufficient to identify proteins by few zzso several complementary techniques have to be applied to maximize primary structure information and analysis steps have to be specifically zzso Starting from sample preparation down to mass zzso analysis and finally to data analysis, some of the techniques typically applied are outlined here in a zzso and introductory zzso
