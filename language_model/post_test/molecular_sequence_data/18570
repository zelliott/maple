zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been recognized as a marker of degradation and aging in ancient zzso Using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to study zzso in zzso zzso we identified eight peptides from zzso proteins in sheep zzso that could potentially be used to assess the level of zzso For each chosen zzso the extent of zzso was determined by comparing the calculated theoretical distribution with the measured distribution using a genetic zzso that gives the best fit to the measured zzso Variations in the levels of zzso were observed between peptides and in modern zzso samples buried for up to 8 years in which zzso levels were relatively low under short-term zzso In contrast, zzso was higher in zzso textile fragments from medieval sites ranging from the 9th to 13th century in York zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and from the 13th to 16th century in zzso zzso Major differences were observed between the British and the zzso samples, showing a negative correlation between age of samples and levels of zzso but highlighting the effect of local zzso In addition, zzso liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso data indicated that zzso in zzso zzso was influenced by primary and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso rather than zzso in the zzso samples was attributed to a higher abundance of Q in the zzso core domain of zzso neighboring zzso and zzso hindrance preventing zzso of zzso
