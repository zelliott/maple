zzso of zzso zzso genes is regulated by zzso such as zzso acid zzso in cell culture and in early embryonic zzso zzso acid response elements zzso have been identified in zzso gene regulatory regions, suggesting that zzso zzso may be involved in the direct control of zzso gene patterning zzso Previously, two zzso located 3' of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso have been shown to regulate zzso zzso expression in the neural zzso and the zzso region, zzso the zzso develops into the zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso We have now examined the functional roles of these two types of 3' zzso in regulating zzso expression at different stages of zzso from embryonic day zzso to zzso in transgenic mice carrying specific zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso is required for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression in the gut and zzso zzso as well as for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in the zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso zzso in the neural zzso requires only the zzso zzso By in zzso zzso we have identified a new site of zzso expression in the developing forelimbs at approximately day zzso and we show that, in transgenic zzso expression in the zzso buds requires that either the zzso or the zzso zzso is zzso zzso of a high level of zzso zzso expression in other regions, such as in zzso 4 zzso and in the zzso requires that both the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso In addition, our transgenic data indicate that the zzso gene is expressed in other zzso such as the zzso gut, zzso zzso and zzso Our analysis shows that zzso zzso act through individual zzso and zzso zzso to regulate zzso expression in different regions of the zzso and that functional zzso between these zzso and zzso zzso does not exist with respect to neural zzso and the gut zzso zzso
