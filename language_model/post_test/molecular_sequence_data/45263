The zzso maturation protein zzso gene encodes a zinc finger and zzso zzso zzso zzso A number of functional studies in a variety of zzso species have demonstrated that zzso is a master regulator of cell fate determination and cell differentiation in a wide diversity of zzso zzso Despite all of this significance, the role, if any, of a zzso of zzso in directing zzso events during embryonic development of zzso has so far remained completely zzso In this report, we describe the identification of a zzso zzso of zzso and show that the gene is expressed in diverse cell types during the course of zzso Further, using genetic analysis, we demonstrate that its zzso activity is critically required for the maturation of the zzso system into properly differentiated zzso
