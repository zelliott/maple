zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein essential for the survival of primordial germ zzso In zzso maternal Nos partitions into pole cells and suppresses zzso to permit proper zzso zzso However, how this critical event is regulated by Nos has remained zzso Here, we report that Nos zzso zzso of pole cells by suppressing translation of head zzso defective zzso a member of the zzso gene family that is required for zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that hid acts in concert with another zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso of zzso is induced in pole cells by maternal zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is required to zzso hid zzso However, zzso expression is largely suppressed in normal pole zzso Once the pole cells lack maternal zzso zzso zzso expression is fully zzso suggesting that zzso expression is also restricted by zzso These findings provide the first evidence that the germ line is maintained through the regulated expression of zzso zzso
