zzso and zzso are zzso factors activated specifically in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso elements capable of binding to zzso zzso or both have been identified to date, namely zzso zzso element zzso unfolded protein response element zzso and zzso zzso controls the expression of zzso molecular zzso such as zzso that can zzso unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso from zzso is fully activated by zzso even in the absence of zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso depends solely on zzso and it has been suggested that zzso may control the expression of components of the zzso degradation system that can degrade unfolded proteins in the zzso The zzso zzso one of the most highly zzso genes under zzso stress, encodes an zzso membrane protein containing a zzso domain with unknown functions, and carries zzso in addition to zzso in its zzso In this report, we show that zzso allows the zzso binding of zzso as in the case of zzso and zzso binding of zzso as in the case of zzso and that zzso from zzso is zzso in the absence of zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso was diminished in the absence of zzso whereas that of zzso zzso was not zzso These results may help in understanding the role of zzso in the quality control system in the zzso
