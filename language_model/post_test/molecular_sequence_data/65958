zzso expressed genes were identified in the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso maturation via differential display reverse zzso chain reaction zzso They are zzso signaling zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso gene identified in this study shows zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso respectively, to zzso and zzso previously isolated from this species, suggesting the identification of a new zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso gene expression was highest when the zzso was actively zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited a similar trend of expression to zzso zzso suggesting their involvement in zzso zzso The signal zzso related genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highly expressed in the zzso in the initial phase of zzso These genes may be important for the signaling in the zzso for synthesis and zzso of zzso and nutrients to the developing zzso The present work provides candidate genes for further investigation on the role of zzso in shrimp zzso
