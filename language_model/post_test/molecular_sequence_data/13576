zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso coli is subject to a phase variation control mechanism that is regulated by the zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In previous work, we found that the differential Dam zzso of two target sites in zzso regulatory DNA, zzso and zzso II, is essential for the transition between active and inactive zzso zzso zzso Here, we identify six zzso binding sites within the zzso regulatory DNA, each separated by about three zzso zzso zzso binds with highest affinity to three sites zzso 2 and 3) zzso to the zzso zzso A zzso analysis indicates that the binding of zzso to sites 2 and 3 zzso zzso transcription, which is consistent with the fact that zzso binding site 3 is located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding region of zzso The addition of zzso decreases the affinity of zzso for sites 1, 2 and 3 and increases its affinity for the zzso zzso binding sites 4 and zzso zzso within zzso binding sites 4 and 5 shut off zzso transcription, indicating that the binding of zzso to this zzso region activates zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites are located within zzso binding sites 5 and 2, respectively, providing a mechanism by which Dam controls zzso binding and Pap phase zzso
