zzso zzso represent the remaining members of a formerly diverse zzso of ancient zzso zzso and have been the subject of multiple zzso analyses using zzso zzso Here, we present the first hypothesis of zzso relationships among living zzso species based on molecular data, through the examination of gene tree zzso and zzso species tree analyses of a portion of one zzso zzso and seven nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Individual gene trees displayed varying degrees of resolution with regards to zzso zzso and the gene trees zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso were the only two that were completely zzso zzso species tree analyses of nuclear genes resulted in a zzso and strongly supported zzso tree of living zzso species, for which zzso zzso zzso support was further improved by the inclusion of the zzso zzso zzso relationships among zzso zzso from our molecular data set were highly zzso with previously published zzso zzso with the exception of the placement of two species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the character coding used by previous authors provided partial resolution of this zzso zzso resulting in broad zzso in the zzso zzso from individual zzso the zzso species tree analysis, and zzso The completely resolved zzso zzso from the molecular data set with strong zzso zzso support at all zzso provided insights into the potential for zzso zzso and patterns of zzso zzso in the evolutionary history of living zzso as well as a solid foundation for future examinations of functional diversification and evolutionary stasis in a zzso zzso zzso
