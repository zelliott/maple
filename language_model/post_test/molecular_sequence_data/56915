zzso among transcripts from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso cells has been analyzed by Northern zzso zzso zzso and primer zzso In both sensitive and resistant cells, a major zzso initiation site mapped zzso 11 zzso downstream of the zzso box, near position zzso relative to the zzso zzso Two other major zzso initiation sites mapped zzso eight and 45 zzso respectively, upstream of the zzso zzso In addition, at least six minor sites were zzso four of which mapped within zzso zzso Within the zzso region zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso gene were four zzso motifs and three zzso zzso Additional zzso repeats occurred in the first zzso and in the single 56 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso terminated at a single position, zzso 22 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso
