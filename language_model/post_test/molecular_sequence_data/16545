In zzso cells, induced expression of zzso in response to wound trauma and pathogen infection plays an important role in regulating the metabolism of zzso to either zzso or zzso oxide zzso In higher plants, which also zzso zzso for the production of zzso and zzso the potential role of zzso as a control point for zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we report the characterization of two genes zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso like all other plant zzso are more similar to zzso than to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso and zzso exhibited specificity for zzso over zzso and related zzso zzso The plant zzso like zzso zzso were inhibited zzso approximately 14 zzso by the NO precursor zzso These results indicate that plant zzso define a distinct group of zzso that function as authentic zzso zzso and zzso transcripts accumulated to their highest levels in zzso zzso In leaves, zzso expression and zzso activity were induced in response to wounding and treatment with zzso acid zzso a potent signal for plant defense zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso was not observed in the tomato zzso zzso zzso indicating that this response is strictly dependent on an intact zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants with a virulent strain of zzso zzso zzso tomato also zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso This response was zzso by the bacterial zzso zzso which exerts its zzso effects by co-opting the host zzso signaling zzso These results highlight striking similarities in the regulation of zzso in plants and animals and suggest that zzso zzso may perform similar roles in diverse biological zzso
