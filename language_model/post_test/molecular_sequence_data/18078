We have isolated and analyzed a zzso gene from zzso zzso This gene encodes a 148 zzso acid precursor protein including a zzso transit zzso of 52 zzso Southern analysis shows the presence of a single copy of this zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso Its expression is zzso and positively affected by zzso Response times, both to dark and light conditions, are remarkably zzso A zzso gene consisting of a zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso fused to the zzso reporter gene was transferred to zzso This fusion gene is expressed in a zzso way; it shows high levels of expression in green leaves, as compared to root zzso
