The study was zzso to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso gene zzso by a sensitive and specific zzso method zzso specific zzso zzso and DNA sequencing for rapid analysis of the promoter zzso status, and to explore the possible mechanism of the zzso gene zzso in human multiple myeloma zzso cells induced by zzso The zzso status of the zzso gene in zzso cell line before and after treatment with zzso was detected by the zzso specific zzso and DNA sequencing, the zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso gene were determined by zzso and the induced growth zzso of zzso cell was zzso by growth curve, zzso and zzso the DNA content of zzso cells was analyzed by flow zzso after being exposed to zzso The results showed that zzso all zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell not were changed, while all zzso in treated zzso cells with zzso had been converted to zzso zzso zzso gene was not expressed in zzso cell line after zzso As compared with the zzso the expression of zzso cell zzso gene zzso was increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 72 hours zzso zzso zzso could significantly zzso DNA zzso 1 zzso 1), zzso and zzso gene at zzso level in a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells line grew slowly and arrested at zzso - zzso phase after treatment with three different zzso of zzso It is concluded that zzso can activate and zzso the expression of zzso gene which zzso the proliferation of zzso cell through inducing the zzso - zzso arrest by zzso zzso by zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso
