A zzso zzso was developed that permitted high-level expression of a functional form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (the zzso gene zzso zzso at its zzso end with an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso When expressed in zzso from this zzso zzso was produced at a level at least zzso higher than that reported previously for any other zzso zzso expressed in the same zzso For zzso isolated cell zzso containing the zzso zzso were zzso with zzso under specific conditions and subjected to immobilized metal affinity zzso Yields as high as 1 zzso of nearly homogeneous zzso zzso were routinely obtained even from relatively small scale preparations zzso g of frozen cell zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into artificial zzso zzso zzso binding studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso bound its zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso consistent with the affinity expected for this zzso in the absence of its associated G zzso zzso restoration of zzso binding activity upon zzso required the addition of zzso zzso prepared from a zzso strain lacking the zzso zzso amounts of active material can be obtained by this procedure to allow physical studies of this zzso and other zzso receptors expressed in this zzso
