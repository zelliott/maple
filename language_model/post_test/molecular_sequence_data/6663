A promoter probe shuttle zzso suitable for the isolation of promoter elements from zzso bacteria was zzso This zzso carried the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso as a reporter zzso and was capable of replication in both zzso coli and zzso zzso The zzso was used in the construction of a zzso zzso library of zzso independently isolated promoter zzso zzso with a wide range of activities in zzso zzso including some very strong promoter zzso were zzso Comparative analysis suggests that significant differences between zzso zzso and zzso coli may exist in the zzso of promoter zzso
