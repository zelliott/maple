The zzso zzso stress responsive zzso protein gene zzso which encodes a protein including typical zzso zinc finger structure, was isolated by reverse zzso chain reaction from zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed that its expression was induced under drought and salt stress zzso To examine its function, zzso of the zzso zzso driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter, was cloned into a plant expression zzso zzso and introduced into tobacco zzso zzso tobacco showed an enhanced salt zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in plant responsiveness to salt zzso
