The zzso protein zzso gene locus zzso has been linked to two kinds of red cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Childhood zzso zzso in zzso coding sequences have been found in zzso of zzso patients, but not in zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso sequence zzso contribute to the considerable clinical zzso in red cell zzso We therefore aimed at identifying zzso variations associated with zzso or zzso zzso 

We targeted a region of zzso zzso encompassing the zzso gene in a cohort of 89 zzso and zzso patients for zzso We provide here a catalog of the zzso previously zzso degree of variation in this zzso We identified 73 variations (65 zzso 8 zzso that all are located outside of the zzso open reading frame, and of which zzso are classified as zzso We zzso that specific zzso in zzso regions of zzso could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or zzso zzso zzso we carried out an extensive analysis to identify zzso factor binding sites zzso A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected zzso Sixteen of the corresponding zzso factors are of particular interest, as they are zzso genes or show a direct link to zzso zzso or leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso at predicted zzso may alter the expression of zzso modify an important interaction between zzso factors with overlapping zzso or remove an important stimulus for zzso We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for zzso and could provide new insights into individual response to zzso
