zzso zzso is an zzso virus with 180 copies of a coat protein forming a shell around a zzso zzso zzso The coat protein zzso form a lattice with the zzso number T zzso zzso The coat protein has a fold which is different from the fold of all other viral coat proteins so far zzso It consists of a zzso beta sheet facing the inside of the zzso and a hairpin and two zzso on the zzso The crystal structure has been refined at zzso A zzso The final zzso was zzso for reflections with F zzso 2 zzso and the zzso zzso from idealized bond lengths and bond angles was zzso A and zzso degrees, zzso The three chemically identical zzso A, B and C are largely zzso The B zzso has a unique zzso in one loop, which is involved in zzso zzso while the A and C zzso which are involved in the zzso zzso are similar throughout the zzso One zzso has been identified in the B zzso but the corresponding zzso in A and C are of the trans zzso This zzso is zzso within small zzso zzso and it is proposed that this zzso enables a less zzso loop zzso around the zzso zzso thus creating a zzso The extensive zzso contact supports the idea of zzso as initial building zzso An assembly zzso is proposed where five zzso zzso into a zzso and 12 zzso are linked together with free zzso creating a complete zzso
