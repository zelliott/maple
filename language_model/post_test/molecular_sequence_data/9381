zzso an zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with 1, 299 zzso in zzso zzso a zzso factor zzso of 432 zzso acid zzso zzso from complementary experiment indicated that zzso was completely capable of restoring the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Together with the sequence and expression data, the zzso data suggested that zzso encodes the zzso of zzso To address the zzso zzso of zzso we performed zzso zzso in zzso Fusion protein of zzso with zzso DNA binding domain strongly activated zzso in zzso and the zzso activity of zzso was localized to the zzso 100 zzso zzso To further study the function of zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso we used a transgenic approach that involved targeted zzso interference zzso repression induced by zzso Floral various zzso zzso and reduced female fertility were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of the function of zzso gene also resulted in delayed zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso In the strong zzso lines, seeds showed defects in shape, structure and development and larger zzso Strong zzso and zzso seeds initially did not display a significant difference in zzso at 10 zzso but the development of zzso seeds was slower than that of wild type at 20 zzso and further at 30 zzso zzso seeds were essentially at their final size, whereas zzso seeds stopped growing and developing and gradually zzso
