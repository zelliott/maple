The zzso of zzso zzso bonds which is required for the liberation of many zzso important compounds is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are implicated in several processes in plants, such as the timely response to zzso and zzso stresses through zzso of zzso and defense zzso We identified 26 zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and propose a standardized nomenclature for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterized their zzso structure, protein features, zzso zzso and measured their expression and activity in various zzso under different environmental zzso zzso alignments revealed some characteristic motifs zzso zzso zzso and specific differences among different zzso Analysis of putative signal peptides suggested that some zzso are zzso whereas others are zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that each member of the zzso family had a characteristic expression pattern with regard to tissue specificity and response to different zzso zzso The source of zzso for gene expression was highest for the type of organ analyzed zzso zzso than for the growth conditions zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Analysis of promoter sequences revealed that each zzso zzso possesses a distinct set of zzso elements and zzso factor binding zzso Since there are no two zzso zzso that have identical molecular properties, we conclude that gene zzso in zzso occurs much more rapidly than gene zzso
