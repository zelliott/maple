zzso zzso and zzso constitute the zzso clock machinery in zzso and zzso activates zzso expression whereas zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is composed of three functional zzso the zzso zzso domain, the central zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain is responsible for zzso formation, binding to zzso enhancing zzso zzso and generating the zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structure at a resolution of zzso A of the zzso zzso domain of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso located at the center of a zzso zzso zzso is essential to zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso probably occurs via the zzso zzso On the basis of the structure, we predict the structural roles of the zzso that affect zzso zzso
