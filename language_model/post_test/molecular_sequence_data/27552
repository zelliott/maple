Apart from its use in research, zzso stem cell transplantation zzso may have important clinical zzso This controlled study aimed at evaluating the safety of zzso by analyzing the DNA zzso pattern of zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and live born offspring obtained after zzso in zzso 

zzso cell suspensions were transplanted to the zzso of genetically sterile WW zzso zzso males were zzso with fertile females and their first and second generation offspring were examined and compared with controls with respect to weight, length and DNA zzso zzso zzso treated zzso DNA extracted from zzso zzso liver, kidney and zzso of first and second generation offspring was zzso to obtain zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso was used to individually zzso the resulting artificial zzso sequence variation at zzso zzso 

First and second generation offspring developed normally with their length and weight not being different from zzso Also the DNA zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso were not different among controls and first and second generation offspring after zzso 

zzso between zzso individuals was not associated with changes in fetal development nor with differences in the DNA zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso or other zzso from two subsequent generations of offspring obtained after zzso
