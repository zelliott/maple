zzso II zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso the first committed step in the zzso zzso zzso We report here the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso in zzso zzso where it was found to be present as a zzso zzso zzso sequence is available at the zzso zzso Number zzso The putative zzso of zzso has a high similarity of zzso with zzso II sequences from other zzso zzso Gene expression and alignment studies confirmed the functional zzso of this zzso zzso model was developed with zzso coli zzso zzso as template to identify the zzso zzso and to explore its functional zzso We report here the first three-dimensional model of any zzso zzso II which due to its absence in humans assumes significance for zzso drug zzso
