We have discovered that zzso zzso zzso zzso to apparent zzso from zzso zzso coli cells, possesses a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso in the active center of zzso zzso zzso abolished or greatly decreased the zzso zzso This zzso activity is specific for zzso DNA and zzso zzso and does not manifest on zzso zzso Under the conditions of zzso zzso on zzso DNA, no zzso activity was zzso The zzso attacks DNA zzso in zzso or zzso zzso The zzso is a 3' to zzso zzso leaving a zzso end, and it degrades DNA zzso to a minimum size of 3 to 5 zzso It is completely dependent on zzso The zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso although not zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso activity is suppressed but an unusual zzso zzso activity is zzso zzso from isolated zzso and zzso complexes arrested by a zzso roadblock or naturally paused at the zzso of an zzso template exhibited evidence of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso is unrelated to zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso acts only in arrested or paused zzso complexes, and that in combination with the unusual zzso zzso activity, causes zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, during normal zzso zzso the kinetic balance between zzso and zzso is shifted in favor of zzso
