zzso zzso preparations isolated from zzso growing zzso zzso cells contain the core zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with multiple zzso factors and other zzso zzso such as zzso omega 1, and omega zzso We have developed an improved, large-scale zzso procedure that yields zzso zzso zzso enriched in both the zzso 28 and delta zzso These zzso have been used to isolate zzso 28 protein for zzso characterization and for preparation of highly specific zzso 28 zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso zzso 28 protein and the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso fragments have been zzso zzso 28 zzso specifically inhibit zzso by the zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso yet do not affect zzso by zzso 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirms that the zzso 28 protein zzso with total zzso zzso activity through the majority of the zzso procedure and allows the steps when zzso 28 protein is lost to be identified and zzso zzso techniques have also been used to monitor the structure and abundance of the zzso 28 protein in zzso A single form of zzso protein was detected by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso Its abundance zzso to a zzso content of 220 molecules of zzso 28 per zzso zzso cell during zzso zzso
