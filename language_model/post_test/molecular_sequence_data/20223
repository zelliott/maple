Human zzso is a small zzso zzso that functions as an inhibitor of the zzso complex zzso of the complement system by binding the complement proteins zzso and zzso The crystal structure of a soluble construct of zzso has been determined to zzso A zzso When compared with previous models of zzso determined using zzso some interesting differences are noted, including the position of zzso zzso which contributes to the binding surface for zzso and zzso Interestingly, the crystal structure zzso more closely with an updated zzso model of zzso that was produced using zzso Carlo zzso including zzso zzso zzso of zzso associated with enhanced or lowered zzso function of zzso show the binding region to be located in a zzso between zzso and a zzso zzso as has been identified zzso zzso in the core of this region are well ordered in the electron density, in part zzso to a network of stabilizing zzso and zzso zzso and manifest an interesting zzso distribution of zzso and basic zzso zzso of the same zzso that was modeled previously into the zzso structure shows that zzso which has been zzso to exist in zzso and zzso positions, is intermediate in position between these two and is well placed to contact the zzso Further clues regarding how zzso interacts with small peptides arise from the crystal packing of this structure, which shows that a zzso loop zzso zzso zzso occupies a zzso similar position to the modeled zzso This higher resolution structure of zzso will facilitate a more precise dissection of its interactions with zzso and zzso and thus increase the likelihood of designing enhanced zzso zzso
