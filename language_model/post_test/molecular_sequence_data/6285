A zzso zzso designated zzso has been cloned from zzso zzso zzso by zzso et zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso coli harboring the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso gene on the zzso when cultured in the presence of zzso which suggests that zzso may act as an zzso (or an zzso for the expression of the specific gene in the presence of zzso We constructed a zzso designated zzso which senses zzso and produces a zzso using zzso and a zzso zzso gene located under the control of zzso promoter: zzso coli harboring zzso produced the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that the transformed zzso coli can be employed as a reporter zzso to screen zzso zzso
