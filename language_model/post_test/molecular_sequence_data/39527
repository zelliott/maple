Thirteen zzso or zzso genes have been revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso with two zzso populations of infected and zzso control roots of zzso zzso Eleven of them zzso small zzso showing zzso to zzso cluster proteins zzso that contain a putative signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso codes for a zzso of the zzso 2 family and zzso contains a scorpion zzso domain at the zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso which was isolated revealed that one zzso separates the first zzso zzso the signal zzso from the second zzso zzso the zzso cluster domain of this zzso Another two zzso zzso and zzso zzso two different products similar to zzso transfer proteins zzso zzso northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis indicated that the other genes except zzso and zzso were expressed exclusively in zzso roots and that their expression was 2-4 d later than that of the zzso zzso gene during zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in zzso control roots but with a significant decline in expression and a zzso expression similar to zzso zzso had a zzso expression in control roots identified by zzso zzso alignment showed that the putative proteins zzso and zzso show lower zzso with zzso from zzso than with those from other zzso
