zzso zzso are important proteins which in addition to controlling the cell regulatory zzso can be manipulated for various zzso zzso The latter is of great interest for zzso zzso used for industrial zzso To facilitate the identification of these zzso we have zzso the zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the presence of zinc finger zzso zzso After analysis of 239 zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso we describe in this paper 161 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso proteins present in one or several of 13 different zzso zzso These partial sequences have been evaluated on different criteria such as percentage of identity of the zzso zzso detailed analysis of the zzso motif and zzso regions, and zzso zzso They can be used to fetch the corresponding zzso
