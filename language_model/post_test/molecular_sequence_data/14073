Agents such as zzso peptides and toxins can zzso membrane zzso to cause leakage of zzso contents in either a graded or an zzso zzso zzso of which mode of leakage is induced is an important step in understanding the molecular mechanism of membrane zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have developed a zzso method for distinguishing the two modes that makes use of the zzso pair zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso without the usual need for the physical separation of zzso from released zzso Their zzso method establishes the mode of release through the zzso changes that occur when zzso is added zzso to a solution of zzso that have released some fraction of their zzso However, the zzso method as originally stated ignored the possibility of preferential release of dye or zzso Here we extend the theory of the method to take into account preferential release and the effects of graded zzso The ratio of the rates of release of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso dye zzso zzso acid can be estimated by means of the zzso For graded zzso we show that the release of the markers does not coincide with the zzso changes observed in the standard leakage zzso This is true for zzso zzso as well and means that 1) the amount of released material will be overestimated and 2) the zzso will be zzso and have artificially high apparent zzso We show how the extended zzso analysis allows the results of leakage experiments to be corrected for artifacts that result from graded and preferential zzso Experimental evidence is presented for the existence of zzso preferential graded leakage of zzso from both neutral and zzso zzso
