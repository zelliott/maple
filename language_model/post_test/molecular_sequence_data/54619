zzso virus zzso human peripheral B cells into zzso cell lines zzso that zzso specific zzso Our previous studies showed that a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso factor expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and displayed an ongoing process of zzso zzso zzso at a frequency of zzso zzso in its zzso rearranged zzso zzso The present work shows that zzso similarly affects the zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso of multiple zzso clones derived from cellular zzso of the parental culture, showed that both zzso exhibited an ongoing zzso process with zzso rates of zzso zzso with a high preference for zzso transition zzso and lack of a significant strand zzso About 50% of the zzso were targeted to the zzso zzso bases in the zzso and zzso hotspot zzso indicating that they were due to the initial phase of AID zzso zzso were targeted to the zzso zzso and not to the zzso or to the zzso zzso Genealogical trees showed a zzso zzso of only 1-3 zzso per branch of the zzso zzso zzso of all the zzso in the two zzso occurred repeatedly and independently within certain sites (not necessarily the zzso hotspot zzso in cellular clones belonging to different branches of the lineage zzso Furthermore, some of the zzso seem to arise as zzso zzso zzso independently generated in different cellular zzso zzso analysis showed that it is very unlikely that these clusters were due to random targeting of equally accessible zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso that generate recurring zzso clusters in the zzso zzso zzso zzso sites may enhance affinity maturation and generation of effective zzso zzso zzso against invading zzso
