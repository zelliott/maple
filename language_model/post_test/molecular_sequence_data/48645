Experimental studies of barley and zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso show that the two proteins bind the zzso zzso in opposite zzso in their internal zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is reported to bind the zzso zzso in the internal cavity in a mixture of two zzso with approximately equal zzso Six 30 zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations of zzso and barley zzso with zzso bound in two zzso zzso M and zzso have been used to understand the different zzso binding zzso The simulations show that both zzso and barley zzso could bind zzso in the orientation observed zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso interaction being a salt bridge between the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso side zzso However, the simulation of barley zzso with zzso in the mode B orientation shows the most favorable zzso interaction zzso In contrast, the simulations of zzso zzso with zzso and with zzso in the mode B orientation show no persistent zzso zzso the zzso leaving the cavity during the zzso zzso differences between zzso and barley zzso in the AB loop region, in zzso at the base of the zzso zzso and in the zzso A region are identified as contributing to the different zzso The simulations reproduce well the zzso observed binding preferences for zzso and suggest that the experimental data for zzso zzso with zzso reflect zzso mobility in binding mode M rather than the population of binding modes M and zzso
