In the present study we investigated the zzso and zzso characteristics of a cohort of zzso women, with the aim to determine a relationship between zzso status and frequency and/or severity of cervical zzso 

21 women, who tested positive for the zzso zzso and who were admitted as zzso because of various zzso complications or because of an zzso infection that was under regular clinical zzso A pelvic examination was performed and zzso zzso were obtained from zzso and zzso before zzso zzso zzso samples for human zzso zzso detection by zzso chain reaction were also zzso zzso obtained in the group of zzso women were compared with findings in a group of zzso zzso women recruited zzso from our zzso zzso zzso samples for T zzso were drawn within 2 weeks of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were purchased from Becton Dickinson zzso View, zzso zzso 

zzso women had a significantly higher percentage of zzso DNA zzso with respect to the zzso population zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso Analysis of zzso specimens revealed 9 women zzso with zzso evidence of cervical zzso in the zzso group zzso 23 zzso of zzso in the zzso population zzso zzso zzso All the zzso women with cervical zzso presented an associated zzso DNA zzso in particular, the percentage of associated zzso DNA type 16 in cervical zzso was zzso zzso zzso In zzso women, the evaluation of T zzso subset distribution suggested a significant relationship between zzso cell decrease and severity of zzso findings zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso women had a tenfold higher prevalence of both zzso infection and cervical zzso than the zzso population; this increased risk seems to be limited mainly to those who also had zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso status confirmed previous observations that an impaired immune system results in increased cervical zzso
