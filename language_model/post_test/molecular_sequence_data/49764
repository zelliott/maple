In zzso free zzso zzso zzso particles and zzso contain an abundant zzso protein called zzso zzso which regulates translation, presumably by affecting the packaging of the zzso Here, we have identified a zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso and studied its relation with the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells contain zzso zzso with the zzso active regions blown up as zzso A few giant zzso called zzso rings zzso generate a zzso product, a large zzso zzso which can be zzso (with the electron zzso during its assembly on the gene and during its transport to and through the nuclear zzso The zzso protein zzso designated zzso (or zzso for zzso was shown to contain a central zzso domain, an zzso and zzso zzso domain, and a zzso domain with alternating zzso and basic regions, an zzso that is characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso protein appears in two zzso zzso and zzso which contain 264 and 317 zzso zzso zzso The two zzso share the first 258 zzso acids and thus differ in zzso sequence only in the region close to the zzso When a zzso zzso was raised against zzso western zzso analysis and zzso showed that zzso is not only abundant in the zzso but is also present in the zzso zzso of isolated zzso zzso showed that zzso appears in zzso active regions, including the zzso Using zzso zzso we revealed that zzso is added along the nascent transcripts and is also present in the released zzso zzso particles in the zzso Finally, by zzso zzso in zzso we showed that zzso is bound to both nuclear and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is being added zzso along the growing zzso zzso is released with the processed zzso into the zzso and probably remains associated with the zzso both during zzso transport and protein zzso Given that the zzso zzso presumably with a role in translation, is loaded onto the primary transcript zzso with transcription, an early programming of the zzso fate of zzso is zzso
