zzso of zzso growth factor 2 zzso is believed to be a contributing factor to the growth of a number of tumor types, including zzso zzso zzso However, the potential of zzso zzso that neutralize zzso for treatment of patients with cancer has not yet been explored in clinical zzso We therefore generated a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso and characterized its properties in zzso and in zzso zzso binds to a different zzso than several previous zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso was defined using zzso zzso proteins and zzso scanning zzso and was shown to comprise zzso acids in both the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso blocked binding of zzso to each of its four cellular zzso strongly inhibited zzso proliferation and downstream signaling in human zzso vein zzso cells, and inhibited proliferation and downstream signaling in two zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso administered at 5 zzso zzso twice weekly, zzso inhibited growth of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines in nude mice, and in some models, had a strong additive effect with an zzso zzso or zzso Treatment with zzso also blocked zzso and inhibited downstream cellular signaling in zzso indicating its zzso mechanism of zzso Our report supports clinical testing of a humanized form of the zzso zzso for treatment of zzso and potentially other zzso
