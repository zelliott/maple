Sixteen zzso zzso genes zzso to a zzso zzso at zzso on zzso zzso zzso Four of these genes comprise two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso Members within each pair share zzso sequence identity at both the zzso and the zzso acid zzso One zzso clone zzso on the zzso with substantial internal sequence zzso contains two complete copies of zzso and zzso and one truncated copy of zzso while a partially overlapping clone zzso contains one copy each of zzso and zzso zzso comparison of the regions of zzso with those of zzso containing the four genes reveals zzso sequence similarity over 37 zzso These observations support the idea that the multiple copies of zzso and zzso present in a single zzso zzso are the result of zzso zzso
