The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of zzso strains circulating in zzso zzso DNA isolated from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of 20 randomly selected zzso individuals was classified into zzso by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and gag zzso regions of the viral zzso The zzso tree based on zzso zzso sequences showed that 15 of the 20 samples were zzso B, two zzso one zzso one zzso and one zzso The zzso analysis of the gag gene yielded identical results expect for one sample that had a zzso zzso it was identified as zzso A1 in the zzso and zzso in the gag zzso Our study confirmed that although zzso B zzso other zzso and circulating zzso forms zzso are also present in zzso The high zzso genetic diversity of zzso B sequences suggests a multiple introduction of zzso B strains into zzso
