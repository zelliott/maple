zzso of short zzso sequences may play a central role in the generation of protein zzso We report here the existence of an zzso group of proteins (the zzso precursors zzso and zzso six zzso and five classes of zinc finger knot zzso having both zzso signatures zzso and their inverse complementary sequences zzso in the same zzso zzso We have also found cases in which the zzso of a given signature is not present in the same zzso but zzso zzso a zzso motif of the human zzso factor, zzso coexists with its inverse complementary sequence in 31 zzso the inverse complementary alone is present in a great number of zzso Our findings suggest that short DNA zzso are a widespread feature of the zzso
