zzso of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso as precursor of the zzso acid zzso The three genes from the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been identified in zzso zzso The expression of zzso is increased up to zzso at the onset of zzso zzso and later decreases to zzso over the zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso zzso decreases when zzso begins to be zzso zzso and zzso are the two zzso of a zzso zzso that would convert zzso into zzso zzso of zzso led to the production of two compounds containing a lateral side chain derived from zzso instead of zzso zzso of this zzso zzso also reaches a peak increase of up to zzso coinciding with the onset of zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso led to an increase in the yield of zzso
