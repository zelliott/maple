The zzso and zzso zzso is a small, zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso was employed as a structural unit in the design of a zzso protein containing two putative zzso zzso By linking two zzso proteins together and comparing the DNA interaction of zzso to that of zzso this study may provide structural insights into other zzso zzso zzso The engineered zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso two zzso zzso molecules through the zzso zzso zzso zzso stability and zzso ability of zzso zzso were assessed and compared to those of wild type zzso by gel zzso zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be equally zzso as wild type, and its ability to stabilize DNA duplex is the same as wild zzso However, the interaction of zzso zzso with DNA zzso from that of wild type, suggesting different zzso modes for zzso zzso In addition, a large difference in extinction zzso was observed in all zzso CD zzso which was reminiscent of the spectrum of zzso zzso of various chemical groups to zzso zzso is possible through the zzso zzso zzso This offers a possible approach in the design of a zzso zzso with novel zzso
