A zzso approach was applied to determine the peptides in the zzso central nervous system of the zzso flesh fly, zzso zzso zzso obtained by high performance liquid zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso mass zzso This provided zzso evidence for the presence of 18 zzso 11 of which were novel zzso zzso Most prominently present were the zzso zzso 7 zzso 1 zzso and zzso The three putative zzso products zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso as well as another zzso This zzso was also present in the ring zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso an intermediate processing product of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the central nervous system contained zzso zzso and zzso designated as zzso With this study, we considerably increased our knowledge of the zzso of the zzso fly zzso zzso which is an important insect model for zzso zzso
