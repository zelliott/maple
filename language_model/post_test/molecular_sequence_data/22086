The regulation of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in specific cell and zzso contexts is not well zzso Here, we identified DNA regions that mediate zzso gene zzso in two of the three major cell types of the zzso zzso of the early pregnant zzso Two clusters of zzso start sites at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso in the zzso zzso gene were localized in zzso zzso and in primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of this gene zzso zzso were fused to a zzso reporter zzso and the zzso were zzso zzso into zzso GE and ST cells representative of pregnancy days 12 and 18 zzso 115 zzso zzso A short (110 zzso upstream region zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso promoters in the two cell types at both pregnancy zzso Two zzso copies of the novel sequence motif zzso within the zzso zzso were implicated in zzso activity, since block zzso of these sequences led to a repression of zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso identified an zzso nuclear protein of zzso molecular weight that bound an zzso containing this zzso and zzso suggested robust expression of this protein in early pregnancy zzso and in zzso but at much reduced levels in zzso at later zzso A pair of zzso elements zzso within the 110 zzso region was zzso to zzso promoter zzso block zzso of these converted the zzso region into a potent zzso zzso in all but day 18 ST zzso zzso identify novel DNA motifs that regulate the zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
