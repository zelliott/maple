zzso zzso and zzso zzso clone zzso now renamed zzso is a small zzso protein expressed in the zzso and upper airways of humans, mice, rats, and zzso This protein is structurally zzso to known zzso of host defense against zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso sequence and expression of a novel but closely related gene from zzso which we call zzso Mouse zzso sequence is zzso identical to mouse zzso The genes also share highly zzso zzso elements including zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso By comparing the expression profiles of zzso zzso and a third related zzso zzso in mice, we show that these genes are expressed in unique zzso along a continuous corridor of zzso zzso zzso and respiratory zzso This expression pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins protect zzso surfaces zzso by potentially zzso zzso
