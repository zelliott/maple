zzso gap junctions are constituted of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso only seven different zzso have been described so zzso Here, we identify two new zzso from zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso zzso displays strong zzso with mouse zzso and zzso zzso is expressed throughout embryonic zzso zzso zzso is only zzso found from stage 22 to 26 of zzso While no zzso expression could be detected by whole mount in zzso zzso expression of zzso was found in the developing zzso lateral zzso liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso failed to produce functional zzso In contrast, zzso expression of full-length zzso in zzso and zzso cells resulted in the formation of gap zzso structures at the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in communication deficient zzso cell pairs led to functional electrical zzso
