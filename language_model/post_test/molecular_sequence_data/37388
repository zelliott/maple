In searching the zzso zzso zzso we previously identified zzso a zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso for zzso zzso zzso but transcribed zzso to zzso is zzso which encodes a zzso zzso almost twice the length of zzso zzso alignment disclosed that zzso like zzso which is another zzso zzso could be envisioned as a zzso with two halves, with each half being zzso to zzso zzso as a member of the zzso family zzso disclosed conservation of basic zzso within the zzso motif and within the beta hairpin loop, two putative DNA binding zzso within this protein zzso The zzso of zzso is increased in a zzso zzso zzso shift and zzso fusion studies revealed that zzso can bind to the zzso promoter region, probably acting as a zzso for zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso of zzso is decreased in a zzso zzso As zzso expression is zzso in a zzso zzso we zzso that zzso may down regulate zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso a positive zzso of zzso zzso We propose that, in addition to the zzso sensing effect of the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso may represent a secondary amplification loop zzso the expression of zzso zzso those found in zzso might repress zzso leading to increased expression of zzso zzso zzso expression would result in additional amplification of the original zzso zzso
