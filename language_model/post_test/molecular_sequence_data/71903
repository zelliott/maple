zzso and zzso have been zzso in zzso cells and two major zzso isolated under native conditions: a zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a core protein form zzso devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hocking, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CD zzso of zzso and zzso zzso indicates that, although they are predominantly zzso zzso has a significantly higher content of zzso zzso zzso zzso and core protein are very similar, whereas the zzso core protein exhibits closer similarity to the zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso removal of the zzso zzso chains from zzso zzso does not induce a shift to the core protein structure, suggesting that the final form is influenced by zzso addition only during zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso demonstrated that the single zzso zzso which is at a zzso position at the zzso domain of both zzso and zzso is found in similar zzso This indicates that in this specific domain the different zzso do exhibit apparent conservation of zzso Exposure of zzso and zzso to 10 M zzso resulted in an increase in fluorescent intensity, which indicates that the zzso from zzso in the native state is zzso zzso of zzso protein unfolding zzso provide further evidence that zzso and zzso assume different structures in zzso zzso zzso and core protein unfold in a manner similar to a classic two-state model, in which there is a steep transition to an unfolded state between 1 and 2 M zzso The zzso core protein also shows a similar steep zzso However, zzso zzso shows a broad unfolding transition between 1 and 6 M zzso probably indicating the presence of stable unfolding zzso
