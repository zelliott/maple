Recent studies have shown that the zzso with the examples of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprise a series of pathways found also in the immune system of zzso such as zzso but are absent in zzso with insects or zzso as zzso One zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we show that crude extracts from tissue of zzso zzso collected from the sea display a considerable amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is converted to the zzso product, while tissue from specimens which were kept for 6 months in an aquarium shows only zzso of zzso As aquarium animals show a lower bacterial load, those specimens were treated for the experiments with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso they responded to zzso with a stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso To monitor if this effect can be obtained also on the in zzso level, zzso which comprise zzso and zzso cells, were incubated with zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso also convert zzso to the zzso products zzso by the zzso In parallel to this effect on protein level, zzso causes after an incubation period of 12 h also an increase in the zzso level of the transcripts zzso the putative zzso zzso It is zzso that in sponges the zzso zzso is involved in zzso defense of the zzso
