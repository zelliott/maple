zzso binding of Y zzso zzso to intact zzso cells, and to zzso cell or rat brain zzso is much greater for human zzso Y zzso compared to zzso zzso Y zzso and especially relative to human pancreatic zzso zzso This binding of zzso is reduced by zzso zzso in preference to zzso zzso zzso while the much lower zzso binding of zzso is more sensitive to zzso The difference could mainly be due to the zzso stretch in zzso Y zzso zzso zzso in zzso clipped zzso located in the sector that contains all zzso zzso of zzso Y zzso zzso pairs containing zzso in the zzso zone could be principally responsible for zzso attachments, but may also aid the zzso site zzso Two such pairs are found in zzso one in zzso and none in zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso at position 13 in zzso zzso and zzso molecules could lower zzso plasticity and the zzso binding via zzso hydrogen zzso The acidity of this tract could also be important in zzso selectivity of the Y zzso zzso The differences point to an evolutionary reduction of zzso protein binding from zzso to zzso and should also be important for Y zzso selectivity within zzso zzso group, and correlate with partial zzso and zzso group zzso with other zzso
