Fish have a complex innate defense mechanism against microbial zzso In particular, zzso zzso and serum in fish play important roles in innate immunity and contain a variety of zzso substances such as zzso zzso and zzso involved in host zzso Recently, zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso activity were isolated from the skin and/or zzso zzso zzso of zzso great zzso and flounder, and were identified to be a novel type of zzso protein in the zzso of zzso In the present study, we found zzso activity in the serum of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was isolated from the serum by sequential column zzso of zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso and zzso The zzso (a molecular mass of 160 zzso comprised zzso with a molecular mass of 53 zzso and showed strict zzso zzso catalyzing only zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The serum zzso exhibited a broad zzso activity against Gram positive and negative bacteria, most zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a minimum zzso concentration of zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso in the serum of fish and its involvement in innate immunity in the zzso zzso
