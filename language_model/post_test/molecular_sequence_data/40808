zzso are important pathogens on a variety of woody zzso including zzso a major crop in zzso Almond is susceptible to zzso zzso that forms band zzso on almond zzso and the same fungus was also isolated from zzso of the zzso To study the diversity and host range of zzso zzso and allied species from almond we used 132 zzso from 36 plant hosts from five continents, including 45 strains from almond in zzso Species were identified by comparison to 13 zzso strains with zzso analyses based on six zzso including the internal transcribed zzso zzso regions of the nuclear zzso zzso gene repeat and portions of the coding genes zzso factor zzso zzso zzso heat shock zzso zzso and zzso Seven species were found from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified from band zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from canopy zzso All were capable of inducing zzso on zzso almond branches in the zzso All species found on almond also occurred on other zzso suggesting that infected vegetation adjacent to almond zzso could serve as source of zzso of virulent almond zzso Of the 19 zzso groups obtained at the species level, 13 contained zzso zzso five were zzso similar to established species and one was zzso distinct from its closest relatives, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as from the more than 190 described species of zzso and zzso and thus was described as the new species, zzso zzso Evidence for cryptic zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprised lineages that formed the zzso distinct zzso zzso not found in any other zzso recognized as zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso isolate from California was zzso divergent and had zzso that differed zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was diverse but lacked any zzso features zzso with molecular zzso zzso analyses of combinations of zzso showed that pooled analyses of all six zzso resulted in the highest number of supported zzso suggesting that addition of more data might yet improve zzso zzso
