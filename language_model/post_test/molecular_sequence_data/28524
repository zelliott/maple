The protein zzso zzso is an important signaling zzso zzso zzso is initiated by an interaction with zzso zzso and zzso functions in signal transmission by zzso and zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso named zzso We identified 13 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene by screening for zzso with abnormal zzso formation or zzso zzso zzso zzso and strong zzso or zzso zzso were zzso The zzso caused by the most severe zzso demonstrates that zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso and the induction of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso is similar to the zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso function in a predominantly linear signaling zzso The zzso zzso include three zzso zzso that affect the zzso domain, three zzso zzso that affect the protein zzso domain, two zzso zzso that affect the zzso zzso binding domain, three nonsense zzso and one small zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso indicates that Ras zzso zzso and protein zzso activity are necessary for full zzso function and suggests that a zzso protein positively regulates zzso signaling during zzso zzso zzso
