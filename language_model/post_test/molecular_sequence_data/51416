zzso In many species, both zzso and zzso zzso receptors appear to be important in zzso the contraction of airway smooth zzso We have examined the distribution and characterization of receptors for zzso in rabbit airways using functional length tension studies, zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso were zzso in four different areas of the respiratory zzso and three progressively more zzso areas of the right zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced similar contraction in all four zzso zzso P zzso and the zzso zzso zzso exhibited a marked zzso in the magnitude of contraction, producing minimal contraction in the trachea and more zzso zzso with zzso becoming progressively larger in the more zzso zzso zzso (which is selective for the zzso zzso produced negligible contraction in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was a weak zzso of zzso and zzso zzso At a concentration of 2 zzso it produced a small but significant shift in the response curve to zzso and a greater shift (8 zzso in the curve to zzso zzso but it had no effect on responses to zzso The non zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also unexpectedly weak in this zzso The zzso value for zzso was decreased 27 fold by zzso at a concentration of 1 zzso without zzso in the maximum zzso zzso binding sites to zzso were sparse over smooth muscle in zzso airway preparations and markedly increased in density in the more zzso zzso There was negligible binding over vascular smooth muscle and zzso zzso binding studies revealed binding to zzso which was zzso zzso The order of potency for zzso of zzso binding was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso (the zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso This profile indicates binding predominantly to zzso zzso These results suggest that there are at least two types of zzso receptors in rabbit zzso a population of zzso zzso the density of which is greatest in the periphery and, in addition, zzso receptors which are zzso distributed throughout the zzso These receptors have unusual characteristics in that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively exhibited only weak zzso
