In high enough zzso such as produced by zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso nitrogen species zzso can kill zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso in zzso and humans with tuberculosis express zzso and mice need zzso to avoid zzso rapidly to zzso However, zzso own ability to produce zzso is rarely considered, perhaps because nitrate reduction to zzso is only prominent in zzso zzso cultures at oxygen tensions zzso Here we found that cultures of zzso human zzso cultured at zzso oxygen tensions produced copious zzso Surprisingly, the zzso arose from the zzso not the zzso zzso responded to zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso through reduced zzso and altering the expression of 120 genes associated with adaptation to acid, zzso zzso oxide, zzso stress, and iron zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was distinct from that of zzso zzso Thus, whether or not zzso is zzso the host expresses zzso or zzso zzso the action of zzso zzso in zzso is likely to encounter zzso by producing zzso zzso zzso may slow zzso growth and prepare it to resist host stresses while the pathogen waits for zzso to promote its zzso
