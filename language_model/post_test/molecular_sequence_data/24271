zzso of the zzso zzso are involved in a variety of cellular processes from locomotion of cells to zzso zzso of the cell zzso One important question is how local interactions of cells with the zzso space are translated into zzso of their membrane zzso To address this problem, we studied zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind the zzso zzso of protein zzso a class of proteins that promote formation of zzso zzso In zzso zzso also interacts via its zzso domain with the zzso C zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso binds a zzso zzso of protein zzso and zzso local assembly of zzso zzso These interactions can be zzso on the zzso tail of zzso Furthermore, zzso can be recovered with zzso filaments prepared from rat brain zzso and zzso are recruited together with zzso and protein zzso into these zzso zzso Thus, analogous to the zzso protein zzso and zzso C at the zzso zzso a similar complex zzso zzso and zzso exists in zzso Our data suggest that zzso junctions formed by zzso such as junctions initiated by zzso with zzso are at least partially coupled to the zzso zzso via an interaction with zzso and protein zzso
