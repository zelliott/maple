zzso and zzso zzso immune responses have been reported to exhibit an age related zzso However, differences in primary and memory responses at zzso sites in aged mice have been zzso In an effort to begin characterizing deficiencies in the zzso system of aged mice, we examined the B cell compartment of gut associated zzso patch zzso zzso To our surprise, we found that zzso center zzso B cells from aged zzso mice zzso zzso were present at similar zzso and exhibited a normal zzso zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as that observed in younger mice zzso zzso As expected, zzso patch zzso B cells from aged mice expressing zzso genes displayed higher zzso zzso zzso compared with younger zzso However, this was particularly striking in zzso sequences where high zzso loads suggested we were sampling memory zzso It is conceivable that zzso expressing these genes reflect the presence of a zzso memory compartment in aged mice that either retains flexibility in zzso function or is committed to the zzso of zzso zzso
