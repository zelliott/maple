zzso zzso is one of well-known toxic heavy metal zzso To gain a global understanding how zzso affects cells at the molecular level, we systematically studied the cellular response of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso using our integrated zzso strategy of zzso zzso mass tagging zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso Our zzso investigation unequivocally identified 1133 zzso zzso zzso Of which, the zzso quantitative analysis revealed 106 zzso and 55 zzso proteins on the zzso zzso The most prevalent functional class in the zzso zzso approximately zzso of our profile, was the proteins involved in protein zzso showing a zzso zzso expression pattern characteristic with rapid initial induction and later zzso Most significantly, 27 proteins functionally classified as cell rescue and defense were zzso for oxygen and radical detoxification, heat shock response, and other stress zzso Furthermore, the large precursor sequence coverage of our zzso approach allowed us to unequivocally identify and zzso different zzso for zzso zzso which have close similarity in their zzso acid zzso Our quantitative zzso also showed that zzso of the zzso proteins found in the zzso zzso response were different from those in the zzso zzso zzso The function of some of the key identifications was validated through zzso zzso It is very interesting that the induction of zzso zzso expression was not observed in our study, although it has been proven as a critical zzso to supply free zzso for the enhancing synthesis of zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso in plants and some zzso Our quantitative zzso result instead suggested that, as an alternative mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced significantly higher level of zzso zzso to zzso cellular zzso as a form of zzso zzso capped with zzso and/or zzso
