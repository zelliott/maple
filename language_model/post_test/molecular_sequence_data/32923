zzso is a large and versatile zzso zzso and member of the zzso protein zzso zzso share a zzso region called the zzso domain located near their N zzso We have determined the crystal structure of an zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso A zzso This region is adjacent to the zzso domain and is required for efficient binding to the zzso zzso in zzso The structure is formed by two zzso repeats connected by an zzso that spans these two zzso While the first repeat is very similar to other known structures, the second repeat is structurally different with a zzso core, zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso domain revealed the presence of up to nine consecutive zzso repeats organized in an array of tandem zzso and a zzso 3 domain inserted in the central zzso zzso The structure of the zzso domain is reminiscent of the modular organization of members of the zzso zzso The architecture of the zzso domain suggests that it forms an zzso and flexible structure, and provides a novel molecular explanation for the contribution of zzso and other zzso to the elasticity and stability of zzso subjected to mechanical stress, such as the skin and zzso zzso
