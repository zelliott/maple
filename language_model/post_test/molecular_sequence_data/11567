The zzso technique has potential for use in detection of low zzso of airborne zzso In this study, the sensitivity of zzso and its zzso to environmental interference were assessed with zzso coli zzso as the target zzso Air samples, containing environmental zzso were collected with zzso samplers and seeded with zzso coli zzso zzso Parallel studies were performed with cells seeded into the zzso prior to collection of air samples to determine the effects of environmental zzso and sampling stress on the zzso zzso zzso studies were also performed without environmental challenge or sampling stress to compare two protocols for cell zzso solid phase and zzso zzso of a zzso target sequence resulted in a detection limit of a single bacterial cell by the zzso and zzso methods within 5 and 9 zzso zzso With a zzso target, the sensitivity of the zzso method was zzso lower than that of zzso zzso which contained zzso to zzso zzso of environmental organisms per zzso inhibited zzso however, a zzso dilution of these samples resulted in successful zzso No difference in sensitivity of the zzso zzso was obtained as a result of sampling stress, although a zzso decrease in zzso was zzso A field validation of the protocol with zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of airborne zzso coli and/or zzso zzso in outdoor zzso This study indicates that the zzso method for detection of airborne zzso is rapid and sensitive and can be used as an alternative method for air quality zzso
