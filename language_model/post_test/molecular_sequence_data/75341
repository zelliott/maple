A zzso clone zzso a portion of zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso has been identified by screening a zzso zzso expression library using zzso zzso zzso zzso Two different zzso regulated zzso species were identified by Northern zzso analysis using the initial zzso as a probe, and full-length zzso zzso apparently corresponding to each message, have been zzso In zzso zzso of both full-length zzso clones in a zzso zzso zzso followed by in zzso translation in wheat germ zzso suggests that both clones zzso zzso zzso the zzso precursor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence analyses confirm the impression that both zzso clones code for the identical zzso which is highly zzso with human zzso A and C as well as with zzso intermediate filament zzso The two clones differ in their zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso clones to zzso zzso zzso shows only a single locus of zzso at or near position zzso on the left arm of zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses of zzso DNA are consistent with the notion that a single or only a few highly similar genes zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso exist in the zzso
