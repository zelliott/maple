The zzso most gene of the zzso coronavirus zzso gene 1, is presumed to zzso the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso clones representing this gene zzso more than 22 zzso suggesting that this region may zzso zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the zzso portion of this gene product is zzso into a protein of 28 zzso zzso To identify possible functional zzso of gene 1 and further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso clones representing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coronavirus mouse zzso virus strain zzso were zzso into zzso zzso from which zzso were transcribed and translated in zzso Although zzso is zzso from the first 1 zzso at the zzso of the zzso translation of in zzso transcribed zzso indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire zzso zzso region was zzso This result suggests that the region close to zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso and may contain an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso indicating that this zzso probably in conjunction with a downstream domain, plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso This zzso zzso may be part of a zzso zzso zzso by gene zzso
