The zzso motif zzso zzso is known to bind to zzso N zzso We have constructed five zzso zzso bearing zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso fiber zzso We compared the targeting properties of the zzso zzso within different zzso acid environments and showed that their cellular zzso were not zzso zzso containing zzso within potentially zzso sequences flanked by zzso zzso viruses mainly to zzso while zzso containing zzso within linear sequences not containing zzso zzso zzso mainly to zzso zzso albeit with a lower zzso Finally, we show evidence that zzso bond formation within an Ad bearing the zzso sequence is essential for zzso to zzso suggesting that this sequence does indeed assume a zzso structure which zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso our study underscores the importance of zzso zzso zzso targeting peptides for not only affinity but also specificity of the zzso zzso
