We have isolated zzso zzso zzso that enter zzso when DNA replication is blocked with zzso The zzso define eight linkage groups, three of which consist of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, these zzso zzso genes have been shown to be required for zzso cell cycle arrest, as is the budding zzso zzso zzso The other five genes are called zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that these genes participate in an zzso signal zzso zzso that monitors the completion of DNA replication and zzso information to the zzso control protein zzso zzso that bypass the requirement for zzso (an zzso of the zzso regulator zzso also zzso zzso from DNA zzso However, zzso is blocked by zzso of DNA replication in strains in which the zzso gene has been deleted, indicating that although zzso influences the zzso of zzso to the completion of DNA zzso it is not essential for this zzso
