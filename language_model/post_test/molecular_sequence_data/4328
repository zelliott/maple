The optimal conditions capable of inducing an increase in zzso zzso during development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined in this zzso These conditions depend on temperature, heat shock duration and recovery zzso In zzso a heat shock response was repeatedly obtained at 37 degrees C for 15 zzso followed by 1 h zzso These results provided evidence for heat shock response at every stage zzso An increase in zzso synthesis was noted throughout zzso but it did not lead to an increase in the amount of soluble zzso except for stage VI zzso Such results suggest that from stage II to stage IV zzso an equilibrium occurs between the zzso used and the zzso zzso In contrast, in stage VI zzso heat shock led to overproduction of zzso During early development, the heat shock response was repeatedly obtained only from the zzso stage with a 37 degrees C shock and a 15 zzso duration of zzso Surprisingly, during zzso stage, the soluble zzso total amount increased after heat shock at a time when no zzso zzso zzso
