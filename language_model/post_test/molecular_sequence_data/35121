The B zzso zzso factor zzso is required for affinity maturation of B zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of zzso is required for stringent elimination of zzso cells that failed to zzso rearrange zzso zzso gene zzso After productive zzso gene zzso zzso cell zzso signaling ends zzso negative selection through B cell zzso 6 zzso repression of zzso In patients with zzso acute zzso zzso the zzso checkpoint control is compromised by zzso rare zzso zzso and loss of its upstream zzso zzso Low levels of zzso expression in these patients represent a strong independent predictor of poor clinical zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso cells resist zzso transformation by zzso through zzso zzso of zzso and do not initiate fatal leukemia in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing and gene expression analyses carried out by us revealed that zzso competes with zzso for promoter binding and reverses zzso repression of zzso and other cell cycle zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as a crucial zzso of negative selection at the zzso cell zzso checkpoint and a safeguard against zzso
