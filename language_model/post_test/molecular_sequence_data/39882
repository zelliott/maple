We report for the first time the chemical synthesis of zzso zzso domain of mouse zzso zzso and of two zzso bearing zzso on zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso The zzso undergo spontaneous and quantitative zzso in about 4 zzso yet with very different zzso zzso linkages have been assessed by zzso zzso and mass zzso analysis of resulting fragments, and the first experimental studies on structural organization have been conducted by circular zzso zzso under different pH zzso Upon zzso the zzso considerably change their zzso although they do not assume zzso structures, and become highly resistant to zzso zzso A comparative study of zzso binding shows that the zzso domain can bind zzso and confirms the importance of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso
