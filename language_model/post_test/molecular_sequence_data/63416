The zzso is required for the assembly of zzso zzso and plays a crucial role in their zzso zzso We zzso shortened the zzso and the zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and investigated the relevance of these segments in the assembly of the zzso and in the growth of the zzso We found that a deletion of 9 zzso at the zzso or 20 zzso at the zzso still allowed efficient import of the zzso into zzso however, the assembly of both zzso and zzso zzso was partially zzso zzso lacking 13 zzso zzso or 30 zzso zzso were not zzso zzso strains expressing either of the truncated zzso did not grow on zzso carbon sources, indicating that zzso parts of the zzso zzso accumulated and impaired essential zzso zzso
