Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a simple method to replace the cap structure of zzso zzso with zzso Gene zzso zzso whose cap structure was replaced by a synthetic zzso we constructed two types of zzso zzso One is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a high content of full-length zzso clones and the other is a zzso zzso zzso which has a high content of zzso clones with their zzso start zzso The zzso library was constructed especially for zzso the zzso start sites of long zzso In order to characterize these libraries, we performed zzso sequencing of randomly selected zzso clones from both libraries zzso clones for the full zzso zzso library and 159 clones for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso clones of the zzso chain zzso factor 1 alpha were most frequently zzso zzso isolated, and more than zzso of them zzso zzso contained the zzso start site of the zzso Furthermore, about zzso of the zzso clones of both libraries whose sequence matched with known genes had the known zzso ends or sequences upstream of the known zzso ends zzso out of 35 for the full zzso library and 51 out of 62 for the zzso zzso The longest full-length clone of the full zzso zzso library was about 3300 zzso (among 28 zzso In contrast, seven clones (out of the 51 clones with the zzso start zzso from the zzso zzso library came from zzso whose length is more than zzso zzso These zzso libraries may be useful for generating zzso zzso with the information of the zzso start sites that are now scarce in the zzso zzso
