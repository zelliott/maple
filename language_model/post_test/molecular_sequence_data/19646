zzso of short hairpin zzso via the use of zzso zzso systems has proven to be an effective mechanism for triggering zzso in zzso zzso The most popular promoters for this purpose are the zzso and zzso promoters since they are easily manipulated for expression of zzso with defined start and stop zzso zzso (the use of zzso against multiple zzso is one strategy that is being developed by a number of laboratories for the treatment of zzso infection since it increases the likelihood of suppressing the emergence of resistant virus in zzso In this context, the development of alternative small zzso promoters other than zzso and zzso would be zzso We describe zzso zzso expression zzso which produce zzso with comparable efficacy and strand selectivity to zzso zzso and show that their activity is consistent with processing by zzso 3' zzso In addition, our observations suggest general guidelines for expressing effective zzso with the potential for graded response, to minimize zzso associated with competition for components of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso
