The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso assembly of highly zzso zzso that contain multiple zzso sequences in the zzso region of the zzso In studies aimed at investigating the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a series of zzso region zzso and deletion plasmids were zzso These plasmids were zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the resulting expression products were analyzed for the ability to assemble into zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso region zzso and the full-length zzso was determined by zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells using complete or selective zzso zzso Our results are the first to zzso define the presence of six zzso zzso These results are consistent with the current model for the organization of the zzso in the zzso zzso and show that the zzso zzso are properly targeted and oriented in the zzso zzso zzso thus making them amenable zzso to study zzso zzso zzso zzso of soluble and membrane protein components revealed that the first two zzso regions were necessary for membrane targeting of the zzso zzso and zzso experiments show that assembly of the zzso zzso was an additive process as the number of zzso regions zzso zzso from cells zzso the full-length zzso and zzso zzso reveal that zzso expressing the first two or more zzso zzso were capable of zzso with the full-length zzso zzso of the fifth zzso segment significantly enhanced the degree of zzso Furthermore, a deletion construct containing only zzso regions 5 and 6 zzso to a similar extent as that of the wild type zzso zzso region deletion constructions that terminate with the zzso 145 zzso zzso acids were found to have enhanced assembly characteristics and zzso the zzso zzso as a zzso in zzso Our results reveal a process of zzso assembly involving several distinct yet additive components and define the fifth and sixth membrane spanning regions as the key zzso in zzso zzso
