zzso zzso zzso includes four zzso reactions in which successive zzso acid zzso are zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso By comparing the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins from various bacterial zzso four regions of zzso were zzso A profile search of zzso for related sequences revealed that these regional similarities were present in the zzso zzso These sequence zzso appear to track with zzso zzso both zzso families proceed through an ordered kinetic mechanism and form product via an zzso zzso zzso Two highly zzso zzso in region II were examined through zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso All zzso were highly zzso to activity with zzso specific activity reductions of zzso zzso the critical nature of these zzso DNA sequence analysis from three zzso coli zzso harboring the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of point zzso closely associated with the fourth of these aligned zzso The zzso zzso expressed and zzso as a zzso zzso fusion, was zzso less zzso active at 30 degrees C and was further reduced at the zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso Thus the zzso zzso zzso arises from a point zzso within a highly zzso region within this protein zzso These data argue that these proteins comprise a zzso of three zzso zzso zzso that share significant structural and zzso zzso
