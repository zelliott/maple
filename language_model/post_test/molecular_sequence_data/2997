Sonic zzso signaling plays a critical role in zzso zzso and signaling defects are associated with severe birth defects and cancer in zzso zzso encodes a critical zzso zzso in this zzso zzso is expressed in human zzso cell zzso and zzso Despite the significance of the zzso gene in human disease, few immediate upstream regulators of zzso expression are zzso We previously demonstrated that a zzso region, including zzso zzso zzso an untranslated zzso and 425 zzso of the first zzso regulates the human zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso box, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites identified three critical regulatory zzso including a zzso box that binds zzso and two zzso zzso that bind zzso proteins or zzso zzso of Twist but not a frame shift zzso of Twist activates the zzso human zzso regulatory sequences but not with zzso zzso of the zzso Twist activates zzso reporter expression through zzso zzso but requires binding of zzso proteins to zzso zzso Twist zzso cause human birth defects and Twist is zzso in many zzso suggesting that one of zzso primary roles is the regulation of zzso
