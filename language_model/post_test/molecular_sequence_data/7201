We have studied the zzso composition in an zzso zzso cell line originated from zzso of a mouse zzso cell line zzso with rat zzso root zzso zzso The total zzso zzso of zzso cells was estimated to be zzso zzso of protein and the total zzso zzso acid was zzso zzso of zzso The major neutral zzso were zzso zzso of the total neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major zzso were found to be zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with trace amounts of zzso The unusually high concentration of zzso zzso is consistent with its putative role as a tumor zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso zzso examined by mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, revealed that the cell bodies and processes were all positively zzso To zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso we zzso zzso cells with the zzso gene from influenza C zzso Compared with the original cell line, the zzso cells showed a dramatic increase in the level of zzso zzso of that in the control zzso and a significant decrease of the concentration of zzso zzso zzso of control zzso In addition, the zzso zzso cells exhibited a zzso different from the parental cells with enlarged cell bodies and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso particularly the expression of zzso and zzso zzso may be associated with the zzso changes observed in this cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
