zzso are zzso that degrade zzso an important component of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso are considered to be involved in many zzso processes like zzso tumor growth, and zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso zzso contribute to the spreading of zzso in zzso Such roles for zzso suggest that zzso could be useful pharmacological zzso zzso and selective zzso are not known to date, although zzso acid has been reported to be a weak inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso with zzso acid has been zzso suggesting that additional zzso interactions might increase zzso zzso Here we show that zzso acid zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of both zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso showed strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 4 zzso and weaker zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso values of 100 and 56 zzso zzso To date, zzso has proved to be one of the most potent zzso of zzso We also determined the zzso structure of the zzso complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional zzso interactions with zzso zzso and zzso in the active site led to increased zzso A zzso structural model of zzso was also generated to suggest binding modes of zzso to this zzso The long zzso chain seemed to interact with an extended, zzso channel formed by mostly zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
