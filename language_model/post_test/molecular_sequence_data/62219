In the coming decade, the ability to sense and detect the state of biological systems and living organisms zzso zzso and zzso will be radically transformed by developments in materials physics and zzso The emerging ability to control the patterns of matter on the zzso length scale can be expected to lead to entirely new types of biological zzso These new systems will be capable of sensing at the zzso level in living cells, and capable of parallel integration for detection of multiple signals, enabling a diversity of simultaneous experiments, as well as better zzso and zzso
