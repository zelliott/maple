The protein factor zzso is an essential component required for zzso zzso zzso identified in the zzso zzso large zzso zzso were used to engineer transgenic zzso carrying zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso tract zzso binding at elevated zzso zzso zzso profiling comparing zzso and zzso strains identified more than 400 genes zzso expressed in the zzso zzso flies grown at the restrictive zzso Surprisingly, almost zzso of the zzso genes lack zzso zzso analyses revealed that nuclear export of a large number of zzso zzso is impaired in zzso cells zzso knocked down for zzso zzso of nuclear zzso complexes showed that zzso associates with zzso zzso These results reveal an unexpected role for the zzso factor zzso in the nuclear export of zzso zzso
