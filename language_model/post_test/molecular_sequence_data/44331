The solution structure of zzso a specific zzso zzso has been determined using zzso zzso zzso by a flat core and a flexible zzso zzso the three-dimensional structure is formed by a central twisted zzso accompanied by two external segments linked by the zzso binding zzso A cluster of three zzso bridges connects the external segments to the central zzso and a single fourth zzso bridge links the binding loop to the central zzso The same spatial distribution of zzso bridges can be observed in both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso another zzso zzso The structural zzso between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso confirms the former as a second member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Based on the zzso between the two proteins and recent results obtained for zzso binding zzso of the bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso we define the segment 22 to 27 as the binding loop of zzso with the zzso zzso bond between zzso and zzso In our solution structures, this loop is extended and zzso and exhibits a large degree of zzso This mobility, already observed for the binding loop in other zzso zzso in solution, might be an important feature for the interaction with the corresponding zzso
