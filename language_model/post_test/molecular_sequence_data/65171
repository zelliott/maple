zzso D zzso zzso types 8, 19, and 37 zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso agents of epidemic zzso and zzso tract zzso Previous studies showed that zzso binds to a zzso membrane zzso expressed on human zzso zzso zzso To identify and characterize the role of the zzso zzso in zzso infection, we partially zzso this zzso from zzso Chang C zzso cell zzso by using lentil zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso mass zzso was subsequently used to identify four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso protein is identical to zzso (also known as membrane zzso zzso The zzso but not zzso fiber zzso bound to the zzso domain of zzso demonstrating a direct interaction of an zzso zzso protein with zzso An zzso specific for the zzso 19 zzso acids of zzso also blocked zzso infection of human cervical zzso and zzso cells, indicating a requirement for zzso in zzso Finally, expression of a zzso zzso of human zzso in a zzso cell line increased cell binding by zzso zzso and gene delivery by an Ad zzso zzso with the zzso zzso but not by a zzso bearing the zzso zzso Together, these studies demonstrate that zzso serves as an attachment zzso for zzso and shed further light on the cell entry zzso of zzso D zzso
