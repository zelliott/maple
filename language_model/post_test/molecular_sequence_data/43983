A systematic analysis of the zzso sequences and lengths of several zzso of zzso peptides and of a number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides was performed to determine the main features leading the zzso to zzso by the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that a minimum zzso length of six zzso acids is required and that among the zzso six to thirteen zzso acid zzso long, their zzso as zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso with similar zzso efficiency, zzso bonds having zzso or zzso zzso acids as well as zzso in the zzso position of zzso ranging from a minimum of six to a maximum of approximately thirteen zzso acid zzso An intriguing observation was the shift of the zzso site, at a zzso bond in zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso stands for zzso and zzso for zzso to zzso in zzso in which zzso was zzso for Val at its zzso Similarly, a zzso site displacement was also observed with the zzso of the internally zzso zzso zzso containing zzso at the zzso position, namely zzso and zzso are zzso at the zzso bond, but zzso and zzso are zzso at the zzso zzso
