The zzso of proteins into higher order structures is both central to normal biology and a dominant force in zzso Certain zzso zzso proteins in the budding zzso zzso zzso assemble into zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso that act as genetic elements in an entirely zzso system of zzso The nuclear pore complex zzso contains multiple zzso proteins whose zzso has also been proposed to zzso structural and functional properties of the zzso Here we show that an essential sequence feature of these zzso zzso zzso promotes their zzso into zzso with characteristics of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso can form bona fide zzso thus establishing a previously undiscovered ability of zzso zzso zzso to adopt this zzso state in zzso
