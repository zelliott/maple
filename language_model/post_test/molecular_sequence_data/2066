A new member of the zzso zzso of zzso receptors was isolated from human zzso zzso zzso to other zzso this zzso is a zzso comprised of structurally unrelated zzso both zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso were observed between these zzso and zzso alpha and beta chain zzso indicating that this zzso zzso is a novel zzso No obvious zzso zzso were detected with other zzso The beta chain of the zzso zzso displayed a zzso zzso significantly higher than other zzso beta zzso possibly due to a large zzso acid zzso zzso zzso are grouped into three families, based on which of three beta chains zzso 1, beta 2 and beta 3) they zzso zzso the zzso zzso may represent the zzso of a fourth zzso family, because it contains a structurally distinct beta zzso The designation alpha E beta 4 is proposed for this novel human zzso
