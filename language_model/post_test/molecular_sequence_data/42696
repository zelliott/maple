zzso chain reaction zzso was used to identify zzso zzso the zzso agent of epidemic zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was applied with buffer containing a relatively low zzso concentration zzso zzso with zzso at 250 zzso zzso A primer pair used to amplify a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on the basis of the DNA sequence of gene zzso coding for a precursor of the mature zzso of molecular weight zzso 14,000 and/or 16,000 zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso For determining the specificity of the primer pair, zzso zzso zzso of 16 zzso and 10 other bacterial strains were zzso
