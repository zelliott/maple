The I locus is a zzso zzso repeat cluster of zzso zzso genes zzso that mediates zzso zzso of zzso and zzso target zzso during seed development leading to yellow seed coats lacking zzso zzso Here, we report small zzso sequencing of ten stages of seed development from a few days post zzso through maturity, revealing the amplification from primary to secondary short interfering zzso zzso occurring during zzso The young seed populations had a higher proportion of zzso representing the zzso gene family members, consistent with this region as the origin of the primary zzso More zzso the very young seed had a higher proportion of zzso zzso zzso than did the zzso zzso We zzso that the primary zzso zzso increase during development to levels sufficient to trigger amplification of secondary zzso zzso from the zzso target zzso enabling the total levels of zzso zzso zzso to rise zzso Further, we demonstrate that the soybean system exhibits zzso zzso zzso production because primary zzso zzso levels are not sufficient to trigger secondary amplification in zzso other than the seed zzso
