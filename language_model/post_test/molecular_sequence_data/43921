The major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso supposed to be one of the structures responsible for zzso to zzso 407 cells, was isolated from the crude outer membrane preparation by treatment with zzso followed by zzso zzso gel zzso By zzso of the isolated protein with zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides were generated, separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid zzso and zzso by automatic zzso zzso The protein was aligned by identification of overlapping zzso Treatment of bacteria with zzso K prior to preparation of the outer membrane yielded a truncated zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 25 zzso consisting of the zzso part of the zzso The isolated zzso was functionally characterized by significant binding activity towards zzso 407 cell zzso when isolated by zzso native gel zzso however, no binding activity was detected when the protein was isolated in the presence of zzso
