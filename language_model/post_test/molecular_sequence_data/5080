The zzso zzso gene product zzso is a highly zzso protein organized in three distinct zzso The roles of these zzso in zzso zzso were zzso By indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso sometimes zzso zzso structures that might include the zzso Its zzso and zzso zzso are zzso They each start with a short basic stretch containing a nuclear zzso zzso followed by a long zzso stretch with zzso zzso such zzso stretches are thought to mediate binding to zzso proteins in the zzso Either domain is sufficient to determine nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso zzso domain shows significant zzso to the zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso zzso of 140 zzso The zzso domain alone, or fused to a reporter zzso displays a zzso zzso outside the zzso zzso and zzso share a highly zzso zzso motif within their similar zzso zzso Inside or outside the nucleus, this motif is important to prevent zzso diffusion or zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso structure is zzso and might result from zzso zzso zzso genetically interacts with four zzso affected in stable zzso synthesis and one zzso blocked in protein zzso to the zzso zzso Growth zzso but no zzso or zzso zzso zzso were observed upon zzso zzso or strong zzso Together, these data point to a zzso zzso role of zzso in zzso assembly or zzso
