zzso of specific cellular proteins is a powerful tool in biological research and has many medical and agricultural zzso In contrast to genetic methods currently available to zzso protein levels, we describe an alternative approach that zzso the zzso zzso zzso to facilitate specific zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso requires the prior attachment of multiple zzso to the target zzso This attachment is accomplished, in part, by a family of zzso designated zzso (or zzso zzso some of which use zzso near their C zzso for target zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso target recognition can be zzso by engineering zzso to contain appropriate zzso peptides fused to their C zzso In five dissimilar examples, zzso zzso were created that recognized and zzso their respective binding partners with high zzso We also show that zzso of one protein targeted by this method led to its zzso degradation in zzso Thus, by exploiting interacting zzso derived from natural and synthetic zzso it may be possible to design zzso capable of directing the selective removal of many zzso zzso
