The zzso for the zzso D3 zzso has been isolated by screening a rat kidney zzso zzso expression library with a mixture of three previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso produced from this zzso zzso with each of the three zzso zzso but does not react with an zzso specific for the zzso zzso or an irrelevant zzso In addition, the expressed protein specifically binds zzso D3 but does not bind zzso zzso testosterone, zzso or zzso The zzso sequence for this zzso has been determined and used to deduce the zzso acid sequence of the zzso This zzso acid sequence contains a region that matches perfectly the partial zzso acid sequence determined for the zzso isolated from zzso zzso This zzso acid sequence also closely matches the reported zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso finger of the avian zzso D3 zzso
