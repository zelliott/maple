zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library derived from zzso kidney zzso The clones were identified by zzso with a synthetic zzso probe based on partial zzso zzso or with a DNA probe zzso human zzso zzso Several zzso clones isolated from the library had a length of about zzso zzso They contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence contains the known zzso zzso in addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso composition of the predicted zzso match those of zzso zzso zzso Data base searches did not reveal significant sequence zzso of zzso I with other well-known zzso
