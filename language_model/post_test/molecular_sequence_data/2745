The zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the normal zzso zzso by a single zzso acid substitution zzso To evaluate the molecular zzso responsible for the reduced serum levels of alpha zzso associated with the zzso zzso alpha zzso gene expression was examined in blood zzso cells which normally produce alpha zzso as well as zzso zzso modified by zzso gene transfer to express the zzso and normal zzso human alpha zzso zzso Northern analysis and zzso protection analysis demonstrated that zzso of M and S zzso both express zzso alpha zzso zzso transcripts in comparable levels and similar in zzso zzso labeling studies demonstrated that both M and S zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso but the S zzso zzso significantly zzso The cellular zzso of both M and S zzso contained a newly zzso zzso precursor form of alpha zzso but the S zzso contained reduced zzso zzso labeling in the presence of zzso an inhibitor of core zzso addition, demonstrated that S zzso exhibited a selective zzso of zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso not observed in M zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso modified by zzso gene transfer to contain an integrated human zzso alpha zzso zzso demonstrated reduced zzso of alpha zzso compared with zzso containing an integrated human zzso alpha zzso zzso and also reproduced the zzso of alpha zzso zzso observed with zzso zzso Furthermore, in the presence of zzso an inhibitor of cellular zzso the zzso modified zzso demonstrated a selective zzso of human alpha zzso zzso not observed for the zzso Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that the single zzso zzso of the zzso alpha zzso gene results in reduced cellular zzso of alpha zzso because the newly zzso zzso alpha zzso protein is zzso zzso prior to zzso
