We screened and identified zzso bacterial strains from the Arctic, the results would help find zzso zzso 

In total 68 zzso strains were screened from the Arctic using the zzso plate under low zzso All strains were classified using the zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso and traditional zzso zzso One strain was chosen to be the representative strain from each group respectively and identified using zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso database Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso features zzso The zzso properties of the representative strains were zzso 

The 68 strains belonged to 3 groups zzso zzso and zzso and strains 6, 11 and 52 were the representative strains zzso The results of the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that: zzso 11 was most closely related to zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso strain 52 was most closely related to zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso strain 6 was most closely related to zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso which might represent a novel species of the zzso The zzso study showed that: strains 6, 11 and 52 were Gram negative, straight zzso did not produce zzso zzso and zzso possessed strong zzso zzso The optimal temperature and pH for the zzso activity were 55 degrees C and zzso for the zzso from strain 6, 40 degrees C and zzso for the zzso from strain 11 and 65 degrees C and zzso for the zzso from strain zzso 

The research zzso introduced the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso in the Arctic marine water, extended the diversity of the zzso bacteria from the Arctic, and provided a useful basis for further study of zzso zzso
