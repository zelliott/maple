Several strains of zzso and zzso are known for their ability to zzso large amounts of zzso zzso especially zzso We focused on the mechanism of zzso zzso triggered by a zzso namely zzso zzso zzso A zzso strain, zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates the sensitivity to zzso A zzso zzso gene that zzso the sensitivity of zzso to the zzso was derived from a gene library of zzso zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso was cloned and zzso An open reading frame was found that coded for the zzso gene of the sensitivity to zzso of zzso and was designated zzso The expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso was confirmed by using zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein indicated significant zzso with some zzso zzso such as the beta chain of zzso zzso from rat zzso and human zzso or a zzso chain of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso
