zzso zzso zzso regulates body water balance by controlling water zzso of the zzso collecting zzso The control mechanisms may involve zzso in the number or unit zzso of water channels in the zzso plasma membrane of zzso zzso How this occurs is unknown, but indirect evidence exists for the zzso hypothesis, which states that zzso causes zzso zzso of water zzso zzso from the zzso zzso To test key aspects of the shuttle hypothesis, we have prepared zzso zzso against the recently cloned zzso water channel protein and used the zzso in zzso studies zzso and electron microscopic zzso in thin and zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso was seen exclusively in zzso principal cells and inner zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane labeling was zzso There was heavy labeling of abundant small zzso zzso and of membrane structures within zzso zzso In addition, labeling of zzso plasma zzso in inner zzso collecting ducts was zzso zzso rats of water for 24 or 48 zzso markedly increased zzso zzso protein expression determined by zzso and zzso These results are compatible with at least two complementary modes of zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso control of channel distribution between the zzso membrane and a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation of the absolute level of expression of zzso zzso
