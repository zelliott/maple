The zzso zzso origin is a zzso region which is specifically recognized by the zzso zzso protein to initiate DNA zzso We analyzed the structural and functional organization of the zzso origin by using various derivatives carrying deletions and zzso zzso The origin may be divided into three zzso zzso I, which is important for stable binding of the zzso zzso zzso II, which is important for binding of the zzso protein and for initiation of DNA zzso and zzso III, which is important for DNA replication but apparently not for binding of the zzso zzso The zzso protein might recognize three specific DNA elements in zzso I and zzso The relative transformation frequency of the autonomously replicating plasmids carrying deletions in zzso I is lower, and nevertheless the copy numbers of these plasmids in host bacteria are higher than those of the zzso zzso zzso and stable binding of the zzso protein to the origin might be important for the replication efficiency to be at the normal zzso zzso zzso II might be essential for interaction with the zzso domain of the zzso protein for primer zzso zzso The zzso sequence across the border of zzso II and III, including the primer zzso is zzso in the zzso origins of many zzso the putative zzso proteins of which are related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso III might be required for a step that is necessary after zzso protein binding has taken zzso
