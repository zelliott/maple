The zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso lie in the zzso bottom of the zzso zzso localized in four clusters within each zzso The zzso clusters within the zzso are aligned to form a ring that has inlet and outlet zzso The inlet is occupied by a novel zzso zzso and there are two possible outlet sites per zzso formed by paired zzso lying within a cavity or zzso on the protein zzso The structure suggests pathways by which electron transfer may occur through the precisely arranged zzso and provides a framework for the interpretation of previous and future zzso and genetic zzso
