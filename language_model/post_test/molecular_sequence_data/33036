zzso zzso 4 zzso is an essential zzso zzso having multiple zzso A long form zzso protein and a short form zzso zzso which are distinguishable by the presence or lack of a zzso signal zzso at the N zzso are generated from the zzso zzso In this study, we generated transgenic mice using zzso zzso genes zzso either the long form zzso zzso zzso or the short form zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that transgenic mice with the zzso gene had increased zzso protein in all zzso and were protected against zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso gene was able to rescue the lethal zzso of the mouse zzso zzso In contrast, transgenic mice with the zzso gene had increased zzso protein only in the zzso and the zzso gene failed to rescue the lethal zzso of the mouse zzso zzso In zzso mice rescued by the zzso zzso the zzso protein was present in zzso isolated from zzso zzso and the zzso distribution pattern of the zzso protein in these mice was identical to that in zzso zzso Interestingly, the male zzso mice rescued by the zzso gene were zzso and exhibited zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the short form zzso protein is present in zzso tissue zzso and is essential for survival and protection against zzso in mice, whereas the long form zzso protein is important for male zzso
