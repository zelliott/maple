Due to the enormous zzso diversity of the zzso zzso it has been difficult to design an zzso molecular typing method for the zzso at this zzso Here we describe a technique for the direct sequencing of zzso zzso Initially, zzso zzso were zzso after zzso reverse zzso of zzso zzso were then separated using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso which separates DNA fragments based on their sequence zzso zzso products were excised from the gel and zzso DNA was zzso and directly zzso The derived sequences were aligned to a database of published zzso zzso and an initial zzso assignment was zzso This approach was theoretically sufficient to type 92 of the 118 known zzso zzso The majority of the remaining 26 zzso contain differences at the beginning of zzso 2, a region outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso sequencing of this region to identify 19 of these 26 zzso raising the resolution power to 111 zzso Using this technique, we analyzed immortalized cell lines and blood samples from several different zzso Nine immortalized cell lines were obtained from the 10th International zzso Workshop zzso and nine were derived from zzso zzso Additionally, 25 blood samples were acquired from a panel of donors previously shown to be difficult to type using zzso zzso Altogether, using this new method of zzso separation by zzso followed by direct sequencing, we typed 52 different zzso from 57 individuals, covering 40 zzso zzso
