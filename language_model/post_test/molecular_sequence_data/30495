Using analysis of zzso zzso cell hybrids as well as in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to normal human zzso zzso we have localized the human zzso gene to zzso 9, bands zzso We also put forward the hypothesis that there has been a recent zzso of a small segment of the human zzso zzso We support this hypothesis by comparison of zzso usage in this segment of the gene to zzso usage in the remainder of the zzso This hypothesis is also supported by comparison of the sequence of human zzso to that of the chicken zzso In addition, the latter comparison shows that the zzso most likely occurred after the divergence of zzso and avian zzso
