The interactions of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso have been investigated by zzso zzso and computer zzso At least 10 zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso are required for the binding of many zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is likely to be bound near zzso zzso likely to be involved in the subsequent zzso zzso include zzso and zzso The binding site for zzso zzso can be defined by at least five zzso in zzso zzso zzso and primary contacts between key zzso and zzso zzso have been assigned based on zzso and its zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso intact and truncated zzso and various zzso suggest that the zzso and zzso binding sites overlap zzso even though zzso and zzso do not interact with the same set of zzso on the zzso zzso the zzso binding site not only allows us to better understand the zzso interaction and antagonism but also leads to a refined three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso
