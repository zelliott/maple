zzso zzso zzso is the most prevalent zzso form of zzso It is a zzso inherited disorder, characterized by zzso zzso zzso abnormal vitamin D and zzso zzso and defective bone zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso gene with zzso to zzso on the X zzso have been found to be associated with zzso 

We report about a 54-year-old male patient who exhibited the typical features of zzso and in whom zzso analysis using zzso and sequencing was zzso Additionally, extensive laboratory and zzso investigations were carried zzso 

A zzso deletion in zzso 2 of the zzso gene was detected zzso which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported zzso This deletion results in a premature stop zzso zzso suggesting a zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, elevated zzso and zzso levels as well as an increased zzso bone mineral density score were zzso 

We present a male patient with zzso who harbors a novel zzso in the zzso zzso which might be the cause for his zzso Our data support previous findings and therefore contribute to the zzso of the zzso pathways of zzso
