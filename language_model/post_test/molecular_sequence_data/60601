zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two highly zzso zzso toxins found in zzso zzso The former is a zzso zzso with four zzso acid zzso zzso (at positions 3, 4, 10 and zzso while the latter is a zzso zzso with five zzso acid zzso (at positions 3, 4, 7, 10 and zzso Despite the apparent similarity in number and relative positions of the zzso acid zzso zzso studies indicated a distinct metal binding behavior for zzso and zzso There appears to be four binding sites in zzso in contrast to one metal binding site in zzso To zzso the mode of calcium binding by the zzso acid zzso in these zzso we designed various analogous peptides with their zzso acid replaced by other zzso acid zzso zzso experiments on zzso zzso reveal that the major difference in the number of metal binding sites between zzso and zzso is due to the zzso at position zzso We also performed molecular simulations to calculate the relative binding free energies of several potential binding zzso Based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose a zzso binding model for zzso and a zzso binding model for zzso
