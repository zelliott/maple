zzso are small zzso viruses that are frequently associated with zzso in humans and zzso Despite much work on the genetic analysis of zzso zzso little progress has been made in the characterization of the proteins zzso mature zzso We have analyzed the zzso protein composition of the reference strains and several wild zzso of human zzso using high-resolution zzso zzso zzso For reference strains of the seven zzso zzso a consistent pattern of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso generally zzso The strains could be divided into two groups, based upon the zzso of these proteins in immune zzso zzso that used zzso rabbit zzso One group included reference types 1 4 for which all three proteins were zzso by zzso rabbit zzso for the other group, types 5 7, only proteins zzso and zzso were zzso When wild zzso from around the world were compared to the reference zzso a correlation between genetic type and the pattern of protein sizes and immune zzso was observed for strains of the common types zzso zzso of types 2 and 4 consistently exhibited zzso proteins larger than those of types 1 and zzso zzso patterns of proteins or immune zzso were detected in strains of types zzso indicating that there may be incomplete processing of the zzso precursor during growth in cell zzso
