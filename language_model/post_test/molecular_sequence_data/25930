The zzso important surface zzso zzso of zzso B virus was produced in large amounts in the zzso space of zzso zzso The DNA fragments zzso coding the zzso zzso were zzso duplicated or zzso and zzso in the same reading frame to a zzso containing the promoter and the signal sequence of the alkaline zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso Further, a DNA zzso zzso coding mature zzso was joined to the region coding the C zzso of the zzso repeat to stabilize the gene zzso Upon induction of the zzso fusion zzso the fusion protein was produced at up to zzso of the total cellular zzso zzso of the cellular components and zzso accessibility of the product showed that the zzso was zzso in the zzso and formed inclusion bodies zzso The signal sequence of alkaline zzso was found to be correctly processed in zzso zzso
