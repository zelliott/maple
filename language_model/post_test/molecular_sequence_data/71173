A competitive zzso employing a zzso zzso raised against zzso was used to isolate and purify a zzso zzso from zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso seven zzso column steps were used to purify zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis and mass zzso were consistent with the structure zzso zzso zzso This zzso was zzso and zzso with the natural zzso on three different zzso zzso The activities of natural and synthetic zzso were zzso with both producing a 4-5 fold increase in fluid zzso by housefly zzso zzso at zzso zzso The presence of a pair of basic zzso zzso suggested zzso might be processed further, with the zzso zzso zzso being produced by conversion of an zzso zzso to zzso zzso However, this analog was zzso less active than the intact zzso comparable to the activity of zzso which shares the same zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is more than double that of a previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso from the housefly, and the two peptides act zzso in stimulating fluid zzso zzso also increased the frequency and zzso of zzso by housefly zzso which might further contribute to the zzso zzso
