zzso and zzso are a frequent cause of allergic zzso The only major zzso identified in shrimp is the muscle protein zzso at least zzso of zzso subjects react to zzso Furthermore, zzso is an important zzso in other crustaceans such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as other zzso such as house dust zzso and cockroaches, and has been implied as the cause of clinical zzso among zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are considered zzso 

The basis of the zzso of proteins has not yet been zzso Thus, zzso molecules provide an excellent opportunity to study the relationship between protein structure and zzso The aim of the current study was to identify the zzso regions of zzso a 1 and compare these regions with zzso sequences in other zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso overlapping peptides zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso spanning the entire zzso a 1 zzso were zzso and tested for zzso zzso zzso with zzso from 18 zzso subjects to identify the zzso regions of shrimp zzso 

Based on the frequency and intensity of the zzso zzso five major zzso regions were zzso All five major zzso regions were zzso zzso acids zzso The major zzso regions identified were: region 1: zzso a 1 zzso region zzso zzso a 1 zzso region zzso zzso a 1 zzso region zzso zzso a 1 zzso and region 5: zzso a 1 zzso In addition, 22 peptides were zzso as minor zzso regions, and 12 peptides did not bind any zzso zzso No substantial differences in zzso acid group composition in the five zzso regions compared to the whole zzso were zzso zzso identities and similarities of the zzso a 1 zzso regions with zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso were as high as zzso whereas identities and similarities with zzso zzso sequences ranged from 36 to zzso and 53 to zzso zzso 

Five major zzso regions of the zzso shrimp zzso zzso a 1, were identified which are positioned at regular intervals of approximately 42 zzso acids (7 zzso suggesting a relationship with the repetitive zzso structure of the zzso zzso The high degree of similarity between zzso a 1 zzso regions and zzso sequences in zzso zzso and the lower percentage of similarity with zzso regions of zzso zzso supports a structural basis for zzso of zzso zzso
