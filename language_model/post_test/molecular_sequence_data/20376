The zzso zzso zzso zzso play a key role in salt tolerance in zzso However, little is known about the zzso zzso in the zzso tree, zzso zzso In this study, we identified six putative zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso chain reaction indicated that the zzso transcripts were abundant compared with the other three zzso genes in the three zzso zzso stems and zzso zzso After zzso treatment for 6 zzso the transcript levels of zzso were zzso in the zzso To address the function of zzso zzso studies were performed with the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which lacks activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso at least in part, for the function of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was targeted to the zzso when zzso expressed in zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso function as zzso zzso zzso and that zzso products play an important role in the salt resistance of zzso zzso
