We have used zzso zzso analysis in conjunction with tandem mass zzso to identify and sequence a novel zzso zzso which may be useful for the diagnosis of tuberculosis zzso especially for patients zzso with human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was tested by an zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso in 25 of 27 zzso patients zzso zzso for zzso as well as in 38 of 67 individuals zzso who were zzso positive zzso No zzso was observed in 11 of 11 individuals zzso who were zzso zzso zzso In addition, neither zzso from zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of 29) nor zzso from healthy zzso of zzso blood donors tested positive with zzso Only 2 of 57 of zzso individuals tested positive with zzso zzso from individuals with zzso zzso and zzso for zzso but who had tested negative for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were also tested for zzso against zzso as were zzso from individuals with lung cancer and zzso zzso reacted with 26 of 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso in this group, compared to 2 of 37 zzso that reacted with the zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso may be a promising complementary zzso for the zzso of zzso
