zzso zzso zzso has been identified from bacteria to plants to animals including zzso The increase in serum zzso is regarded as an index for clinical diagnosis of liver function in zzso However, zzso zzso is also reported in zzso injury conditions and in apparently healthy people, suggesting it may play a fundamental role zzso zzso we isolated an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso an zzso species from zzso to zzso which zzso a zzso of 500 zzso acids with more than 62 and zzso sequence identity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It was zzso expressed in many zzso including the zzso zzso the precursor of liver, and its expression in the zzso was significantly zzso by challenge with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a specific activity of zzso was capable of specifically binding to the zzso bacteria zzso coli and zzso zzso and to their zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso the growth of zzso coli and causing its zzso In contrast, zzso did not bind to the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as their zzso zzso zzso In addition, a high zzso noted between zzso and zzso zzso sequences suggested a functional conservation of zzso zzso hinting at the clue that zzso zzso may also play an zzso role similar to that of zzso Taken together, it is proposed that zzso is an zzso zzso capable of identifying zzso and causing damage to zzso bacteria like zzso coli and zzso zzso It also bolsters the notion that the zzso zzso of zzso is the precursor of zzso liver, acting as a major tissue in acute phase zzso
