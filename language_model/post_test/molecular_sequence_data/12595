zzso are an important group of hormones zzso or modulating zzso zzso zzso are especially abundant in zzso zzso nervous systems, such as those of zzso the lowest animal group having a nervous zzso zzso often have a life cycle including a zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from sea zzso that zzso metamorphosis in a zzso zzso zzso to become a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Mann, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have cloned the precursor protein for this zzso zzso from sea zzso The precursor protein is zzso acid zzso long and contains 10 copies of the zzso authentic zzso zzso All zzso copies are preceded by zzso or zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in zzso precursor zzso In addition to these zzso copies, there are 14 copies of another, closely related zzso sequence zzso These copies are flanked by basic zzso sites and, therefore, are likely to be released from the precursor zzso Furthermore, there are 13 other, related zzso sequences having only small sequence variations (the most frequent zzso zzso eight zzso These zzso are preceded by zzso zzso or zzso zzso and are followed by basic zzso sites, and therefore, are also likely to be produced from the zzso Thus, there are at least 37 closely related zzso localized on the precursor zzso making this precursor one of the most productive zzso known so zzso This report also shows that unusual processing sites are common in zzso zzso
