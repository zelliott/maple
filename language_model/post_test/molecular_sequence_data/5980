The zzso response to zzso virus in zzso mice is directed almost exclusively to a single zzso zzso derived from the virus zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that the repertoire of T cells zzso by this zzso following primary zzso virus infection is very zzso The current experiments were undertaken to determine how a diverse array of zzso are able to interact with a single class I zzso zzso analysis of zzso bound to zzso has shown that the side chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and A8 zzso toward the zzso and are potentially available for recognition by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso prominently from the zzso site due to its zzso on a zzso in the center of zzso To determine the importance of these zzso for T cell recognition, we analyzed the response of a large panel of zzso to zzso zzso zzso at these four zzso The data suggested that there is dominant recognition of the central zzso and zzso zzso at the center of the zzso However, individual zzso exhibited distinct patterns of fine specificity for zzso F1 and zzso in that they were dependent on one, both, or neither of these zzso for recognition of zzso These data are consistent with a critical role for the zzso and zzso zzso in governing zzso recognition by T cells and may have implications for T cell recognition of zzso restricted zzso in zzso
