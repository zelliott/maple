A novel, strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso marine zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from seawater and studied by using a zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso : 1), zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso : zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequencing revealed that strain zzso zzso formed a cluster with the zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with levels of similarity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso AB zzso zzso
