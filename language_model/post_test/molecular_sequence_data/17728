The sweet protein zzso consists of two zzso associated zzso zzso the A chain of 44 zzso acid zzso and the B chain of 50 zzso The zzso zzso zzso chain, an zzso of the A chain, was zzso by the zzso zzso method in an overall yield of zzso The synthetic A chain analogue was combined with the zzso zzso chain, which was left over from a previous work, to give zzso zzso zzso in a yield of zzso This synthetic zzso analogue was approximately 550 times sweeter than zzso zzso the zzso groups of zzso zzso and zzso of the A chain to zzso groups significantly decreased the sweetness zzso zzso was performed by a vapor diffusion zzso
