Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso is a family of zzso factors composed of five zzso Among them, zzso is a zzso zzso protein in zzso T zzso zzso positively regulates zzso of a large number of zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and other zzso However, disruption of zzso results in an unexpected increase of zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso in regulation of zzso gene expression in T helper 2 cells zzso from an zzso zzso zzso deficient zzso cells showed a sustained zzso expression while wild type zzso cells reduced its zzso We tested whether zzso maintenance and changes in the zzso architecture of zzso promoter locus play a role in differential zzso zzso between in zzso and zzso deficient zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso deficient zzso zzso cells exhibited enhanced zzso accessibility with zzso zzso modification and DNA zzso in the zzso promoter zzso zzso factors bound to zzso promoter region in the absence of zzso were identified by zzso zzso Among the candidates, preferential recruitment of zzso to the zzso promoter was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso together with zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity, while zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso Our results suggest that the prolonged zzso expression in zzso deficient zzso cells is zzso by preferential binding of zzso to the zzso promoter with zzso zzso zzso
