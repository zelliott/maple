During an investigation of zzso in China, a novel zzso virus was isolated from adult female zzso zzso Full zzso sequence analysis showed the virus to be related to members of the family zzso and was therefore named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso identified zzso zzso virus particles with a mean diameter of 40 zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso and a zzso domain (which may be involved in the evasion of zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso encodes the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso coat protein shows a higher level of zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso than with infectious zzso virus zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso shows higher identity levels with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso levels to other members of the family zzso in either the coat protein or the zzso ranged from 6 to zzso Based on a recent reassessment of the coding strategy used by zzso we suggest that an zzso zzso fusion protein could be zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to grow in both zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that it is an zzso that can zzso zzso
