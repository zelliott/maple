In cold zzso disease, zzso red blood cell zzso termed cold zzso induce zzso in patients exposed to the zzso zzso these zzso are directed against the zzso regulated zzso blood zzso A second blood group system, the zzso system zzso on zzso is involved less zzso zzso cold zzso recognize either alpha zzso or alpha zzso zzso acid as the zzso zzso Cold zzso of zzso specificity show a remarkable restriction in their zzso repertoire of the zzso heavy and zzso zzso domain zzso exclusive use of zzso in heavy zzso For zzso cold zzso preliminary data on the repertoire of the zzso variable domain indicate a preference for the zzso zzso zzso To zzso restrictions in the zzso zzso zzso repertoire of zzso cold zzso zzso and to discuss these results in the context of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid, light chains in 13 zzso cold zzso were zzso 

The zzso light chains were isolated using zzso zzso zzso zzso they were subjected to zzso zzso degradation, and the light chain zzso zzso was affiliated using the zzso zzso 

Five of 13 zzso light chains belonged to zzso IV, five of 13 zzso to zzso I and three of 13 zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso IV zzso light chains exclusively recognized alpha zzso zzso zzso 

Including data from the literature, the repertoire of the zzso variable domain in pathological zzso cold zzso exhibits a clear bias towards the use of the single zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso of 17 or zzso The association of zzso IV zzso light zzso zzso cold zzso with binding to alpha zzso but not alpha zzso zzso acid raises speculations about a possible role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
