A zzso gene bank of zzso zzso zzso classical zzso was screened in zzso coli zzso for expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Positive clones were identified by their ability to cleave the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso clones were detected after screening zzso zzso zzso with a zzso qualitative plate zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso from one of the zzso and was located within a zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso Evidence that zzso was the zzso structural gene was obtained by zzso zzso and by zzso and comparison of the cloned gene product with the zzso zzso zzso from the parent zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the first 20 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation and matched perfectly with the zzso acid sequence predicted from zzso sequencing of zzso The sequence data also revealed the existence of a potential signal zzso that was apparently processed from zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso coli zzso clones did not zzso zzso into the growth zzso retaining most of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso showed that zzso expression and zzso zzso were temporally correlated as cells in batch culture entered zzso zzso Similar zzso were observed in at least one of the zzso coli zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression in zzso coli might be controlled by some of the same signals as in the parent zzso zzso zzso
