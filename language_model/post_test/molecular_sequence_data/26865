The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso fish that shows the characteristic of natural sex zzso In this study, 2-year-old female groupers were successfully reversed to functional males by oral administration of zzso zzso for 42 zzso The protein inhibitor of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso gene was cloned from zzso male zzso using modern suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and rapid amplification of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso containing a zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes 89 zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was specifically transcribed in zzso male zzso zzso expression analysis showed that zzso gene was expressed in the brain, heart, liver, zzso and kidney but not in the muscle zzso zzso of the expression pattern by zzso and Western zzso indicated that zzso and the level of expression of zzso in the zzso increased gradually during the transformation from female to zzso The results showed that zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso male zzso but scarcely in the female zzso and that its expression is zzso as the change of sex zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate that zzso is associated with the zzso sex transition of the zzso zzso but the precise role of the gene in this process remains to be further zzso
