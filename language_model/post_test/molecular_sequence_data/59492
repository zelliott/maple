zzso zzso activity was identified and defined by transfer of a part of zzso to reduced zzso zzso zzso in an zzso preparations from zzso zzso zzso Although the activity was distributed in zzso and zzso zzso associated with cells and in the zzso zzso it was mostly recovered in the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso was bound to the cell zzso The affinity for zzso zzso was increased at a higher concentration of donor zzso with a constant zzso The zzso for donor zzso was increased at a higher concentration of the zzso without any change in zzso These kinetic data suggest that the zzso acts by combining with the zzso independently of the zzso The zzso of the reaction decreased gradually as the zzso units was increased from two to four, suggesting that the zzso zzso reaction caused donor zzso substantially to decrease in molecular zzso The activity in zzso fraction was increased by zzso in zzso cells, when cultured in zzso medium containing various plant zzso Nevertheless, the activity increased markedly at the exponential growth and decreased immediately at the stationary phase of cells in the presence of zzso The activity of zzso zzso is zzso regulated during the growth but is not directly induced by plant zzso
