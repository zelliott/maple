zzso zzso contains eight members of a novel and zzso family of zzso proteins that is defined by four zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso involved in zzso drug zzso Although initially described as zzso factors, at least four zzso proteins bind most efficiently to zzso a sequence that differs at position zzso from the optimal zzso site zzso further, a zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binds efficiently to the zzso recognition zzso zzso modeling suggests that the zzso zzso make novel contacts and cause physical constraints at the zzso position that may account for the distinct zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso To various zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate zzso from a promoter containing a zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso is abolished in strains containing high levels of protein zzso zzso in contrast, zzso zzso activity is zzso by protein zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso activity is zzso by hydrogen zzso whereas zzso activity is zzso by zzso and zzso In addition, unlike other zzso zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso affect zzso stability, and they suppress the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, members of the zzso family carry out overlapping but distinct biological zzso
