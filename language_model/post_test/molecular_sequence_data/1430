Major intrinsic proteins zzso are a family of membrane channels that facilitate the zzso transport of water and small zzso zzso such as zzso The 35 full-length members of the zzso family in zzso are zzso into four structurally zzso zzso plasma membrane intrinsic proteins zzso zzso intrinsic proteins zzso zzso zzso intrinsic membrane proteins zzso and small basic intrinsic proteins zzso zzso methods were used to construct structural models of the putative pore regions of various plant zzso based on zzso modeling with the atomic resolution crystal structures of zzso zzso 1 and the bacterial zzso zzso zzso Based on comparisons of the narrow selectivity filter regions (the zzso zzso zzso the members of the four zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be classified into eight zzso zzso possess a uniform zzso signature characteristic of high water transport zzso whereas zzso are highly diverse with three separate zzso zzso zzso zzso possess two separate zzso zzso regions, one that is similar to the zzso soybean zzso zzso zzso 26, and another that is characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso zzso possesses two zzso subgroups, characteristic of either zzso or zzso Both zzso zzso zzso are divergent from all other zzso in plants and other zzso Overall, these findings suggest that higher plant zzso have a common fold but show distinct differences in proposed pore zzso potential to form hydrogen bonds with transported zzso and zzso that likely results in divergent transport zzso
