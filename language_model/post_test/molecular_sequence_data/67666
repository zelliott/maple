zzso is an zzso degradation system by which zzso materials are enclosed by an zzso and delivered to a zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso formation as a complex with zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the structure of zzso and its recognition mode of zzso or zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals a zzso zzso without circular zzso zzso analyses of zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso structure suggested that zzso has two zzso sites at zzso 5 and 6, whereas the zzso region is located at blade zzso Point zzso in the zzso of blade 2 specifically zzso zzso without affecting another zzso function, the regulation of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This architecture enables zzso to form a complex with zzso and zzso in zzso thereby functioning in the formation of zzso at zzso zzso
