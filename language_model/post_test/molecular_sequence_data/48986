The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit an oxygen consumption activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is insensitive to zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso zzso zzso Following this zzso the zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and zzso The pure protein is a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 49 zzso having a high zzso zzso acid sequence similarity towards other zzso zzso of the same zzso It contains a zzso attached zzso which was identified as being zzso by zzso zzso a novelty among zzso zzso zzso Metal analysis showed the absence of iron, indicating that no zzso clusters are present in the zzso The average reduction potential of the zzso group was determined to be zzso zzso at 25 degrees C and pH zzso by zzso zzso monitored by visible zzso zzso the zzso is a zzso zzso as it is capable of transferring electrons from zzso to several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso turnover rates of 195 zzso zzso oxidized zzso zzso at 60 degrees C were obtained using zzso as electron zzso after zzso dilution and incubation with zzso
