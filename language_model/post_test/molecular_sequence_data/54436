The zzso zzso is a critical zzso of human zzso zzso in its composition have been correlated with chronic disorders, such as obesity and inflammatory zzso disease in adults, and may be associated with zzso zzso zzso in premature zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso variation may zzso distinct ecological zzso within mixed zzso yet there have been few zzso analyses of zzso connections in the context of the human zzso Here, we document zzso zzso divergence during the first 3 zzso of life within the zzso zzso of an infant born at zzso zzso We observed three compositional zzso during zzso and reconstructed and zzso curated population zzso zzso from the third zzso The relative abundance of two zzso strains sharing zzso zzso identity changed significantly over time within a community dominated by a nearly zzso zzso population and harboring a lower abundance zzso population and multiple plasmids and zzso Modeling of zzso strain abundance suggests differences in growth rates and host colonization zzso We identified zzso variation potentially responsible for divergent strain zzso including hotspots of sequence variation in regulatory genes and zzso regions, and in genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and host zzso as well as differences in the zzso of these zzso Our results demonstrate that a community zzso approach can zzso gut microbial colonization at the resolution required to discern medically relevant strain and species population zzso and hence improve our ability to diagnose and treat microbial zzso zzso
