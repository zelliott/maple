In zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso of the primary zzso factor zzso 70 are the most highly zzso regions and are responsible for the recognition of zzso and zzso promoter elements zzso zzso studies provide evidence to this end and indicate that the side chains of zzso zzso make specific contacts with the zzso at zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso among zzso zzso factors and is strongly zzso to the classical zzso zzso motif shared by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein and other zzso zzso suggesting that zzso factor also belongs to the zzso class of zzso In this study, a single point zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso zzso results in a zzso that is zzso inefficient although zzso similar to zzso zzso The zzso zzso like zzso zzso as a 87 zzso protein on zzso gels and has 50% zzso However, zzso at zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso appreciable amount of zzso product, when compared with that generated by zzso zzso a zzso in zzso DNA binding zzso A model of zzso motif for the zzso 20 zzso region of zzso domain of zzso coli zzso 70 as well as its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed based on five other zzso zzso motifs from zzso complexes for which X-ray or zzso structure is zzso A zzso structure was designed for zzso region using sequence dependent base pair zzso The modeled zzso structure was zzso into the major groove formed by the zzso zzso DNA using the zzso rules and zzso zzso base contact information of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso contact information of the model was tested and found to have good agreement with the experimental zzso
