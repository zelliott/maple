zzso virus infection has recently taken endemic proportions in India with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso In this study, we carried out the selection pressure analysis of three critical zzso regions of zzso zzso analysis was then carried out on the positively selected zzso region in the zzso virus strains isolated in the Indian subcontinent over a time span of 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso calculation of the substitution rate was carried out for the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso sequence regions of zzso strains were taken for the positive selection zzso The zzso junction sequences were then used to construct a maximum likelihood zzso zzso zzso zzso rates were also calculated under various models of population zzso 

It was found that zzso 86, corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso in a crucial zzso zzso of the zzso was under significant positive zzso The zzso substitution was found to exist in almost all the Indian strains isolated after zzso The zzso tree constructed from the zzso junction sequences indicated that strains from the 2006 dengue zzso in Delhi, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most rapidly zzso zzso rates of a zzso zzso sequences from the Indian subcontinent were found to be zzso times higher than those reported from other parts of the zzso 

Positive selection in the zzso corresponding to zzso of the highly zzso surface zzso is important in view of its occurrence in a zzso zzso as well as its strict conservation in all the DEN zzso zzso analysis of the zzso junction sequences showed that three strains of 2006 are rapidly zzso These results were also supported by calculations of the substitution zzso Their significance in the expansion of viral zzso requires to be zzso
