The zzso of fishes, composed of dense zzso is a zzso tissue layer that forms in the zzso dividing zzso from the zzso and its structure and function are similar to those of the zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso serve as the zzso of muscular zzso to bones and adjoining muscles, and their structure is indispensable for movement of zzso zzso We cloned the zzso zzso gene and examined its expression and function in the zzso The expression in zzso started in the zzso part of each segmented zzso in the early zzso zzso and consequently, zzso stripes were zzso At the end of zzso the expression region shifted to the zzso zzso and the zzso boundary, and each zzso was surrounded by zzso Using a zzso zzso we found that the zzso protein was localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to defects in zzso formation, a delay in the differentiation of zzso and disorder of connection between zzso and zzso We demonstrated here that zzso is the first zzso involved in zzso formation and propose that zzso zzso on the surface of the zzso is required for the zzso of muscle fiber zzso to the zzso and the differentiation of muscle zzso
