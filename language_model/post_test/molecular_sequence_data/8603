We have identified and zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso The inhibitor showed a molecular mass of 90 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The inhibitor protein was zzso from the zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and the size exclusion on a zzso A zzso m column in the presence of high zzso The zzso protein inhibited all three zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it failed to cause any significant zzso of zzso activity of zzso suggesting that the regulation of zzso and zzso activities is zzso The zzso of the zzso activity was zzso The results suggest that the zzso inhibitor protein may be an important regulator of zzso zzso
