The zzso zzso is used by many organisms to zzso zzso zzso the building block for the zzso of many biologically important compounds, including zzso zzso zzso and many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a critical zzso transfer step, producing zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A, revealing an overall fold similar to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso In addition, the zzso shows structural similarity with zzso zzso zzso and domain IV of zzso factor zzso The active site of zzso is in the zzso between its zzso and zzso zzso Several structural motifs zzso among species, including a zzso loop, have been found in this zzso zzso an zzso zzso among zzso zzso is located close to the putative zzso site and has been assumed to play the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso model in the context of the other members of the zzso zzso family offers the opportunity to understand both the mechanism of these zzso and the structural details that may lead to the design of novel zzso
