zzso more insight into the mechanisms governing the behavior of proteins at zzso zzso is particularly relevant in the interaction of high-value zzso with storage and delivery device surfaces, where zzso zzso changes may dramatically affect zzso The impact of structural stability on zzso behavior has been previously investigated by engineering zzso stability zzso Potential shortcomings of such approaches include only modest changes in zzso and the introduction of changes in the zzso of the proteins when zzso bonds are zzso Here we employ two members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso to gain a new perspective on the role of naturally occurring zzso on zzso protein arrangement and its subsequent impact on zzso zzso we find that during initial zzso events, both proteins have similar affinity to the zzso and undergo nearly identical levels of structural zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso occur during zzso and both proteins exhibit some level of activity loss and irreversible zzso change upon zzso Although such zzso zzso is expected for the less stable zzso it is remarkable that the extremely zzso zzso is similarly affected by zzso zzso These results question the role of zzso stability as a predictor of protein zzso zzso
