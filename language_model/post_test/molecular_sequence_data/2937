zzso A zzso and B zzso are two major zzso of the human zzso zzso Here we present a comparison of the zzso structures of zzso and zzso developed by analyzing DNA clones isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso junctions and zzso and 3' zzso sequences revealed that the zzso and zzso genes consist of 7 and 5 zzso respectively, and both genes have greater than zzso identical sequence from the zzso zzso region to the region approximately 1 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso the zzso zzso In this zzso part of the zzso zzso lacks one zzso due to a point zzso at the zzso zzso site of the third zzso which zzso the zzso zzso event of zzso and leads to zzso of the second to the fourth zzso Following these very zzso zzso the zzso sequences for zzso and zzso diverge significantly and no zzso can be detected in their 3' end zzso The transition site from zzso to zzso sequences can be localized within zzso repeat zzso The analysis of the zzso sequences and their zzso direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral zzso structure has been maintained in the zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3' sequences different from those of the zzso gene by zzso zzso at the zzso repeats during or after gene zzso
