In the course of breast cancer global gene expression studies, we identified an zzso gene known as zzso zzso domain containing 2) to be markedly zzso in primary tumors from patients with zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso and protein expression significantly elevated in breast zzso compared with normal breast samples as analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, specimens displaying zzso zzso were predominantly advanced stage III breast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing analyses allowed us to identify two zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso expressed in breast cancer cell zzso We further investigated the occurrence and frequency of gene amplification and zzso affecting zzso in 131 breast zzso zzso gene amplification was detected in zzso of 98 invasive breast zzso zzso However, no zzso amplification was detected in normal breast zzso zzso or breast benign zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso expression results in a decrease of zzso breast cancer cells proliferation compared with the corresponding controls zzso In addition, analysis of publicly available gene expression data showed a strong association between high zzso expression and decreased overall survival zzso zzso survival zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with primary zzso breast zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that zzso zzso behaves as an indicator of poor prognosis and may play a role zzso breast cancer zzso
