zzso zzso zzso have been used as a genetic and molecular tool to study the functions of many gene zzso Each zzso zzso protein may contain a zzso zzso mechanism such as zzso zzso zzso To identify key zzso structural elements controlling the protein function, we screened zzso zzso zzso from a comprehensive zzso library consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso for their zzso zzso through zzso sequences in zzso zzso We isolated 142 zzso zzso zzso including 131 zzso zzso zzso These zzso clustered in zzso in the zzso domain, particularly in one of the two zzso of the zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso hot zzso Among the 142 zzso 54 were examined further in human zzso zzso cells, and it was confirmed that zzso of the zzso were also zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso represented distinct zzso zzso for the zzso binding sequences and a distinct zzso expression pattern for zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso in the core zzso domain of zzso was a key structural element controlling the protein function and provided a clue for finding a molecular mechanism that enables the rescue of the zzso zzso zzso
