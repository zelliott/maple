zzso zzso plays an essential role in signal zzso pathways that regulate zzso and energy zzso zzso function, and muscle mass in human skeletal zzso zzso zzso of signaling zzso has been identified in zzso muscle using zzso zzso but its role in other skeletal muscle disorders remains largely zzso This may be in part due to insufficient knowledge of relevant zzso Here, we therefore present the first large-scale in zzso zzso study of human skeletal muscle from 3 lean, healthy zzso zzso zzso of 3-5 zzso human skeletal muscle protein was followed by zzso enrichment using zzso and zzso The resulting zzso were analyzed by zzso Using this unbiased approach, we identified zzso distinct in zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso including 240 zzso 53 zzso and 13 zzso in at least 2 out of 3 zzso In addition, 61 ambiguous zzso sites were identified in at least 2 out of 3 zzso The majority of zzso detected are involved in zzso function, zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of particular interest, we identified multiple novel zzso sites on several zzso zzso proteins known to be involved in signaling and muscle zzso These results provide numerous new targets for the investigation of human skeletal muscle zzso in health and disease and demonstrate feasibility of zzso research of human skeletal muscle in zzso
