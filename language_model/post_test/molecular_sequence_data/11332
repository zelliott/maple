zzso mice were generated containing a zzso pair zzso of the kidney zzso protein zzso promoter fused to the human zzso zzso gene with the goal of specifically targeting zzso expression of zzso system components to the zzso High level expression of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evident in the kidney of male mice from two independent transgenic zzso Renal expression of the zzso in female mice was zzso under zzso conditions but could be strongly induced by administration of zzso zzso treatment did not cause a zzso induction in any other zzso zzso However, an analysis of six zzso target zzso in males revealed that the zzso was expressed in zzso No other zzso expression of the zzso was zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that expression of zzso (and zzso zzso in males and zzso females was restricted to zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso Although there was no zzso human zzso protein in zzso it was evident in the zzso consistent with a zzso of synthesis in zzso zzso cells and release into the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso base pairs of the zzso promoter is sufficient to drive expression of a zzso reporter gene in a zzso zzso and zzso fashion in transgenic zzso
