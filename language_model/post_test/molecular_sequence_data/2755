Two zzso genes zzso products related to zzso protein zzso have been isolated by zzso to a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes zzso products with putative zzso binding and zzso zzso on the same zzso chain, as found for the zzso bovine lung zzso protein zzso The deduced product of one gene zzso zzso position, zzso is zzso larger than the bovine zzso and differs substantially in sequence at the zzso zzso the region responsible in the bovine zzso for zzso The second gene zzso zzso position, zzso is transcribed into three major zzso species of different zzso The largest zzso zzso and smallest zzso zzso zzso overlapping zzso of similar sequence to the whole length of bovine lung zzso protein zzso The translation product of the third major zzso zzso lacks sequences similar to those that constitute the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the bovine zzso The percentage zzso acid identity between zzso or zzso and bovine lung zzso protein zzso is 55 and zzso zzso A common zzso of the two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso is strongly suggested by the zzso positions of zzso in these zzso
