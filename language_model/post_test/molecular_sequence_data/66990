A putative zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso is zzso to zzso that mediates positive zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso domain of zzso protein was zzso as a fusion with a zzso tag zzso in zzso cells and isolated to zzso The zzso conversion of zzso showed zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the green zzso form zzso zzso and zzso at 433 and zzso zzso for the blue zzso form zzso zzso At zzso the zzso form zzso at 580 zzso while the zzso form did not emit any zzso Mass zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso at ring A via a zzso zzso It is established that zzso and zzso are novel zzso in zzso zzso that are similar, but distinct from the zzso and zzso
