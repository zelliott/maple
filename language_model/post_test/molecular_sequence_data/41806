Analysis of zzso resistant cell lines has led to the identification of the zzso zzso zzso Two of the three classes of zzso zzso have the ability to zzso cellular resistance to a broad range of structurally and functionally diverse zzso zzso zzso are integral membrane zzso comprised of two similar halves, each consisting of six membrane spanning zzso followed by a zzso domain which includes a zzso binding zzso The zzso is a member of a large zzso of transport proteins which zzso zzso to zzso a wide range of zzso across biological zzso This zzso includes transport complexes comprised of zzso systems, half zzso and zzso zzso which appear to require 12 zzso zzso zzso and two zzso binding folds for zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and characterized from a wide range of zzso zzso acid zzso the similarities between the halves and zzso boundaries have been compared to understand the evolutionary origins of the zzso
