The aim of this study was to characterize the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a fish used extensively in experimental studies, and to use the cloned zzso as zzso for measuring zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso treated with different zzso and zzso A first strand zzso was prepared from 10 zzso from male zzso and zzso fragments were amplified by zzso using zzso zzso based on highly zzso regions of known zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To obtain full-length zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso was 540 zzso long, zzso a protein of 122 zzso acids and zzso zzso was zzso zzso long, zzso a protein of 148 zzso zzso Of zzso zzso zzso published so far, those most similar to zzso zzso are found among other zzso fishes, with zzso acid similarities of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso cloned zzso were used as zzso to analyze zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso from zzso exposed to different zzso and zzso Two hundred males were divided into four groups and kept under different zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 degrees zzso zzso zzso 7 degrees zzso zzso zzso 20 degrees C, and zzso zzso 7 degrees zzso Red breeding colors and a marked kidney zzso zzso male secondary sexual characters in the zzso appeared in the group kept under zzso zzso at 20 degrees C, but not in the other zzso The kidney zzso height zzso was significantly lower in the zzso zzso 20 degrees C group than in all other groups, and this was also the only group with active zzso The zzso zzso 20 degrees C had significantly lower expression of both zzso and zzso than all other zzso Thus, both zzso displayed their lowest expression when zzso was active and when low zzso indicated that zzso levels were at their zzso
