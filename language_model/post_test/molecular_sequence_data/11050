zzso usually carry two highly zzso genes zzso and zzso for zzso zzso In several zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene has a large deletion compared to other zzso zzso In this study we have measured zzso pore activity in zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso channel activity whilst zzso forms zzso pores of variable size which are smaller than zzso No sequence zzso exists between zzso and zzso of known structure, so zzso moment analysis has been used to model their membrane zzso From this it appears likely that the deletion removes the crucial zzso internal zzso
