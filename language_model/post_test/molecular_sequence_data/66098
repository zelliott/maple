zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso a zzso important for all cellular zzso We have cloned and characterized an zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso This gene was transcribed primarily as an approximately zzso zzso which encodes a protein containing zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso or zzso zzso and 382 zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso was also transcribed as part of an apparent zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso together with a putative zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso coli, showed functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis using an zzso zzso showed that this zzso is expressed in zzso zzso Thus, zzso like other organisms, can zzso its own zzso and may not depend on its host for the supply of this important zzso
