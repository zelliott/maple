zzso tail removal is the first step in the degradation zzso for some zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso removes zzso zzso tails in zzso by a process similar to that observed in zzso The zzso zzso degrades zzso and zzso bound by zzso and can be activated by zzso to degrade zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso of the zzso tail down to zzso zzso and the terminal zzso of this short zzso tract are zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso rates are zzso by the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso and this occurs by switching zzso from a zzso to a more zzso zzso Terminal zzso rates are also zzso to different zzso by various zzso zzso of the zzso 3' zzso sequence completely zzso the terminal zzso reaction zzso to the presence of an zzso element 70 zzso from the zzso zzso Other sequence elements inserted at a similar distance from the zzso tail also interfere with the zzso These data suggest that the two zzso of zzso degradation can be regulated by zzso zzso and they provide a zzso description of how this regulation could occur in zzso
