zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso sample based on its high level of mineral zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was correlated with expression of the direct zzso zzso An zzso zzso library constructed in zzso coli strain zzso was screened for zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso zzso was capable of zzso acid zzso production and zzso zzso zzso but only in the presence of stationary phase zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso was apparently the result of the zzso zzso zzso activity because zzso (a zzso knockout of zzso carrying zzso did not produce zzso under the same zzso zzso production by zzso zzso was not observed when zzso was replaced by another zzso strain zzso These data add to a growing body of evidence that zzso coli contains some type of zzso zzso zzso distinct from those previously characterized in zzso bacteria and that these genes may be induced under appropriate zzso
