Most zzso proteins are zzso as precursors in the zzso prior to their transport into zzso These precursors are generally zzso in a form that is larger than the mature form found inside zzso The extra zzso zzso called transit zzso are present at the zzso zzso The transit zzso is necessary and sufficient to recognize the zzso and induce movement of the attached protein across the envelope zzso In this review, we discuss the primary and secondary structure of transit zzso describe what is known about the import process, and present some hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of the import zzso
