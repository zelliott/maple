zzso zzso contains a zzso particle zzso composed of an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso We have now identified a mycoplasma zzso to the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso The protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso zzso has a weak intrinsic zzso activity but zzso zzso was markedly zzso when it was combined with mycoplasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso when zzso was combined with the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso These findings indicate that basic features of the zzso zzso mechanism are independent of the zzso M domain of the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso is zzso to a large extent by contacts between the zzso zzso of the mycoplasma zzso and zzso proteins and that the contribution of the M domain and zzso zzso in the zzso mechanism is mainly for zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
