The mouse zzso zzso a zzso exploits its large zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso for both essential and zzso zzso Among the zzso functions are those that offer the virus a selective advantage in zzso both the innate and zzso immune responses of the zzso Several zzso genes of zzso are thought to zzso zzso genes and to function as zzso To understand further the evolution and function of these viral zzso zzso zzso X-ray structures of several of them have been determined, not only confirming the overall zzso structure, but also zzso features unique to this zzso Future efforts promise to clarify the nature of the molecular zzso of these zzso their evolution in the context of the adapting immune response of the zzso host, and by zzso the evolution of the host response to human zzso as zzso
