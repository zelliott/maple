In this paper we describe identification and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso is expressed by all zzso strains belonging to the zzso tuberculosis complex but is absent from virtually all other zzso species, and it is a promising zzso for zzso of tuberculosis zzso zzso we analyzed whether zzso is a similarly powerful tool for the study of zzso by examining zzso responses against zzso in zzso patients, zzso patients, and exposed or zzso healthy controls from areas where zzso and zzso are endemic and areas where they are not zzso zzso was recognized by T cells from zzso patients, zzso patients, individuals who had contact with zzso patients, and healthy individuals from an area where zzso and zzso are endemic but not by T cells from individuals who were not exposed to zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso patients who were not responsive to zzso zzso failed to respond to zzso A very similar pattern was obtained with zzso These results show that zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso that stimulates zzso gamma zzso production in a large proportion of individuals exposed to zzso zzso Moreover, our results suggest that there is significant zzso between zzso and zzso which has implications for the use of zzso as tool for diagnosis of zzso and zzso in areas where both diseases are zzso
