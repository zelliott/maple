zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso type II zzso integral membrane protein that functions in the zzso of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and protection of zzso in other organisms from toxic zzso Recently we showed that zzso zzso zzso was sorted zzso from the zzso to zzso via a novel zzso zzso network that was interpreted to be a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the molecular signals responsible for sorting zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of certain zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso (includes a positively charged domain found in most zzso integral zzso zzso abolished sorting of zzso zzso to zzso via zzso However, the zzso tail was not sufficient for sorting zzso zzso to zzso via zzso whereas the zzso plus most of the immediately adjacent zzso acid zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso was sufficient for zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with an artificial zzso zzso of putative sorting zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso tail also sorted zzso zzso to zzso via zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso does not possess essential sorting zzso Instead, the zzso appears to zzso the proper context required for the zzso positively charged domain to function within zzso zzso as an overlapping zzso sorting signal and a membrane zzso targeting signal type zzso
