zzso analysis of class B zzso receptors zzso zzso proteins that respond to zzso hormones, has been restricted to the zzso zzso domain, thus providing little understanding of the zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso type 1 is a class B zzso which mediates the response to stress and has been considered a drug target for depression and zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the human zzso factor zzso type 1 in complex with the zzso zzso zzso The structure provides detailed insight into the architecture of class B zzso Atomic details of the interactions of the zzso with the zzso zzso that binds deep within the zzso are zzso This structure provides a model for all class B zzso and may aid in the design of new zzso drugs for diseases of brain and zzso
