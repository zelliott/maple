A series of zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated for their in zzso and in zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso These compounds inhibit zzso by forming both a zzso bond between the zzso zzso carbon atom and the zzso group of zzso and a hydrogen bond between the zzso nitrogen atom and zzso zzso to the parent zzso ring a variety of zzso which spanned a range of zzso properties had only a modest effect on in zzso potency zzso zzso zzso zzso This apparent lack of a significant effect is believed to result from the fact that any increased zzso zzso zzso by the ring zzso is counter balanced by a corresponding decrease in the zzso ability of the zzso nitrogen zzso In contrast to the results in zzso maximizing in zzso activity was critically dependent upon the choice of the zzso ring zzso Several zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso lung injury when administered zzso 24 h prior to the zzso
