zzso protein zzso zzso are important regulators of a wide variety of protein zzso signaling zzso in animals, zzso and zzso We previously identified a cluster of putative zzso in zzso (including zzso and zzso in which the zzso domain is related to that of zzso the human protein zzso in zzso zzso In animal and zzso systems, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso have all been demonstrated to bind to zzso by a zzso domain zzso We present a zzso analysis which shows that these zzso from zzso together with other related plant zzso share with the above animal and zzso proteins a widespread and ancient zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to zzso starch through its predicted zzso region, and that zzso of key zzso zzso reduces this zzso zzso with its ability to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso was found associated with starch zzso from zzso plants and suspension zzso zzso experiments revealed a zzso with zzso placing zzso zzso in the zzso zzso data from different stages of the zzso cycle and across a wide variety of zzso show a strong correlation between the pattern displayed by transcripts of the zzso locus and that of genes zzso key starch zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest the hypothesis that plant zzso could be part of a protein zzso at the starch zzso where they would be zzso situated to regulate starch metabolism through zzso zzso zzso
