zzso are essentially ancient natural antibiotics with potent activity extending from lower organisms to zzso They can inhibit the growth or zzso of zzso directly or indirectly enhance the zzso immune zzso The successful prediction of zzso peptides will provide very useful information and insights for the basic research of zzso In this study, by selecting the zzso composition of reduced zzso acid alphabet zzso obtained from structural alphabet named zzso zzso as the feature zzso the zzso of diversity zzso is zzso developed to predict zzso family and zzso The zzso test based on zzso composition of reduced zzso acid alphabet zzso with 13 reduced zzso acids shows that the overall accuracy of prediction are zzso for zzso family, and zzso for zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is a simple and efficient prediction method for zzso zzso
