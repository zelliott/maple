A zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso degradation of newly zzso zzso zzso exported from the zzso zzso The gene zzso this zzso zzso has been identified in zzso Based on sequence analysis, zzso was classified as a member of the zzso zzso that contains a putative zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso More recent studies in zzso indicate that zzso can bind to the zzso zzso through its interaction with the DNA repair protein zzso A mouse zzso of zzso zzso bound not only to the zzso zzso but also to various proteins related to zzso and/or the zzso through an extended zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso which is not found in zzso contains a zzso domain predicted to be involved in the zzso zzso This review will focus on the primary structure and potential functions of the zzso zzso
