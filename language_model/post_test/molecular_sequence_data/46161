zzso from the biomass in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso cooperation between zzso bacteria, zzso zzso bacteria and zzso zzso zzso of microbial community composition within the zzso zzso may improve the methane production from biomass zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso of a zzso reactor supplied with zzso feces as zzso under zzso conditions was zzso Community composition was determined by analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso clone library consisting of 123 zzso zzso analysis of zzso library indicated that all major groups of zzso from our zzso reactor were zzso In the library, zzso clones were affiliated to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and about zzso clones belonged to zzso zzso Over zzso of the zzso zzso from our zzso reactor were zzso to be zzso zzso Comparing with other previous studies reporting that zzso zzso are dominant species in the zzso plants, this study zzso reported that zzso instead of zzso are the most zzso zzso zzso in the zzso reactor fed with zzso feces as sole zzso
