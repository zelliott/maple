zzso zzso has been isolated as a zzso zzso from the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1977), zzso zzso zzso 41, zzso However, the fine zzso and structural composition of zzso zzso remained to be studied because a large amount of contracted zzso zzso were present in the zzso preparations so far zzso To obtain intact zzso zzso and its major parts, we developed simple and efficient zzso methods including the use of zzso density zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of a novel zzso structure at the zzso end of the zzso zzso which consisted of a zzso part, a zzso and tail zzso zzso sheath and inner core were zzso as hollow zzso structures with zzso lengths of 69 and 174 zzso respectively, and tail fibers were zzso as a zzso structure with length of 63 zzso zzso gel zzso showed the presence of single major proteins of 50, 20, and 68 zzso in the isolated zzso core, and tail zzso zzso Three other minor proteins of 46, 44, and 35 zzso were also identified as the structural proteins of zzso zzso which may be the candidate proteins for the zzso and the base plate zzso Thus zzso zzso consists of at least 6 protein zzso
