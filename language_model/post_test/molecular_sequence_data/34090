zzso stresses such as drought, zzso and cold are major environmental factors that limit agricultural zzso zzso factors play essential roles in zzso stress signaling in zzso Three zzso members were identified and designated zzso zzso and zzso based on their zzso zzso The zzso elements in the promoter regions were zzso and their diverse expression patterns under different zzso stress conditions were zzso zzso was further characterized because of its earlier response to zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso localized in the zzso To examine the role of zzso under various environmental zzso transgenic zzso plants carrying zzso controlled by the zzso zzso promoter were generated and subjected to severe zzso zzso zzso zzso had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing zzso which were confirmed by the enhanced expressions of zzso zzso genes and several zzso zzso including decreased rate of water loss, enhanced cell membrane stability, improved zzso potential, and reduced zzso zzso zzso is a zzso regulatory zzso Its zzso zzso enhanced tolerance to multiple zzso stresses while having no obvious negative effects on zzso under zzso and stressed zzso thus, zzso has the potential for zzso in transgenic breeding to improve zzso stress zzso in zzso
