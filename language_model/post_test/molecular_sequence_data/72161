The crystal structure of human zzso H refined at zzso A resolution is compared with that of zzso zzso The core of the zzso consists of two repeats containing five zzso each and forming the zzso zzso fold also observed in zzso One hundred and zzso out of the 217 C alpha atoms from the zzso fold can be zzso with a zzso difference of zzso zzso The structural zzso is even higher for the zzso at the interface with the zzso which is of functional significance, as shown by our observation that zzso H binds to zzso zzso 2 zzso and that zzso A is able to activate zzso in the presence of zzso Based on this zzso a new signature sequence for zzso was zzso The specificity of the zzso H zzso is provided mainly by two long zzso which extend the zzso fold at its zzso and zzso and pack together against the first repeat on the side opposite to the zzso zzso zzso show that the terminal zzso are required for a functionally active zzso zzso
