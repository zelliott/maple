Numerous diseases have been linked to the malfunction of zzso coupled receptors zzso Their adequate treatment requires rational design of new zzso and zzso drugs targeting these zzso In this work, we report three-dimensional models of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso The models are based on the X-ray structure of bovine zzso The zzso approach employs an original procedure for zzso of zzso zzso It includes rotation of one of the zzso zzso around its axis with simultaneous assessment of quality of the resulting complexes according to a number of criteria we have developed for this zzso The optimal geometry of the zzso binding is selected based on the analysis of zzso of zzso properties between the zzso and its protein environment in the binding zzso The elaborated zzso models are employed to explore the details of zzso interactions for zzso and a number of its zzso with known affinity to zzso and zzso zzso The models permit rationalization of experimental data, including those that were not used in model zzso The perspectives opened by the constructed models and by the zzso procedure in the design of new drugs are zzso
