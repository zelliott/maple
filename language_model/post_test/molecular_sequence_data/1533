The zzso 434 zzso zzso between its six naturally occurring binding sites using indirect zzso In indirect zzso zzso differences in the structure and flexibility of zzso bases in a zzso zzso site zzso the affinity of DNA for zzso The zzso and flexibility of a DNA sequence can be influenced by the interaction of the DNA bases or backbone with solution zzso We examined the effect of changing the zzso present in solution on the stability and structure of 434 zzso complexes with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso binding sites that differ in their contacted and zzso base zzso We find that the affinity of zzso for zzso but not for zzso depends remarkably on the type and concentration of zzso zzso Moreover, the formation of a stable, specific zzso complex requires the presence of zzso zzso however, zzso complex formation has no such zzso zzso zzso zzso type alters the ability of zzso to protect zzso but not zzso from zzso radical zzso zzso the relative length of the zzso zzso zzso tract in the zzso regions of the zzso and zzso can reverse the zzso sensitivity of zzso affinities for these two zzso Taken together these findings show that zzso zzso in DNA structure zzso indirect zzso of DNA sequence by 434 zzso and perhaps other zzso
