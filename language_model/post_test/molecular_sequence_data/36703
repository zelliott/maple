The prevalence of zzso DNA was examined in inflammatory zzso disease zzso DNA was extracted from zzso and biopsy specimens of the large zzso from patients with zzso colitis zzso zzso zzso patients with Crohn's disease zzso zzso 29), and patients with zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect viral DNA using primer pairs specific for either zzso zzso zzso zzso virus 1 zzso human zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso virus zzso or Epstein zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso DNA were not detected in any of tissue zzso There was a high prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA in zzso colitis tissue compared to Crohn's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Control tissue had a relatively low frequency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA but a prevalence of zzso DNA similar to that of zzso colitis zzso However, the simultaneous presence of zzso and zzso and/or zzso DNA in zzso colitis tissue zzso was much greater than in either Crohn's disease zzso zzso or control tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a low prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso DNA in peripheral blood zzso cells from all patient zzso zzso and zzso are capable of zzso zzso the high prevalence of zzso zzso infection with either or both of these two viruses in zzso colitis tissue suggests that they may play a synergistic role in the zzso of this zzso
