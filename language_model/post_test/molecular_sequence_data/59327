We describe a method for identifying genes zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are transformed with a gene library in which zzso zzso zzso sequences are fused to the gene zzso the zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso are subsequently identified by rapid zzso screening in zzso In a model application of these methods to the zzso zzso nucleus, we have identified several novel genes whose products are found in specific nuclear regions, including zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso and sequence similarities between some of these genes and previously identified genes zzso nuclear proteins have validated the zzso These methods will be useful in identifying additional components of the zzso zzso nucleus, and further extensions of this approach should also be zzso to a more comprehensive identification of the elements of zzso architecture in zzso zzso
