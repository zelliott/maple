The zzso organization at the 3' end of canine coronavirus zzso and zzso enteric coronavirus zzso was determined by sequence analysis and compared to that of zzso infectious zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso of zzso zzso of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso lacking in zzso which is currently designated zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso possess zzso zzso at the 3' ends of their zzso The presence of zzso zzso in three of four viruses in this zzso cluster strongly suggests that zzso has lost this zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso with that of zzso but the predicted zzso acid sequences are only zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains a large deletion compared to that of zzso reducing the zzso part to zzso The sequence zzso were highest between zzso and zzso on the one hand and between zzso and zzso on the zzso Previously, we showed that the expression product of the zzso zzso zzso can be detected in infected cells by zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the present study we have performed similar experiments with zzso and zzso In infected cells both viruses produced proteins related to but different from the zzso zzso zzso
