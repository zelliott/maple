zzso zzso has provided extraordinarily diverse functions to zzso Nevertheless, how newly combined zzso are coordinated to create novel functions remains a fundamental question of genetic and zzso zzso Previously, we reported a unique mechanism of gene creation, zzso new combinations of functional zzso are assembled from distinct genes at the zzso level, reverse zzso and integrated into the zzso by the zzso zzso The novel gene zzso created by the fusion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is specifically transcribed in human and zzso zzso We present the first evidence for the translation of zzso in zzso The human zzso locus showed a low zzso diversity within 11 populations zzso zzso compared with other zzso regions such as zzso and overall zzso It was equivalent to the average for coding sequences or zzso from other zzso suggesting that human zzso has some function and is zzso among modern zzso Two linked zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso They are positioned in the vicinity of the zzso cavity of the parental zzso protein and change the charge of both zzso The relatively rapid expansion of this zzso might indicate a selective advantage for it in modern zzso We determined the evolutionary fate of zzso zzso created by domain zzso During zzso diversification, the zzso domain was retained in all zzso whereas the zzso motif zzso 1 in the domain experienced critical zzso acid replacements at an early stage, being zzso under subsequent high levels of zzso zzso to zzso and other zzso suggesting that zzso evolution diversified these functional zzso zzso the zzso domain is zzso in zzso and zzso These observations provide a possible scheme of domain zzso in which the combined parental zzso are not tightly linked in the novel zzso zzso allowing for changes in their functional roles, leading to their zzso Selective pressure toward a novel function initially acted on one domain, whereas the other experienced a nearly neutral zzso Over time, the latter also gained a new function or was zzso
