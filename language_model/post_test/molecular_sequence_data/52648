zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to bind sequences in zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso In the current study, an zzso transcript containing the zzso region of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene is shown to be an zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso of the transcript, zzso of the zzso reaction is reduced to zzso of the value obtained in the absence of the zzso zzso This zzso is due to a zzso zzso increase in the zzso value for zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity is also obtained with a transcript containing a portion of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso gene and with an zzso form of the zzso transcript, both of which contain potential zzso secondary structures implicated in binding of zzso In contrast, much higher zzso of zzso zzso or zzso respectively, zzso and zzso greater than that required for the zzso transcript, are required to produce a 50% decrease in zzso These results suggest that zzso of activity is relatively specific for the zzso regions of zzso zzso All measurable zzso of zzso activity by zzso is eliminated by addition of 100 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso At equivalent zzso zzso is less efficient than zzso as an zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso less effective in protecting against zzso of activity by the zzso zzso Other zzso that are not zzso zzso fail to protect zzso activity from zzso effects of zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the property of zzso zzso
