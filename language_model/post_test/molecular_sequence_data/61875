The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso into at least eight zzso by zzso refinement of zzso zzso An initial zzso of 323 proteins containing the zzso domain helped identify the zzso The zzso could be differentiated on the basis of the pattern of occurrence of seven defining zzso zzso association is also different between the zzso The zzso show zzso as well as zzso zzso suggestive of propagation by both zzso and horizontal transfer zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso led to the identification of common structural and sequence motifs in the zzso family with the other three families under the zzso zzso zzso
