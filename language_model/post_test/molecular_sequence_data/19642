zzso is an autonomous zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it maintains zzso zzso To investigate zzso zzso and cellular properties, we show that zzso zzso is expressed widely in mouse zzso and human cell zzso zzso zzso human zzso is predominantly expressed as a zzso protein (not 26 zzso as previously zzso which is likely zzso by longer zzso zzso and/or zzso that possess similar capacity for zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the three functional activities of zzso are zzso yet zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso important for zzso significantly zzso both DNA binding and zzso activity, while zzso of zzso acids (except zzso in the DNA binding and zzso zzso affects their corresponding zzso Interestingly, however, zzso domain zzso do not impact zzso activity, while zzso domain zzso diminish DNA zzso To understand zzso cellular properties, we find zzso zzso is down regulated during zzso and nuclear zzso displays a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reduces cell zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso plays an important function during DNA metabolism and cellular zzso
