The development of methods that can predict the zzso biological activity based only on the zzso structure of zzso proteins has become a goal of major zzso This work is dedicated to the zzso terminal zzso and zzso zzso motifs that participate in the DNA zzso and have zzso zzso We have calculated zzso for the first time, the zzso zzso spectral moments for 415 different zzso including 133 potential zzso zzso zzso Using these parameters as input for Linear zzso zzso we have found a model that discriminates between zzso zzso proteins and zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso out of 415 of proteins including both training and external validation zzso Finally, the model has predicted for the first time the DNA zzso function of proteins from the pathogen zzso We have predicted possible zzso proteins with a probability higher than zzso in nine zzso families such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso The distribution by biological function of the zzso proteins predicted has been the zzso zzso zzso signaling proteins zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso proteins zzso metal zzso zzso translation proteins zzso zzso zzso structural proteins zzso and zzso zzso The model is implemented at zzso
