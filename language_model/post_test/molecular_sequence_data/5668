In many organisms, the replication of DNA requires the binding of a protein called the zzso to DNA sites referred to as origins of zzso zzso of multiple zzso proteins bound to their zzso origins have provided important insights into the mechanism by which DNA replication is zzso To extend this level of analysis to the study of zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the architecture of the zzso zzso origin recognition complex zzso bound to zzso origins of zzso zzso of DNA zzso important for zzso association indicated that zzso interacts zzso with one strand of the zzso origin of zzso DNA binding zzso using zzso complexes lacking one of the six zzso demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of zzso requires the coordinate action of five of the six zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that recognition of origin sequences is zzso primarily by two different groups of zzso zzso that make zzso contacts with two distinct regions of the zzso zzso of these findings for zzso function and the mechanism of initiation of zzso DNA replication are zzso
