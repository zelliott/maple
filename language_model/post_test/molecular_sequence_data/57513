zzso disease is an zzso zzso disorder of copper metabolism resulting in death in early zzso The gene has been mapped to band zzso based, in part, on a zzso zzso in a female with the disease, which was found to lie within 300 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso allowing the isolation of a zzso clone spanning the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso region were isolated and used to screen zzso zzso zzso clones were found which detect an 8 zzso transcript from normal individuals but show diminished or absent zzso in zzso disease zzso zzso sequence of the zzso shows a unique open reading frame containing putative metal binding motifs which have been found in heavy metal resistance genes in zzso This gene is a strong candidate for the zzso disease zzso
