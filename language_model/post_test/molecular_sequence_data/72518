zzso to the regulatory region of the zzso zzso resulting in overproduction of zzso zzso zzso were encountered frequently in a large collection of zzso zzso clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not seem to be important for zzso resistance, however, as most of these strains were already defective for zzso zzso the zzso required for zzso of zzso Transformation of the zzso reference strain, zzso tuberculosis zzso with plasmids bearing the zzso genes of zzso tuberculosis or zzso zzso did not result in a significant increase in the zzso Two highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were isolated in zzso and shown to produce no or little zzso activity and, in the case of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso as the result of an zzso regulatory zzso that was also found in some clinical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was studied zzso in three mouse models: fully zzso zzso and Black 6 mice, zzso major zzso complex class zzso mice with zzso low levels of zzso T cells and zzso mice producing no cellular immune zzso The results indicated that zzso tuberculosis strains producing zzso were considerably more virulent in zzso mice than the zzso zzso zzso but that loss of zzso was less important when zzso mice, unable to produce activated zzso were zzso Restoration of zzso was not seen in an zzso zzso tuberculosis strain that zzso zzso and this finding was confirmed by experiments performed with appropriate zzso zzso strains in guinea zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to act as a zzso factor in zzso infections or to play a direct role in zzso resistance, although it may be important in maintaining zzso zzso of the zzso when zzso activity is low or zzso
