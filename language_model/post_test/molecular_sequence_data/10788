We have investigated the role of a putative zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso A zzso containing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and an zzso against it zzso zzso G prevents the binding of zzso to zzso and also zzso zzso but not the formation of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it may prevent lateral but not zzso zzso zzso The zzso to zzso G shows little reaction with the zzso zzso network, zzso zzso or zzso of cultured cells, whereas it clearly zzso with zzso zzso These results suggest that this putative zzso site present in zzso could be involved in the lateral zzso interactions along the zzso zzso
