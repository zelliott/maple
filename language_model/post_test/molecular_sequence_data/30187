We describe two truncated forms of zzso zzso and present evidence suggesting that both forms are zzso derived from the intact zzso zzso The first is a zzso zzso of zzso displaying an apparent molecular weight of 78 zzso This zzso containing the zzso portion of the zzso may be generated in cultured chicken lens cells, either by a short treatment with zzso or by zzso zzso during incubation in low zzso zzso zzso labeling of normal and zzso cells indicated that the zzso zzso is zzso distributed over the cell zzso Moreover, zzso of developing chick zzso with pairs of zzso which distinguish the zzso zzso from intact zzso indicated that, at early stages of zzso zzso in developing zzso a truncated zzso of the zzso is zzso The second truncated form of zzso is a zzso zzso which is zzso released by cultured lens cells into the culture medium in the presence of normal zzso We present evidence that the zzso zzso is zzso derived from zzso by the action of an zzso zzso We discuss possible mechanisms leading to the formation of these two truncated derivatives and their possible involvement in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
