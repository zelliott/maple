zzso zzso zzso zzso from the moderate zzso zzso zzso is a type 2 zzso H but shows poor zzso acid sequence identity with another type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso It is composed of 310 zzso acid zzso and acts as a zzso zzso zzso has a large zzso extension with unknown function and a unique zzso motif zzso both of which are characteristics common to zzso zzso To understand the role of these zzso extension and zzso zzso the crystal structure of zzso zzso was determined in both zzso and zzso forms at zzso zzso zzso According to these structures, zzso zzso consists of the zzso domain and zzso zzso H zzso The structures of the N and zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso binding proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso zzso were very similar to those of other type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso Single zzso and zzso zzso were coordinated with zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso studies indicated that the replacement of either one of these zzso with Ala resulted in a great reduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and characterization of the zzso zzso derivatives with N and/or zzso zzso indicated that the zzso domain and zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso but the former contributes to zzso binding more greatly than the zzso
