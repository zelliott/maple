The class I zzso zzso zzso which include zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be required for zzso gene expression during T and B zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso proteins function to regulate zzso zzso possibly by allowing access of variable region segments to the zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso and zzso however, are largely zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso zzso present in the zzso class I zzso proteins as well as in a zzso zzso protein that is essential for zzso We provide both genetic and zzso evidence that the highly zzso zzso motif stimulates zzso by direct recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
