We report on the zzso sequences of zzso of the zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso zzso a common weed in zzso For decades, the mosaic frequently associated with zzso plants was considered to be caused by a Brazilian strain of zzso mosaic virus zzso By infection studies and sequence zzso we demonstrate that it is associated with a complex of at least two zzso as different from zzso as most South American zzso Two molecules of DNA A zzso zzso and three of DNA B zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso According to the high zzso in their common regions, DNA A1 and DNA zzso as well as DNA zzso and DNA zzso are zzso components of two zzso which were infectious in zzso zzso zzso No zzso was found for any other zzso zzso The zzso region of DNA B2 appears to be the product of the zzso between DNA B1 and DNA zzso These results show that a zzso of zzso can persist over decades, producing a zzso of partially zzso but distinct zzso
