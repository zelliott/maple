The zzso gene encodes a DNA zzso which plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso repair, mismatch repair and DNA zzso A zzso zzso DNA library for zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed, and this was screened by Southern zzso using a zzso zzso amplified by zzso as the zzso The zzso sequence of cloned zzso zzso was then zzso zzso zzso zzso made up of seven zzso were all zzso in the zzso acid zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed zzso zzso with that of zzso coli zzso In the zzso composition of zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso Met and zzso zzso was zzso and the number of Pro zzso was zzso The distribution of Pro zzso and recent data on X-ray zzso structure suggested the importance of the structural dynamics of the zzso These changes are thought to stabilize the native protein zzso against heat zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sensitivity of a zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso whose function is common to zzso zzso
