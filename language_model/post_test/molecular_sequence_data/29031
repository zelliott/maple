The zzso domain is a zzso zzso sequence motif found in zzso 60 zzso zzso including the zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso These proteins often contain other zzso zzso A zzso zzso domain from mouse zzso zzso acids zzso has been structurally characterized at zzso A zzso The zzso half of this domain resembles a zzso zzso structure, whereas the zzso half contains a zzso zzso The two halves are packed against each other to form a single structural module that exhibits a prominent positive zzso zzso The zzso domain alone binds DNA in zzso probably through its basic zzso We also show that zzso zzso protein (a zzso zzso of zzso and two zzso deletion zzso zzso and zzso have approximately equal zzso transfer activity on zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which includes the zzso domain, binds DNA more strongly than zzso which lacks the zzso zzso
