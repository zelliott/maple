zzso of zzso tandem repeat sequences has been reported to play a major role in the zzso zzso of familial colon cancer, as well as a potential role in the zzso of other sporadic zzso To determine the frequency of short tandem repeat instability in zzso of the zzso we studied 40 tumors that were zzso according to tumor zzso The tissue samples were screened with zzso zzso and zzso markers spanning a wide range of zzso zzso including an zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso instability was observed overall in only one of the 40 zzso prostate zzso zzso This replication zzso tumor demonstrated repeat length zzso at two zzso Five other tumors showed an zzso in zzso size at a single zzso These tumors were not considered to have the zzso instability zzso All changes were identified either within zzso sequences or within the zzso zzso gene repeat (4 or 20 total markers zzso Both repeat length expansions and zzso were zzso The replication zzso case also included separate zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso analysis of the zzso tumor tissue revealed zzso patterns identical with the normal tissue zzso Our data indicate that zzso instability is rare in prostate zzso zzso observation of this low replication error frequency suggests that most prostate zzso develop in the absence of widespread zzso of zzso zzso in short tandem repeat zzso Additionally, these genetic zzso appear to occur more often in zzso repeat sequences as well as in an zzso zzso gene zzso zzso
