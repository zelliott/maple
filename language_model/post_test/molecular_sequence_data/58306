zzso zzso zzso based mainly on zzso zzso show that three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso emerge consistently at the base of the zzso tree before groups having zzso This suggests that these groups could have zzso before the zzso zzso Nevertheless, since all these organisms live in zzso zzso the absence of zzso might be due to secondary loss, as demonstrated for the later emerging zzso zzso zzso We have now isolated from zzso zzso a gene zzso a zzso protein zzso that in other lineages is addressed to the zzso zzso The zzso reconstruction zzso located this zzso within a large set of zzso zzso itself a zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso protein exhibits the zzso sequence signature, so far exclusively found in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso could have occurred earlier than previously zzso The zzso double zzso zzso the zzso could have evolved from zzso
