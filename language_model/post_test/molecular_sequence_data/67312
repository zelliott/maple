zzso of discrete brain regions for molecular analysis is complicated by zzso between zzso flexibility, and zzso We developed a flexible and cost-effective method, in zzso zzso zzso guided zzso assisted zzso zzso for zzso zzso quantities of DNA from zzso sections as thin as 12 zzso Using zzso to zzso regions of interest, tissue is targeted by applying a small zzso of zzso embedding zzso onto zzso zzso and collecting the beads for zzso acid zzso The method zzso recovers zzso and DNA usable for zzso and DNA zzso zzso
