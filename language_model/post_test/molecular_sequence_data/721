zzso zzso 2 zzso belongs to a family of zzso involved in the zzso maturation of zzso precursors into mature peptides that act as zzso zzso or zzso Here we show that a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed during zzso development and in the adult zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits high sequence identity to other zzso zzso and thus is likely to function in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression indicates that it is activated early in nervous system zzso During zzso and early zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the vicinity of the forming zzso of the central nervous system and parts of the putative peripheral nervous zzso Later in zzso development, at the time the zzso becomes competent to interact with the external environment and initiate zzso zzso expression largely restricts to cells of the major zzso and their zzso zzso of zzso larvae by zzso approaches suggests the expression of a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of juvenile zzso cerebral zzso zzso reveals an abundance of zzso including zzso peptides and zzso compatible with zzso functioning in zzso processing in these zzso These results are consistent with zzso regulating zzso generation in the earliest functioning of the zzso nervous zzso
