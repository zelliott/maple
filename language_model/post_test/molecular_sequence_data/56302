We determined whether proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso are expressed on the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso or zzso proteins were prepared using the corresponding fusion proteins with zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso was specifically zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was specific for zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso with most human zzso and some zzso cell lines in flow zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was zzso with only a limited number of cell zzso Based upon the surface expression of zzso zzso cells were classified as zzso zzso or zzso No cell lines with zzso were found among those zzso The specificity of flow zzso analysis was confirmed in the zzso myeloma line zzso zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso only to zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis identified zzso and zzso proteins with zzso zzso or zzso respectively, in cellular extracts of zzso labeled zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso The presence of zzso zzso on the cell surface indicates an zzso role for these proteins in addition to their reported zzso zzso
