Four new and specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonists, containing the zzso of zzso or zzso analogue zzso at position 6, were studied for their effects on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso release in zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected into the lateral brain zzso just preceding zzso administration of zzso to evaluate its zzso effect on zzso serum growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso demonstrated significant zzso zzso zzso zzso activities on zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso (10 zzso immediately before zzso (1 zzso completely prevented the zzso serum zzso zzso These results indicate that 1) marked differences exist in the ability of these zzso to antagonize zzso zzso or zzso release, suggesting the existence of different zzso zzso zzso and 2) the central effect of zzso on zzso release from the zzso is probably zzso through specific zzso zzso
