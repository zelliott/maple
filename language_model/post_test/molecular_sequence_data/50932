In the present work, we employ a combination of CD zzso and gel zzso technique to characterize zzso the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a 17 base pair operator zzso We have found that three minor zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso compete effectively with the zzso for binding to the operator zzso Among these zzso zzso binds zzso to DNA in the minor groove at the zzso of zzso whereas zzso A and zzso interact zzso with runs of AT base pairs and avoid DNA regions containing zzso bases in the two zzso zzso Only subtle DNA zzso changes are known to take place upon binding of these zzso Both the CD spectral profiles and the results of the gel zzso experiments indicate that zzso A and zzso can zzso zzso zzso from the operator zzso The binding of zzso zzso to the zzso is accompanied by considerable changes in CD in the zzso region which appear to be attributed to a zzso structural transition in the zzso zzso changes are also induced in the wavelength region of zzso zzso The CD spectral profile of the zzso mixture in the presence of zzso A can be represented as a sum of the CD spectrum of the zzso complex and spectrum of zzso complex at the appropriate zzso ratio of the bound zzso to the operator DNA zzso When r tends to the zzso level of binding the CD spectrum in the region of zzso zzso approaches a CD pattern typical of complexes of the zzso with the free DNA zzso This suggests that simultaneous binding of zzso zzso and zzso A to the same DNA zzso is not possible and that zzso A and zzso can be used to determine the equilibrium affinity constant of zzso zzso to the synthetic operator from zzso zzso The binding constant of zzso zzso to the zzso is found to be (6 zzso zzso at 20 degrees C in 10 zzso sodium zzso buffer zzso zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso
