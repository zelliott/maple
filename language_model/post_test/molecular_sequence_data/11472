The zzso of quantitative image zzso assessment of zzso gel separated zzso products was tested in a zzso core facility image analysis unit serving several research zzso zzso type use of the zzso showed considerable variation zzso of individuals zzso zzso about zzso ratio zzso zzso about zzso zzso concentration on the methodology improved the result zzso about zzso and zzso zzso Focusing into the methodology clearly showed that the baseline correction was zzso The zzso of the image and the zzso of the measurement window were important variation zzso If these were kept constant, the zzso improved remarkably zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Further analysis showed that the results did not change during the warm up period of the zzso zzso based on integrated optical density or related variables were well zzso but did not show linear relation with peak height zzso The most zzso results were achieved when the thresholds were placed at the point of 45 degrees inclination of the image density curve of the band, or at the half height points of the zzso
