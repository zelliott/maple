A zzso zzso zzso interaction column has been used for the separation of zzso zzso zzso zzso released from naturally occurring and zzso zzso zzso structure identification of the zzso zzso derivatives was carried out by zzso using zzso and mass zzso zzso In some cases, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was applied to confirm zzso zzso This strategy is considerably more rapid than methods normally used in zzso analysis, which involves manual collection of separated zzso derivatives and analysis of individual zzso by mass zzso
