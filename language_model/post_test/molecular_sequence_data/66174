zzso zzso is the zzso zzso agent responsible for the chestnut blight zzso We report the generation of zzso expressed sequence tags representing zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso revealed different gene expression patterns for zzso and zzso cultures at the zzso stage and allowed the reconstruction of key zzso zzso signal zzso pathways zzso in the zzso A list of zzso genes implicated in zzso zzso and virus replication in other zzso were also zzso A large-scale gene comparison indicated that zzso zzso is most closely related to the plant pathogen zzso zzso but more closely related to the zzso zzso zzso than to the rice pathogen zzso zzso This zzso information lays a new and solid ground for further investigation of both the biology of the fungus and interaction between a zzso and the host zzso
