The human zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso zzso protein and the zzso properties of its zzso activity were zzso Likewise, a zzso zzso lacking intrinsic zzso activity was constructed by zzso zzso zzso to zzso and expressed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso fusion protein showed a pH optimum of 7 to zzso and optimal activity was observed at either 10 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso were zzso as was the addition of zzso to the zzso Previous work by this laboratory zzso several proteins and peptides showed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso to be efficiently zzso by zzso zzso zzso Here we examine the zzso sequence specificity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of different synthetic zzso zzso showed zzso to have a strong zzso preference for the zzso zzso with an almost zzso higher specificity constant zzso over that of the zzso zzso zzso The presence of basic zzso acid zzso on the zzso terminal side of the target zzso was shown to be essential for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of calf zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso resulted in fragments containing sequences similar to that of the preferred synthetic zzso zzso shown zzso zzso under zzso in zzso conditions, the zzso recognition sequence for zzso zzso is zzso where zzso is likely neither a basic nor a large zzso zzso
