The molecular zzso are essential proteins involved in protein zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso While there is abundant structural information about the machinery and the zzso details of its action are well zzso it is yet unresolved how zzso recognize a large number of structurally unrelated zzso in their unfolded or partially folded zzso To determine the nature of zzso recognition, we have characterized by zzso methods the interactions of zzso with synthetic peptides that mimic segments of unfolded zzso In previous work, we found using transferred nuclear zzso effect zzso analysis that two 13 zzso acid peptides bound zzso in an zzso zzso zzso By extending the study to a variety of peptides with differing sequence zzso we have observed that peptides can adopt zzso other than zzso when bound to zzso Furthermore, peptides of the same composition exhibited significantly different affinities for zzso as zzso by the magnitude of zzso zzso to zzso zzso well with the ability of the zzso to cluster zzso zzso on one face of the zzso as determined by the retention time on zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the molecular basis of zzso recognition is the presentation of a zzso surface by an incompletely folded zzso and that many backbone zzso can be zzso
