zzso 4 is a zzso zzso employed as a functional mimic of lung zzso protein B, which successfully lowers surface tension in the zzso A zzso understanding of how zzso 4 affects zzso properties has proven elusive as the secondary structure of zzso 4 in zzso preparations has not been determined at high zzso The sequence of zzso 4 is based on the zzso of zzso a naturally occurring zzso protein that binds to zzso zzso The spacing of the zzso zzso in zzso 4 zzso the formation of a zzso zzso zzso qualitative zzso using zzso CD, and zzso zzso have given conflicting results as to the secondary structure of the zzso as well as its orientation in the zzso zzso Here, we present a structural model of zzso 4 bound to zzso zzso based on solid state zzso zzso zzso correlation experiments employing zzso peptides were used to zzso determine the backbone zzso angles in zzso 4 at several zzso These zzso coupled with CD experiments, verify the zzso nature of zzso 4 when bound to zzso with zzso zzso angles that differ substantially from common values for zzso of zzso zzso The average zzso angles found for zzso 4 bound to zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso this zzso from ideal zzso structure allows zzso 4 to form an zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
