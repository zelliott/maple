A zzso approach identified a putative integral membrane zzso zzso in zzso zzso with 13 predicted zzso zzso and a zzso motif zzso features that are common to the zzso C zzso of zzso The deletion of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a viable zzso Further zzso linkage analyses of the zzso complex revealed a reduction of terminal zzso zzso and, as a result, a corresponding loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was fully restored upon the zzso of the deletion zzso by zzso As a result, we have now termed this previously zzso open reading frame, zzso A zzso Furthermore, an analysis of zzso zzso lipids from zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso a putative zzso for the zzso cell wall zzso
