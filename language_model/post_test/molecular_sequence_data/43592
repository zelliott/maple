The zzso zzso protein and its zzso counterparts, the zzso zzso have been proposed to function in zzso target zzso Here we show that zzso function is required for the zzso phase of zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso that change the affinity of a small zzso element for zzso protein result in corresponding changes in the zzso embryonic zzso Our data suggest that the zzso and zzso proteins directly activate this element in zzso cells without zzso binding to a specialized zzso binding zzso Based on the types of zzso transformations and changes in gene expression observed in zzso zzso zzso we propose a new model for zzso action in which these proteins are required for zzso protein zzso zzso functions, but zzso for zzso zzso repression zzso Although the selection of a specific target gene by a zzso protein versus another may be explained in some cases by the selective zzso of zzso binding specificity by zzso we favor the idea that zzso interacts in a more general sense with most zzso proteins to switch them into a state where they are capable of zzso zzso
