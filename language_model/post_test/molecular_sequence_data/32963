The minor zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso zzso It can be used as a target for graft versus zzso reactions to eliminate residual zzso expressing zzso cells in patients following zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso primed donor cells can be transferred into a patient via adoptive zzso However, thus far only synthetic peptides corresponding to a zzso zzso restricted zzso zzso have been used to generate zzso specific T zzso We are the first laboratory to zzso express and purify a region of zzso using an zzso coli expression zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso under zzso conditions and the affinity zzso tag removed using zzso to remove zzso zzso zzso The 92 zzso acid zzso protein was zzso by mass zzso Our rationale is that by using a zzso zzso protein rather than zzso zzso specific T cells may be generated from presentation of multiple zzso zzso zzso in different zzso zzso A zzso approach may have wider zzso and maybe more effective at zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein may also be used as a research tool to identify novel zzso helper T cell and zzso zzso T cell zzso
