zzso exchange behavior of human zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso has been determined by protein zzso combined with zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso After a specified period of zzso exchange in solution, zzso zzso was zzso by zzso under slow exchange conditions zzso zzso 0 degree zzso and then subjected to zzso zzso for zzso analysis of each zzso zzso The hydrogen exchange rate of each individual zzso hydrogen was then determined independently by zzso two-dimensional zzso on zzso zzso zzso A maximum zzso method zzso zzso makes it possible to derive the zzso of hydrogen exchange rate zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso in either the zzso or its zzso zzso The zzso rate constant zzso of zzso zzso and different segments of zzso zzso are compared to the rate zzso determined by zzso for individual zzso zzso The rate constant zzso determined by both methods are consistent and zzso thereby zzso protein zzso zzso as a reliable measure of hydrogen exchange in zzso
