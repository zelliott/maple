Six zzso zzso zzso from zzso isolated from the spotted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized and zzso for zzso The expression levels of these zzso were determined in the zzso zzso and fat body by real-time zzso and the resulting patterns are in line with results from published studies on other zzso sex zzso zzso The zzso were found to zzso to six zzso Using both zzso and zzso zzso four of these were found to belong to previously characterized zzso functional groups zzso Delta zzso the Delta 9 zzso and the Delta 9 zzso zzso A zzso highly expressed in the zzso zzso was a novel E11 zzso that was specific to zzso precursor zzso The fifth gene zzso was found to display a novel zzso activity indicating that it belongs to a new Delta 9 functional group, whereas the sixth gene was determined to be zzso with respect to zzso zzso In accordance with previous studies, we find that zzso of the Delta zzso and Delta 14 groups, which are the fastest evolving zzso and possess the novel zzso zzso function, are expressed primarily in the zzso zzso whereas all other zzso which do not possess the novel zzso function, evolve more slowly and display the ancestral zzso function and pattern of gene zzso
