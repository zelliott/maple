In the zzso zzso zzso expression of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is controlled by zzso light and darkness and the A mating type zzso In this study, we analyzed the promoter of the zzso gene by measuring transcript levels by quantitative real-time zzso and show that regulation of zzso expression occurs at the zzso zzso A minimal promoter sufficient to zzso regulated expression of a zzso reporter gene and zzso zzso base pairs from the start zzso was zzso On the minimal promoter we identified a 120 zzso sequence zzso induction of the zzso gene in constant zzso Along with direct repeats zzso the sequence contains a zzso consensus site zzso element, zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso zzso No specific elements responsible for light repression and mating type regulation were found in the zzso
