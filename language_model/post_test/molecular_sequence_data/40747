zzso zzso internally transcribed zzso zzso sequences from 53 zzso strains were zzso and sized from zzso chain reaction amplification products and compiled with 14 selected zzso ITS sequences from public zzso zzso zzso included two to three ITS copies lacking length zzso except for nine zzso No zzso gene was encountered in this zzso zzso strains exhibited various lengths zzso to zzso and a wide range of sequence similarity zzso in the ITS zzso The average zzso distance varied from zzso zzso 1 and 2) to zzso zzso 3 and 4) and was zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for cluster 4 zzso zzso clusters 1 and 3 zzso zzso and cluster 2 zzso zzso This suggests a gradual erosion of zzso diversity zzso with a shift from zzso zzso to zzso and symbiotic zzso Comparative sequence analyses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region of zzso strains are not useful to assign them to their respective cluster or host infection zzso zzso assignment required the inclusion of the adjacent zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
