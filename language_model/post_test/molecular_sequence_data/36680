The ability to engineer the zzso zzso has now progressed to the stage where one can realistically zzso creating a zzso useful targeting zzso zzso a zzso minimal zzso combining site together with a domain that zzso a second zzso It will certainly be possible in the near future to adjust the fine specificity and affinity of the zzso domain, either by in zzso selection methods or by zzso zzso based on structural zzso The functional domain could be an zzso a zzso or any other protein that suits a pharmacological zzso In this review I have illustrated these directions primarily by zzso work from my laboratory and those of my zzso The review covers single point zzso in the heavy chains of zzso zzso that either zzso diminish or zzso enhance recognition of a small feature of the zzso the position 12 OH zzso in the steroid zzso The principles for constructing a zzso zzso zzso domain based on one of the zzso zzso are also zzso as are the principles for incorporating such zzso into fusion zzso Finally, as a practical application of zzso zzso the construction and evaluation of an zzso zzso zzso fusion protein is zzso This protein has enhanced potency and specificity both in zzso and in zzso and it offers the promise of increased therapeutic efficacy as well as diminished zzso
