The nature of zzso class zzso zzso not only determines the specificity of T cell responses, but may also alter zzso cell zzso zzso zzso T cells have been observed primarily in zzso responses, but very little is known about the conditions under which they can be zzso Their potential as regulators of immune responses, however, deserves zzso We describe here that inclusion of a zzso zzso motif within zzso zzso of class zzso zzso results, both in zzso and in zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells through increased zzso zzso We show that both zzso and polarized zzso T cells, including zzso cells, can be converted by zzso recognition of such modified zzso zzso zzso T cells induce zzso on zzso by zzso zzso These findings potentially open the way towards a novel form of zzso zzso
