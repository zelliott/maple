Certain protein families are highly zzso across zzso related organisms and belong to large and functionally diverse zzso The patterns of conservation present in these protein sequences presumably are due to selective constraints maintaining important but unknown structural mechanisms with some constraints specific to each family and others shared by a larger subset or by the entire zzso To exploit these patterns as a source of functional information, we recently devised a statistically based approach called contrast zzso alignment and interaction network zzso analysis, which zzso the strengths of various categories of selective constraints from zzso patterns in a multiple zzso The power of this approach strongly depends on the quality of the multiple zzso which thus motivated development of theoretical concepts and strategies to improve alignment of zzso motifs within large sets of zzso related zzso 

Here we describe a hidden zzso model zzso an zzso system, and zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso sampling strategies for alignment of multiple sequence zzso The zzso sampling strategies are useful both for alignment zzso and for adjusting position specific background zzso acid zzso for alignment zzso Associated statistical zzso provide an objective measure of alignment quality as well as automatic gap penalty zzso zzso alignments obtained in this way are compared with zzso based alignments within the context of zzso analysis of three protein families: zzso zzso zzso zzso and transitional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

While not entirely replacing zzso based zzso which likewise may be zzso for zzso analysis using this approach, these zzso methods often more accurately align very zzso related sequences and thus can provide a better measure of selective zzso In some instances, these new approaches also provide a better understanding of zzso constraints, as we illustrate for zzso zzso Programs implementing these procedures and supplementary information are available from the zzso
