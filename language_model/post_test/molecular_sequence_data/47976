A zzso zzso zzso coding for a full length zzso zzso zzso protein was obtained by zzso screening of an adult zzso zzso library using zzso taken from mice vaccinated with zzso zzso which are capable of transferring high levels of passive immunity to this zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence consists of 254 zzso acids and is highly zzso with zzso family of proteins from a variety of species zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed and zzso in zzso coli, and in Western zzso was strongly zzso by zzso from mice, rats and zzso vaccinated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso showed that zzso is expressed in zzso and adult zzso but not in zzso however mouse zzso against zzso zzso a 29 zzso native zzso in zzso preparations made from eggs, zzso zzso and adult worms of zzso zzso indicating that this zzso is present in all zzso zzso The presence of the native zzso in zzso extracts of intact zzso suggests that it is also present in the zzso zzso which is the most vulnerable target for immune zzso However, zzso against zzso did not zzso a similar band in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso indicating that, like the zzso vaccines, this protein induced zzso immune zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that there may exist more than one gene copy and/or zzso for zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the native zzso is present throughout the body of adult worms including the zzso but is less abundant in the zzso The potential of zzso as a vaccine is now under further zzso
