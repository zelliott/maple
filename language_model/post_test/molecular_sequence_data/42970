The zzso of the zebra zzso zzso zzso is the key element of its adhesive zzso It consists of a bundle of threads tipped by adhesive plaques and attached to the zzso at the base of its zzso organ, the zzso Two zzso protein precursors of the zzso have been zzso from the zzso These zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso foot zzso with apparent zzso values of 76 and 26 K, respectively, contain zzso zzso integrated into their primary zzso but differ from previously characterized zzso proteins from marine zzso The related zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso proteins with significantly different zzso The zebra zzso zzso proteins are zzso repetitive with unique zzso motif zzso contain zzso and are zzso primarily on zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso detected after zzso zzso constitutes a zzso family of zzso with, zzso an zzso range of zzso values between zzso and zzso The detection of zzso in the thread and in the juncture between thread and plaque suggests that these two proteins are localized in those regions where they may function as zzso or structural zzso
