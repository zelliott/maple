zzso of zzso genes is important for triggering spore differentiation inside zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis suggested that zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso at the zzso zzso which is adjacent to zzso zzso regularly zzso short zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from developing zzso zzso confirmed that zzso and zzso genes are zzso with a short upstream gene and at least two repeats of the downstream zzso forming the zzso zzso The zzso is subject to strong, negative zzso during development by zzso The zzso promoter was zzso Its zzso and zzso regions resemble those recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso coli zzso but the zzso may be too long (20 zzso there is very little expression during zzso zzso during development relies on at least two positive regulatory elements located in the coding region of the next gene zzso At least two positive regulatory elements and one negative element lie downstream of the zzso promoter, such that the region controlling zzso expression spans more than 1 zzso The results of testing different fragments for zzso promoter activity in zzso and zzso zzso backgrounds strongly suggest that upstream and downstream regulatory elements interact zzso zzso the zzso sequence between the two zzso repeats that, minimally, are zzso with zzso and zzso genes exactly matches a sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a form of the zzso needed for zzso of zzso zzso
