In this chapter we have described one of the more complex zzso factors, zzso The zzso zzso gene is almost 21 zzso in length and is arranged into 10 zzso and 9 zzso zzso of the gene at the zzso level is heterogeneous, and several species of zzso zzso have been found in human and zzso cells and zzso In human cells the different zzso arise from alternative zzso of the nuclear zzso precursor in both coding and zzso zzso This results in zzso zzso two distinct zzso zzso 256 and zzso zzso acids in zzso In zzso cells only a zzso form has been found thus zzso All forms of zzso have a zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso region near the zzso which resembles a zzso zzso A large portion of the zzso end, including the zzso region, is not found in the mature zzso Thus, the primary translation product of zzso is a zzso with processing occurring at both zzso and zzso zzso The exact size of the mature protein is still somewhat in doubt, but deletion zzso from the zzso end indicates that the protein may be as small as 150 zzso acids and still be zzso zzso zzso has also shown that the first seven zzso in the mature zzso are probably necessary for biological activity, whereas the next two zzso zzso are zzso In spite of the heavy zzso found in the native zzso removal of the zzso zzso signals does not seem to affect activity to any great zzso The zzso gene and its zzso zzso are tightly linked on the long arm of zzso 5, a unique finding in the zzso zzso This region also contains the genes for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso A similar situation may exist on zzso 11 of the zzso The close linkage of these factors and receptors is the probable cause for the disorders of zzso that arise when deletions occur in this zzso The preceding discussion has shown how quickly the area of zzso molecular biology has advanced in the past 2-3 zzso A great deal of effort is now being directed toward expressing zzso at high levels in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
