zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso with unknown function, consisting of a zzso zzso zzso core and the zzso zzso The characteristic structural feature of zzso is the presence of multiple so called zzso repeats which are in part identical and in part exhibit slight sequence zzso The assembly of zzso and LDL, which is zzso for plasma zzso levels, takes place zzso and requires specific structural motifs in zzso and zzso Here we studied the structural features in zzso necessary for zzso zzso Thirteen zzso zzso zzso which differed in the set of zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells and incubated with zzso The rate of total and zzso zzso complex formation was measured by an zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso yielded almost zzso total and zzso stable complexes, zzso zzso or replacement of the different zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the high-yield assembly and that zzso zzso had an amplifying zzso zzso the absolute number of zzso repeats had an additional amplifying zzso The rate of zzso assembly correlated strongly with the affinity of these zzso to zzso Our results have implications for understanding the metabolism of zzso and may help to design strategies for searching natural zzso zzso with zzso plasma zzso zzso
