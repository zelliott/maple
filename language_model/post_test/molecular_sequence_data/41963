The zzso surface zzso of the human malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intrinsic to successful zzso zzso In the zzso clone of zzso zzso the zzso responsible has been zzso as a zzso zzso activity, sensitive to irreversible zzso of zzso zzso Here we extend these studies and show that secondary processing activity in intact zzso of zzso zzso strains expressing the alternative zzso type of zzso surface zzso has identical zzso and that the zzso site is close to or identical to that in the protein from zzso The zzso responsible is shown to be zzso and able to zzso processing of native zzso only when present in the same zzso zzso of the zzso follows apparent first order zzso for at least 2 zzso It is concluded that secondary processing of both zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso surface zzso is a zzso event, zzso by a mechanistically zzso zzso located on the zzso zzso These observations provide clues to the identity of the zzso and show that, irrespective of the zzso type, secondary processing results in the same, highly zzso region of the zzso surface zzso remaining on the surface of the invading zzso
