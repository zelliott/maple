zzso of the first zinc finger from human zzso hormone zzso zzso with zzso duplex zzso from zzso regulatory element has been studied by molecular mechanics simulation zzso The structure of the finger as well as its complex with DNA is zzso using zzso of zzso coordination of the zinc zzso to zzso zzso The finger is stabilized by series of zzso (5 in zzso 2 in side chains and 2 between backbone and side zzso The complex is stabilized by zzso between side chains of zzso 11, His 12, zzso 13 and zzso 14 with zzso zzso and zzso DNA is in B zzso zzso network within DNA is zzso zzso strand zzso and zzso distances are changed zzso There is a systematic change in the backbone zzso angles and sugar zzso Also, there is an evidence of zzso zzso change in zzso
