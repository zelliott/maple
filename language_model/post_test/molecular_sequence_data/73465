An zzso zzso zzso hybrid in the zzso zzso complex is essential for keeping the zzso 3' zzso engaged with the active site of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso of the hybrid leads to detachment of the transcript zzso zzso zzso and shifting of the hybrid zzso Eventually, the exposed 3' segment of zzso can be removed through transcript zzso At certain sites, cycles of zzso of the hybrid are coupled to zzso sliding of the zzso zzso zzso This explains apparent zzso zzso which was previously interpreted as contraction and expansion of an zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso hybrid plays the dual role of keeping the active site in register with the template and sensing the zzso zzso in zzso launching correction through backtracking and zzso
