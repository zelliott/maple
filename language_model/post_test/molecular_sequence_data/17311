zzso proteins zzso are known to transport zzso such as zzso in addition to zzso zzso Although zzso transport by zzso is clearly involved in zzso the mechanism of its zzso transport is not clearly zzso In this study, we examined the zzso channel characteristics of the six individual zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso The second TM domain zzso zzso forms zzso channels by zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso exhibited zzso zzso channels with properties comparable to those of zzso zzso zzso However, the other five TM peptides did not form zzso zzso Moreover, an analog of zzso in which two zzso zzso were zzso by Ala zzso did not form stable channels, zzso the significance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso channel structure of zzso protein is zzso and the second TM domain is essential for the zzso of this zzso zzso
