An zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso region of the mouse vascular smooth muscle zzso gene serves as a binding site for multiple proteins with specific affinity for either zzso or zzso zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that zzso zzso proteins are responsible for preventing a cryptic zzso zzso centered within this element from cooperating with a nearby serum response zzso zzso motif to zzso the minimal promoter in zzso and smooth muscle zzso DNA binding studies revealed that the core zzso sequence mediates binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso element while zzso zzso account for interaction of zzso alpha and zzso beta with the zzso strand and zzso with the complementary zzso zzso zzso that selectively impaired high affinity zzso DNA binding by zzso or smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso released the cryptic zzso zzso from repression in zzso zzso Additional experiments indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also interact specifically, albeit zzso with zzso DNA and with zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with two plausible models of cryptic zzso zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involving either competitive zzso DNA binding or masking of zzso zzso zzso zzso
