In many animal species, zzso zzso associate with zzso zzso cells to form the embryonic zzso zzso that later develop into functional organ producing zzso To explore the genetic regulation of the zzso development, we initiated a comprehensive identification and functional analysis of the genes expressed within the zzso First, we generated a zzso library from zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso Using this library, we zzso the genes expressed in the zzso by zzso zzso A total of zzso high-quality zzso representing zzso genes were zzso corresponding to zzso of the predicted genes in the zzso The zzso zzso is unexpectedly distinct from that of adult zzso and includes an extremely high proportion of zzso zzso We verified 101 genes zzso expressed in the zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Within this zzso 39 and 58 genes were expressed predominantly in zzso and zzso cells, respectively, whereas four genes were expressed in the both cell zzso The zzso genes zzso a variety of predicted zzso However, genes implicated in zzso and protein translation, including zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in the germ line, whereas the expression of various zzso and zzso genes are more prominent in the zzso zzso These zzso data are a resource for understanding the mechanism of various cellular events during zzso zzso
