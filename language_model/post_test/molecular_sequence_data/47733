The zzso zzso zzso core of the zzso zzso zzso is thought to be part of a zzso zzso intermediate in the zzso of the envelope zzso into a zzso zzso In an effort to discover small organic zzso that block zzso zzso we have generated a biased zzso chemical library of zzso binding elements targeted to the zzso zzso From this library of zzso potential zzso we have identified elements that, when zzso attached to a zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso contribute to the formation of a stable complex with the inner core and to zzso of zzso cell zzso
