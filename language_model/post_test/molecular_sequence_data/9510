zzso zzso are biologically active natural zzso Many important pharmaceuticals are derived from aromatic zzso Especially important in aromatic zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso chain zzso by zzso zzso which serves as a key control point in aromatic ring zzso How different zzso promote different zzso patterns is not well zzso The zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of an aromatic zzso precursor to the gray spore zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares a high degree of similarity to another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This paper presents the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso and zzso structures of zzso and zzso zzso bound with zzso aromatic compounds that mimic the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize the interior pocket zzso of zzso zzso The results confirmed that the interior pocket of zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso A unified zzso zzso mechanism is proposed on the basis of these structural and functional zzso
