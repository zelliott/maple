A method for the production of plasmids giving different levels of expression of zzso growth hormone zzso zzso in zzso coli is zzso The zzso sequence coding for mature zzso was inserted into the multiple cloning site of zzso zzso and random deletions were then introduced 3' to the initiation zzso zzso producing zzso (with varying zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso of expression of zzso zzso measured by zzso or on zzso gels, varied from over zzso to less than zzso of total cell zzso The coding sequence of zzso zzso giving very high expression of zzso zzso was zzso
