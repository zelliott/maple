zzso type C disease zzso a zzso disorder characterized by zzso of zzso cholesterol and zzso in the zzso zzso system, is due to zzso on either the zzso or the zzso zzso We report the diagnosis of six unrelated patients with zzso all with zzso zzso We further attempted functional characterization of the zzso zzso and zzso + 2 zzso zzso under native zzso This was achieved by zzso and zzso zzso on cultured skin zzso and in zzso zzso zzso + 2 zzso led to multiple zzso with only zzso spliced zzso Among the three zzso zzso only zzso led to zzso amounts of an zzso zzso This protein showed a normal zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso the first naturally occurring zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso D domain, results in reduced amounts of a protein capable to reach the zzso but unable to efficiently bind zzso The patient had a juvenile neurological onset form of the zzso An update of the 22 families with zzso in the zzso zzso currently known to us, confirms the good zzso correlations seen in this zzso zzso of more naturally occurring zzso zzso may help to dissect further the functional zzso of the zzso
