The zzso zzso zzso gene has been cloned and zzso Whereas disruption of zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of which has been deduced to be zzso and to function as a zzso zzso leads to the absence of zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequence with three other zzso sequences indicated that there are not only two zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain, but also two more in the central highly zzso zzso The latter would be located toward the zzso of two of the eight zzso zzso predicted to compose the zzso central domain of zzso Both these zzso zzso plus other zzso zzso zzso notably zzso and zzso are also zzso in a group of membrane zzso related to zzso zzso zzso which lack the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso of zzso zzso and other organisms transfers reducing power from the zzso to the zzso through reduction and zzso of an zzso zzso bond, or other mechanism involving these zzso zzso and that this function can also be performed by zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The failure of zzso disruption to abolish zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso suggests that, in contrast to the situation in zzso coli, the absence of zzso can be compensated for by one or more other zzso for example a zzso protein acting in tandem with one or more zzso zzso
