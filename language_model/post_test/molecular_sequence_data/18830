The silk zzso stored in the silk zzso of the zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso is spun out and converted into the silk fiber with extremely high strength and high zzso Therefore it is important to determine the silk structure before spinning called zzso I at an atomic level to clarify the fiber formation zzso We proposed the repeated type II zzso structure as zzso I in the solid state with the model zzso zzso and several solid state zzso techniques zzso In this paper, the solution structure of native zzso zzso was determined with solution zzso especially for tandem repeated sequences with zzso zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso and zzso motifs in the zzso zzso silk zzso The assignment of the zzso zzso and zzso solution zzso zzso for the repetitive sequence motifs was zzso and the chemical shifts were zzso The program, zzso to predict the backbone zzso angles from the chemical shifts of proteins was applied to these motifs with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemical zzso The zzso best matches of zzso angles zzso zzso were well populated and mainly fell into the regions for typical type II zzso structures in the zzso zzso map for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso plots for motif zzso were scattered, indicating that the motif is in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cross zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso motifs were observed, supporting the repeated type II zzso zzso Thus, we could show the presence of the repeated type II zzso structure in zzso zzso
