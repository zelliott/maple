zzso zzso leukemia zzso virus zzso is a zzso that was originally identified from human prostate cancer patients and subsequently linked to chronic fatigue zzso Recent studies showed that zzso is a zzso mouse zzso zzso its association with human diseases has become zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso envelope zzso zzso infection is not blocked by zzso agents and cellular zzso zzso suggesting that zzso entry is not zzso The full length zzso zzso was unable to induce zzso formation and zzso fusion, even in cells zzso the viral zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso 21 or 33 zzso acid zzso in the zzso tail zzso of zzso zzso induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the zzso zzso cells but also in the zzso zzso cells that lack a functional zzso zzso The increased fusion activities of these zzso correlated with their enhanced zzso shedding into culture media, suggesting zzso changes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso further zzso of the CT of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain severely impaired the zzso zzso as well as dramatically decreased the zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in greatly reduced viral zzso zzso our studies reveal that zzso entry does not require a low pH or low zzso host zzso and that the zzso tail of zzso zzso critically zzso membrane fusion and cell zzso Our data also imply that additional cellular factors besides zzso are likely to be involved in zzso zzso
