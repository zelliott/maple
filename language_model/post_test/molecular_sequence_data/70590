The zzso envelope surrounding the zzso zzso egg is converted from an zzso to a zzso form during transit through the zzso zzso portion of the zzso zzso conversion involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso which selectively zzso envelope zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso and sequence analysis revealed that the zzso is translated as the N zzso of an unusual mosaic zzso In addition to the zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain with low identity to zzso was present, possessing an apparent zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were also present, which are related to the zzso zzso molecules implicated in zzso zzso zzso We propose that during zzso zzso processing of the mosaic zzso zzso the processed zzso zzso domain is released coupled to two zzso zzso zzso and constitutes the zzso active zzso zzso In functional studies, isolated zzso egg envelopes treated with zzso zzso from the zzso showed a dramatic increase in zzso zzso This observation established that zzso alone was the zzso factor responsible for converting the egg envelope to a zzso form, via an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on envelope zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso processing is the only requirement for envelope zzso
