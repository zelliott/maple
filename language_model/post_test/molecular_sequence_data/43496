zzso controls exist in zzso cells to ensure that cells do not enter zzso in the presence of DNA damage or zzso zzso In zzso zzso many of the checkpoint genes zzso to date are required for both the DNA damage and the replication zzso an exception being zzso zzso We report here on the characterization of nine new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which is defective in the DNA damage checkpoint but not the replication zzso We have cloned and zzso the corresponding zzso The predicted protein is most similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso having zzso similarity and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which we have named zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso on the basis of structural and zzso zzso also contains motifs present in zzso and zzso zzso of the gene is not lethal and results in a DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso analysis with other zzso checkpoint zzso indicates that zzso acts in a process involving the checkpoint zzso genes and that the zzso zzso is zzso very similar to zzso
