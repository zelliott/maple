zzso is a zzso membrane protein of unknown function resident in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes the zzso storage disorder zzso zzso zzso Defining the zzso of zzso and the structural zzso and motifs required for interaction with zzso and zzso proteins may allow insights into its zzso In this study we zzso the zzso zzso retention and zzso of zzso We demonstrated, by differential membrane zzso of zzso zzso cells using specific zzso and two distinct zzso that zzso contains an zzso zzso domain, seven zzso zzso and a zzso C zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso zzso showed that changes of potential zzso zzso signals in the zzso or zzso domain (a triple zzso zzso and a zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso of zzso The deletion of a zzso motif impaired partially the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, expression analyses of fusion and deletion zzso in zzso and zzso cells suggested that two portions of zzso contributed to its retention within the zzso We showed that the zzso domain was necessary but not sufficient for zzso retention of zzso and that deletion of zzso zzso 6 and 7 was accompanied with the loss of zzso zzso and, in some instances, trafficking to the zzso From these data we concluded that zzso maintains its zzso zzso by expressing retention signals present in both the zzso zzso domain and in the zzso zzso zzso 6 and zzso Additionally, the ability of zzso to zzso may also prevent exit from the zzso via an interaction with zzso zzso
