The embryonic zzso is zzso by the influx of zzso zzso in zzso To characterize the T cell progeny of the initial colonization waves, we used intravenous adoptive transfer of bone zzso zzso into zzso zzso The experiments were performed in birds because intravenous cell infusions can be performed more efficiently in avian than in zzso zzso zzso cells, which entered the zzso zzso via zzso zzso in the zzso region and zzso located at the zzso zzso zzso to the outer zzso to begin zzso zzso The zzso of differentiation and zzso of the T cell progeny were analyzed for the first three waves of zzso Each zzso wave gave rise to zzso T cells 3 d earlier than zzso T zzso Although the flow of T cell migration from the zzso was zzso distinct colonization and differentiation zzso defined three successive waves of zzso and zzso T cells that depart zzso the zzso en route to the zzso Each wave of precursors rearranged all three zzso zzso gene families, but displayed a variable zzso The data indicate a complex pattern of repertoire diversification by the progeny of founder zzso zzso
