The zzso zzso of carrot zzso zzso was isolated as an zzso abundant zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso Northern analyses of zzso isolated from zzso cultured cells, and a variety of zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso specifically accumulates in zzso beginning at the early stages of zzso zzso In zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso begins to accumulate at low levels throughout zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases and becomes more localized as zzso zzso in torpedo zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso regions, particularly the zzso The similarity in distribution of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso indicates that much of the spatial pattern of expression of the zzso gene is dependent on the zzso program of the carrot zzso and does not require maternal or zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso molecular weight zzso is a very zzso protein that is a member of a class of highly zzso proteins zzso also by the zzso protein of wheat and the Lea zzso protein of zzso that may be ubiquitous among zzso zzso but whose functions are as yet zzso The carrot zzso appears to contain one or two copies of the zzso zzso A zzso pair DNA zzso of the carrot zzso containing the zzso gene was isolated and zzso The gene is interrupted by a single zzso of 99 base zzso zzso extension experiments identify two zzso zzso differing by 6 bases at their zzso ends that are transcribed from this zzso
