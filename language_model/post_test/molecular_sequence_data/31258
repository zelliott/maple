The gypsy zzso of zzso zzso contains a sequence that zzso upstream zzso zzso In contrast to other sequences that influence zzso site use, it appears to operate at the level of the DNA zzso Nuclear extracts contained protein that bound to a repeated motif in the zzso zzso with zzso that reduced transcripts zzso in the zzso long terminal repeat of gypsy contained less zzso activity than wild zzso A change in the repeat motif reduced both protein binding and zzso site zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso proteins can regulate zzso zzso
