zzso differentiation in some species of zzso is sensitive to zzso The zzso sex of zzso frogs such as zzso zzso can be reversed from female to male by injection of testosterone into zzso but little is known about the molecular mechanism of this sex zzso To zzso the mechanism of the sex zzso we examined the role of zzso zzso zzso an zzso that converts testosterone to estrogen, during zzso differentiation of zzso In this study, we first cloned a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso its expression profile in developing and in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in the zzso of zzso during zzso differentiation and became much stronger in the developing zzso in which only immature zzso were zzso However, its expression declined significantly in the zzso of frogs 2 months after zzso when zzso were zzso and it was no longer seen in adult zzso By zzso we also examined the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the orphan nuclear zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was high in the zzso but it declined rapidly after the injection of zzso In contrast, no change in the zzso (also known as zzso expression was zzso Moreover, to identify the zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso we performed zzso with an zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso giving positive signals were observed around zzso in the zzso of frogs 1 month after zzso They were identified as zzso cells by both light and electron zzso The results, taken together, indicate that zzso protein is zzso in zzso cells and that zzso is very much involved in zzso differentiation in zzso zzso
