During photosynthesis, part of the fixed carbon is directed into the synthesis of zzso zzso which serves as an intermediate carbon storage facility in zzso This zzso starch is mobilized during the zzso zzso evidence indicates that the main route of starch breakdown proceeds by way of zzso zzso and results in zzso zzso This zzso requires a zzso zzso to mediate the export of zzso from the zzso We have zzso the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso zzso and, using a differential labeling zzso have identified the zzso zzso as a component of the inner envelope zzso zzso sequence information derived from this protein was used to isolate zzso clones zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso from spinach, zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also present the molecular characterization of a candidate for a zzso zzso of the zzso envelope zzso This zzso initially characterized more than 20 years ago, is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family and differs from all other plant zzso zzso that have been characterized to zzso
