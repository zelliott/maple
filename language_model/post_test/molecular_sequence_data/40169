A zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from surface soil was shown to produce zzso zzso A zzso synthesis gene cluster containing ten genes was cloned from strain zzso among which eight genes were involved in zzso zzso In addition to the zzso gene zzso the zzso ring zzso and the zzso gene zzso the zzso ring zzso that were responsible for zzso zzso the cluster also contained a novel gene zzso identified recently zzso the zzso ring zzso that further zzso zzso The individual genes in the zzso cluster showed the highest sequence similarities to the corresponding genes reported in zzso zzso strain zzso a marine isolate that also produced zzso zzso The genetic organization of the zzso synthesis gene clusters in the two zzso strains was zzso It is likely that the two zzso strains were evolved from the same zzso and adapted later to growth in different zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso from zzso in a zzso zzso coli produced zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso from zzso and the zzso from another zzso zzso strain were expressed in zzso coli producing different zzso zzso Both zzso showed low activity on zzso and high activity on zzso The main difference was that the zzso from zzso zzso worked well on zzso or zzso but the zzso from zzso did not work on either of the zzso
