In earlier studies we showed that point zzso introduced into the proposed zzso segment, zzso zzso acids zzso of the mouse cardiac zzso zzso reduced or abolished high affinity zzso zzso Here we investigate the effects of these zzso on the affinity and zzso properties of zzso binding and on zzso modification of the zzso zzso channel at the single channel and whole cell zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies reveal that zzso zzso decreases the equilibrium zzso constant zzso and the zzso rate constant zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso increase the zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on single zzso and zzso zzso channels is zzso on the time scale of single channel experiments, in contrast to the irreversible effect of zzso on single zzso zzso zzso alone is able to induce a large and sustained zzso release in zzso cells zzso with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso at the resting zzso zzso but causes little or no zzso release in cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso diminishes the functional effect of zzso on zzso release but spares zzso zzso release in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins produces single channels that interact with zzso zzso and display altered zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with the view that the proposed zzso segment is a critical zzso of zzso zzso A putative model of zzso zzso interaction is zzso
