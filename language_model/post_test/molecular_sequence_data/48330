zzso zzso are used to control infections of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the poultry zzso zzso zzso There are still no reports of zzso resistance zzso to zzso in these two zzso although zzso to zzso is widespread in several other veterinary zzso Several single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso genes have been associated with zzso In the present study we have zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 of zzso zzso and zzso 1 of zzso zzso zzso analysis of all currently known zzso showed that the zzso has more diversity among the zzso genes than the zzso In addition, this diversity is arranged in a more complex pattern of zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence and one of the zzso zzso sequences clustered with the known zzso zzso 1 zzso while the other zzso zzso sequence did not cluster with any other zzso zzso We therefore conclude that this is a previously zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene sequences were used to develop a zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso 198 and zzso No zzso was observed despite sequencing 95 and 100 individual adult worms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Given the diversity of zzso patterns among zzso it is likely that associations of genetic data with zzso cannot be zzso from one zzso group to zzso
