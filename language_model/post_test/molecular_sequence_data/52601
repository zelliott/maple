The zzso region of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso makes up the interior core of the zzso bundle structure of the zzso zzso zzso We extended our previous study of this domain zzso Weng and zzso zzso Weiss, zzso zzso zzso 1998) by analyzing 23 additional zzso at positions that lie at the interface of the interior core and outer zzso We found nine new functional zzso For most zzso the activity could be explained by the ability of the modeled zzso to stabilize the zzso bundle zzso The present study provides insights into the envelope zzso fusion mechanism and information for rational drug and vaccine zzso
