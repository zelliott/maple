zzso stalk zzso in zzso zzso is controlled by a zzso zzso system consisting of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the response regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso groups between zzso and zzso When zzso zzso triggers a downstream zzso cascade for stalk synthesis in an zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso was determined to zzso A zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso proteins that feature a highly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is located on the surface of the zzso bundle and is fully zzso zzso One end of the zzso bundle in zzso is shorter compared with other characterized zzso zzso whereas the face that potentially interacts with the response regulators is structurally zzso zzso of the interaction surface around the zzso site suggest that zzso is likely to share a common mechanism for molecular recognition and zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso despite their low overall sequence zzso
