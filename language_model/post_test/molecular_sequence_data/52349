In order to locate the promoter region of the human alpha 2A zzso zzso gene we used zzso protection analysis and zzso zzso zzso to map the cap site of the alpha 2 zzso Prior sequence analysis has shown two potential zzso box motifs in the human alpha 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located zzso and 1037 base pairs zzso respectively, upstream of the protein coding zzso zzso protection experiments and primer extension show that zzso starts downstream of the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso region is approximately 1 zzso in zzso We have used the zzso zzso reporter gene and transient zzso into zzso a human zzso cell line that expresses the alpha 2A zzso to show that as little as 150 zzso upstream of the cap site can direct zzso zzso analysis shows that although this region contains the zzso box motif it lacks a zzso box zzso zzso I footprint analysis of a zzso from zzso to zzso (where zzso is the zzso initiation zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso showed hypersensitive sites zzso and two protected zzso zzso to zzso which includes a zzso zzso and zzso to zzso which includes a zzso box, a common motif for zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that zzso or a related factor may bind to this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso box and the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that these zzso sequences may function in lieu of a zzso box to regulate zzso of the human alpha 2A zzso zzso zzso
