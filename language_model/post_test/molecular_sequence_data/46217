zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for many pathological responses in allergic asthma including zzso production, zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso is required for immunity to many zzso zzso zzso signals via the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which is also used by zzso zzso also binds to zzso but with much higher affinity than the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso has been shown to zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso However, molecular zzso that dictate the specificity and affinity of mouse zzso for the different receptors are largely zzso Here, we used zzso overlapping zzso zzso structural zzso and molecular zzso methods to map zzso binding sequences on its zzso zzso binding sequences on mouse zzso and zzso were in agreement with the reported human zzso zzso complex structures and zzso zzso zzso Novel structural differences were identified between zzso zzso particularly at the zzso binding zzso zzso additional binding sites were observed for zzso on zzso In addition, the identification of zzso sequences that are unique to zzso allowed us to generate a zzso zzso that selectively binds zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso combined with molecular zzso studies provide a novel, zzso and reliable method to map zzso interactions that may be used to generate signaling and decoy zzso zzso
