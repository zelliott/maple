zzso is the most common and most lethal form of brain tumor in zzso Unfortunately, there is still no effective therapy to this fatal disease and the median survival is generally less than one year from the time of zzso Discovery of zzso that can bind specifically to this type of tumor cells will be of great significance to develop early molecular imaging, targeted delivery and guided surgery methods to battle this type of brain zzso 

We discovered two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso against cultured human zzso cell line zzso after 30 rounds selection by a method called zzso zzso Evolution of zzso by zzso enrichment zzso These two zzso have high affinity and specificity against target zzso zzso They neither recognize normal zzso cells, nor do they recognize other normal and cancer cell lines zzso Clinical zzso were also tested and the results showed that these two zzso can bind to different clinical zzso zzso but not normal brain zzso More importantly, binding affinity and selectivity of these two zzso were retained in complicated biological zzso 

The selected zzso could be used to identify specific zzso zzso zzso of molecular imaging, targeted drug delivery, zzso guided surgery can be further developed based on these zzso for early zzso targeted therapy, and guided surgery of zzso leading to effective treatment of zzso
