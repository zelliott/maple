Stem cells are characterized by zzso and zzso to produce multiple lineages of zzso and differentiated zzso zzso gene encodes zzso zzso which is a cell surface marker of zzso stem cells, zzso zzso stem cells, pancreatic stem cells, zzso stem cells, liver cancer stem cells, and zzso cancer stem zzso Here, comparative zzso analyses on zzso zzso were zzso Human zzso zzso zzso was a truncated transcript, while zzso was the representative human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of 27 zzso was identified within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso identity with human and mouse zzso zzso zzso Only 2 of 8 zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso revealed that zzso zzso were relatively divergent between primates and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in human embryonic stem zzso cells, zzso small zzso zzso cells, zzso gastric cancer, and zzso zzso Human zzso zzso transcribed from zzso zzso was the major zzso Comparative zzso revealed that the region around zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of human zzso zzso was not zzso in mouse and zzso zzso 2 of zzso zzso was relatively well zzso among zzso zzso zzso sites with zzso spacing within zzso 2 were zzso among human, zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso Together these facts indicate that zzso zzso signaling zzso is implicated in zzso expression in zzso cells, adult stem cells, and cancer stem zzso
