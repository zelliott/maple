Most zzso channel proteins exhibit some degree of charge zzso that is, an ability to conduct zzso of one charge more efficiently than zzso of the opposite zzso The structural origins of charge selectivity remain incompletely understood despite recent advances in the determination of zzso and zzso channel protein zzso zzso bundle channels formed via zzso of the zzso zzso provide a zzso model system for exploring the structural basis of charge zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso at position 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in each zzso to assess the role of this position as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Of the position 18 zzso investigated, the zzso zzso exhibited the greatest degree of zzso zzso zzso channels were slightly less zzso than zzso Interestingly, zzso channels showed zzso selectivity nearly equivalent to that exhibited by the neutral zzso zzso We suggest that this result is due to a wider pore diameter that permits a greater number of zzso leading to enhanced charge screening and a lower effective zzso positive zzso
