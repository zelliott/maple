One of the zzso for the development of zzso zzso vaccines is the induction of an efficient immune response to zzso zzso like zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso In an attempt to overcome the problems that arise from the zzso immune response induced by such zzso selecting zzso sequences that mimic protective zzso zzso has been zzso In this study, we investigate a new selection strategy for zzso zzso mimics using the zzso zzso library zzso Two zzso zzso zzso of the A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso part of the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protective against zzso infection were used to screen two zzso zzso libraries in zzso Using zzso zzso 13 different specific clones were selected, and 6 using zzso zzso 5 of the latter also zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the first zzso All of the 19 clones selected were separately used to zzso mice, but only 2 of them, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with both zzso were able to induce zzso zzso The immune response was specific for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and also selectively recognized the corresponding bacterial zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso mimics were zzso zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results are the first example of zzso mimicry of carbohydrates by zzso zzso and indicate a new strategy of selection of zzso for the development of zzso zzso
