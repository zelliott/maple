zzso is a core protein of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso that processes the majority of DNA zzso breaks in zzso zzso stimulates the final zzso step zzso by the complex between DNA zzso IV and zzso zzso Here we present the crystal structure of the zzso complex at zzso resolution and identify the relative positions of the two factors and their binding zzso The X-ray structure reveals a filament arrangement for zzso and zzso zzso zzso by repeated interactions through their zzso head zzso A filament arrangement of the zzso complex was confirmed by transmission electron zzso analyses both with truncated and full-length zzso We further modeled the interface and used zzso zzso zzso and zzso to characterize the roles of various zzso at the zzso zzso We identified four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso essential for the interaction with zzso These findings provide new insights into the molecular bases for zzso and bridging roles of zzso in the final DNA zzso zzso
