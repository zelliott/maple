zzso of zzso tobacco cells through the cell cycle was followed after treatments with ultra violet zzso and salicylic acid zzso used as a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso which can mediate response to zzso zzso zzso in S phase were more sensitive than zzso or zzso cells to zzso zzso Although zzso efficiently blocked cells in zzso or zzso it did not block S phase synchronized zzso zzso and zzso applied simultaneously to cells in zzso delayed the cell cycle progression more than each one zzso Therefore zzso zzso and zzso act as zzso to arrest zzso cells at cell cycle zzso To further investigate the zzso zzso zzso zzso response, we zzso a zzso zzso coli strain with a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso A zzso zzso whose coding sequence is identical to the zzso induced zzso zzso cloned by zzso et zzso zzso was zzso We show that zzso zzso is induced at cell cycle entry but not directly by the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is induced prior to the restriction point as shown with the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso level is increased by zzso zzso but prevented by zzso Indeed, addition of zzso prior to zzso zzso blocks the induction of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso gene is modulated in both zzso and zzso responses, the zzso effect preceding the zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso a rat zzso zzso for protein zzso C, and possesses identical zzso fixation zzso it is zzso that the zzso gene is involved in zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso
