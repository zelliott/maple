zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso protein of zzso human zzso To understand zzso gene regulation in human zzso we studied the zzso gene promoter activity in human zzso zzso cell line zzso Previously, we have reported that a zzso pair zzso zzso fragment, from zzso to zzso of zzso promoter enhances promoter activity by zzso in zzso zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso of zzso promoter by this zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso with deletion zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso were located in a zzso fragment, from zzso to zzso which enhanced promoter activity zzso zzso zzso and gel mobility shift zzso with zzso zzso revealed three zzso within this zzso zzso I) zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso In nuclear extracts of zzso cells, at least two proteins bound to zzso III, one of which was zzso factor zzso since zzso against zzso caused a zzso in a gel mobility shift zzso A protein with a molecular mass of approximately 100 zzso bound to zzso I as revealed by zzso zzso An unidentified protein bound to zzso zzso zzso in zzso I, II, and III reduced promoter activity by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that there was a synergistic function among these three zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
