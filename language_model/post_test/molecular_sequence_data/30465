We have constructed a zzso library from mature egg zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of the library using zzso made against zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the cortical zzso zzso or cortical zzso resulted in several clones that zzso to a higher degree to the zzso from the zzso zzso We selected and analyzed the clone giving the strongest signal zzso zzso for its distribution in zzso and found that it bound to zzso in the nurse cell zzso in the zzso and in the zzso cells of zzso zzso of the insert from zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso on dot blots further supported the observation that the zzso corresponding to zzso was enriched in this zzso zzso The zzso for zzso was approximately 500 bases long and the gene seems to be a member of a large zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso acid sequences reveal similarity to zzso zzso genes and a lesser but convincing similarity to zzso zzso The filter and in zzso zzso data point to the association of specific zzso zzso with the cortical zzso of zzso zzso Aspects of the structure of the protein zzso by this zzso suggest that it is a structural component necessary for formation of the cellular zzso of the zzso The association of this maternal zzso with the cortical zzso presents the interesting possibility that zzso bound to the zzso may be capable of participating in the synthesis of new zzso or related structures during zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
