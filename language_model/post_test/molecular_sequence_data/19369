zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to zzso zzso wax zzso storage compounds when grown on zzso as the sole carbon source under limiting nitrogen and/or zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso wax zzso synthesis involves zzso zzso of an zzso fatty acid by a zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso bond formation between an zzso alcohol and zzso zzso most zzso by an zzso wax zzso zzso similar to an zzso wax zzso zzso wax zzso zzso zzso zzso recently described from zzso zzso strain zzso We used the recently released rough draft zzso sequence of a closely related strain, zzso zzso zzso to search for zzso and zzso zzso candidate zzso The sequence information from putative zzso and zzso zzso genes identified in this strain was used to clone zzso from the zzso wax zzso zzso zzso zzso The activities of the zzso zzso were zzso and two new zzso wax zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso and zzso hybrid zzso in zzso were identified along with an zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso wax zzso zzso displays several orders of magnitude higher activity toward zzso zzso than any previously characterized zzso and may reflect adaptations to available carbon sources in their zzso
