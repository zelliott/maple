zzso protein zzso zzso a family of zzso protein zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso and zzso stress responses in zzso In this study, we investigated 16 putative zzso genes from tomato zzso and compared them with those from zzso The full zzso sequences of 13 novel zzso in tomato were obtained through zzso zzso A comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso in tomato is zzso including their gene structure, zzso zzso zzso and expression zzso zzso analysis of the 16 zzso and 20 zzso from zzso indicated that the zzso genes were clustered into four major groups, and genes within the same groups had similar zzso zzso All zzso proteins in groups A, B and C had a zzso zzso zzso domain, whereas those in group D contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of zzso region of zzso revealed a group of putative zzso elements related to stress zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes using zzso and real-time quantitative zzso demonstrated that all zzso transcripts were able to be detected in at least one investigated zzso and some of them exhibited zzso expression zzso The transcript abundance of nearly all zzso genes was increased in response to heat stress zzso Our data provided an insight into the evolution of the gene family and a useful reference for further functional analysis of zzso family genes in zzso
