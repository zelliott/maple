zzso T cell recognition is dependent on the functional density of the zzso which consists of specific zzso molecules and a specifically bound zzso We have examined the influence of the affinity and concentration of zzso zzso and the density of specific zzso molecules on the proliferation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso Using zzso zzso zzso with different zzso of known zzso zzso T cell response was reduced in an zzso and - concentration specific zzso The decrease using weaker binding peptides was gradual as stimulation with a zzso with intermediate affinity yielded intermediate T cell proliferation and the poorest binding zzso induced an even weaker T cell zzso zzso class II density on the zzso was modified using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso however this variation of zzso concentration had no effect on T cell zzso We interpret this as a reflection of a low threshold for zzso of the T cell zzso in which zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the strength of zzso zzso
