zzso and zzso interactions between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha and beta zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso and zzso As a first step to understanding these zzso we used the zzso zzso to measure zzso of the zzso zzso TM zzso and zzso TM domain zzso zzso measures the zzso of a zzso protein containing a TM zzso in the zzso coli inner membrane via the zzso zzso of the gene for zzso zzso We found the amount of zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso TM zzso was approximately half that induced by the strongly zzso TM zzso of zzso A, confirming that the zzso TM domain zzso in biological zzso zzso each of the zzso TM domain zzso to either Ala, zzso zzso or Val revealed that a zzso motif mediates zzso Further, we found that the zzso preceding each zzso contributed to the zzso zzso as did the zzso at position i + 4 after the second zzso of zzso Thus, the sequence zzso is critical for zzso of zzso TM zzso These data were used to generate an atomic model of the zzso zzso revealing a family of structures with right-handed crossing angles of 40 degrees to 60 degrees, consistent with a zzso zzso and with an interface rotated by 50 degrees relative to zzso zzso Thus, although the zzso TM zzso makes use of the zzso zzso neighboring zzso have evolved to engineer its zzso zzso enabling it to zzso specific and specialized zzso
