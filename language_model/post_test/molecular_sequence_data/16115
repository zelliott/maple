The zzso gene encodes zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the second zzso in the parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is induced by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso This zzso induction is zzso by a positive zzso zzso by an adjacent zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are transcribed in opposite directions from promoters that are zzso In this paper we characterize the in zzso DNA binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso product binds to two adjacent operator sites located in the zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso One of these operators, designated zzso contains regions of zzso symmetry centered at position zzso relative to the zzso zzso start site, and the second site, designated zzso contains an zzso zzso repeat sequence centered about the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso product at the zzso and zzso operator sites is zzso and this zzso zzso complex in the presence of zzso acid zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter as detected by zzso I protection zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso were performed to characterize the regulation of the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso zzso of the zzso gene is maintained at a zzso level of activity which is elevated as much as zzso in the presence of zzso product and zzso The zzso product zzso zzso zzso in a manner that does not appear to be dependent on zzso acid zzso zzso We discuss models in which zzso of zzso zzso results from a direct interaction of zzso protein with zzso zzso or an zzso zzso of the DNA zzso of the zzso zzso promoter zzso Additionally, we discuss the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
