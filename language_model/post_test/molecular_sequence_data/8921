zzso the structure, function, and molecular interactions of complex molecular machines in their cellular context and at atomic resolution is of prime importance for understanding fundamental zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance is a well-established imaging method that can zzso cellular entities at the zzso scale and can be used to obtain zzso atomic structures under in zzso zzso Here, we introduce a solid-state zzso approach that provides atomic level insights into zzso molecular zzso By combining dedicated protein production and labeling schemes with tailored solid-state zzso pulse methods, we obtained structural information of a zzso integral membrane protein and the major zzso molecular components in a bacterial zzso Our approach permits studying entire cellular compartments as well as zzso proteins at the same time and at atomic zzso
