The overall folding of neutral zzso from zzso zzso has been predicted by zzso zzso taking as a basis the known three-dimensional structure of zzso As expected from the 50% similarity of sequence between the two zzso the structure of zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso including the zzso zzso and location of elements of regular secondary structure zzso and zzso whereas specific differences were predicted in loop zzso A protruding and loose loop predicted in zzso zzso has been detected also zzso by a limited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso for 24 h at room temperature with zzso at zzso ratio (by zzso leads to a specific and almost quantitative zzso of the zzso zzso bond located in a highly exposed, and thus probably flexible, loop of the zzso On the other hand, zzso was completely resistant to zzso zzso when reacted under identical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can be isolated by gel zzso zzso at neutral zzso whereas the two zzso fragments zzso and zzso are separated under zzso zzso Overall, these results indicate that the limited zzso approach can pinpoint a peculiar difference in surface structure between the two similar protein molecules of zzso zzso neutral zzso and zzso and emphasize the potential use of zzso zzso as structural zzso of zzso zzso
