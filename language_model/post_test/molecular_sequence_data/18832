The zzso zzso egg capsules of marine zzso zzso zzso zzso ) exhibit unique zzso properties such as high elastic strain recovery and elastic energy dissipation zzso zzso material possesses long-range zzso that is fully zzso and is the result of a secondary structure phase transition from zzso zzso to extended zzso rather than of zzso zzso zzso We report here the characterization of the precursor proteins that make up this zzso Three different proteins have been zzso and zzso and complete protein sequences deduced from zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso indicate that the proteins are strongly zzso in solution and primary sequence analysis suggests that these proteins have a propensity to form zzso This is in agreement with previous wide-angle X-ray scattering zzso and solid-state zzso zzso analysis of mature egg zzso
