In this study we characterize two proteins zzso by the two smallest zzso segments of the zzso zzso infectious salmon zzso virus zzso Both zzso zzso by the zzso zzso from zzso segment 7 zzso and the larger zzso from segment 8 zzso are involved in zzso of the type I zzso zzso zzso The data suggests that the zzso protein is zzso zzso zzso contains no nuclear zzso signals, zzso mainly to the zzso zzso area and does not bind zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso segment 8 uses a zzso coding strategy and the zzso zzso protein is a structural component of the viral zzso This protein contains two nuclear zzso signals, has a predominantly nuclear zzso binds both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso salmon cells both zzso proteins independently zzso the type I zzso promoter zzso Thus, zzso zzso the type I zzso response by the action of at least two of its gene products, rather than just one, as appears to be the case for other known members of the zzso
