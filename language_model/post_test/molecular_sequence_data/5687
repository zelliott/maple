The mouse zzso downstream zzso has been previously characterized on several levels of gene zzso The zzso was zzso with a zzso I hypersensitive site in the zzso of mature zzso the in zzso interaction of zzso factor zzso with the zzso core zzso demonstrated binding being restricted to mature zzso cells, and analysis of the zzso zzso state revealed a correlation between zzso of zzso zzso and the in zzso zzso zzso Here, we analyzed in detail the full-length zzso in addition to the core zzso We identified a total of nine binding sites for nuclear zzso Most of these factors are found zzso in all cell types zzso These factors include several unknown proteins as well as the zzso factor zzso In addition, three binding sites for a new zzso DNA binding protein were zzso The presence of this factor in mature zzso zzso with the in zzso DNA melting of one of the binding sites and with the zzso zzso
