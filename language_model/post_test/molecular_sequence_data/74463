zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso play extremely important roles in zzso such as regulating zzso formation, zzso or zzso zzso the formation of zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso is a group of functionally important zzso named zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand their evolutionary patterns, in this study, we presented a systematic analysis of all the zzso in zzso zzso We found that different zzso had various numbers of zzso in view of their remarkable zzso in zzso size and zzso Most of these zzso exhibited distinct domain zzso which implies the versatile functions of zzso zzso zzso the whole set of zzso domain zzso from diverse zzso organisms to their zzso tree and detailed zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso domain recruitment appeared to be the most prevailing pattern contributing to the great zzso of zzso zzso domain zzso However, other scenarios, such as gene duplication, also occurred during the evolution of zzso zzso zzso divergence seemed to contribute to the origin of putative zzso zzso which were found only in zzso In conclusion, the comprehensive survey of zzso in zzso provides novel insight into their potential evolutionary mechanisms and further functional zzso
