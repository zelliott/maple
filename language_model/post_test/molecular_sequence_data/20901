To understand the time course of action of any small zzso inside a single cell, one would deposit a defined amount inside the cell and initiate its activity at a defined zzso An elegant way to achieve this is to zzso the zzso in a zzso zzso introduce it into a cell, remotely open its wall by a laser pulse, and then follow the biological response by zzso The zzso of this approach is validated here using zzso with defined walls that are doped with metallic zzso so as to enable them to be opened with an infrared zzso The capsules are loaded with a fluorescent zzso zzso and introduced into zzso cultured cells where, upon zzso release, the zzso binds to major zzso complex zzso class I proteins and elicits their cell surface zzso The concept of releasing a drug inside a cell and following its action is zzso to many problems in cell biology and zzso
