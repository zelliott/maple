zzso zzso is a natural inhabitant of marine environments and constitutes part of the zzso microbial communities, but is also associated with human zzso wound infections and zzso Recently, a number of clinical cases of infection due to zzso of seafood contaminated with zzso zzso and potentially pandemic marine strains isolated from water and zzso have been reported in zzso To identify the source of virulent strains and to analyze the possible zzso in time and space, of particular zzso the molecular typing of zzso strains is of high zzso zzso In this study, we applied zzso gel zzso and two zzso techniques zzso repetitive zzso zzso and repetitive zzso zzso to establish the DNA fingerprints for the analysis of genetic zzso among the environmental zzso zzso strains isolated in the area of the Venetian zzso A zzso distribution of the environmental strains in the studied geographical area and, in some cases, a strong association between a certain genetic profile and a specific source have been zzso A number of genetic zzso seem to persist over time, zzso in the marine environment for subsequent months and also at a zzso zzso The use of multiple typing methods allowed a more accurate characterization of the environmental strain genetic profiles and the identification of clones hardly revealed through common zzso
