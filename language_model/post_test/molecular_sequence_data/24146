To zzso study zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso especially those with zzso C virus zzso infection, proteins extracted from zzso cells were separated by two-dimensional zzso zzso reacting with zzso from 15 patients with zzso were detected by Western zzso zzso extracted from the spots were subjected to mass zzso for identification by mass zzso zzso of the proteins identified was confirmed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso so detected was investigated by zzso Among 20 protein spots zzso four were identified as zzso heat shock protein zzso 70, zzso and a novel protein zzso zzso consists of two zzso of zzso zzso and a specific zzso zzso against the specific domain were detected in zzso of patients with zzso zzso of those with zzso zzso of those with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso carriers, but in no healthy zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is present in the zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso or the vascular zzso zzso is a novel protein expressed in zzso and zzso zzso to this protein may exacerbate inflammation in chronic viral zzso
