The virulent zzso zzso zzso isolated in 1995 from a failed cheese production in France, represents a new zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso This zzso has a burst size of 160 and a zzso period of 85 zzso Its linear zzso DNA zzso was composed of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Its deduced zzso zzso zzso shared limited similarities to other known zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso analyses led to the identification of 15 structural zzso The most striking feature of the zzso zzso was that 22 zzso shared similarities with proteins deduced from the zzso of either zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Both are zzso bacteria found in the gut zzso of zzso We also identified a zzso module in zzso zzso most likely involved in host recognition that shared similarities with zzso zzso We propose that the virulent zzso zzso infected another bacterial zzso before picking up a zzso host recognition zzso
