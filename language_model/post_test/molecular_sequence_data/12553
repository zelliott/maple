zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of neural and zzso peptides through a zzso reaction carried out zzso by its zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurs in soluble and integral membrane zzso zzso labeling of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed that zzso was efficiently incorporated into zzso and zzso zzso of membrane zzso but not into soluble zzso zzso of integral membrane zzso proteins (which terminate with zzso at zzso eliminated their zzso suggesting that the zzso region of the protein was the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain was zzso on zzso and zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso protein recovered from different zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso Although zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect was an indirect one since it was also observed in zzso cells expressing a truncated zzso protein that was not zzso zzso cells expressing zzso lacking one of the zzso sites zzso exhibited an altered pattern of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein targeted to zzso upon zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso domain of membrane zzso plays a role in a specific step in the targeting of this zzso
