The function of zzso protein zzso as a zzso zzso regulated by zzso binding is zzso zzso transport requires fatty acids zzso with relatively wide structural zzso The zzso binding site is specific for zzso zzso and zzso a number of zzso The strong pH dependency zzso regulation of zzso binding and thus zzso zzso The zzso relationship of zzso has been zzso by various zzso and by zzso According to our model, zzso are a zzso in zzso zzso providing zzso shuttling zzso groups in the zzso zzso By zzso additional zzso zzso groups at both sides of the zzso channel were zzso Two pH sensors, controlling zzso zzso were identified in accordance with earlier zzso deduced from the pH dependence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A common pH sensor zzso and a specific pH sensor zzso for zzso only, control access to the zzso binding zzso The three zzso carrier family characteristic zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso of other charged zzso reveals their role in structure zzso and/or has more zzso effects due to charge relay networks in zzso
