A zzso method to zzso the zzso strand of a model system, dengue virus, with high specificity and sensitivity is zzso The high specificity of this approach is achieved at two zzso the use of a reverse zzso primer folded into a zzso structure with optimal zzso and the use of specific zzso zzso to the loop zzso This approach has exceptional specificity to the zzso zzso as compared with the zzso sequence zzso zzso with a detection sensitivity of 10 zzso The high correlation to the biological zzso zzso plaque zzso used to zzso infectious virus, renders this method a useful quantitative tool that can replace the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method has been extended to the detection of zzso strands of other zzso viruses (West Nile virus and human respiratory zzso zzso with similar zzso This real-time zzso method is reliable, simple to perform, and easily adaptable to different zzso The ability to detect and rapidly zzso replicating viruses is an important step in the zzso of zzso and is also useful for the evaluation of drugs designed to inhibit viral zzso
