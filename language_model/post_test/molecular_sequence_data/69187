We have described new zzso mouse zzso cell lines zzso derived from transgenic mice expressing zzso virus 40 large T zzso under the control of zzso III gene promoter zzso Cell zzso (1992) zzso zzso In an attempt to understand the zzso variations of the different cell lines, we analyzed their content in zzso zzso factors at the level of both the zzso by gel shift analysis, and the zzso by quantitative zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso ability of zzso zzso alpha and zzso alpha was also evaluated by measuring the activity of zzso synthetic promoters consisting of DNA element zzso upstream of a zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors were maintained in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso alpha was much more variable between the different cell lines and was less abundant than it was in zzso in the zzso We investigated the influence of zzso alpha and zzso alpha on the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was not limiting for the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the activity of the zzso promoter in the different lines was clearly dependent on the zzso alpha content, which seems, therefore, to be an essential factor modulating the expression of this gene in zzso zzso zzso This work shows that the correlations between promoter activities and zzso factor contents in a panel of zzso cultured cells can be used to determine the respective role of zzso factors on the strength of some zzso
