In a previous study, system level analysis of zzso evolved zzso zzso showing improved zzso zzso revealed relevant zzso The governing zzso were suggested to be in the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso having one of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and zzso The zzso were also combined with zzso of zzso earlier proved as a beneficial target for zzso zzso The constructed strains were analyzed for their gross zzso zzso and targeted zzso and the results were compared to those obtained from reference strains and the evolved zzso The zzso zzso resulted in the highest specific zzso zzso rate among all of the strains with an increased maximum specific growth rate on zzso The zzso zzso also improved the specific zzso zzso rate and also resulted in many zzso changes, including zzso zzso The zzso zzso only showed a small improvement, but when it was combined with zzso zzso the zzso was almost the same as that of the evolved zzso Combination of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso also led to a complete recovery of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Recovery of the gross zzso by the reconstructed zzso was achieved with much fewer changes in the zzso and zzso than for the evolved zzso Our study demonstrates how the identification of specific zzso by systems biology can direct new zzso engineering strategies for improving zzso zzso by zzso
