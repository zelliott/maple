A novel member of the I zzso family has been identified as a protein that associated with the zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Similar to previously known I zzso zzso this member, I zzso zzso has six consecutive zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in different human zzso with highest levels in zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso interacts with different zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso and zzso the zzso activity of both zzso and zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by I zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso is expressed at different levels in specific cell types and is zzso zzso in transformed zzso zzso It also displays differential induction in response to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso or zzso zzso stimulation compared to I zzso alpha in zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso represents a novel I zzso family member which provides an alternative mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso
