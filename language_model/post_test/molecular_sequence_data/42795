zzso clones containing human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were isolated from a zzso 19 zzso zzso The clones were confirmed to contain zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso start site by restriction zzso zzso zzso analysis, and sequence zzso zzso zzso mapping determined that the clones spanned approximately 26 zzso of zzso sequence from 14 zzso zzso to 12 zzso 3' of the zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 3A restriction zzso zzso was zzso This sequence extends from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 3' of the zzso zzso This sequence was analyzed for the presence of consensus zzso regulatory zzso repetitive zzso and other zzso Several zzso regulatory consensus sequences were zzso These consensus sequences may have significance for the zzso regulation of zzso
