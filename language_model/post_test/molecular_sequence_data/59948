Two zzso components of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso chain zzso acid preferring zzso cleave bonds after zzso zzso zzso The possible involvement of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities in the zzso of bonds attributed to the zzso component was zzso Several zzso of the zzso activity containing a zzso group did not affect the zzso activity at zzso that were more than 150 times higher than their zzso values for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that zzso more than zzso of the zzso activity had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that zzso the zzso activity activated by up to zzso the zzso activity toward synthetic zzso and by more than zzso the degradation of the insulin B chain in a reaction not inhibited by zzso a selective inhibitor of the zzso zzso These findings are incompatible with any significant involvement of the zzso activity in the zzso of zzso zzso Both the native and zzso zzso zzso the insulin B chain mainly after zzso zzso in a reaction inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure did not result in zzso of the zzso zzso in the active site of the Y zzso These results suggest involvement of the zzso activity in the zzso of zzso zzso but this conclusion is incompatible with zzso zzso of the zzso activity and zzso of the zzso activity, and with the finding that proteins zzso the zzso activity had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso of these contradictions is zzso
