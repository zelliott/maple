The zzso zzso which is found in zzso DNA zzso and in zzso encodes a protein that is required for the zzso reduction of zzso zzso to zzso a zzso A DNA zzso downstream of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso of the DNA zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso that zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which showed extensive zzso to the proteins zzso by genes on zzso zzso in zzso zzso in pine and zzso in zzso zzso and to zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso We isolated a targeted zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso by the zzso of a zzso gene into the coding zzso zzso exhibited a zzso similar to that of zzso an zzso zzso which did not zzso zzso zzso and accumulated zzso a precursor to zzso in the zzso These zzso characteristics of zzso indicate that the zzso reduction of zzso requires not only the zzso protein but also the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso of zzso exhibit low but significant similarity to those of the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a zzso relationship between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as is observed between the zzso protein and the zzso of zzso
