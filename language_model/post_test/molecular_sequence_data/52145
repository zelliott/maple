Previously, we isolated two zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were unable to grow either on zzso or on zzso zzso This zzso was unexpected, since the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways had appeared from earlier studies to be independent of each zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also of interest because both were unable to compete successfully with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tracts of zzso zzso Thus, both appeared to have a colonization zzso We have now cloned the zzso locus in which the zzso insertions in zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the zzso insertions in zzso and zzso were about 100 zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we localized the region affected by the zzso and zzso insertions to within zzso zzso This DNA segment was zzso and found to contain a zzso open reading frame zzso and the zzso segment of a second open reading frame zzso which was downstream of zzso and transcribed in the same zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed significant zzso to that of a putative positive regulator of an zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso was at least zzso zzso acids long and did not exhibit zzso to any proteins in the data bases zzso zzso insertions in both zzso zzso and zzso disrupted zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicated that zzso was not essential for growth on zzso zzso or zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso appear to be due to the interruption of a regulatory gene zzso by zzso and not to a polar effect of the insertions on a downstream zzso The gene zzso zzso has been designated zzso for regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fusion studies showed that the expression of zzso occurred at the same level under inducing and zzso conditions, in contrast to the regulated expression of structural genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso nor was its expression affected by a zzso zzso that eliminated the expression of all zzso zzso zzso genes but did not affect the zzso of zzso
