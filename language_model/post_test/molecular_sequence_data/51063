The crystal structure of a zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat liver zzso zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved at zzso resolution by multiple zzso replacement zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A, and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso played an important role in the solution of the structure in that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to help locate the positions of zzso zzso sites in zzso derivatives with zzso zzso and to align the sequence with the model derived from zzso zzso A complete model for the protein was not obtained until part of the zzso structure was zzso The zzso in the zzso unit refined to a zzso R zzso zzso for zzso data and I zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The final model consists of 4150 zzso including all zzso atoms of 434 zzso acid zzso two zzso zzso and oxygen atoms of zzso water zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in shape with dimensions of 53 zzso 62 zzso 56 zzso Crystal contacts are primarily responsible for zzso differences between the two zzso which are related by a zzso zzso zzso The structure of the type 3 zzso can be divided into two zzso separated by a short zzso a smaller zzso domain zzso I, zzso zzso and a larger alpha domain zzso II, zzso zzso zzso I contains four zzso which form a central mixed zzso and three zzso which are arranged in a beta alpha beta alpha beta beta alpha zzso zzso II is composed of five zzso zzso I can be considered the zzso binding domain, while domain II seems to be primarily responsible for zzso zzso zzso The active site is located in a deep zzso cavity which is composed of three relatively mobile structural zzso the long loop zzso zzso of domain I, the alpha zzso 5 zzso segment, and the zzso zzso zzso is bound at the active site in an extended zzso at one end of the zzso of domain I with its backbone facing the cavity and the sulfur pointing toward the zzso to which it is zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
