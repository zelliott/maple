zzso active surveillance has uncovered two zzso German zzso cases in older cattle which resemble the two different zzso zzso zzso that have recently been described in France zzso zzso and Italy zzso zzso or zzso The zzso is characterized by a significantly higher molecular size, but a conventional zzso of the zzso K treated abnormal prion protein zzso while the zzso zzso has only a slightly lower molecular size and a distinctly different zzso In this paper we describe the successful transmission of both German zzso zzso cases to transgenic mice zzso bovine zzso Upon challenge with the zzso these mice developed zzso after a substantially shorter incubation period than any classical zzso transmission using these mice to zzso In contrast, the incubation period was distinctly prolonged when these mice were challenged with the zzso zzso accumulated in the brains of these mice were of the same zzso zzso type that had been used for the zzso These zzso cases suggest the possible existence of sporadic zzso cases in zzso It is thus feasible that the zzso epidemic in the UK could have also been initiated by an zzso transmission from a sporadic zzso zzso
