Development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a network of proteins that includes the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso components zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso zzso Loss of zzso activity zzso zzso development and body zzso leading to embryonic zzso We have used a genetic zzso approach to dissect this complex zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso encodes a divergent zzso family member that binds to several zzso proteins and the zzso protein zzso Like zzso zzso levels were zzso regulated by zzso We also found that zzso and zzso physically associated and that zzso could bind zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso may function within a zzso or complex that includes zzso zzso Additionally, zzso may regulate the zzso zzso of zzso during zzso We carried out a zzso zzso screen to identify additional regulators of this network and identified 39 zzso most of which are associated with zzso zzso zzso of these genes acted via the zzso zzso In addition, several zzso zzso protein zzso zzso components were identified, further implicating zzso complexes as part of the greater network controlling zzso zzso
