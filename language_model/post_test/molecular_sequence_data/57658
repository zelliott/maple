zzso zzso a common environmental zzso is responsible for a number of lung disorders, including zzso and infection, in human zzso For zzso of these diseases, zzso zzso and relevant zzso are not currently zzso 

A complementary DNA library of zzso zzso was constructed with zzso zzso isolated from zzso culture of the zzso Fusion proteins expressed with the zzso were characterized and zzso 

One of the zzso which reacted with both rabbit zzso zzso serum and a pool of zzso from patients with allergic zzso zzso expressed a 65 zzso protein of zzso zzso The zzso protein reacted with zzso E and zzso G zzso in the zzso from patients with allergic zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the partially zzso complementary DNA of the clone is zzso with the zzso 90 family of heat shock proteins in human beings and other zzso 

The zzso nature and the zzso to human heat shock proteins suggest a possible role for this protein in protective immunity and zzso
