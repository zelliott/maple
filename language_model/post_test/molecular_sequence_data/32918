A growing number of organisms have been discovered inhabiting extreme zzso including temperatures in excess of 100 degrees zzso How cellular proteins from such organisms retain their native folds under extreme conditions is still not fully zzso Recent zzso and structural studies have identified zzso bonding as an important mechanism for stabilizing zzso proteins in certain zzso zzso Here, we present the first zzso analysis of zzso zzso bonding in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study reveals that the zzso of zzso bonds extends beyond individual proteins to include many zzso zzso We report the zzso A crystal structure of one such complex, a zzso zzso zzso The structure contains two zzso zzso bonds, one per zzso which result in the zzso of each protein chain in such a way that the two chains are zzso zzso rendering them zzso This unusual feature emphasizes the variety and sophistication of the molecular mechanisms that can be achieved by zzso
