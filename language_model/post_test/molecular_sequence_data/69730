The zzso is a zzso zzso that establishes the internal zzso environment of most animal zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso contains multiple zzso zzso but the number and location of these zzso has not been clearly zzso We have used zzso addition to determine the zzso zzso of the alpha zzso An zzso zzso was inserted into various regions of the zzso zzso the rat alpha 1 zzso and the zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso or zzso location of the zzso tags was determined by zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso of the alpha zzso are situated zzso and the zzso is likely to possess eight zzso zzso The systematic application of zzso tagging may be useful for analyzing the zzso of membrane proteins of unknown zzso
