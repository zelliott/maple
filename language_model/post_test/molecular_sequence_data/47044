Previously we have identified and characterized three zzso zzso proteins zzso from the zzso fraction of cells from the zzso zzso cell line zzso During these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional zzso protein in the zzso fraction of zzso cells that had been activated with zzso zzso In this study we have zzso this zzso designated zzso to apparent zzso and demonstrated that it is a zzso small (Mr zzso zzso zzso displayed marked zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that the protein also displays activity against zzso coli, zzso zzso and an zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated that it is most likely identical to the zzso protein zzso This protein is produced by zzso processing of the zzso zzso a zzso fusion protein consisting of zzso linked to an unusual zzso with significant zzso to zzso The zzso gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of zzso in humans and various animal zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso of zzso may serve to restrict the zzso growth of zzso In addition, because zzso disintegration will likely lead to release of zzso into the zzso environment, it may contribute to host defense after zzso zzso
