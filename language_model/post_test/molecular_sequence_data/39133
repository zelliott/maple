zzso of tips of rod outer segments zzso by retinal zzso zzso zzso cells is vitally important for maintaining structural and functional integrity of the zzso We previously reported that zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso expression of early response genes coding for zzso zzso Here we study the expression of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso of rat zzso cells in primary cell culture, using competitive quantitative zzso During zzso of zzso (but not of latex zzso by zzso cells, zzso revealed a transient increase in zzso zzso zzso that peaked at 4-6 zzso We zzso and described two alternatively spliced zzso of rat zzso zzso and zzso Both of these, along with the recently described zzso were induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was also detected in zzso cells, but the level of expression did not change during zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid had the opposite zzso effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso had a dual action on zzso expression in zzso zzso it enhanced expression under zzso conditions but zzso expression induced by zzso zzso It also zzso expression of zzso but had no effect on zzso Selective zzso of zzso may play an important role in regulating the expression of target genes that are involved in zzso and fatty acid metabolism in the zzso renewal zzso
