The zzso zzso tumor gene zzso encodes zzso proteins that are required in zzso cells for zzso formation, nurse cell zzso structure and egg zzso We have analyzed a zzso zzso that zzso in many of the same processes and interacts with zzso zzso Both nurse cell and zzso zzso require cup to attain a normal zzso In addition, the gene is needed for the zzso to grow normally by taking up materials transported from the nurse zzso The gene encodes a zzso protein containing a putative zzso zzso Cup protein (but not cup zzso is transported selectively into the zzso in zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso It is strongly associated with large structures in the zzso and zzso region of nurse cells and, like zzso moves to the periphery of these cells in stages zzso Moreover, cup zzso zzso disrupt zzso zzso zzso We propose that cup, zzso and another interacting zzso zzso take part in a common zzso zzso with multiple functions during zzso
