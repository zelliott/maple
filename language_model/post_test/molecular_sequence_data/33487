A major limitation in zzso development is selectively targeting drugs to diseased zzso Growth factors and viruses have solved this problem by targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a growth factor important in both nervous system development and cancer, has a unique zzso domain zzso that targets to cell surfaces expressing its zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso 51, zzso We have harnessed this natural targeting ability of zzso by fusing the zzso of zzso to soluble zzso This fusion protein retains high affinity zzso binding to zzso and to cells that express zzso zzso resulting in a more potent zzso zzso In zzso it is targeted to peripheral nerve segments where it blocks the activity of zzso as a zzso cell survival zzso The fusion protein also efficiently blocks zzso and zzso signaling and reduces the proliferation of zzso breast cancer zzso These findings demonstrate the utility of the zzso of zzso in zzso targeting and provide a new way to block zzso signaling in cancer zzso
