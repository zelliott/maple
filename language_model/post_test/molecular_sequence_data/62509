The structural changes taking place in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso that are required to achieve zzso competence upon binding zzso and zzso have been simulated by means of targeted molecular dynamics zzso The hinge regions were characterized by structural zzso comparisons with zzso zzso zzso whose X-ray structure has been solved both in a closed and in an open zzso The zzso of zzso around the zzso that was observed during the zzso trajectory suggested that zzso could be playing an important role in the zzso zzso A quantum mechanical study of the reaction in the presence of the most relevant active site zzso was then performed at the zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso could be involved in the zzso of the zzso base at the zzso position to yield the zzso zzso of the zzso To establish the role of this oxygen atom in the reaction, ground states, transition states, and final products were studied using higher level zzso zzso methods starting from both zzso and zzso as alternative zzso zzso of both transition states showed that replacing the oxygen at position 2 of the zzso base by sulfur should accelerate the reaction zzso zzso with this result, zzso was shown to be a better zzso for zzso than the natural zzso zzso For simulating the final step of the reaction, zzso simulations were used to study domain opening upon product formation considering both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso release from the zzso was easiest in the simulation that incorporated the zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that the zzso intermediate spontaneously zzso back to the more energetically stable zzso zzso These results highlight a previously zzso role for zzso in the zzso mechanism of zzso and can have important implications for the design of novel zzso zzso
