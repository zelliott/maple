In both zzso zzso and the zzso studies of the nuclear distribution gene C zzso have strongly suggested that the zzso protein interacts with zzso which is the product of zzso a zzso of human zzso (also know as zzso one of the zzso genes for classical zzso We have isolated the human zzso gene and its two processed zzso The human zzso gene is highly zzso and its predicted zzso acid sequence shows zzso identity to mouse zzso and zzso identity to rat zzso The zzso structure of zzso its zzso zzso and expression pattern in human zzso were zzso zzso consists of at least 9 zzso ranging from 66 zzso to zzso zzso in size and 8 zzso from 92 zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and the total zzso region spans about 8 zzso zzso was mapped to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Northern analysis showed a major zzso zzso transcript in all fetal and adult zzso zzso zzso which amplify individual zzso of zzso were developed for zzso zzso
