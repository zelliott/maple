zzso of protein translation is a well-studied fundamental process, albeit zzso and more comprehensive determination of the exact translation initiation sites zzso was only recently made possible following the introduction of zzso zzso techniques that target protein zzso zzso translation initiation is of crucial importance, as truncated or extended proteins might fold, function, and locate zzso Still, as already shown for some zzso alternative translation initiation can also serve as a regulatory zzso By applying zzso zzso zzso fractional diagonal zzso we here isolated zzso peptides of a zzso zzso zzso and analyzed both zzso and alternative zzso We analyzed this zzso of zzso zzso which resulted in the identification of 650 unique zzso peptides corresponding to database zzso zzso Furthermore, 56 unique zzso peptides were identified that suggest alternative zzso zzso while zzso evidence of zzso led to an additional 33 such zzso To improve the overall sensitivity of the analysis, we also included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translations together with the zzso protein sequences in zzso To ensure the quality of the individual zzso zzso zzso matches were only accepted at a zzso probability threshold and were subsequently analyzed in detail by the zzso tool to automatically ascertain their compliance with several expert zzso Furthermore, we have also identified 60 zzso and 117 zzso zzso peptides that point to zzso as a zzso modification since these peptides did not start nor were preceded (in their corresponding protein zzso by a zzso zzso Next, we evaluated consensus sequence features of zzso acids and zzso acids across each of these groups of peptides and evaluated the results in the context of publicly available zzso Taken together, we present a list of zzso zzso and alternative zzso for zzso proteins and found that under normal growth conditions alternative zzso might zzso in zzso zzso in roughly one tenth of all zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso acid and zzso acid features zzso to these alternative zzso favor either zzso or zzso zzso following the start zzso or zzso zzso acids following the zzso zzso Finally, we also observed an unexpected high number of zzso peptides that could not be related to zzso and therefore suggest events of zzso zzso
