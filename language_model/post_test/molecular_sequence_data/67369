zzso in west central Africa zzso zzso zzso are zzso infected with zzso zzso viruses zzso that have crossed the species barrier to humans and gorillas on at least five occasions, generating pandemic and zzso forms of human zzso virus type 1 zzso as well as gorilla zzso zzso zzso in east Africa zzso zzso zzso are also infected with zzso however, their viruses zzso have never been found in zzso To examine whether this is due to a paucity of natural infections, we used zzso methods to screen zzso eastern chimpanzees in the Democratic Republic of the zzso zzso Uganda, and zzso We also screened zzso zzso zzso in the zzso a species not previously tested for zzso in the zzso zzso samples zzso zzso zzso were collected at 50 field sites, tested for species and subspecies origin, and screened for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of zzso samples from eastern zzso 323 were zzso positive and 92 contained viral zzso The zzso samples represented 76 individuals from 19 field sites, all sampled north of the zzso River in an area spanning 250,000 zzso In this region, zzso was common and zzso with seven field sites exhibiting infection rates of zzso or zzso The overall prevalence of zzso infection was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso In contrast, none of the zzso zzso samples from six sites was zzso zzso All newly identified zzso strains clustered in strict accordance to their subspecies zzso however, they exhibited considerable genetic diversity, especially in protein zzso known to be under strong host selection zzso Thus, the absence of zzso zzso cannot be explained by an insufficient zzso zzso Instead, greater zzso hurdles may have prevented the successful colonization of humans by zzso zzso zzso zzso
