We have identified three novel chicken zzso zzso genes among zzso clones derived from zzso cells of the chicken zzso cell line zzso Two of these zzso show DNA sequence zzso to the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the third shows similar levels of zzso to several zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA showed that all three chicken zzso possess the zzso structure and zzso zzso positions typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of the three chicken zzso locates them in three zzso regions which zzso to regions containing zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the currently known chicken and human zzso suggests that individual chicken and human zzso derive from common ancestral genes in patterns that reflect their zzso positions, indicating that the diversity of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso Since the function of the zzso is principally to act as zzso between zzso cells and specific zzso of responding immune cells, this suggests that the complex organization of the immune system and diversity of responding cells were largely in place at that zzso
