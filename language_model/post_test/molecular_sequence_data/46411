A synthetic bovine zzso zzso was zzso on the basis of zzso zzso usage via an overlap zzso strategy, prior to being expressed under the control of the zzso zzso rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the culture medium was achieved by using the existing signal zzso The plant expression zzso was introduced into rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The integration of the zzso gene into the zzso of the transgenic rice callus was verified via zzso DNA zzso amplification, and zzso expression in transgenic rice suspension cells was confirmed via Northern zzso zzso Western zzso analysis detected zzso proteins in the culture zzso having masses from 24 to 26 zzso following induction by sugar zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso was confirmed by gelatin zzso and was similar to that of the commercial zzso zzso The yields of zzso that accumulated in the transgenic rice cell suspension medium were 15 zzso at 5 days after sugar zzso
