The zzso of zzso zzso mediate bacterial binding to human zzso cell zzso We have previously shown that a zzso synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso contains the adherence binding zzso Another zzso strain, zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso et zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pp zzso American Society for zzso Washington, zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso which is zzso as compared to the zzso zzso In this study, the interactions between the zzso human lung zzso cells and the two zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso using a single zzso replacement analysis on the zzso zzso synthetic zzso of the zzso The ability of these zzso zzso to inhibit the binding of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells was zzso Six zzso zzso acid side chains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and nine zzso side chains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be important in zzso the zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso In addition, a flexible zzso analog with both zzso zzso replaced by zzso failed to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso This suggests that the interactions between the zzso zzso and the zzso cell surface receptors are dependent on the zzso zzso by the zzso bridge zzso and zzso The zzso considered to contribute to bacterial adherence are referred to as the zzso Four zzso and three zzso side chains were located in a structurally more rigid region of the zzso zzso as revealed by two-dimensional zzso studies zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso The structural aspects of the zzso interactions related to the mapped zzso sequences are zzso The zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso may suggest that zzso zzso could occur among different zzso strains so as to allow the zzso zzso to interact with the same zzso
