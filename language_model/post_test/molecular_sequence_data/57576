A zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso II zzso zzso has been isolated using the zzso screening approach and zzso zzso binding of zzso was found in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 approximately 3 zzso zzso and was displaced with zzso zzso peptides and zzso in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso responded to zzso by only a small increase in the concentration of zzso free zzso However, zzso study of the zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso provided strong evidence that it could functionally couple to a second zzso system leading to the zzso of zzso stores of zzso Northern zzso analysis in cultured zzso zzso smooth muscle cells demonstrated that the expression of this gene varies with the culture zzso These results indicate that the zzso encodes the functional and regulated zzso zzso of zzso zzso
