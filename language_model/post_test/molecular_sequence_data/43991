We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso clone containing the open reading frame sequence for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso for a smaller zzso than the rest of the genes described from zzso organisms and the deduced zzso acid sequence could be aligned with the zzso half of animal and plant zzso exhibiting pronounced similarity to other zzso zzso Further examination of the zzso zzso region by zzso analysis and establishment of the zzso zzso sites clearly indicated that the corresponding zzso apparently lacks sequences zzso a membrane zzso zzso The zzso gene is a single copy and is located on a zzso of zzso zzso as determined by zzso homogeneous electric field zzso The overall cellular distribution of zzso activity was investigated after differential zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso activity was primarily associated with the cellular soluble fraction because zzso of the total cellular activity was recovered in the zzso and was particularly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso the zzso can be efficiently zzso in a highly active form by using the expression zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso zzso is unique in the sense that it totally lacks the zzso sequences present in all zzso zzso zzso so far zzso
