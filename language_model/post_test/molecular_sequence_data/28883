zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is an important root pathogen of zzso that causes zzso disease and results in severe crop losses zzso Previously we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the fungus when induced with zzso Here we report cloning and partial characterization of three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by these genes had 38 to zzso zzso acid sequence identity and had zzso zzso sites characteristic of zzso The sequence of the zzso predicted zzso matched the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso that we zzso in earlier zzso We also characterized expression patterns of these genes by reverse zzso zzso was transcribed zzso and zzso of zzso was zzso zzso All three genes were transcribed in zzso however, zzso of zzso was observed only in zzso or in the presence of host zzso plant zzso
