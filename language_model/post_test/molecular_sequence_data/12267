We have isolated the entire gene coding for human zzso zzso zzso and untranslated zzso of human zzso zzso zzso were found in 7 zzso distributed throughout approximately 14 zzso of human zzso zzso The appearance of zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso in several human zzso was determined using a reverse zzso - zzso zzso In contrast to a previous report, this analysis has zzso shown that the size zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not due to alternate usage of any of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, DNA sequence analysis of the entire zzso zzso zzso region zzso within zzso 7 revealed multiple zzso sites which were shown to be zzso expressed in human skin zzso This differential usage of zzso sites within the zzso explains the appearance of multiple zzso zzso zzso of different zzso
