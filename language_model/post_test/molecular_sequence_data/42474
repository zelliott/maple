The zzso zzso major surface protein gene family encodes multiple zzso which differ predominantly in the zzso zzso We have isolated 4 full-length zzso zzso clones derived from zzso zzso zzso of a cloned isolate of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso These zzso along with the previously published zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso appeared to be mosaics of different combinations of zzso and 3' untranslated regions and sequences zzso the zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso shared as little as zzso sequence identity, comparable to the zzso diversity of zzso The zzso organization of zzso genes in zzso zzso is highly zzso there are at least 4 distinct zzso forms of zzso linked gene zzso with zzso cluster variation in gene sequence and in the number of gene zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that the arrangement of zzso genes in this zzso zzso isolate did not differ from that in the parental zzso
