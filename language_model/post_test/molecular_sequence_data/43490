To analyze the zzso repertoire of human zzso B cells and the zzso and zzso subsets, individual zzso zzso or zzso B cells were sorted and zzso as well as productive zzso gene zzso were amplified from zzso DNA and zzso In both subsets, the zzso family was overrepresented largely as a result of preferential usage of a small number of specific individual family zzso In the zzso B cell zzso all other zzso families were found at a frequency expected from random zzso whereas in the zzso population, zzso appeared to be overrepresented in the zzso repertoire, and also zzso selected since it was found significantly less often in the productive compared to the zzso zzso the zzso family was significantly diminished in the productive zzso of zzso B zzso zzso was the most frequently used zzso gene segment and was found significantly more often than expected from random usage in productive zzso of both zzso and zzso B zzso Evidence for selection based on the D segment and the zzso gene usage was noted in zzso B zzso No differences were found between the B cell zzso in zzso zzso the number of zzso or evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent and extensive in zzso compared to zzso zzso B cells, indicating that zzso memory B cells were more frequent in the zzso B cell zzso Of note, the frequency of specific zzso genes in the zzso population differed from that in the zzso population, suggesting that zzso stimulation imposed additional biases on the repertoire of zzso B zzso These results indicate that the expressed repertoire of zzso B cell zzso is shaped by zzso bias, as well as selection before and after zzso zzso Moreover, the influences on the zzso of zzso and zzso B cells are significantly different, suggesting that human peripheral blood zzso and zzso B cells represent different B cell zzso with similarities to zzso zzso and B-2 subsets, zzso
