We have characterized a new mouse gene highly transcribed in the zzso and a derived zzso gene expressed in the zzso The latter gene is present in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso but is absent in zzso zzso The sequencing of different clones from a zzso zzso library reveals a complex zzso regulation for the zzso zzso The use of several zzso alternative zzso and zzso and of two different zzso sites account for the zzso The different zzso zzso proteins with features of basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors with zzso to a new zzso zzso The presence of multiple zzso and zzso zzso sites suggests that their activity may be regulated by zzso In man, a zzso apparently derived from the same transcript as in mouse and showing zzso zzso in the coding region, is present within an zzso of another zzso Interestingly, although the human zzso is highly zzso in human, in the mouse it has only four zzso changes compared with the zzso of origin, and is still capable of zzso a zzso
