zzso mosaic virus zzso is a zzso rod shape virus made of zzso zzso that assemble around a plus sense zzso zzso The structure determination of zzso and of zzso viruses in general is a major challenge for both zzso and X-ray zzso In this report, we present the characterization of a truncated version of the zzso coat protein zzso that is suitable for zzso zzso The deletion of the zzso 26 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso generates a zzso that can be expressed to high level and easily zzso for production of an adequate zzso zzso The zzso gel shift zzso showed that zzso lost its ability to bind zzso in zzso suggesting that the zzso of the zzso is important for this zzso The fusion of a zzso His tag at the zzso improved the zzso of the zzso and allowed its concentration to zzso zzso The CD zzso of the truncated and the zzso proteins were similar, suggesting that both proteins are well ordered and have a similar secondary zzso zzso was zzso labeled for zzso studies and a zzso zzso spectrum confirmed the presence of a zzso structure and the zzso form of the zzso These results show that zzso is amenable to a complete and exhaustive zzso study that should lead to the first three-dimensional structure determination of a zzso rod shape zzso
