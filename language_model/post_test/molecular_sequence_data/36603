The occurrence of high-level zzso resistance zzso was determined for 73 zzso and 54 group A zzso by the zzso disc method, tube zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso method revealed the presence of genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso or both, in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso to at least one zzso among local zzso was 37% zzso Only one of 54 zzso zzso zzso produced zzso and exhibited high-level resistance to zzso and zzso In general, the three methods yielded comparable results, with only three discrepancies among the zzso zzso zzso zzso disc screening and tube zzso proved to be practical, reliable and zzso and thus suitable for routine zzso Of 20 zzso zzso strains tested, all were zzso Only one of seven zzso zzso zzso strains was zzso No association between the two forms of resistance was zzso
