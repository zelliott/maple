The native state of a protein zzso in zzso solutions represents one of the lowest states of Gibbs energy zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso Much progress has been made about the rules of protein folding zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso News 67, zzso and the dominant forces in protein folding zzso zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso However, the quantitative contributions of different Gibbs energy terms to protein stability remains a controversial issue zzso zzso & Unger, zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso A molecular zzso model has been proposed for the Gibbs energy of folding a zzso in zzso zzso from a zzso state to either the zzso state or the zzso state zzso zzso zzso zzso King, zzso & Evans, zzso (1992) zzso 32, zzso In this work, we present a zzso of the molecular zzso model for the Gibbs energy of folding natural and synthetic zzso from zzso zzso into zzso zzso The generalized model incorporates the intrinsic folding potential due to zzso zzso the cooperative folding effect due to zzso zzso and the location and length of zzso The utility of the model was demonstrated by examining the stability of zzso zzso of a number of natural zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso A zzso pancreatic zzso zzso the P alpha zzso in zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso and synthetic zzso (the zzso of different zzso acid zzso including zzso peptides (16 or 17 zzso zzso in zzso The zzso Gibbs energies zzso well with the experimental data on zzso The results also accounted for the effects of zzso acid substitution and temperature on the stability of zzso zzso of the test zzso
