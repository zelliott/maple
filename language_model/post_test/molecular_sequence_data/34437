A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso an industrial zzso zzso strain, was cloned and zzso This gene is predicted to zzso a zzso acid protein with significant zzso to the zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene blocked yellow zzso zzso synthesis and resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso confirming that it encodes zzso zzso Further research indicates that the yield of zzso gum production by zzso gene knockout zzso is almost the same as that by the zzso zzso In addition, a recovery method based on the zzso zzso broth of the zzso gene knockout zzso was zzso Compared to the volume of alcohol for the parent strain, much less alcohol zzso is required in this recovery process; thus, the costs of downstream zzso of zzso gum can be substantially zzso
