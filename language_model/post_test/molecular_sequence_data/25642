Variations have been made to the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso from zzso zzso at regions of the zzso that we believe determine specificity toward different zzso acids zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso Two regions of zzso that border the active site (but are not involved in the zzso zzso were altered in order to accommodate zzso with zzso side chains larger than that of the naturally preferred zzso zzso (R zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were made to increase the tolerance for large zzso zzso side zzso The triple and double zzso alone gave little improvement for zzso zzso The five changes together produced a broader zzso specificity zzso acid zzso with a zzso improved zzso for zzso to a value about zzso that of the native zzso for zzso zzso protein engineering enabled coupled changes in zzso structure to be obtained with greater probability of success than random zzso
