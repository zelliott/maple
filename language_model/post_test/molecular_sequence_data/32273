Human zzso zzso protein 1) is a member of a zzso family of zzso proteins that have an essential role in signal zzso in zzso and zzso This study demonstrates that most zzso zzso contain both a zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are functional in the human zzso zzso with the zzso domain involved in zzso and membrane binding by zzso and the zzso able to bind activated zzso zzso zzso and Ras zzso and zzso showing that these proteins associate with each other in zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein expression in zzso cells enhanced the zzso of zzso by zzso These data suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso
