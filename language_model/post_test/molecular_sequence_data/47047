We have examined the zzso activity of one class of zzso compounds in green zzso two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso equivalent zzso capacity zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso phase zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso were good zzso but not as effective as the zzso zzso zzso values for the zzso and other zzso of zzso were much lower than the corresponding zzso species but similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both potent zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to the those of zzso The compounds described zzso demonstrate the zzso activity of the zzso present in green beans and indicate the effect on zzso activity of sugar zzso in the zzso C zzso
