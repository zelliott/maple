The zzso diversity of six strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated at the zzso level and in terms of zzso and zzso profiles in an zzso cheese zzso The six strains were isolated from various sources, but all exhibited a dairy zzso zzso in zzso cheese model and high zzso zzso The six strains exhibited similar behaviors in terms of growth during cheese zzso while different zzso capabilities were zzso Even if all strains displayed large zzso similarities, sharing a large core zzso of almost 2,000 zzso the expression of this core zzso directly in the cheese zzso revealed major zzso differences that potentially could account for the observed different zzso zzso This work demonstrated that significant zzso zzso exist even among zzso zzso zzso zzso strains with the same dairy zzso
