zzso SARS coronavirus zzso sequences derived from the early, middle, and late zzso of the severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso epidemic were analyzed together with two viral sequences from palm zzso zzso characteristic of each phase were discovered, and the earliest zzso were similar to the animal zzso zzso Major deletions were observed in the zzso region of the zzso both at the start and the end of the zzso The neutral zzso rate of the viral zzso was constant but the zzso acid substitution rate of the coding sequences slowed during the course of the zzso The spike protein showed the strongest initial responses to positive selection pressures, followed by subsequent zzso selection and eventual zzso
