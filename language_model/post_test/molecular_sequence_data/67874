This study genetically zzso zzso zzso obtained from pigs intended for human consumption in northeastern zzso zzso zzso and sequencing techniques were zzso zzso were conducted using the brain and tongue of 20 pig heads purchased at butcher shops in the city of zzso zzso zzso Overall, 11 zzso zzso zzso designated zzso were zzso Application of zzso zzso with seven molecular markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified six different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, 12, 14 and 15 were indistinguishable by this technique, forming a single zzso the remaining zzso were characterized as distinct zzso However, when five genetic markers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were employed in zzso zzso all zzso strains of zzso zzso were shown to be zzso All zzso differed from Type I, II and III zzso zzso using both zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso underestimated the true diversity of the zzso zzso population in this zzso Thus, DNA sequencing is the preferred technique to zzso the genetic diversity and population structure of zzso zzso strains from zzso Moreover, it is necessary to develop new molecular markers to group and characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso from South zzso
