The reconstruction of zzso trees from molecular sequences is zzso by the variety of zzso and criteria used to evaluate trees, making it difficult to compare the results of different zzso A global method of zzso zzso reconstruction described here, zzso zzso can be used with any zzso algorithm, including distance, maximum likelihood, and zzso zzso It incorporates a zzso analysis to provide a uniform zzso criterion for comparing the results from diverse zzso To examine the usefulness of the method, the origin of the zzso has been investigated by the analysis of zzso small zzso zzso zzso Three common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kimura zzso support the zzso zzso whereas one zzso zzso supports the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are the closest zzso relatives of the zzso
