zzso zzso genes with an analogue of an zzso site in the first or the second position of zzso 12, or in the second position of zzso 61 were constructed and zzso into zzso zzso The genes with the zzso in zzso 12 exhibited more focus formation than a normal zzso zzso while the gene with the zzso in zzso 61 did zzso zzso cells were isolated from the zzso and the zzso genes present in the zzso were zzso A point zzso to A in the modified position was found most frequently in the cases of zzso genes modified in zzso zzso Surprisingly, point zzso in the adjacent position were also zzso These results indicate that zzso and not zzso was mainly incorporated into the sites opposite to the zzso site zzso and that incorrect zzso were incorporated in the position adjacent to the zzso site zzso
