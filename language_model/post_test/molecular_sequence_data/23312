To clone the entire coding sequence of rat premature nerve growth factor zzso beta zzso and construct its zzso expression zzso 

The gene of premature nerve growth factor zzso beta zzso was amplified by zzso from zzso rat zzso zzso product was zzso into zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was identified by the restriction zzso zzso and DNA sequence zzso Then the gene of premature nerve growth factor zzso beta zzso was cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified by the restriction zzso zzso 

The DNA sequence was identical to the published sequence zzso zzso zzso the restriction zzso mapping product of the zzso zzso zzso was nearly 750 zzso which matched the expected zzso 

The entire coding sequence of premature nerve growth factor zzso beta zzso was successfully cloned and its zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed, which will provide the basis for studying the gene of zzso
