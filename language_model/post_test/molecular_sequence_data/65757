zzso is a highly specialized storage organ with three sets of zzso It is one of the most economically important zzso in zzso zzso development involves parental zzso and zzso A thorough study of the zzso zzso particularly the nuclear zzso may provide critical insight into the regulation of seed zzso Unfortunately, zzso is extremely rich in starch grains and protein bodies of different sizes, making zzso studies on zzso zzso particularly the zzso zzso very zzso Here we have developed a zzso method to remove large starch grains and an zzso method to recover zzso zzso zzso Using these methods, we have identified zzso proteins from the nuclear enriched fraction of rice zzso including zzso factors, zzso modification zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso 208 zzso are hypothetical zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is poorly zzso In addition, analyses of the zzso data using zzso zzso have identified 59 putative zzso proteins and 40 putative zzso zzso Our studies have developed a method to remove starch grains and recover zzso zzso zzso The methods should be zzso to other zzso
