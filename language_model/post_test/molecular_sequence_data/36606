The tobacco zzso zzso nuclear zzso contains long tracts of DNA zzso in excess of 18 zzso with high sequence zzso to the tobacco zzso zzso Five zzso clones containing these nuclear DNA sequences zzso more than one-third of the tobacco zzso zzso The absolute size of these five zzso is unknown but potentially includes uninterrupted sequences that are as large as the zzso zzso zzso An additional sequence was cloned consisting of both nuclear and zzso DNA zzso The nuclear component of the clone is part of a family of repeats, which are present in about 400 locations in the nuclear zzso The zzso sequences present in zzso DNA were very similar to those of the corresponding sequences in the zzso zzso However significant sequence zzso including base zzso insertions and deletions of up to 41 zzso was observed between these nuclear sequences and the zzso zzso Associated with the larger deletions were sequence motifs suggesting that processes such as DNA replication zzso and zzso of hairpin zzso may have been involved in deletion zzso
