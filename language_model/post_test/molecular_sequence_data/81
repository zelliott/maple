Located at the important tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso that mediates regulatory signaling of energy zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso We identified zzso as a zzso gene in zzso zzso through expression profiling and zzso zzso We found that zzso was expressed in all normal adult zzso but low or silenced in zzso zzso gastric cancer cell lines, well correlated with its zzso island zzso zzso zzso zzso was further detected in zzso zzso gastric primary tumors, but none of normal gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with tumor high zzso zzso zzso analysis of 37 zzso sites at the zzso CGI by zzso zzso sequencing confirmed its zzso zzso zzso could be reversed by pharmacological zzso with zzso indicating a direct zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in silenced gastric tumor cells dramatically inhibited their zzso and migration, possibly through zzso zzso expression and zzso the reorganization of zzso through zzso zzso by zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso is common and zzso in gastric cancer, and zzso acts as a functional tumor zzso involved in gastric zzso
