Human zzso is a zzso protein that mediates zzso upon zzso with zzso zzso The gene lies on the long arm of zzso 10, consists of nine zzso and spans more than 26 zzso of zzso We previously reported the presence of a zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso delta zzso in human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso delta TM is generated by alternative zzso of the intact zzso 6, which encodes the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we describe three novel forms of zzso zzso that are generated by alternative zzso of zzso 3, 4, 6 and zzso These three zzso zzso undergo a zzso and produce truncated zzso because of the appearance of a stop zzso in the altered open reading zzso On zzso of the peripheral blood zzso cells, a decreased expression of alternatively spliced zzso zzso species correlated with increased zzso expression of zzso These results suggest that differential expression of alternatively spliced zzso zzso may play a role in regulation of zzso function via regulation of the production of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso
