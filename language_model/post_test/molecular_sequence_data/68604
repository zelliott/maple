A synthetic gene coding for zzso zzso was used to produce large amounts of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found to accumulate in the zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso bodies located at the pole caps of cells were detected using zzso zzso zzso were designed to fuse the zzso gene to DNA fragments zzso signal peptides for an zzso protein zzso or for a zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso No significant maturation was observed with these fusion proteins which were found in an zzso form in the zzso The influence of charge disposition at the zzso of the mature portion of the protein was investigated by replacing positively charged zzso acids with zzso zzso None of the introduced zzso had any zzso Various factors that might affect zzso zzso and folding were examined in an attempt to obtain zzso By fusing zzso to the precursor zzso protein zzso a large fraction of the zzso protein was correctly processed and transported to the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso after zzso zzso possessed similar specific activity to zzso zzso produced in Chinese zzso zzso zzso
