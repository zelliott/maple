We have cloned two novel zzso motor zzso zzso zzso motor proteins zzso from mouse brain by utilizing a zzso consensus zzso The first protein was the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso motor zzso and we designated this protein zzso The other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is novel, with no significant similarity to known zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso was specifically expressed in adult zzso and was zzso localized to zzso structures in cell bodies and zzso but was not detected in zzso zzso microscopic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso associates with zzso body zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions as the motor for the transport of zzso zzso in zzso
