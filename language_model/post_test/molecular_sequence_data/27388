zzso was a toxin from the saliva zzso of zzso zzso To study the zzso function of zzso and confirm its biological status and significance, we extracted total zzso from the saliva zzso and amplified the zzso of zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso long and zzso a zzso composed of 118 zzso acids including 2 zzso 17 zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso We cloned the zzso into the zzso zzso and expressed the zzso protein zzso in zzso coli zzso Fusion zzso with the zzso zzso was a 15 zzso soluble zzso Using the zzso affinity zzso we zzso zzso Furthermore, we determined the biological activities of zzso To examine the ability of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso we used zzso zzso The results showed that, zzso inhibited zzso induced proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso manner, the zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that, the zzso of the cells treated with zzso were stained much brighter than that of zzso cells due to zzso zzso Furthermore, the DNA zzso patterns from the cells treated with zzso were also zzso These results demonstrated that zzso could induce zzso of zzso zzso Cell zzso migration and invasion are critical processes in tumor zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso of zzso cells to zzso in a zzso zzso In order to determine the effect of zzso on zzso cells migration toward zzso we used zzso containing insert zzso zzso showed a significant zzso on zzso cells migration, the zzso rate was zzso In the invasion zzso the zzso and zzso were used to imitate environment in zzso The results of invasion zzso revealed that, zzso significantly inhibited zzso induced invasion of zzso zzso Taken together, these results revealed that zzso had typical functions of zzso toxin protein and will be valuable in developing zzso zzso zzso
