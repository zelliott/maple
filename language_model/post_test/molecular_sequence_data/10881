The zzso domain defines a zzso region of about 120 zzso and has been found in over 40 proteins to zzso It is located predominantly at the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso where it may function as a repression domain, and less frequently in zzso and zzso zzso where it may function as a zzso interaction zzso A zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia zinc zzso is fused to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in a subset of acute zzso zzso zzso where it acts as a potent zzso The exact role of the zzso domain in zzso interactions and/or zzso regulation is zzso We have zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic light zzso and equilibrium zzso experiments show that zzso forms a zzso with a zzso below 200 zzso zzso scanning zzso and equilibrium zzso experiments are consistent with the zzso zzso undergoing a two-state unfolding transition with a zzso of zzso degrees C, and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso has significant secondary structure including about zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have prepared zzso of the zzso that are suitable for a high resolution structure determination using zzso zzso The zzso form in the space group zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso b zzso zzso and c zzso zzso A and contain 1 protein zzso per zzso unit with approximately zzso zzso Our data support the hypothesis that the zzso domain mediates a functionally relevant zzso function in zzso The crystal structure of the zzso domain will provide a paradigm for understanding the structural basis underlying zzso domain zzso
