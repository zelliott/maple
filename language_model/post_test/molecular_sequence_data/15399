Many important zzso interactions are zzso by the binding of a short zzso stretch in one protein to a large zzso segment in zzso Recent efforts have provided hundreds of examples of new peptides binding to proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is available zzso known zzso or readily zzso but where no structure of the zzso complex is zzso To address this zzso we present an approach that can accurately predict zzso binding sites on protein zzso For peptides known to bind a particular zzso the method predicts binding sites with great zzso and the specificity of the approach means that it can also be used to predict whether or not a putative or predicted zzso partner will zzso We used known zzso complexes to derive preferences, in the form of spatial position specific scoring zzso which describe the zzso environment in zzso proteins for each type of zzso acid in bound zzso We then scan the surface of a putative binding protein for sites for each of the zzso acids present in a zzso partner and search for combinations of zzso zzso acid sites that satisfy constraints deduced from the zzso zzso The method performed well in a benchmark and largely agreed with experimental data mapping binding sites for several recently discovered interactions zzso by zzso including zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso hook with zzso zzso zzso The method, and associated statistics, is an excellent tool for predicting and studying binding sites for newly discovered peptides zzso critical events in zzso
