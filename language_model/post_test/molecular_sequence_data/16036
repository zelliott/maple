zzso fatty acid zzso zzso causes the production of zzso acids in zzso zzso and avian zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the duck zzso probably has a single copy of the zzso zzso The zzso gene with its zzso regions was cloned in zzso zzso 35 and zzso This zzso gene consists of seven zzso which showed complete zzso with the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso region were a series of six adjacent potential zzso zzso A search for steroid hormone zzso binding sites revealed no putative binding sites within the zzso region of this zzso However, putative binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso receptors were found within the first zzso Within a zzso segment, eight putative binding sites were found, along with both zzso and zzso box zzso The adjacent putative hormone binding sites might play a functional role in the regulation of expression of this zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this gene is highly expressed specifically in the zzso zzso though transcripts could be detected in zzso zzso brain, and zzso
