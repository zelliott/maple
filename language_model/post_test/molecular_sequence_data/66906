To evaluate the role of the zzso region in zzso zzso toxin zzso activity, processing, and zzso sequential zzso zzso and point zzso were created by zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity on zzso cells, zzso of zzso and the capacity to induce zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso showed that deletion of only 2 zzso acid zzso at the C zzso significantly reduced zzso biological activity and deletion of eight or more zzso acid zzso obliterated zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and reverse zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso lacking seven or fewer zzso acid zzso in the zzso region are processed and expressed similar to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso lacking eight or more zzso acids at the C zzso are expressed similar to zzso zzso but are zzso We concluded that the C zzso of zzso is not tolerant of modest zzso acid zzso suggesting that it is biologically important for zzso zzso
