All zzso carrier protein primary and zzso structures were gathered into the zzso zzso They are classified into 16 families by zzso acid sequence zzso with members of the different families having sequences with statistically highly significant zzso These zzso are supported by zzso structure zzso zzso zzso structures from a number of families are very similar, suggesting that these families may come from a single distant zzso zzso zzso mode analysis was conducted on zzso determined zzso structures, showing greater fluctuations at chain zzso and zzso than in most zzso Their modes overlap more so within families than between different zzso The zzso structures of three zzso carrier protein families that lacked any known structures were predicted as zzso
