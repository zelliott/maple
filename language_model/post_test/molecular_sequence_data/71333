zzso studies of zzso signaling have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining large quantities of zzso biologically active zzso zzso In this paper, we report the production in zzso zzso cells of biologically active zzso zzso zzso zzso or alkaline zzso zzso proteins are zzso by concentrated zzso cells in a form that is suitable for quantitative zzso experiments with yields of 5 and zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso also are described for the production in zzso cells of an zzso fusion of the zzso domain zzso of mouse zzso 8 with a yield of 20 zzso We demonstrate the use of these proteins for studying the interactions between soluble zzso and various zzso zzso membrane anchored or zzso zzso and a set of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In a solid phase binding zzso the affinity of the zzso zzso fusion for the zzso mouse zzso zzso fusion is approximately 9 zzso
