We have isolated and zzso the gene zzso the human zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso The gene is split into seven zzso by six zzso the last zzso as in all zzso zzso genes zzso to date, is completely 3' untranslated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene with the other zzso genes showed that the zzso arrangement of the human zzso zzso gene is analogous to that of the other zzso type zzso zzso We have also mapped the human zzso zzso gene to the long arm of zzso zzso the corresponding mouse gene has been mapped to zzso zzso This zzso together with a number of others such as the zzso alpha 1, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is part of the largest zzso group between mouse and zzso
