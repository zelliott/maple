The sequence of zzso zzso of the 3' zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso 3 of zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes is presented and compared to that of the zzso strains of zzso zzso It allowed us to determine consensus sequences derived from the zzso zzso signals and the order of protein conservation zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso The sequences of the N gene of a fox rabies virus isolate from France zzso 1), zzso bat virus zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso two European bat zzso zzso zzso 1, and two zzso zzso 2 were also determined to study the genetic diversity throughout the whole zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of this zzso Six clearly distinct zzso can be distinguished according to their percentage of zzso acid zzso zzso 2 zzso bat zzso and 3 zzso zzso are the most zzso distant from the zzso and classical rabies viruses of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and 5 zzso are closely related to each zzso zzso 6 is represented by zzso Compared to the N proteins of the four principal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso New Jersey and zzso Indiana, zzso virus, and zzso zzso the N gene of zzso exhibits a lower genetic zzso
