zzso and zzso zzso members of small zzso zzso zzso to specific zzso compartments and regulate zzso zzso To carry out their cellular functions, zzso interact with numerous and structurally diverse zzso zzso Over the years, a number of zzso complexes have been zzso and their structures reveal shared binding modes including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We review available structural information and provide a framework for in-depth analysis of zzso The unifying features that we identify are organized into a zzso scheme for different modes of zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modes of zzso Additionally, we highlight structural zzso that are the basis of zzso zzso We conclude by expanding on functional implications that are emerging from available structural information under our proposed zzso zzso
