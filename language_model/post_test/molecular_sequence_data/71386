In zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that zzso entry into zzso by zzso zzso the universal zzso zzso zzso that regulates the zzso transition in all zzso zzso A search for zzso of the zzso arrest caused by zzso of zzso led to the isolation of a new zzso of zzso (named zzso the gene coding for zzso zzso which is required to zzso zzso The zzso zzso carries a zzso to zzso acid substitution at zzso acid 155 that results in a partial loss of zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso in combination with the point zzso zzso or zzso showed severe zzso zzso zzso interactions were not observed in combination with point zzso in other zzso zzso suggesting that zzso specifically interacts with zzso This synthetic lethal zzso zzso (or zzso strain had normal levels of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso activity, indicating that zzso is required to enable zzso to interact with its zzso zzso or regulators, rather than for its proper folding or zzso In a zzso background, zzso zzso cells were sensitive to temperature as well as to other stress agents, such as zzso ethanol and zzso Under these stressful growth conditions, the zzso cells displayed zzso B arrest and zzso zzso patterns, indicating that a subset of proteins involved in zzso and zzso is highly dependent on zzso zzso for zzso
