Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disease caused often by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso located at the side of an zzso large cluster of water in the zzso zzso reduces the zzso of the zzso Why and how these water molecules are directly related to the excessive zzso of the zzso have not been investigated in structural zzso 

This work compares the structure of the zzso zzso with its wild type zzso It is found that the water zzso in the zzso interface of zzso is zzso having a zzso distribution with 16 water molecules tightly packed in a small deep region surrounded by 22 zzso including zzso These water molecules are zzso with their surrounding zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso across zzso zzso zzso indicating their importance in preserving the overall zzso zzso As the structural zzso induced by the zzso is not zzso we zzso that the excessive zzso of the zzso zzso is attributed to the easy propagation of zzso flexibility from the surface into the core via the large cluster of zzso It is indeed found that the B factor zzso in the wet region is higher than other regions, and, more importantly, the B factor zzso in the wet region is maintained in the deeply buried zzso zzso dynamics simulations revealed that for the zzso structure at normal temperature, a clear increase of the zzso zzso is observed for the wet region zzso with the large cluster of zzso zzso Such increase is not observed for other zzso regions or the whole zzso This clearly suggests that, in the zzso zzso the large water cluster is responsible for the zzso interface flexibility and overall zzso and it ultimately leads to the zzso of this zzso 

Our study reveals that a large cluster of water buried in protein zzso is fragile and zzso closely related to the structure, function and evolution of the whole zzso
