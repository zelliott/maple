zzso community structure and dynamics were investigated in two different, zzso zzso wastewater treatment reactor zzso zzso zzso bed zzso and expanded zzso sludge bed zzso treating synthetic dairy zzso during operating temperature transitions from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso over a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on quantitative real-time zzso data, along with zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso communities developed in a different manner in these reactor zzso A comparable level of performance was recorded for both systems at zzso and zzso but a more dynamic and diverse microbial community in the zzso zzso supported better stability and zzso capacity towards low temperature zzso The emergence and maintenance of particular bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with efficient protein zzso in the zzso while protein zzso was inefficient in the zzso A significant community shift from a zzso and zzso towards a zzso community was demonstrated during operation at zzso in both reactor zzso
