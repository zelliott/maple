zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso an electron transfer zzso zzso and an integral membrane anchor zzso zzso zzso is not zzso and the production of zzso to this zzso has not been zzso We have zzso zzso at the zzso with a zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to which zzso are readily zzso We were able to use this tagging technique to monitor expression and zzso of zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso Growth properties of zzso zzso coli, strain zzso zzso zzso suggest that the expression of zzso is lethal to zzso zzso The zzso could be overcome by utilizing an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso as the zzso Growth conditions of culture density, duration of zzso temperature of incubation after induction and media conditions were investigated to zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to alleviate the problem arising from the toxicity of zzso expression in zzso tissue culture was also zzso A zzso expressing zzso was zzso into zzso or zzso zzso The presence of expressed zzso was confirmed using specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso was localized to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not appear to be toxic to the zzso zzso These data suggest zzso to overcome zzso problems associated with the zzso of integral membrane proteins like zzso
