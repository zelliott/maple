We have identified a minimum functional domain of human zzso for zzso activity using deletion zzso Four zzso were constructed by zzso deletion zzso to delete one or more zzso growth factor zzso structures from the domain of human zzso containing six repeated zzso zzso These deletion zzso were expressed zzso in zzso cells, and their protein zzso zzso activities in the culture medium were zzso One zzso zzso zzso which contains the fourth, zzso and sixth zzso structures expresses apparent zzso zzso However, neither zzso (24 zzso zzso nor zzso (16 zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso and its zzso effects on plasma zzso time and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed almost the same zzso activities as zzso which contains six consecutive zzso structures of zzso It was concluded that zzso is the minimum functional domain for both protein zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso
