zzso is a genetically modified zzso hybrid which is widely cultivated in Canada and exported to some other countries for production of zzso or zzso In this study, the zzso sequences zzso the right borders of the integrated transgenic sequences in the zzso zzso were characterized and showed high similarities with the bacterial artificial zzso clone of Chinese zzso zzso qualitative zzso chain reaction zzso methods were established with the zzso and zzso targeting the junction regions to produce a 123 base pair zzso product for the zzso event and 92 zzso for the zzso zzso The absolute detection limit of qualitative zzso was zzso initial template copies for the zzso event and 50 copies for the zzso zzso zzso detection methods were established, with the absolute zzso limit being approximately 25 initial template zzso
