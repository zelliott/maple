A novel zzso zzso found in an African patient with zzso cell anemia undergoing bone zzso transplantation is zzso zzso suspected by inconsistent zzso typing zzso zzso then recognized by zzso and finally characterized by zzso sequencing, this novel zzso is designated zzso It differs from zzso by a point zzso zzso to zzso at position 17 of zzso 3 causing zzso to zzso change at zzso 96 of zzso domain, a zzso position among zzso class I zzso zzso sequence analysis further revealed the presence of both normally and zzso spliced zzso species in established cell zzso The abnormal species zzso to partial zzso of zzso 3 presumably due to the zzso change in zzso 3, which constitutes a new consensus zzso zzso site within this zzso We zzso that the observed blank is essentially the consequence of qualitative change in a critical region of this novel zzso as abnormal zzso species are relatively less abundant than normal zzso Because the zzso 96 of the zzso class I heavy chain is directly involved in interaction with zzso another interesting possibility is that an zzso change in this position would zzso such interaction and consequently could affect the zzso specificity of zzso or its expression or zzso
