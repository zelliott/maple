The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso associated zzso zzso plus end tracking families play central roles in the regulation of zzso zzso dynamics and the proper formation of zzso zzso architecture and zzso zzso members comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 3, the zzso zzso of protein zzso 2A and the zzso zzso zzso repeats known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso members are zzso and have five zzso zzso zzso counterparts are zzso and have two zzso zzso zzso determination of the zzso domain reveals that the six zzso repeats are aligned to form an oblong zzso The zzso domain face composed of zzso zzso forms a contiguous, zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso loop 1 is an zzso signature, zzso zzso zzso that is a prime zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The arrayed organization of zzso zzso is critical for the zzso mechanism of zzso indicative that multiple zzso sites are required for plus end tracking zzso The zzso family has been zzso as containing a single zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso domain structure zzso as a metric to zzso zzso zzso it is anticipated that zzso contains two additional cryptic zzso zzso zzso The presence of additional zzso zzso implicates zzso as an ancient zzso relative that uses a similar, zzso mechanism to zzso track zzso zzso
