Recent studies have shown that protein zzso C zzso delta is zzso activated at the onset of zzso induced by zzso agents, tumor necrosis factor, and zzso zzso However, the relationship of zzso delta zzso to induction of zzso is zzso The present studies demonstrate that full-length zzso delta is zzso at zzso to a zzso active zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The results also demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in cells is associated with zzso zzso nuclear zzso induction of zzso phase DNA and zzso By contrast, zzso of full-length zzso delta or a zzso inactive zzso delta zzso had no zzso zzso The findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso delta by a zzso zzso contributes to zzso changes associated with zzso
