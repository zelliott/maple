The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prime regulator of red cell production in zzso yet the precise nature of its interaction with specific cell surface receptors is poorly zzso zzso defining zzso of EPO that are involved in zzso zzso we have developed zzso conditions for the expression of zzso human EPO zzso at high levels in zzso cells using modified zzso and 5-liter stirred reactors, zzso a zzso procedure for the zzso of this EPO without zzso and zzso forms of EPO zzso with either a zzso influenza virus zzso or a consensus sequence for in zzso zzso Compared to EPO expressed in zzso cells, zzso from zzso cells in zzso with simple, neutral zzso of limited size, yet as zzso presently using zzso procedures, possesses exceptionally high in zzso activity zzso or zzso 500,000 zzso Thus, this form of EPO should prove advantageous for direct zzso zzso Regarding zzso and zzso zzso forms modified at the zzso zzso zzso fully retained zzso binding and in zzso biological zzso In contrast, forms modified at the zzso zzso zzso were inactive and did not compete for zzso zzso indicating that integrity of this domain is essential for zzso zzso For active zzso forms, the specific binding of zzso zzso to native zzso and the utility of zzso zzso in zzso binding and zzso studies also were zzso The development of these unique, highly active forms of human EPO should advance studies of essential interactions between this zzso and its cell surface zzso
