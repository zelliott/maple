The zzso are a family of zzso zzso that are characterized by repeated zzso zzso and a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso growth, zzso and zzso Our initial basement membrane zzso screen using zzso D, a tumor zzso zzso contained fragments of zzso and full length zzso In this report, we evaluate the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrate that both zzso and zzso suppress zzso tumor zzso zzso labeling and zzso zzso further reveal that zzso suppression of zzso tumor growth is associated with diminished zzso and also enhanced zzso of zzso cells and tumor zzso In contrast, zzso zzso tumor zzso with a minimal zzso zzso zzso D zzso of zzso produces a zzso with nearly the same molecular weight as zzso and this zzso (named zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Additionally, degradation of basement membrane by zzso D zzso both zzso fragments and zzso which function to inhibit zzso
