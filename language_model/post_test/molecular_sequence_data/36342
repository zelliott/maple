We have generated mouse embryonic stem cell lines that carry zzso zzso trap zzso integrated in their zzso zzso cell lines were zzso for zzso expression in zzso stem cells and at day zzso zzso and zzso of development in zzso zzso obtained after zzso zzso In 13 cell lines the zzso reporter gene was expressed in zzso stem cells zzso zzso as monitored by zzso zzso 46 cell lines did not show zzso zzso activity zzso zzso In zzso zzso one-third of the zzso 59 embryonic stem cell lines gave rise to a variety of zzso Six out of the 13 zzso lines and 14 out of the 46 'white' lines showed zzso and temporally regulated patterns of zzso expression and were additionally zzso on day zzso The majority of patterns showed zzso exclusively or predominantly in structures of the developing nervous system, three patterns were observed only or predominantly in zzso structures and five patterns were found exclusively in zzso zzso The analysis of DNA from cell lines that gave rise to zzso patterns in zzso zzso showed that in 11 out of 15 cases simple zzso had occurred at a single site while in the remaining four cell lines multiple copies had integrated either at a single or at multiple zzso zzso sequences from five reporter gene zzso have been zzso At present, three integration sites have been zzso further and in all three cases we have identified transcribed sequences in the zzso DNA and isolated corresponding zzso zzso The expression patterns of two of these genes were zzso by zzso in zzso zzso In both cases, expression of the zzso genes was more widespread than the corresponding zzso zzso suggesting that the reporter gene responded to only a subset of the regulatory elements of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso trap zzso in embryonic stem cells can be used to efficiently identify zzso zzso patterns during mouse zzso and to isolate zzso genes expressed in zzso and temporally regulated zzso
