zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso or zzso adhere to immobilized peptides and proteins that possess appropriate sequences of zzso acids in addition to a zzso accessible zzso zzso In an attempt to further define the nature of these targets, we surveyed the ability of zzso cells to adhere to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beads coated with a zzso zzso from a library of zzso unique zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso of beads from the library, whereas zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso bound to zzso zzso to zzso of randomly selected zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso had a distinctly different adherence zzso than did cells expressing zzso The former zzso in groups or zzso of cells, whereas the latter zzso initially as single cells, an event which was followed by the build up of zzso zzso zzso with adherent cells were removed, and the zzso attached to the zzso was determined by zzso acid zzso All adhesive beads carried a zzso sequence motif zzso zzso that possessed a vast zzso zzso zzso was sequence specific and was inhibited when soluble zzso identical to the immobilized zzso was zzso The zzso zzso recognized some peptides that went zzso by zzso The sequence motif of adhesive peptides identified by this method is common in proteins and offers so many possible sequence combinations that target recognition by the zzso proteins is clearly zzso A zzso recognition system provides the zzso with the potential of adhering to a multitude of proteins and zzso an advantage for any zzso attempting to establish a zzso or zzso relationship with a zzso
