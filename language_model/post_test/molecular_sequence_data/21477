The zzso status of the zzso zzso variable region zzso genes zzso by chronic zzso leukemia zzso clones defines two disease zzso Patients with zzso zzso have a more aggressive disease and a worse outcome than patients with cells having zzso zzso gene zzso Moreover, up to zzso of the zzso zzso clones exhibit very similar or identical B cell receptors zzso often zzso by the same zzso zzso These zzso zzso have been classified into defined zzso The presence of an zzso gene zzso zzso and the zzso of a skewed gene repertoire compared with normal B cells together with the expression of stereotyped receptors by zzso zzso clones may indicate zzso by zzso zzso This zzso stimulation may occur prior to or during zzso zzso but it is unknown whether this zzso continues after zzso has zzso In this study, we focused on seven zzso cases with stereotyped zzso zzso zzso found among a cohort of 700 zzso in six, the cells expressed zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso as reported for zzso zzso zzso One case exhibited special features, including expression of zzso or zzso by different zzso zzso to an zzso switch, zzso inclusion at the zzso locus in the zzso cells and a particular pattern of zzso zzso zzso the data indicate a process of zzso zzso of the fully transformed zzso cells leading to the expansion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
