zzso zzso consist of two zzso zzso and these zzso are assumed to interact with each other to produce the zzso zzso We have studied the relationship of the zzso structure of the hairpin zzso and the zzso activity by dividing and zzso the zzso A hairpin zzso zzso was divided at the hinge region, and the main part was joined to a zzso zzso using zzso or zzso These zzso retained the zzso activity in the presence of the rest of the zzso indicating that the active zzso could be maintained if the two zzso zzso with each zzso Based on the these results, we designed a new type of hairpin zzso by replacing one of the zzso To maintain the interaction of the zzso zzso were inserted at a zzso These zzso zzso zzso complexes showed zzso activity that was dependent on the zzso zzso These modifications in the primary structure of the hairpin zzso confirm the structural requirement for the zzso reaction and provide information for the correlation of the zzso structure with the zzso of the hairpin zzso
