zzso cancer zzso growth is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because current zzso zzso therapies of PC lead to resistance, novel approaches to block zzso activity are urgently zzso 

We inhibited zzso function beyond the level of hormone binding by blockade of the zzso groove in the zzso domain zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso selection, the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso functions was determined in zzso cells that were zzso zzso with zzso expression zzso or were incubated with synthetic zzso zzso zzso coupled to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso were used to study zzso zzso target gene expression in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso efficiently zzso with zzso zzso interaction and specifically inhibited zzso reporter gene zzso The zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, nor zzso active gene zzso The zzso also specifically blocked in zzso interactions of zzso zzso with zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso expressed by an expression zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso efficiently blocked zzso zzso interaction and inhibited full-length zzso reporter gene zzso It hardly affected zzso and zzso activity, but the effect on zzso active promoters was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited expression of zzso and zzso but hardly affected zzso and zzso 

Our results show that the zzso zzso groove may function as a target to overcome therapeutic failure that arises during current zzso zzso zzso
