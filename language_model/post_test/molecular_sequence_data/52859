Conventional zzso is a motor protein implicated in the transport of a variety of zzso zzso along zzso The zzso zzso consists of two heavy chains with motor zzso at their zzso zzso and two light zzso which, together with the zzso zzso of the heavy zzso are proposed to mediate binding to zzso Since the light chains are represented by multiple zzso zzso at their zzso zzso they are presumed to specify zzso targeting to zzso Previously, we isolated five zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso and found that one of them (B or zzso zzso associated with zzso To obtain additional evidence proving the specific location of various zzso light chain zzso on zzso we made an zzso against a 56 zzso sequence found at the zzso regions of the zzso D and E zzso By indirect zzso this zzso specifically labeled the zzso complex in cultured zzso In western blots of total cell zzso it recognized two close zzso one of which zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, the results of this and previous studies demonstrate that different zzso light chains are associated with different zzso in zzso
