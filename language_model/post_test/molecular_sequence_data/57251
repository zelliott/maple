To obtain a molecular basis for the similarities and zzso in the functional, chemical, and zzso properties between zzso and the other zzso a predicted three-dimensional model is zzso The predicted structure was assembled using molecular modeling techniques, as well as secondary structural prediction zzso in conjunction with global secondary structural information from zzso zzso To add zzso to this model, the structure was refined using energy zzso techniques to diminish the likelihood of structural zzso and energetically zzso van der zzso contacts arising from the large number of zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso The refined model overall showed a loosely packed, zzso structure with an zzso ratio of zzso zzso side chains were zzso dispersed over one end zzso zzso and the center surface of the zzso the other end (N zzso was zzso The zzso section also possessed a large loop through which water could easily zzso Such a zzso structure could account for the zzso type of zzso driven zzso exhibited by zzso Other chemical and zzso data are in good agreement with the refined zzso
