zzso virus zzso causes zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Due to the lack of a complete zzso zzso the molecular biological properties of this virus are not zzso We have cloned and zzso the functional large zzso zzso segment of zzso and shown that it has zzso activity using a zzso system with zzso zzso zzso The complete L zzso segment is zzso zzso long and encodes an L protein of zzso zzso zzso which functions as an zzso zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso was constructed by zzso either the zzso zzso or the green fluorescent protein gene in the zzso orientation with the zzso and zzso zzso regions of the small zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the reporter zzso and the L protein and zzso (N zzso expression zzso The reporter activity was zzso in a zzso manner with increasing concentration of either the L or N protein expression zzso Furthermore, the reporter activity could be zzso by the zzso zzso protein as well as by other zzso These results show that the zzso zzso system is a powerful tool for studying zzso and for rescuing infectious viruses from cloned zzso
