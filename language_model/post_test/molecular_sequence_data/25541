To investigate the sequences important for assembly of zzso into zzso zzso we used a combined approach of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells in zzso and zzso in zzso assembly of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso missing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso not only integrated without zzso into zzso zzso filament networks in zzso but they also formed zzso filaments with zzso in zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso missing the highly zzso L L E G E zzso common to all intermediate filament proteins and found at the zzso end of the zzso rod domain, also assembled into filaments with only a somewhat reduced zzso Even a zzso zzso zzso missing approximately zzso of the rod assembled into zzso although in this case filaments zzso zzso Despite the ability of these zzso to form filaments in zzso they often zzso zzso filament organization in zzso In contrast, small zzso in the zzso end of the rod domain more severely disrupted the filament assembly process in zzso as well as in zzso and in particular restricted zzso For both zzso and zzso rod zzso the more extensive the zzso the more severe the zzso Surprisingly, while zzso could be almost zzso blocked with large zzso zzso formation and higher ordered lateral interactions still zzso zzso our in zzso data zzso provide a molecular basis for the dominance of our zzso in zzso zzso offer new insights as to why different zzso may generate different zzso in zzso and zzso delineate the limit sequences necessary for zzso to both incorporate properly into a zzso zzso filament network in zzso and assemble efficiently into zzso zzso filaments in zzso
