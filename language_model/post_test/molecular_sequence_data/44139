zzso are ecologically important, but zzso identification requires techniques which are not zzso for use in quantitative studies of zzso alternative methods of accurate recognition of zzso species in mixed populations are therefore zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso which zzso with unique sequences of the small zzso zzso zzso have been exploited as zzso zzso in the identification of zzso In this paper we describe the preparation and application of zzso which specifically zzso with a common zzso species, zzso zzso The sequence of zzso in the zzso zzso gene of this flagellate was determined and compared with those of related species to select unique zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso in zzso Five sequences in different parts of the zzso zzso gene were used to design zzso zzso zzso zzso Published sequences were used to make zzso that zzso with all zzso zzso or any cellular zzso zzso and zzso were designed not to zzso with zzso zzso zzso conditions for zzso were zzso In all cases, zzso zzso zzso with the cells, but zzso zzso were only bound to a limited zzso All five zzso targeted to zzso zzso proved to be zzso they zzso well with this species, but not with three other species of the same zzso nor with three more zzso related flagellate species, nor with a zzso nor with zzso These zzso provide a means of zzso measuring the proportion of zzso zzso cells in samples of mixed zzso
