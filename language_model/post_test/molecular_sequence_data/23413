We report the discovery of previously zzso short consensus repeats zzso within human and zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of available zzso protein and expression databases suggests that these are actually zzso remnants of zzso previously reported in other complement control proteins zzso zzso with the zzso motifs of the 11 defined zzso of zzso justifies the designation zzso because of the close similarity to the g zzso found in zzso and zzso To date, we have identified five such zzso in human and zzso zzso one in human and zzso zzso but none in either rat or mouse zzso in keeping with the number of internal zzso of the long zzso repeat zzso found in zzso and zzso In fact, at the zzso level, the ancestral zzso must have contained eight zzso rather than seven as previously zzso Since zzso zzso are found immediately downstream of d zzso we suggest that there must have been a functional zzso set which has been retained by zzso and zzso but which is zzso in zzso or zzso Interestingly, zzso is also present in the zzso component of mouse zzso The zzso of the g zzso must have occurred prior to the formation of zzso zzso and prior to the zzso events which resulted in zzso zzso In this context, the apparent conservation of zzso zzso may be surprising and may suggest the existence of mechanisms unrelated to protein zzso These results provide examples of the many processes which have contributed to the evolution of the extensive repertoire of zzso
