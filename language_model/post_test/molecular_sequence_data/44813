The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso protein zzso belongs to the large zzso family of zzso zzso It is a zzso DNA binding protein that makes use of a high energy zzso zzso intermediate to catalyze zzso and zzso zzso at specific zzso sites zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and used to further dissect the zzso From this we have cloned and characterized a zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso that we believe is the minimal zzso competent domain of zzso zzso has zzso activity and converts zzso suicide zzso to the zzso zzso complexes characteristic of zzso zzso However, it does not show efficient binding to zzso site DNA in a native gel shift zzso We propose that zzso zzso consists of three functional and structural zzso zzso zzso specify recognition of zzso DNA sequences distant from the region of strand zzso zzso zzso contribute to specific recognition of zzso sequences at the sites of strand exchange and possibly to zzso zzso and zzso zzso carry out the chemistry of DNA zzso and zzso The finding that the active site zzso zzso is in a uniquely zzso region zzso and reinforces the recently solved zzso crystal structure, which places zzso at the center of a zzso acid flexible zzso It is proposed that zzso is likely to represent a generic zzso family domain that thus zzso a specific route to studying the chemistry of DNA zzso and zzso in these zzso
