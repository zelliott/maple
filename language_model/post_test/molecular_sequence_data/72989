zzso zzso clones designated zzso 4, 5 zzso zzso and zzso 33, 34, 35 and 36 zzso zzso isolated from a tomato leaf zzso library zzso were zzso Southern analysis showed that zzso is zzso by a zzso gene while zzso 34, 35, 36 and zzso and zzso are members of small gene zzso DNA and protein database searches revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are novel zzso of unknown zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso encodes a zzso II 10 zzso zzso and zzso encodes zzso The zzso sequence is identical to the zzso tomato protein previously reported to be zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso 4 and 5 increased during leaf zzso and zzso and zzso were also expressed at high levels during leaf development and in other plant zzso The zzso zzso was associated more specifically with leaf zzso although low expression was also detected in green zzso The zzso for all zzso clones decreased during tomato leaf development and zzso and all except zzso were expressed at low levels in other plant zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and the decrease in abundance of zzso provide good molecular markers for leaf zzso
