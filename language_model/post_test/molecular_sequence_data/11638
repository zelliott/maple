Besides their zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a second zzso zzso This 35 zzso circular zzso has a number of features reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that along with other genes the circle codes for 25 different zzso all of which are zzso Six of the zzso have some unusual features, and one has an zzso the only one found so far on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso usage indicates that the 25 zzso are sufficient to decode all the protein genes present on the zzso The maintenance of such a zzso but complete translation system is further evidence for the functionality of the zzso
