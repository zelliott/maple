The zzso of toxic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A7 is initiated by a zzso zzso zzso The smaller zzso zzso zzso component zzso the zzso reduction of free zzso according to a zzso zzso zzso The reduced zzso is then used by the larger zzso component zzso to zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso We have determined the zzso structure of zzso containing a bound zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the first structure of a member of this zzso zzso zzso We have also determined the zzso structure of reduced zzso in complex with oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso is a single domain zzso protein with each zzso zzso being organized around a zzso zzso and a capping zzso The tightly bound zzso prosthetic group zzso zzso 10 zzso binds near the zzso zzso and the zzso face of the zzso zzso ring is fully exposed to zzso The addition of zzso to zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso and the zzso product was bound in a wide zzso groove adopting an unusual folded zzso with ring zzso This is the first observation of an zzso that is very likely to react with a folded compact zzso zzso The zzso zzso models strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso binds in the zzso zzso after release of zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso data indeed showed that zzso is able to bind one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso In conclusion, the structural data provide evidence that zzso contains a dual binding zzso for zzso and zzso zzso which alternate during zzso
