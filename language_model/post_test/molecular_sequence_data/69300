Identification of the zzso zzso site of zzso by a zzso reaction with zzso zzso was confirmed by spectral zzso zzso of zzso provided peptides containing modified zzso zzso The major product, zzso to zzso which corresponded to labeling at zzso was recovered in zzso yield, and its structure was demonstrated by zzso acid analysis, zzso degradation, and mass zzso Yields of labeled zzso zzso and zzso identified by zzso analysis, were in the proportion of zzso zzso is permanently zzso but can be further activated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso vary from two to three times the equivalent values for zzso zzso zzso a zzso competitive inhibitor of zzso was a zzso competitive inhibitor of zzso Thus, zzso part of zzso zzso affects the zzso process and, when modified zzso permanently activates zzso zzso binding with zzso supported the kinetic data obtained with zzso This permits the integration of protein zzso zzso equilibrium zzso and zzso data to demonstrate a fine interaction between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso resulting in subtle structural changes when the native zzso is zzso modified at zzso
