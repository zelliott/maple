A zzso moderately zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from zzso from Lake zzso in the Inner Mongolia zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and did not display zzso zzso zzso zzso grew in a complex medium supplemented with zzso % zzso marine zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso belonging to a cluster with zzso zzso % gene sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso albeit emerging as an independent lineage from members of these two zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso based on zzso acid and possessed zzso as the major respiratory zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso and zzso The polar zzso pattern consisted of zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso could be clearly differentiated from its zzso zzso on the basis of several zzso zzso and zzso zzso Therefore strain zzso is considered to represent a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
