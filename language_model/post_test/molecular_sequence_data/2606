A human zzso zzso zzso expression zzso library was screened for zzso zzso by zzso with a zzso mouse zzso zzso A total of four positive overlapping clones were identified, and the sizes of the zzso were shown to vary from zzso to zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the human zzso revealed that the largest zzso zzso contained both a zzso open reading frame zzso 582 zzso acids and a 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso zzso of human zzso sequences with mouse zzso sequences revealed zzso identity on the zzso level and zzso identity with the deduced zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the human zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso growth zzso repeats and the sequence zzso zzso a potential cell binding site, two features previously identified in mouse zzso The sequence zzso a consensus sequence for zzso zzso was also zzso The newly isolated human zzso were zzso to analyze the expression of the zzso gene by cultured human zzso Northern zzso revealed a single zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in human skin zzso and in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso However, the human zzso cell line zzso which expressed zzso zzso did not contain zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso of the relative zzso zzso abundance in zzso zzso zzso cells indicated that zzso zzso levels were approximately the same as those for the zzso B2 zzso Finally, one of the zzso zzso was used to map the zzso gene onto locus zzso of zzso zzso
