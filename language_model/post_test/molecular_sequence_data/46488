A remarkable diversity of zzso peptides is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso as zzso or zzso Between 50 and 200 different zzso peptides can be found in a single zzso species, each having its own complement of zzso zzso are zzso by a few gene zzso here we analyze the evolution of the zzso in a zzso species zzso zzso More than 90 zzso sequences from 11 different zzso species were used to build a zzso zzso zzso with a species tree based on standard genes reveals multiple gene zzso events, some of which took place before the zzso zzso By zzso several zzso from other zzso species recorded in zzso we date the major zzso events after the divergence between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, likelihood approaches revealed strong positive zzso the magnitude depends on which zzso lineage and zzso locus is zzso The four major zzso zzso defined are consistent with the current division of the zzso into families and zzso based on the zzso zzso The function of three of these zzso (the zzso the zzso and zzso has previously been zzso The function of the remaining zzso corresponding to the zzso has not been zzso This zzso is also found in several other zzso species zzso within zzso The analysis revealed a surprisingly diverse origin of zzso zzso from a single species, zzso zzso This zzso approach that defines different genetic lineages of zzso zzso peptides provides a guidepost for identifying zzso with potentially novel zzso
