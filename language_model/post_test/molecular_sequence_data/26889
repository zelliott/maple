The architecture of the rice zzso which is determined mainly by the number and length of primary and secondary zzso zzso is of importance in both zzso and zzso zzso The position and number of primary branches are established during the phase transition from zzso to zzso growth, and several of the genes identified as participating in this process do so by regulating the zzso activities of zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that controls zzso branch zzso Here, we report on a novel rice zzso short zzso zzso which is defective in rice zzso zzso and thus leads to the zzso zzso Gene cloning and characterization indicate that zzso encodes a putative zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso This conclusion is based on the findings that zzso contains a zzso zzso domain consisting of 12 zzso zzso and that the zzso fusion protein is localized in the plasma zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed in the zzso of the branches of young zzso which is consistent with the predicted function of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analysis implies that zzso might be a nitrate zzso However, neither nitrate zzso activity nor any other compounds transported by known zzso proteins could be detected in either a zzso zzso or zzso system, in our study, suggesting that zzso may need other zzso to be able to function as a zzso or that it zzso unknown zzso in the zzso rice zzso
