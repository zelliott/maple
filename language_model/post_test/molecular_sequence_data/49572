zzso are major zzso zzso junctions that provide stable zzso contacts and mechanical strength to zzso zzso by zzso zzso intermediate filaments of adjacent zzso zzso zzso are zzso core components of the zzso and belong to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso Currently, there are three known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by distinct genes that are zzso expressed to determine their tissue specificity and differentiation state of zzso zzso In this study, we cloned a novel mouse zzso gene sharing high zzso to both mouse and human zzso We propose to designate the previously published mouse zzso gene as zzso and the new gene as zzso Analysis of zzso organization of the zzso and zzso genes revealed significant zzso The full-length mouse zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a precursor protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein shares zzso and zzso identity with mouse zzso and human zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso panel demonstrated that while zzso zzso was expressed in zzso to zzso zzso and adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso To assess zzso zzso a zzso expression construct of zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso was found at the zzso border and was recognized by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso we have cloned and characterized a novel member of the mouse zzso gene family, zzso
