Common zzso zzso zzso are thought to have zzso the Atlantic island zzso (the zzso zzso and the zzso from neighboring zzso populations zzso and north zzso within the last million zzso However, colonization may have occurred separately from north Africa to the zzso and from zzso to the zzso (as would be predicted zzso or in one wave from zzso to the zzso and then to zzso and the zzso These alternatives have different implications for the evolution of zzso and zzso differentiation in island zzso To determine the most likely colonization route, we estimated the zzso relationships among island and zzso subspecies of common zzso using sequences from four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso 5, and the control zzso The most strongly supported zzso zzso places the zzso subspecies together as the sister group to a zzso zzso containing the island zzso This is consistent with a single wave of zzso and suggests that patterns of similarity among Atlantic island common zzso such as blue zzso short wings, and long zzso are due to common colonization history rather than to zzso evolution in a common island zzso However, spectral analysis of zzso splits showed that although zzso of island zzso is favored, there is also substantial support for their zzso zzso We attribute the latter to the zzso effect of zzso at multistate sites and to the relatively rapid sequence of colonization events which provided insufficient time for the zzso of strong zzso zzso These problems are likely to be significant impediments in attempts to test hypotheses of zzso histories of recently evolved populations and zzso
