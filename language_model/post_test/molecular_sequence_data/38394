The zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso that cleave zzso from zzso protein zzso We have recently cloned zzso a novel member of this family from zzso zzso zzso To analyze the role of zzso in zzso and zzso we have cloned a full-length human zzso zzso by screening a human zzso zzso library as well as by zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso This zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with all of the structural motifs of a zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is strongly expressed in human liver and zzso zzso analysis has demonstrated that zzso is a nuclear zzso Interestingly, the gene zzso human zzso maps to zzso zzso This region, known as zzso syndrome critical region, contains a minimal area of 2 zzso and is consistently deleted in zzso syndrome and related zzso The syndrome is marked by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso cardiac zzso Taken together, our results broaden the understanding of a new human zzso zzso zzso and suggest that this gene may also be related to zzso zzso
