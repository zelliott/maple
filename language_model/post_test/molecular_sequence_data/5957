In zzso binding zzso and zzso of cell zzso with zzso zzso have implicated the zzso alpha 3 beta 1 as a zzso for a variety of zzso zzso However, reports of alpha 3 beta zzso interactions are inconsistent, and zzso studies have suggested that alpha 3 beta 1 is not sufficient for cell attachment to zzso other than zzso zzso We used zzso to study zzso zzso of the alpha 3A zzso domain zzso in different cultured cell zzso Using standard fixation and zzso methods, zzso specific for alpha 3A stained most cell types in a diffuse pattern, consistent with previous zzso Surprisingly, however, chemical zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and extraction of the zzso prior to zzso revealed alpha 3A in focal contacts of most cells tested, suggesting that the zzso domain was concealed in intact focal contacts by zzso or other zzso zzso The alpha 3A zzso localized to focal contacts in several cell types cultured on zzso zzso 5, zzso 1, type IV zzso or zzso In contrast, alpha 5 and alpha V zzso were detected in focal contacts only in cells grown on their known zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso our results show that alpha 3A beta 1 responds to a broad spectrum of zzso zzso Time course comparisons of the recruitment of alpha zzso from different zzso receptors suggested that zzso of alpha 3A beta 1 to zzso focal contacts was independent of the recruitment of alpha 5 and alpha 4 zzso However, other studies have shown that alpha 3A beta 1 does not mediate initial cell zzso to many of the zzso that induced its focal contact zzso including zzso zzso we suggest that alpha 3A beta 1 may be a secondary zzso with zzso functions for a broad spectrum of zzso zzso
