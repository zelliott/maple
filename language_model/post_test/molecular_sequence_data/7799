zzso is the principal positive regulator of zzso synthesis and zzso in zzso zzso is able to control zzso synthesis through feedback zzso at the zzso level, presumably by binding to its zzso which interacts with one or more negative zzso hormone response elements zzso present within the human zzso zzso In the present study we have identified the specific negative zzso within the zzso promoter and characterized their ability to interact with zzso hormone receptors zzso and the zzso X zzso zzso Our analysis demonstrates that zzso and dependent regulation of the human zzso promoter is restricted to the zzso beta 1 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified two discrete regions that are responsible for zzso zzso negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso of potential zzso binding zzso within these regions identified three separate zzso zzso 4 from zzso to zzso base pairs zzso site 5, zzso to zzso zzso and site 6, zzso to zzso zzso which act in combination to allow for negative zzso zzso and/or deletion of each of these sites leads to a loss of negative regulation of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso shift zzso of site 4 and its surrounding zzso revealed that this region of the promoter is capable of binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of site 4 leads to a loss of all binding to this zzso The region encompassing sites 5 and 6 binds only zzso zzso and the addition of zzso to the binding reaction leads to a loss of specific zzso zzso To assess the functional importance of site 4 and its surrounding zzso we zzso zzso zzso along with zzso beta with zzso promoter zzso containing either site 4 or its zzso In the presence of wild type site 4 zzso zzso zzso enhanced negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso and or deletion of site 4 leads to a loss of this zzso These data demonstrate that two structurally different negative zzso cooperate to allow for negative regulation of the human zzso promoter and that negative regulation is zzso zzso and modulated by the zzso zzso through a novel negative zzso
