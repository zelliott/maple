Studies suggest that zzso zzso and zzso nuclear receptors zzso are involved in regulation of zzso cell growth and zzso To probe mechanisms for zzso effects, we studied prostate zzso cells, investigating the effect of zzso on expression of the zzso zzso gene 2 zzso which regulates the zzso transition of the cell zzso 

zzso of zzso on cell proliferation were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was investigated using zzso Northern zzso and transient gene expression zzso The putative zzso response element was determined by zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso the proliferation of prostate zzso cells and human zzso prostate zzso cells zzso but not zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso by 50% promoter activity of the zzso gene in zzso cells but not zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the putative zzso hormone response element zzso zzso blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso zzso from in zzso translation, or with nuclear extracts from zzso cells and zzso cells, demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso 

These results suggested that the zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells by zzso zzso gene expression through the consensus zzso zzso
