zzso in the zzso gene zzso have recently been associated with zzso dominant familial zzso zzso zzso in families linking to the zzso locus on the long arm of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to screen zzso in a panel of 40 patients with zzso to identify the types and location of zzso and to calculate what proportion of this zzso condition is attributable to zzso zzso 

zzso products were generated from zzso DNA with zzso designed to amplify the coding sequence of zzso The zzso products were screened for zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso and by direct zzso 

In total, eight zzso were identified, seven of which were zzso Three were deletions zzso zzso and zzso one was a nonsense zzso zzso and four were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Eight zzso have been identified in the zzso gene in a cohort of 40 unrelated patients with zzso This result indicates that zzso zzso are responsible for only zzso of zzso index cases and suggests that the other zzso zzso may account for more cases than previously zzso
