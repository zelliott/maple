zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso specific for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso inflammatory changes in these two zzso in zzso zzso We report here on the identification of an zzso zzso of bovine zzso that is highly zzso and zzso in the Lewis zzso The zzso which comprises the sequence zzso of bovine zzso was shown to be zzso by its capacity to stimulate zzso zzso against whole zzso A comparison was made between zzso zzso and another zzso zzso which is zzso but is zzso and zzso in the Lewis zzso zzso zzso was found to be superior in its zzso zzso the minimal dose of zzso needed to induce cellular immune response or disease in Lewis rats zzso zzso is zzso to 1,000 times smaller than that of zzso In addition, unlike the zzso disease induced by zzso the disease produced by zzso resembled that induced by whole zzso in its zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in the Lewis rat was localized to the 10 zzso at the zzso zzso no such activity was exhibited by the truncated zzso zzso which comprises the 20 zzso at the zzso zzso of the full zzso The usefulness of this unique experimental system in analyzing the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is zzso
