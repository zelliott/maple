The Arc zzso of zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins that use zzso zzso in a zzso zzso for operator zzso Here, Arc is shown to bind to its operator site as a zzso When zzso of Arc zzso zzso and an active zzso of Arc (78 zzso are used in gel zzso experiments, five discrete zzso complexes are zzso This result is as expected for operators bearing zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratios of the two zzso zzso zzso of binding zzso support the conclusion that Arc binds to a single zzso operator site as a zzso The zzso binding reaction is highly cooperative zzso constant zzso zzso and involves at least two coupled zzso In the first reaction, two unfolded zzso interact to form a folded zzso zzso & zzso zzso Rapid dilution experiments indicate that the Arc zzso is the zzso significant zzso species and allow an estimate of the equilibrium zzso constant for zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso The rate of association of zzso complexes shows the expected zzso dependence on the concentration of free Arc zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso complexes is a zzso process with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio of these kinetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides an estimate for the equilibrium constant for zzso of the zzso zzso to two free Arc zzso and the zzso An independent determination of this complex equilibrium constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained from equilibrium binding zzso
