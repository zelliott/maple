To identify early changes in gene expression during the zzso transition induced by chronic zzso zzso total zzso was extracted from zzso zzso anterior zzso muscles of rats and amplified by differential display zzso Among the signals of zzso expressed zzso a zzso approximately 300 zzso in zzso which was almost zzso in control zzso muscles but prominent in zzso zzso and normal zzso muscles, was zzso This zzso was cloned and identified as corresponding to the zzso of the muscle zzso protein zzso Its differential expression in control, zzso zzso and zzso muscles was verified by Northern zzso zzso against zzso were used to identify by zzso analysis a protein of 22 zzso the predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso revealed strong zzso for zzso in all fibers of normal zzso muscle and faint zzso of some type zzso and type I fibers in control zzso zzso These fibers increased in number and zzso intensity in zzso zzso zzso zzso thus seems to play an essential role during the zzso of zzso and/or zzso structures in transforming adult muscle zzso
