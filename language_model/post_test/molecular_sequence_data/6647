The mob locus of zzso coli encodes functions which zzso the synthesis of active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso in the zzso gene have been constructed using zzso zzso zzso The mob locus is expressed at very low levels under both zzso and zzso growth zzso Neither additions to the growth media zzso zzso or zzso nor secondary zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso affected the level of zzso Two zzso initiation sites and their associated promoter regions have been identified upstream of zzso Both of the promoter regions show a poor match to the zzso and zzso consensus sequences for zzso 70 zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso which zzso all available mob zzso has been zzso Two zzso were identified, arranged as a single zzso zzso The zzso zzso have predicted molecular masses of zzso Da and zzso zzso zzso The DNA has been zzso into a zzso zzso system and the predicted products zzso The zzso gene encodes protein zzso which has been zzso to zzso and brings about the zzso of inactive zzso in cell extracts of mob zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso with a putative zzso binding zzso All available mob zzso which have been selected for by their ability to grow zzso in the presence of zzso are located in the zzso zzso
