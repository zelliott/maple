zzso zzso factor I zzso was originally identified as a host factor required for DNA replication and zzso of zzso zzso zzso with viral basic zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to core zzso and stimulate zzso from zzso zzso Human zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which differ from each other only in their zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso has a zzso zzso activity comparable to that of zzso another zzso binding zzso whereas zzso has only a weak zzso Analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso by zzso revealed that zzso interacts directly with zzso basic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso region itself is not sufficient for zzso since an zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso domain of zzso which has the intact zzso region does not support zzso zzso We detected the beta form of zzso in zzso zzso and eggs by zzso and the cloning of its zzso led us to conclude that zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso structure as well as zzso structure through direct interaction with zzso basic zzso
