In Brazil, there are near 20 zzso and almost 120 species of zzso of which zzso reproduce zzso zzso zzso however, may also take zzso To gain insight into useful molecular markers in zzso scorpion species, we studied DNA zzso using two molecular zzso simple sequence repeat anchored zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing of the zzso C zzso zzso I of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Three different groups were zzso group 1, composed of 1 female and 14 zzso group 2 with 1 female and 17 descendants, both from the city of zzso State of zzso zzso zzso Brazil, and the third group that consisted of three adult zzso from the city of zzso zzso zzso The profiles generated by zzso were identical for all zzso while partial sequencing of zzso showed the presence of zzso After aligning zzso zzso one of the groups presented 18 zzso and the second 8 zzso The two groups were differentiated by two diagnostic zzso We did not find evidence of zzso zzso The results are in agreement with the zzso mode of reproduction of this species and sequencing of the zzso gene enabled the separation of zzso zzso
