Human zzso zzso is an zzso that has the capacity to zzso DNA at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and, therefore, can be considered a putative DNA repair zzso The zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso acid sequence was obtained for several zzso fragments by mass zzso The sequences were matched through the zzso data base with an incomplete human zzso zzso which was used as a probe to retrieve the zzso of the zzso sequence from a separate zzso zzso The complete zzso which codes for a zzso acid protein zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was shown to possess the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with other zzso proteins identified a zzso zzso indicative of an zzso domain, and a second motif associated with several different zzso There is reasonable sequence similarity to putative open reading frames in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but similarity to zzso T4 zzso zzso is limited to the zzso and zzso zzso noted zzso Northern zzso revealed a major transcript of approximately zzso zzso and a minor transcript of approximately 7 zzso zzso heart, and kidney appear to have higher levels of zzso than brain, zzso or zzso zzso zzso of human zzso cells indicated that the zzso resides predominantly in the zzso The gene zzso the zzso was mapped to zzso band zzso
