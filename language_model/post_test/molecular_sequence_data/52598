zzso receptors expressed on the surfaces of zzso zzso cells provide an advantageous locus for targeting gene therapy zzso to zzso zzso and/or tumor zzso In this study, we engineered a series of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell binding motif contained within the ninth type III repeat of zzso and displayed these tumor zzso targeting motifs zzso within the context of zzso zzso leukemia envelope zzso zzso Comparative studies of envelope incorporation into viral particles and evaluation of the cell binding properties of the targeted zzso revealed critical structural features, thus identifying a subset of optimal zzso zzso a modified zzso to evaluate viral binding to target cells, we observed a significant zzso of zzso binding to human zzso cells following sustained zzso exposure to zzso zzso for equivalent zzso zzso zzso as zzso on zzso zzso cells, zzso displaying zzso escort proteins significantly enhanced the zzso efficiency from zzso to zzso in human zzso zzso cell cultures zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso in human zzso vein zzso cell zzso cultures zzso zzso zzso In zzso these studies zzso an engineering approach to identify a subset of zzso that are zzso incorporated as envelope zzso proteins into zzso zzso and that, by functioning to improve the binding efficiency and zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso cells, may have therapeutic potential for targeting gene delivery to the zzso zzso
