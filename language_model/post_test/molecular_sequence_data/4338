zzso zzso generated at various zzso stages differ markedly in zzso It is well documented that zzso H chain genes in human fetal liver are limited with regard to zzso diversity and use of diversity zzso It is unclear whether these characteristics persist in zzso cell H chain genes of adult bone zzso Using zzso H chain zzso zzso and sequence analysis, we analyzed the diversity of zzso H chain third zzso determining regions zzso in adult bone zzso zzso and mature B zzso zzso cell zzso sequences exhibited adult characteristics with respect to zzso size, distribution of N regions and usage of diversity zzso This suggested that zzso cells in adults are distinct from fetal B cell precursors with regard to zzso H chain diversification zzso At the DNA sequence level, zzso diversity in mature B cells was similar to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, frequently contained a consecutive stretch of zzso zzso zzso which were rare in mature B zzso We propose that highly zzso zzso zzso may be zzso selected on the basis of structural limitations imposed by the zzso binding zzso At the same time, usage of zzso zzso sequences zzso to support zzso loop zzso may be promoted by positive zzso
