The human zzso zzso family consists of 15 genes located on human zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family and is expressed in various zzso Two types of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, have been predicted from zzso zzso zzso 1 has been isolated from human zzso whereas zzso 2 has been isolated from zzso However, the regulation and characteristics of these zzso are zzso We identified the first three zzso zzso zzso and zzso by determining their zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso contained the initiation zzso of zzso 2, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributed to zzso 1 zzso The dual zzso promoter zzso revealed three promoter regions, corresponding to the first zzso of each zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso thalamus, and zzso nervous system zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was detected only in zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso except for zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the initiation zzso for zzso 2 in zzso zzso was zzso zzso 2 had additional zzso zzso acids at the zzso terminal and was zzso from the zzso cell line zzso zzso 1 fused with green fluorescent protein zzso was distributed to cellular zzso whereas zzso zzso was retained in the zzso zzso We suggest that not only alternative zzso but also zzso use of multiple promoters regulate the expression and zzso trafficking of zzso zzso
