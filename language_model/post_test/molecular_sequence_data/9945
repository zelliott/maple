A gene zzso zzso a zzso is present in the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso the strain producing zzso acid and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located zzso zzso downstream from and in the opposite orientation to zzso zzso the zzso C zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso similar to other class A zzso produced by zzso zzso (to zzso of the zzso zzso motif of class A zzso as well as of zzso acids in otherwise zzso regions in the zzso may explain the low zzso and zzso activities of the zzso The zzso has been zzso to zzso and found to bind zzso a result reflecting a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso to zzso were found in all tested zzso producers, but several other zzso species which produce a zzso do not contain genes for zzso zzso zzso
