Among the most numerous objects in the zzso zzso show enormous diversity in zzso and genetic zzso We have zzso 7 zzso zzso and compared their zzso zzso All seven zzso share a core zzso with T4 that is interrupted by several zzso regions zzso where most of their divergence zzso The core primarily includes zzso of essential T4 zzso such as the zzso structure and DNA replication zzso In contrast, the zzso contain mostly novel genes of unknown function and zzso A few of the zzso genes that can be assigned putative functions, such as a series of novel Internal zzso are implicated in zzso adaptation to the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso appears to be zzso into discrete segments that zzso different functions and behave differently in zzso Such zzso may be critical for these large and complex zzso to maintain their flexibility, while simultaneously allowing them to conserve their highly successful zzso design and mode of zzso
