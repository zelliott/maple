We have previously employed an zzso spreading strategy using zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein to enhance DNA vaccine potency because DNA vaccines lack the intrinsic ability to amplify in zzso Recently, studies have demonstrated that the protein zzso by zzso of zzso disease virus type 1 zzso exhibits some degree of zzso to the zzso zzso protein and features the property of zzso zzso We therefore generated a DNA vaccine zzso zzso zzso linked to a model zzso human zzso type 16 zzso We demonstrated that compared with mice vaccinated with DNA zzso zzso zzso mice vaccinated with zzso zzso DNA exhibited a significant increase in number of zzso zzso zzso precursors as well as stronger tumor prevention and treatment zzso Furthermore, our data indicated that the zzso effect was zzso zzso These results suggested that the development of vaccines zzso zzso fused to a target zzso might be a promising strategy for improving DNA vaccine zzso
