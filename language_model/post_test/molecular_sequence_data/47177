An zzso 30 K zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso major zzso core zzso Like its zzso in zzso virus, the mature zzso 30 K protein is derived by zzso zzso of a precursor at a zzso zzso zzso The zzso 30 K protein is the first zzso structural zzso protein to be zzso and zzso of its characteristics provides evidence for the assumption that zzso similarities observed between zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso reflect corresponding similarities at a molecular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso locus identified an zzso zzso a zzso of the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the conceptual product of this zzso showed zzso zzso sequence identity to those of various zzso The presence of this gene in the zzso zzso supports the hypothesis that there is a substantial correspondence in basic zzso processes of members of the two zzso zzso despite their zzso of divergent host zzso In contrast, the relative positions of the 30 K and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso provide further evidence of substantial zzso zzso subsequent to divergence of these viral zzso
