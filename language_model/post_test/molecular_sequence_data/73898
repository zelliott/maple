The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recently cloned from zzso zzso zzso brain, and zzso plays a central role in maintaining near constancy of zzso We previously showed that the zzso normally present in New Zealand white rabbits is associated with an elevated set point for zzso zzso release (the level of zzso zzso zzso hormonal zzso This observation suggested an zzso in the zzso mechanism in the rabbit zzso a possibility we have now pursued by zzso and characterizing the rabbit zzso of the zzso The cloned rabbit kidney zzso zzso shares a high degree of overall zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with the zzso human, and rat zzso although it differs slightly in several regions of the zzso domain potentially involved in binding zzso By Northern analysis and/or zzso a similar or identical zzso is also expressed in zzso zzso C cells, small and large zzso and in the thick ascending limb and collecting ducts of the zzso When expressed zzso in zzso cells and zzso functionally through zzso zzso increases in zzso the rabbit zzso shows apparent affinities for zzso zzso and zzso that are indistinguishable from those observed in studies carried out zzso using the human zzso zzso at least as assessed by its ability to increase zzso when expressed in zzso cells, the intrinsic functional properties of the rabbit zzso cannot explain the zzso observed in zzso in the New Zealand white zzso
