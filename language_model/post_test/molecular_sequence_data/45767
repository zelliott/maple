zzso plasmids zzso mouse and rat zzso and their zzso zzso were zzso The proteins were expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso to zzso yielding zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso hardly affect the zzso secondary structure, and they were similar to previously reported CD zzso for human zzso Both mouse and rat zzso were biologically active in promoting proliferation in zzso cells zzso zzso with the long form of human zzso zzso The zzso did not change the binding properties to zzso cells as zzso respectively, to zzso zzso rat or human zzso or their ability to form zzso complexes with the zzso domain of chicken zzso zzso In contrast, their biological activity, tested in a zzso proliferation zzso was abolished and both became potent zzso As the zzso zzso acids zzso sequence is preserved in all known zzso the present results substantiate the hypothesis that this sequence plays a pivotal role in zzso site III and that interaction of zzso with its receptors resembles the corresponding interactions of zzso and zzso zzso factor their zzso
