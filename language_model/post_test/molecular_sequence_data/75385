In attempts to isolate human zzso zzso a human zzso zzso zzso zzso library was screened with a zzso zzso sheep zzso DNA zzso corresponding to the zzso of the zzso zzso The four largest zzso the largest being approximately 3 zzso were characterized by Northern transfer zzso restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern transfer analyses of zzso revealed zzso to zzso transcripts in the region of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso sequencing demonstrated distinct zzso characteristic of zzso and identified areas of zzso which apparently reflects alternative zzso of the primary zzso zzso To demonstrate the zzso of these zzso for studies on zzso gene expression in human cells, zzso zzso was examined in zzso cultures established from the skin of several individuals of varying zzso Northern transfer analyses and slot zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso gene expression is initiated early during fetal development, and continues at a relatively constant level through several zzso The lowest abundance of zzso zzso was noted in the cell cultures established for the oldest individual studied zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in cultured zzso provides a system to study diseases affecting the elastic zzso
