A zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso omega-3 fatty acid zzso responsible for zzso fatty acid formation, was isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso zzso by zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that a small gene family composed of two copies or closely linked genes zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso was abundant in leaves but hardly zzso in zzso The zzso transcript level in leaves was much higher at 15 degrees C than at normal temperature zzso degrees zzso In zzso zzso also showed particularly prominent expression of zzso in the zzso layer and zzso zzso cells of leaves when exposed to 15 degrees C conditions for 5 days and 10 zzso Two transgenic lines zzso and zzso harboring the zzso zzso in sense orientation under the control of the zzso zzso promoter contained increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fatty zzso When exposed to 2 degrees C for 7 days, the damage observed to the control plants was significantly alleviated in the zzso and zzso zzso The amounts of zzso fatty acids in an zzso zzso line zzso declined zzso compared to the control zzso The zzso plants survived after growth at 44 degrees C for 3 days while the control plants zzso These data suggest that zzso encodes a zzso zzso omega-3 fatty acid zzso
