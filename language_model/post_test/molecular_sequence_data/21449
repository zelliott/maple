In this study, we describe the first survey in Thailand of zzso zzso a widespread and prevalent zzso of cattle that is transmitted by zzso zzso Investigation of 210 bovine blood samples of Thai cattle from six farms by zzso zzso technique zzso revealed 14 samples with zzso zzso compatible to zzso zzso Additional animals were positive for zzso zzso by zzso based on the zzso zzso sequence zzso despite negative by zzso indicating cryptic zzso zzso revealed a prevalence of 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 12 samples positive for zzso zzso were detected in cattle from other 11 zzso From a total of 30 blood samples positive by zzso and/or zzso from 17 farms, seven were characterized to evaluate the genetic zzso of zzso zzso through sequence analysis of zzso zzso DNA zzso All zzso sequences of zzso zzso from Thai cattle clustered with sequences of the previously described zzso lineages zzso and zzso supporting only two major lineages of zzso zzso in cattle around the zzso However, 11 of the 29 zzso sequences analyzed showed to be different, disclosing an unexpectedly large zzso genetic repertoire, with multiple zzso of zzso zzso not previously described in other countries circulating in Thai zzso
