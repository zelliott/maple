To determine whether zzso zzso of zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso four series of experiments were performed on blood from normal zzso In the first experiment zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso With zzso added to blood zzso with zzso zzso the zzso increased zzso less than zzso to an extent similar to that when only saline was used for zzso In the second experiment, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso substances which also antagonize at the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso to an extent similar to that after zzso with zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso less than zzso while after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso did not enhance zzso zzso In the third experiment zzso an inhibitor of von zzso factor and its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso In the fourth experiment zzso enhanced zzso zzso to a similar extent zzso less than zzso regardless of zzso of the blood with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the latter an zzso at the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso but was abolished by zzso zzso zzso that the zzso effect is related to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
