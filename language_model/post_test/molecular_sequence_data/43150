The mechanisms that govern zzso production are still under zzso In particular, zzso can appear as a consequence of a zzso zzso of B cells or as a consequence of an zzso driven B cell zzso The molecular analysis of the variable regions of zzso arising during different clinical situations can help to understand the origin of zzso We recently described the main light chain variable regions of zzso zzso factors occurring during zzso arthritis and suggested that the zzso pattern of these regions could reflect an zzso driven zzso Using the same approach, we now report the molecular analysis of the same light chain variable region containing a zzso segment of zzso factors originating from a zzso zzso of B cells during an in zzso zzso virus infection, infectious zzso The zzso derived from zzso factor zzso cells were amplified by two sets of zzso chain zzso The amplified products were cloned in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso containing zzso regions shows that: 1) the zzso factor activity is associated with the 3 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso already known to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso factors, 2) there is a preferential use of zzso zzso and zzso each one of these genes being poorly zzso 3) the zzso zzso rates of these genes is no higher than the framework zzso rates, 4) there is a restriction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived gene segments rearrange exclusively with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso These results mainly suggest that naturally occurring zzso zzso of zzso B cells produces poorly zzso zzso
