In order to identify regions in zzso growth factor binding zzso involved in the binding of zzso we tested three zzso zzso designated zzso A, B, and C on their interference with zzso zzso A zzso with the binding of zzso to zzso as determined by zzso whereas zzso B and C did zzso zzso zzso A was found to abolish zzso zzso of zzso stimulation in an in zzso proliferation zzso The zzso of all three zzso zzso were found to be located within the zzso part of zzso The regions surrounding zzso zzso and zzso are especially important for zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso A functionally interferes with the binding of zzso to zzso Furthermore, we suggest that part of the zzso of zzso A is located at or zzso near the zzso binding domain of zzso
