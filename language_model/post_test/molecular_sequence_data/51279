zzso a zzso with a zzso zzso zzso domain, has been described in bone and is also known to be expressed in other zzso particularly zzso The goal of the present work was to define the distribution of zzso synthesis and deposition in a wide variety of normal adult human zzso using a multifaceted approach that included zzso in zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso studies have revealed the unexpected finding that zzso is deposited as a prominent layer at the zzso surfaces of specific populations of zzso cells of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso urinary and zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and sweat zzso Northern analyses identified gallbladder as a major site of zzso gene zzso comparable in magnitude with that of zzso and zzso identified zzso in zzso In zzso zzso localized zzso gene transcripts predominantly to the zzso of a variety of zzso as well as to zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell origin, like zzso zzso promoted zzso cell spreading in attachment zzso We zzso that zzso zzso by zzso binds zzso on zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest an important role for zzso on many zzso zzso surfaces zzso with the external zzso
