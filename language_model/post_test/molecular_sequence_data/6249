Water soluble zzso based on zzso zzso containing zzso side chains terminated in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso compound zzso zzso were zzso by a new facilitated synthetic route and studied for their ability to release free zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the properties of the low molecular weight zzso zzso derivatives were studied in the presence of zzso zzso preparations and zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso the zzso zzso vs zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso vs zzso of the penultimate zzso acid zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the total length of the zzso sequence zzso zzso vs zzso terminated in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso carrier all directly influence the zzso zzso release of free zzso
