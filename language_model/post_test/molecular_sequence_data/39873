zzso zzso requires various complex processes including zzso division, enlargement and protein zzso We have been studying a number of zzso zzso zzso that display zzso zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso showed green fluorescent protein zzso in the zzso as well as in zzso indicating a decrease of efficiency of zzso targeting signal 1 zzso protein transport to zzso Interestingly, both zzso were defective in zzso protein zzso Plant growth was more inhibited in zzso than zzso zzso apparently because protein transport was more severely decreased in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to zzso proteins zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which are thought to be involved in transporting zzso proteins into zzso in zzso and zzso We show that zzso and zzso are localized on zzso zzso and that zzso interacts with zzso a zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso zzso was found to stall on zzso zzso in both zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are components that are involved in protein transport on zzso zzso in higher zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso have previously been found in zzso but it is not known whether they are involved in protein transport to zzso Our findings reveal that zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso protein import to zzso in zzso
