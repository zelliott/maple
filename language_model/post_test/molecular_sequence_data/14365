zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of diverse cellular zzso In zzso zzso all three states of zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which associates with zzso to regulate its zzso zzso and zzso activity towards zzso The structure of the zzso zzso domain, which is the first zzso domain identified which binds to zzso at the zzso site, was determined in the present study by solution zzso The zzso zzso domain adopts a classical zzso fold, with a zzso zzso zzso followed by three zzso However, it differs significantly from other zzso zzso in some structural aspects that account, in part, for its molecular zzso Moreover, we revealed a unique binding pattern of the zzso domain, in that the zzso domain of zzso bound not only to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but also to zzso zzso zzso via an aromatic cage and a positively charged area zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso illustrated the ability of the zzso zzso domain to bind to the zzso core zzso and further zzso experiments indicated the crucial role of this binding activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The present study may shed light on a novel mechanism of zzso zzso regulation by the zzso zzso
