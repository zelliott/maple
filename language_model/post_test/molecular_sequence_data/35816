zzso studies have established that fish gastrointestinal zzso contain peptides with zzso zzso zzso zzso but the molecular nature of this material is zzso In this study, the most abundant zzso that was zzso towards an zzso raised against pig zzso was isolated in pure form from an extract of the stomach of the rainbow trout zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso was established zzso zzso zzso Although this zzso acid sequence is shorter than those of zzso zzso by four zzso the zzso zzso is identical to the corresponding region in pig zzso The data zzso therefore, that the zzso molecular form of zzso in the stomach of a zzso fish is structurally more similar to zzso zzso than to the zzso skin zzso zzso
