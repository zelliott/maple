zzso zzso peptides consist of a zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso although their binding modes for zzso receptors have not been zzso in zzso zzso which is highly selective and specific for the zzso zzso zzso possesses two zzso zzso at the consecutive positions 3 and zzso In order to clarify the role of zzso and zzso in binding to the zzso zzso we zzso a series of zzso in which zzso and zzso were replaced by various zzso zzso It was found that the zzso of the zzso groups of zzso and zzso is a principal zzso of how strongly it binds to the zzso although better molecular zzso reinforces the zzso The zzso binding zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were found to exhibit different structural zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to different zzso zzso
