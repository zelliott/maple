Companion cells are metabolically active and functionally specialized cells that behave as terminals for the transport of materials between zzso and the surrounding zzso Although previous research has clarified the distinct function of companion cells, it is still largely unknown how plants establish and maintain the special identity of these zzso To shed further light on this issue, we carried out expressed sequence tag zzso zzso To minimize the difficulty of zzso and gathering intact companion cells, vascular strings with an abundant content of companion cells were excised from the zzso of zzso zzso By random sequencing with a zzso zzso library derived by suppression zzso zzso between the string itself and the zzso from which it had been removed, we identified 377 zzso and assembled them into 247 zzso zzso The most frequent zzso was zzso (15 of 377 zzso which showed the highest sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso expression in the vascular tissue of zzso Through transient expression zzso using zzso zzso and zzso transient zzso we found two integrated zzso regions of the zzso zzso This work has provided not only zzso zzso information and shown that two novel zzso regions sustain zzso activity in companion cells, but also a series of procedures for efficiently examining the zzso framework of companion cells by exploiting the zzso advantage of zzso zzso as an experimental zzso
