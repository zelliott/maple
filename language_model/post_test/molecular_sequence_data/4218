zzso zzso play a major role in membrane dependent processes and are zzso in the primary structure of a protein by the periodic appearance of zzso zzso Based on these periodic zzso the zzso moment was introduced, zzso which essentially treats the zzso of zzso acid zzso as a two-dimensional zzso sum and provides a measure of zzso within regular repeat zzso To identify putative zzso zzso forming zzso zzso moment analysis assumes an zzso acid zzso zzso of 100 and scans protein primary structures to find the zzso window with zzso zzso Taken with the window's mean zzso zzso zzso moment plot analysis uses the coordinate pair, zzso zzso to zzso zzso as either surface active, zzso or zzso More recently, this latter analysis has been extended to recognize candidate zzso zzso zzso Here, the zzso moment is reviewed and data to query the logic of using a fixed window length and a fixed zzso angular zzso in zzso moment analysis are zzso In addition, problems associated with the use of such analysis to predict zzso zzso relationships are zzso
