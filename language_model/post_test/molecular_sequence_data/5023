The crystal structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso complex of zzso coli DNA zzso III has been zzso Three consecutive zzso in the structure are arranged in a zzso zzso The zzso domain contains a zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso component of the zzso complex is the gamma zzso which is zzso to zzso A zzso alignment suggests that zzso bind to gamma at an zzso interface within the inner surface of the zzso The alignment is extended to other zzso complexes and to the zzso family of DNA zzso and suggests that each of these is assembled from zzso components that can open and close the jaws of the zzso in response to zzso binding and zzso
