zzso resistance is an ecologically important zzso increasingly well understood at the molecular genetic zzso In this article, we examine levels of zzso resistance and zzso locus DNA sequence zzso in a worldwide sample of 27 zzso of zzso zzso The rooted zzso tree of zzso sequences drawn from a diverse set of zzso includes a deep zzso separating major resistance and zzso zzso of zzso We find evidence for selection maintaining these zzso and identify the zzso part of the zzso repeat region as a probable target of zzso Additional protein zzso are found within the two major zzso and correlate well with measurable differences among zzso in resistance to the zzso gene zzso of the pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso have been observed for other resistance genes of zzso zzso the zzso data suggest that the long-term maintenance of zzso variation in resistance genes may be a general phenomenon and are consistent with diversifying selection acting in concert with selection to maintain zzso
