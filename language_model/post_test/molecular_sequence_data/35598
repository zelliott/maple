zzso for zzso against specific zzso proteins is a difficult task due to many unrelated proteins that are expressed on the cell zzso Here, we describe a method to screen zzso zzso libraries against native zzso zzso We applied this method to isolate zzso that selectively recognize zzso which is the major zzso for zzso entry zzso playing a pivotal role in zzso transmission and zzso We employed a zzso screening strategy by using cells that zzso zzso and zzso along with an excess of control cells that do not express these proteins (and are otherwise identical to the zzso zzso These control cells are intended to remove most of the zzso that bind the cells zzso thus leading to an enrichment of the zzso presenting zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells were zzso sorted by flow zzso and the bound zzso were zzso zzso and used for further successive selection zzso Several different clones of human zzso zzso zzso that interact with zzso cells were zzso The most specific zzso zzso was converted to a full-length zzso and bound the second zzso loop of zzso The experimental approach presented zzso for screening for zzso zzso can be zzso to screen zzso zzso libraries against any zzso expressed protein of zzso
