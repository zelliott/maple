Four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso channels zzso have been isolated from the zzso of the Chinese scorpion zzso zzso These peptides were identified by screening zzso zzso zzso of the crude zzso by means of mass analysis by zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso tests in zzso zzso degradation analysis of the zzso peptides showed sequences of zzso zzso acids including 6 zzso zzso Three of the sequences were similar to the zzso peptides from zzso zzso showing zzso sequence similarity for the most closely zzso named zzso and zzso for the other two, named zzso and zzso Like the zzso zzso these molecules showed a low toxic activity in mice after zzso injection, and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso with zzso zzso for binding to its zzso site from rat brain, which has been proved to be the zzso zzso The fourth toxin was structurally related to the zzso I toxin family, with zzso zzso and was named zzso This toxin exhibited a high toxic activity with lethal effects in zzso Due to its small representation in the zzso zzso than zzso (by zzso its biological properties have been assessed on the synthetic analogue of zzso which was assembled on a solid phase by means of zzso zzso The synthetic zzso was zzso identical to the natural zzso as shown by comparison of their molecular masses and zzso acid compositions, and by their zzso after zzso on zzso zzso These results confirmed the primary structure of zzso including an zzso zzso zzso to natural zzso synthetic zzso produced toxic and lethal effects after zzso injection in mice zzso zzso 37 zzso and was able to compete with zzso zzso for binding to its zzso in rat brain zzso zzso 20 zzso
