zzso alpha is a zzso zzso zzso protein that activates the zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso by zzso is highly dependent on the context of its binding site within the zzso alpha zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso contains a potent zzso zzso domain that is separate from the zzso motif and is zzso active in T zzso We find that zzso fusion proteins can activate a zzso zzso alpha zzso up to zzso in zzso lines and are as active as zzso in this zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso could not activate zzso promoters bearing only zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso by zzso like that noted previously for the native zzso zzso was strongly influenced by the context of its zzso site within the zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests that zzso by zzso is especially dependent on zzso a distinct zzso protein that binds to sequences zzso the zzso site in the zzso Analysis of small deletion or clustered zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso sequences identified a minimal zzso region between zzso acids 80 and 256 that appears to be zzso in zzso The zzso zzso domain is not notably acid or zzso but is zzso and includes a motif rich in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that sequences outside of the zzso zzso box mediate zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso alpha zzso and may facilitate interactions between zzso and other zzso factors recruited to the zzso
