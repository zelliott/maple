zzso DNA transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of zzso resistance genes in zzso zzso To further our understanding of DNA transfer in zzso zzso we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by its capture on the zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso Similar to other zzso zzso transfer factors, zzso was mobilized in zzso coli by the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and deletion analysis of zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, the two zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso origin of transfer zzso was localized to a zzso region that included nearly all of the zzso region between zzso and zzso and overlapped with the 3' end of zzso This zzso contained a putative zzso site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the zzso regions of other transfer factors, including zzso Despite the lack of sequence similarity between the zzso of zzso and zzso a zzso in the zzso putative DNA zzso zzso was partially zzso by zzso In addition to the functional zzso with zzso a second distinguishing feature of zzso is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins zzso not only by zzso but by several zzso zzso transfer factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
