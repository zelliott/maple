The zzso of the N zzso in the zzso coding for the zzso zzso factor zzso results in a truncated protein that zzso the expression pattern of some of its target zzso A weak zzso three alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a variety of putative target sites for zzso regulatory proteins are found around the N zzso two zzso codes zzso and a zzso tract zzso are found in front of the zzso In this work we analyzed some of the regulatory factors and elements involved in the preferred selection of the zzso zzso zzso in the small cell lung cancer cell line zzso Wild type and zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and showed that the zzso and the zzso elements are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments identified these elements as zzso and zzso H targets, respectively, and that they are also required for zzso zzso zzso Compared to normal zzso cells, and in keeping with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso H and other zzso factors were highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso H zzso occurs first and is a prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso experiments suggest that zzso recognition zzso zzso H and helps to recruit other zzso factors (at least zzso zzso to the zzso Our results evidenced novel zzso H and zzso zzso respectively, zzso to a zzso in humans and the zzso zzso function from two juxtaposed zzso zzso
