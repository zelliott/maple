zzso are the results of a trial in zzso monkeys of 2 zzso zzso malaria vaccine candidates based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Compared with an earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an additional 24 zzso acids at the zzso which includes the zzso region of zzso and a putative T cell zzso The zzso was generated from a chemically zzso gene that contained an additional 54 zzso acids at the zzso zzso and zzso at the same zzso zzso acid as zzso In addition, zzso contained only 1 each of the repeat sequences zzso and zzso Both zzso were administered with zzso as zzso Neither zzso caused toxic side effects and both zzso molecules induced high zzso zzso Two monkeys were protected against zzso challenge by zzso with zzso zzso while none of the zzso zzso animals displayed any degree of zzso While there was no correlation between protection and zzso zzso or the in zzso proliferation of zzso in response to the zzso this is further evidence to support the role of the repeating zzso in generating protective zzso
