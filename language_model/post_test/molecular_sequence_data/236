Two strictly zzso zzso zzso bacteria containing zzso zzso designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from a culture of the marine zzso zzso zzso and coastal seawater from Korea, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the two strains were related to members of the zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the family zzso However, the two novel strains did not form a robust zzso with any species of the zzso zzso forming a distinct zzso The major polar lipids of the strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso profiles that were distinguishable from those of the related zzso zzso Although the level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso was very high zzso zzso zzso zzso between the strains was 13 zzso suggesting that they represent zzso distinct zzso In addition, the two strains could be differentiated based on the presence of a minor polar zzso on the zzso of gelatin and the zzso of carbon zzso Based on the data from the present study, strains zzso and zzso are considered to represent separate novel species of a new zzso of the family zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
