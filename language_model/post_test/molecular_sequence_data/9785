A method for the detection of zzso based on zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been developed and applied for the direct detection of zzso in pure cultures and in zzso zzso tissue zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso gene sequences representing all of the zzso zzso subspecies and zzso zzso an zzso zzso probe was zzso The specificity of the probe was tested by in zzso zzso to bacterial cell zzso of pure zzso zzso of 55 tested zzso zzso belonging to subspecies I, II, zzso IV, and VI zzso with the zzso The probe did not zzso to zzso from subspecies zzso zzso zzso or to zzso zzso No zzso to 64 other strains of the family zzso or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was zzso The probe was tested with sections of zzso zzso tissue from zzso infected mice or from animals with a history of clinical zzso In these tissue sections the probe zzso specifically to zzso zzso allowing for the detection of single bacterial zzso The development of a zzso specific zzso probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identification of zzso zzso in bacterial zzso as well as for the detection of zzso zzso in zzso tissue zzso
