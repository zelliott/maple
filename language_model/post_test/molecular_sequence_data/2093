The zzso protein zzso isolated from bovine brain was zzso with zzso and the 3 largest peptides of zzso 21, 19 and 18 zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso digest of zzso with alkaline zzso changed the zzso mobility of these peptides to 19, 18 and 17 zzso zzso acid sequencing of the total zzso digest of zzso revealed at least 3 zzso two of which were highly zzso to previously published mouse and human zzso sequences derived from zzso A third zzso acid sequence of 17 zzso with zzso at position 11 showed no zzso with the zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso predicted from their zzso might be zzso
