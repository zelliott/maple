zzso of Human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso drug resistance is still a major challenge in the follow-up of zzso therapy in infected zzso Because of the high degree of zzso natural variation, complex interactions and zzso zzso of evolution, the role of resistance zzso is in many cases not well zzso Using zzso network learning of zzso sequence data from diverse zzso zzso B, C, F and zzso we could determine the specific role of many resistance zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such networks zzso relationships between treatment, selection of resistance zzso and presence of zzso in a zzso zzso The analysis identified zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso as most probable major resistance zzso zzso we found striking similarities for the role of many zzso against all of these zzso For example, for all three zzso we found that the novel zzso zzso was minor and associated with zzso at positions 90 and zzso zzso network learning provides an autonomous method to gain insight in the role of resistance zzso and the influence of zzso natural zzso We successfully applied the method to three zzso zzso The analysis shows differences with current knowledge especially concerning resistance development in several non-B zzso
