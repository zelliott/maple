zzso genes tend to occur in zzso We have identified a cluster in zzso mouse zzso zzso 2, known from early genetic studies to contain both zzso and zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso one was identified as zzso which encodes a G protein alpha zzso and there is clinical and zzso evidence that the human zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso is also zzso We have used zzso difference analysis, based on zzso zzso differences, to isolate candidate imprinted genes in zzso zzso 2 and found two zzso imprinted zzso zzso and zzso zzso determines a zzso G protein alpha zzso associated with the zzso network and zzso encodes a zzso protein of neuroendocrine zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso DNA and encodes a zzso transcript, whereas zzso is zzso zzso with zzso zzso Their zzso zzso may offer insight into the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all part of the same zzso unit; transcripts for zzso and zzso are alternatively spliced onto zzso 2 of zzso This demonstrates an zzso mechanism in which two zzso imprinted genes share the same downstream zzso
