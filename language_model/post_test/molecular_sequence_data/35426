The establishment of zzso zzso with different zzso activity is essential for many zzso zzso The asymmetry of the zzso zzso flower is established by zzso factors with an zzso pattern of zzso To understand how this zzso pattern is established, we studied the molecular mechanism through which the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso restricts the activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso to the zzso region of the flower zzso We show that zzso competes with zzso for binding with other zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact to form a protein complex that binds to the zzso consensus region, suggesting that the zzso act as zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso bound to DNA is zzso Moreover, the zzso are zzso in the zzso by zzso thus, preventing or reducing the formation of zzso zzso in the zzso Our results suggest that in the zzso region of the zzso flower zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso the activity of the zzso identity protein zzso in a zzso competition for a zzso protein promoting the establishment of the zzso pattern of gene activity in the zzso zzso
