zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and is considered to be a marker for zzso zzso which regulate the levels of zzso hormone in brain and zzso in the zzso In the present study, we cloned full-length zzso of zzso from the zzso brain and evaluated its expression pattern in the male and female brain during early development and after zzso zzso treatment using quantitative real-time zzso We measured the CA levels to compare our results on zzso zzso zzso from zzso brain is zzso zzso which encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso acid zzso and showed high zzso with other zzso The tissue distribution of zzso revealed ubiquitous expression in all the zzso analyzed with maximum expression in male and female zzso Copy number analysis showed zzso more transcript abundance in the female brain when compared with the male zzso A differential expression pattern of zzso was observed in which the zzso levels were significantly higher in females compared with zzso during early brain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels measured using zzso liquid zzso with zzso detection in the developing male and female brain confirmed the prominence of the zzso system in the female zzso zzso analogue treatment using zzso and zzso confirmed our findings of the differential expression of zzso related to CA zzso
