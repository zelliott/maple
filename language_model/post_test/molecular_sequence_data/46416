zzso can only be accepted as a zzso method when using standards with a high resemblance to the zzso Unfortunately, this is usually not zzso to zzso zzso a zzso of singular zzso zzso zzso present in all living organisms, since the absence of suitable reference material due to the high diversity among zzso species zzso their zzso by molecular mass zzso Even thus, it is widely assumed that the zzso of the zzso zzso of similar species are directly correlated with their relative concentration in the sample, and this has been extended to the determination of different zzso proteins zzso in a zzso Practically all organisms contain several zzso zzso some of them exhibiting highly similar zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso For the current analysis, we used as a model system the zzso zzso of two zzso snails zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distinct samples were prepared by zzso at different zzso ratios, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and they were analyzed by zzso both at neutral pH (for zzso zzso zzso and at zzso pH (for the corresponding zzso The results here presented reveal that the zzso peak intensity of a single zzso species strongly depends on its sensitivity to be zzso and thus, on the presence or absence of metal zzso zzso Furthermore, our data demonstrate that very similar zzso zzso of the same zzso with similar zzso zzso from zzso to zzso can show a clear different sensitivity to zzso zzso something that cannot be readily predicted only by consideration of their zzso acid zzso In conclusion, even in this optimum case, zzso about quantity features of zzso samples drawn from zzso zzso should be carefully zzso
