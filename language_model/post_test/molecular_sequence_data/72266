The zzso family represents a challenge for molecular zzso reconstruction because it consists of 38 living species that evolved from a relatively recent common zzso zzso million years zzso We have determined zzso DNA sequences from two genes that evolve at relatively rapid evolutionary rates, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso from multiple individuals of 35 zzso Based on separate and combined gene analyses using minimum evolution, maximum zzso and maximum likelihood zzso methods, we recognized eight significant clusters or species zzso that likely reflect separate zzso evolutionary zzso in the history of this zzso The clusters include zzso zzso zzso zzso domestic cat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso Asian zzso cat group, zzso zzso group, and zzso bay cat zzso The results confirm and extend previously hypothesized associations in most cases, but in others, zzso the bay cat group, suggest novel zzso zzso The results are compared and evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso data to derive a zzso synthesis of field evolutionary zzso
