zzso zzso are freshwater bacteria that form zzso structures by cellular attachment to a common zzso Comparative analyses of zzso zzso zzso gene and internally transcribed zzso region sequences indicated that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso of zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso was related to a cluster of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the precise zzso relationships among these zzso could not be established with a high degree of confidence, the sequences of zzso zzso and several zzso zzso from zzso of zzso zzso were almost zzso zzso are bacteria that form zzso zzso with zzso including soybeans zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso From symbiotic zzso tests we demonstrated that the type strain for zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of forming an effective zzso zzso with zzso zzso Not only do these results reveal a previously unknown ecological adaptation of a relatively obscure aquatic zzso but they also demonstrate how evidence gathered from molecular systematic analyses can sometimes provide clues for predicting ecological zzso
