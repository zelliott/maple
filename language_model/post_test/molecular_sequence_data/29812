zzso zzso is a zzso zzso bacterial pathogen that escapes from a zzso and grows in the host cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso O zzso mediates bacterial escape from zzso and is approximately zzso more active at an zzso than neutral zzso By swapping dissimilar zzso from a zzso zzso zzso O zzso we identified zzso 461 as unique to zzso zzso and responsible for the zzso pH optimum of zzso zzso of zzso 461 to the zzso present in zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso almost zzso at a neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed from its zzso site on the bacterial zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso These bacteria escaped from zzso zzso and initially grew normally in cells and spread cell to cell, but prematurely zzso the host membrane and killed the zzso These data show that the zzso pH optimum of zzso results from an zzso zzso that acts to limit zzso activity to zzso zzso and prevent damage in the host zzso a strategy also used by host cells to zzso zzso zzso
