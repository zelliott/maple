To facilitate analysis of the role of zzso molecules in the zzso immune system, we cloned and zzso eight putative alternatively spliced transcripts of the sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso we cloned the sheep zzso zzso zzso that encodes eight forms, which differ in the length of the signal zzso the presence or absence of a zzso region and in their zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the largest zzso zzso TM form zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso human and mouse zzso indicated that the deduced protein had a higher degree of similarity to cattle zzso of zzso acid zzso than to pig zzso human zzso and mouse sequence zzso of zzso Our results indicate that zzso transcripts zzso different zzso protein forms are expressed in zzso like in other zzso and suggest that the expression of this gene may be regulated at the zzso or zzso zzso level, which could give rise to zzso expression of zzso It is possible that, in the zzso these zzso zzso zzso could play different regulatory roles in T cell zzso
