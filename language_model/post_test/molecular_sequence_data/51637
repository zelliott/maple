In order to investigate the importance of zzso in cellular sensitivity to chemical zzso agents we have constructed zzso zzso for the integration and expression of the zzso coli tag gene in zzso zzso The tag gene encodes zzso DNA zzso which specifically removes zzso from zzso The zzso were introduced into Chinese zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso or into zzso zzso stem cells by zzso with a zzso zzso cell zzso In both cases, stable zzso were selected for resistance to the antibiotic, zzso zzso by expression of the zzso gene carried by the zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso activity in cell extracts showed an up to zzso increase in cell lines with zzso integrated tag gene zzso These cell lines were significantly more resistant to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso than their parent cell lines, indicating that zzso repair is a limiting factor in cellular resistance to these zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso frequency induced by zzso was reduced to 50% of normal by expression of zzso I activity in the Chinese zzso cells, indicating that zzso is not only a zzso but also a zzso zzso in zzso zzso It is concluded that an zzso repair gene function of a type only thought to be present in bacteria can yield a zzso zzso when transferred to zzso zzso
