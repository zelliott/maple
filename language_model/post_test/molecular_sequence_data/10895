A canine zzso zzso obtained from the liver of a zzso beagle was cloned and zzso zzso at position 4 zzso among all zzso zzso and zzso is replaced by zzso in the canine zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso acid doesn't exist at either position 10 or 11 in the deduced zzso acid zzso it is supposed that this zzso is derived from canine zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using the zzso as a probe revealed the induction of the canine zzso zzso expression in the liver and kidney of a zzso zzso Thus, the canine zzso zzso obtained in the present study should provide an useful tool for the molecular investigation of zzso in zzso
