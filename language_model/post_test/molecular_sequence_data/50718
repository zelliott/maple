In order to purify the zzso involved in the assembly of zzso zzso and to be able to study the zzso zzso specificity of these zzso methods were developed to prepare and purify a variety of zzso zzso differing in the structure of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso was prepared by isolation and zzso synthesis using zzso pancreatic zzso while zzso was isolated from zzso canine kidney zzso Treatment of these zzso lipids with a series of selected zzso led to the preparation of Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta 1, zzso and Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha 1, zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso The preparation, isolation, and characterization of each of these zzso zzso zzso are zzso
