A key step of translation initiation in zzso is formation of the zzso zzso complex zzso containing the zzso zzso a set of zzso initiation factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacting with zzso start zzso however, the zzso structure remains substantially zzso Here, we apply zzso zzso zzso to identify contacts between zzso protein zzso zzso zzso stands for zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso assembled on either model zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso and mass zzso we show that with both types of zzso zzso zzso to zzso Comparative analysis of peptides resulting from zzso of the zzso proteins before and after zzso reversal reveals zzso peptides in the zzso parts of zzso and zzso Application of these data to a model zzso structure obtained with the use of available structures indicates that zzso zzso major zzso zzso to enable contacts of the factor with zzso These contacts are suggested to maintain the correct positioning of zzso relative to other zzso zzso this could be essential for zzso selection by the zzso
