Two fragments of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso each containing the zzso domain, were expressed and characterized in either bacterial or zzso zzso The first fragment, zzso included the zzso domain and first zzso zzso and was zzso expressed in the membrane of human embryonic kidney zzso zzso The second, zzso consisted of only the zzso domain of the zzso fused with a zzso tag at its N zzso The latter zzso was expressed in zzso coli in the form of inclusion bodies from which the protein was subsequently zzso and zzso in zzso Although both zzso fragments displayed negligible zzso zzso zzso they both displayed high affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Competition binding studies demonstrated that the zzso domain of the zzso zzso maintains high affinity for the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in contrast, zzso affinity was greatly zzso This study shows that although the zzso zzso are not dependent upon the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for maintaining their normal high affinity zzso the zzso zzso zzso requires regions outside of the zzso zzso zzso distinct structural features in zzso between zzso 9 and 39, provide additional affinity for the zzso domain of the zzso These data are consistent with a model for the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in which the central and zzso regions of the peptides bind to the N zzso of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
