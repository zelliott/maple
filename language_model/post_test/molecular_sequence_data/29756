zzso a member of the zzso small G protein family, regulates zzso zzso of zzso The cyclical zzso and zzso of zzso are essential for the zzso action in zzso zzso is activated to zzso by zzso zzso exchange protein zzso zzso and zzso is zzso to zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso It remains unknown how or in which step of the multiple zzso steps these regulators are activated and zzso We isolated here a novel protein that was zzso with zzso zzso and GAP by their respective zzso from the crude synaptic zzso fraction of rat zzso The zzso named zzso bound both zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was cloned from a human zzso library and its primary structure was zzso Human zzso consisted of zzso zzso acids and showed a calculated zzso of zzso It had 12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso distribution analyses in rat indicated that zzso was abundantly expressed in the brain where it was enriched in the synaptic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso was concentrated on synaptic zzso at zzso These results indicate that zzso serves as a scaffold zzso for both zzso zzso and GAP on synaptic zzso
