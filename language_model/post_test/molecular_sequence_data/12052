We and others have previously shown that the nuclear zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner after zzso of zzso zzso M on B zzso As this zzso was independent of protein zzso C activity, we tested whether a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso might zzso the zzso protein after zzso of zzso free calcium zzso The zzso form of zzso has been shown to bind to zzso suggesting that the operative zzso should be zzso in the zzso We prepared nuclear extracts from two human B cell lines in which increased zzso free calcium levels correlated with increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was determined using a synthetic zzso zzso both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor specific for the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso of cells with zzso led to increased activity of a nuclear zzso that could zzso the zzso and this activity was reduced by 10 zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced in zzso zzso using an zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps of the zzso protein from cells incubated with zzso or zzso contained two unique zzso that were absent in zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso II produced zzso of peptides that migrated zzso to those found in cells incubated with either zzso or zzso These data suggest a model of signal zzso by the zzso zzso on B zzso in which increased zzso free calcium can rapidly activate nuclear zzso zzso II, potentially resulting in zzso and regulation of zzso zzso
