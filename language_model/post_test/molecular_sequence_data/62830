The general zzso factor zzso recognizes the zzso tract zzso zzso that precedes 3' zzso sites and has three zzso recognition motifs zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is highly zzso has been proposed to contribute to zzso binding and establish zzso contacts with zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso we find that the human zzso domain is zzso for zzso activity in zzso However, it has an essential function in zzso zzso distinct from binding to the zzso tract or to zzso and zzso First, deletion of zzso from the human protein has no effect on zzso zzso Second, zzso and zzso select similar sequences from a random pool of zzso Third, deletion of zzso has no effect on the zzso activity of zzso in zzso However, deletion of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function in zzso In addition, certain zzso acid zzso on the zzso zzso surface of zzso compromise zzso function in zzso without affecting binding to zzso or zzso in zzso We propose that zzso has an zzso function that is possibly relevant for the zzso of only a subset of cellular zzso We discuss the implications of these observations on previous models of zzso zzso
