The zzso zzso reaction zzso by the zzso from the zzso zzso intervening sequence has been characterized with a zzso that forms a zzso duplex with the zzso zzso binding site of the zzso zzso + G in equilibrium with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso The zzso step with zzso zzso is zzso of the product zzso Here we show that the reaction of the zzso zzso which forms a zzso duplex with the zzso zzso binding site at position zzso from the zzso site, has a value of zzso that is approximately zzso greater than zzso for the matched zzso zzso degrees C, 10 zzso zzso pH zzso This is explained by the faster zzso of the mismatched product, zzso than the matched zzso With zzso zzso zzso and zzso G, the binding of the zzso zzso and the chemical step are each partially zzso The rate constant for the chemical step of the zzso reaction and the rate constant for the zzso zzso reaction, in which zzso replaces G, are each within approximately zzso with the matched and mismatched zzso despite the approximately zzso weaker binding of the mismatched zzso This can be described as zzso zzso of the base at position zzso in the ground state and transition state zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1976) zzso 15, zzso Thus, the matched zzso does not use its extra binding energy to zzso stabilize the transition zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
