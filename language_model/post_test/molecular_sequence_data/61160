zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso clusters at zzso zzso structures on the surface of zzso red blood cells and mediates their zzso to the vascular zzso In zzso lacking zzso vascular zzso is less efficient, and infected red cells are not able to zzso successfully under zzso flow conditions even though zzso is still present on the exterior of the infected red zzso We examined the interaction between the zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso protein upon which zzso formation is dependent, and zzso and we show evidence of a direct interaction between zzso and the zzso region of zzso zzso We have identified three fragments of zzso which bind zzso Two of these zzso fragments zzso and zzso interact with zzso with binding affinities zzso of 1 zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M respectively, values comparable to those reported previously for zzso interactions in normal and infected red zzso Further experiments localized the high affinity binding regions of zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these two regions from the zzso fragments abolished their ability to bind to zzso Identification of the critical zzso involved in interaction between zzso and zzso may aid development of new therapies to prevent serious complications of zzso zzso zzso
