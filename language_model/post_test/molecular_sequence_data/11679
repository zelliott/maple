The zzso of the zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated as a target of protective zzso 

Two zzso proteins from the zzso of zzso the 42 zzso fused to zzso zzso and the 19 zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso from zzso zzso zzso To determine if vaccination with these zzso proteins zzso protective zzso we conducted a randomized, blinded vaccine trial in two species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After three injections using zzso zzso the monkeys were challenged with the virulent Vietnam Oak zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso 

All three control monkeys required treatment by Day zzso Two of three monkeys vaccinated with zzso required treatment by Day 17, whereas the third monkey controlled zzso for 28 days before requiring zzso In contrast, both of the zzso zzso vaccinated with zzso zzso an otherwise lethal zzso One of the two zzso zzso zzso had a prolonged zzso period of zzso 28 days before requiring zzso No evidence of zzso were evident in the zzso recovered after the prolonged zzso zzso zzso from the two zzso zzso that zzso had no zzso effect on in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso with zzso induced protective immune zzso The course of zzso zzso in protected monkeys suggested that immunity is not zzso by zzso that block zzso Our data indicate that vaccine trials with the highly adapted zzso strain of zzso zzso can be tested in zzso zzso and that zzso is a promising zzso vaccine for human zzso
