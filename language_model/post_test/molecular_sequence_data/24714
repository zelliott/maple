zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is widely used as a serum marker for the diagnosis and management of prostate zzso We report here the zzso of a zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso degradation of zzso zzso followed by mass zzso analyses of the peptides zzso These two technologies, combined with molecular display, allowed the identification of zzso acid zzso contained within three different peptides distant on the zzso zzso but close in the zzso three-dimensional structure, that may be part of the zzso zzso zzso The last four zzso zzso acid zzso are included in this zzso as well as certain other zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The involvement of the zzso zzso end in the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by western zzso experiments with the zzso protein zzso resulting from the cloning of an alternative transcript of the zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso end was deleted and replaced by another zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso used as a control bound zzso zzso zzso did zzso The requirement of the zzso end for the recognition by zzso zzso may be useful for the discrimination of zzso zzso
