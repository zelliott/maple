The present study aimed to characterize systematically the target zzso of T cell responses in zzso structural zzso These were studied by zzso 86 overlapping zzso peptides covering the known sequence of zzso structural proteins and analyzing the proliferation responses of 18 zzso T cell lines against these zzso zzso peptides differed depending on the zzso zzso of the T cell zzso They were concentrated to the zzso and zzso regions as six of seven common zzso zzso located in this region, whereas there was only one in the zzso region and none in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso areas were recognized more often (on average, zzso of them zzso each T cell line) than those derived from variable areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exact zzso Some zzso peptides inducing T cell responsiveness in most subjects were identified, a knowledge which can be useful in the development of new synthetic zzso
