The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein which is the human zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cycle zzso In attempting to isolate and zzso characterize zzso proteins capable of regulating various activities of zzso we have identified an activity in bovine brain zzso which effectively zzso the zzso of zzso from the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this activity was achieved by a series of steps which included ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulatory protein has an apparent molecular weight of zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences of this protein were identical to sequences from the zzso portion of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Takai, zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein fully zzso for the zzso which we have zzso from bovine brain in its ability to inhibit zzso zzso from zzso These findings suggest either that a common regulatory protein zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso proteins or that these two zzso proteins interact with zzso proteins of very similar zzso The zzso brain zzso protein shows little ability to inhibit zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and is capable of only a very weak zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso from the zzso zzso zzso However, brain zzso very effectively zzso the ability of the human zzso zzso product to catalyze zzso zzso from zzso In addition to influencing zzso zzso association with zzso the zzso brain zzso protein also appears to catalyze the zzso of zzso from the plasma zzso of human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect by the zzso protein is observed whether the zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso gamma zzso or no zzso zzso and occurs over a similar concentration range as that necessary for the zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso
