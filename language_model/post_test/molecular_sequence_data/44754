zzso C virus zzso possesses two separate zzso functions in the zzso zzso a zzso and an zzso zzso In order to determine the minimal domain for zzso and zzso zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso serial deletion zzso were zzso The zzso protein a fusion protein of 25 zzso acids zzso from an expression zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso We made deletion zzso of 10, 30, 50, 97, and 135 zzso from the zzso and 16 and 32 zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso The deleted protein lacking 50 zzso from the zzso still possessed both activities, while the protein lacking 97 zzso from the zzso lost an zzso zzso zzso The zzso lacking 16 zzso acids from the zzso retained the zzso activities and the zzso 32 zzso deleted zzso lost an zzso zzso zzso A zzso deletion zzso lacking 16 zzso the zzso and 50 zzso from the zzso retained the zzso zzso These results show that the functional domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is about 400 zzso in length and maps between zzso zzso zzso and zzso
