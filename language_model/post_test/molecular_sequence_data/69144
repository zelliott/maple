We have performed zzso analysis at the low density zzso zzso zzso locus in order to investigate the molecular zzso of familial zzso zzso in zzso zzso were constructed using 7 restriction zzso length zzso zzso in zzso subjects from 48 unrelated Norwegian FH zzso zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso locus in all 48 zzso zzso zzso could be established for 190 independent zzso from 51 FH zzso and 44 healthy normal zzso A total of 20 different zzso was zzso The most frequent zzso was zzso 3, which accounted for zzso or zzso of the normal and defective zzso zzso zzso 2 was significantly more frequent among the defective zzso than among the normal zzso zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso Thus, zzso 2 and 3 accounted for zzso of the defective zzso More data are needed to determine the possible existence of founder genes in the Norwegian zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 accounted for zzso of the normal zzso Based upon the cumulative zzso index, the zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso are the most zzso markers in the Norwegian zzso
