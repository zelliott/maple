Little is known about the fundamental biology of zzso zzso zzso that cause serious diseases, affecting literally billions of animals and humans zzso zzso the biology of these neglected pathogens using modern technologies will yield crucial and profound knowledge of their molecular biology, and could lead to new treatment and control zzso zzso by studies in the zzso zzso zzso zzso some recent investigations have provided improved insights into selected protein zzso zzso of economically important zzso zzso zzso In the present article, we review this progress and assess the potential of zzso zzso zzso genes and/or their products as targets for new zzso zzso Current information indicates that some small zzso known to specifically inhibit zzso might be developed as zzso For instance, some zzso zzso are known to display exquisite zzso activity, which indicates that some of them could be designed and tailored to specifically inhibit selected zzso of zzso This information provides prospects for the discovery of an entirely novel class of zzso which is of paramount importance, given the serious problems linked to zzso resistance in zzso zzso populations of zzso and has the potential to lead to significant zzso zzso
