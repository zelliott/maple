zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso expressed in virtually all organisms from bacteria to zzso While zzso a poorly zzso region within zzso zzso has been implicated in numerous zzso regulatory properties, no one has zzso the zzso region as a functional protein to zzso in order to study its role in zzso zzso We zzso that zzso is an internal regulatory zzso To pursue this hypothesis, we constructed several soluble zzso proteins from type zzso zzso arriving at one, zzso which can be expressed and zzso from zzso zzso zzso is relatively stable, as demonstrated by limited zzso analysis, circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso interacts with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and with the zzso first zzso domain zzso of type zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in our soluble zzso model zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that zzso meets basic criteria to serve as a model protein for the zzso region and may be used as a zzso to develop other zzso zzso soluble model proteins to further investigate the role of this domain in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
