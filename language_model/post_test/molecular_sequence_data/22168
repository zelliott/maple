During zzso immune responses, two distinct genetic modification events diversify the zzso genes in zzso center zzso B zzso zzso zzso and class switch zzso zzso Both processes require the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso expressed specifically in zzso B zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate AID activity are largely zzso Here we report that protein zzso A zzso zzso AID and regulates its activity in zzso B zzso AID physically interacts with the zzso zzso in the zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso at specific zzso AID zzso is required for zzso because substitution of the two zzso targets zzso its ability to rescue zzso in zzso B zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevents zzso class switching in a zzso zzso zzso cell line; conversely, B cells from mice where zzso activity is made zzso by conditional deletion of the zzso regulatory zzso gene display enhanced zzso These findings zzso zzso in the regulation of AID function and suggest that the control of T zzso immune responses may be zzso via zzso by signals that activate zzso
