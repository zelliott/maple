The purpose of this study was to analyze the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso carrier family 6 member 3 gene zzso zzso zzso zzso as a first step towards zzso regulatory sequences useful for driving zzso expression within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in each of the major groups of zzso zzso previously identified in the zzso zzso The zzso gene spans zzso zzso of zzso DNA and contains 15 zzso The zzso organization of zzso is highly zzso with respect to its human zzso including the presence of an untranslated first zzso The promoter lacks a zzso zzso box and there are multiple zzso start zzso zzso analysis of zzso elements responsible for the expression pattern of zzso was carried out by generating stable transgenic zzso lines expressing fluorescent reporters under zzso control of fragments of zzso zzso zzso The region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with respect to the zzso start site contains the core zzso promoter, in addition to zzso enhancers and/or zzso zzso that restrict expression to the zzso but this region lacks zzso elements responsible for zzso expression in zzso zzso The upstream sequence between zzso zzso and zzso zzso contains an zzso element that drives zzso expression in zzso zzso of the zzso region, and additional sequences that partially repress expression in zzso zzso However, expression of zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on elements that lie outside the region zzso zzso to zzso zzso These data provide a detailed analysis of the zzso gene and show that its expression in different populations of zzso zzso is driven by discrete zzso rather than a single target sequence for a terminal factor involved in specifying zzso zzso
