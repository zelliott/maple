zzso zzso and zzso zzso from two strains zzso and zzso of the sheep pathogen zzso zzso were zzso The predicted zzso proteins of these strains are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein and collectively represent the second example of a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts were readily detected by reverse zzso zzso with zzso isolated from strain zzso grown under zzso conditions in the presence or absence of bovine zzso zzso However, with strain zzso and depending on the primer pair, zzso transcripts were detected by zzso predominantly when the zzso was from cells grown under zzso conditions in the presence of bovine zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso was found to be immediately upstream of fur and, based on zzso these genes are transcribed as a single unit; the availability of iron and the presence or absence of bovine zzso in the growth medium had no apparent effect on the relative amounts of the zzso zzso
