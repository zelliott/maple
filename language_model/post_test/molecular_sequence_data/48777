We investigated the transformation between the zzso and zzso structures of an zzso design zzso whose sequence is zzso This zzso has both zzso and zzso structures in zzso zzso For this purpose, we proposed the zzso zzso zzso This is one of the zzso zzso methods in which we exchange parameters for umbrella zzso to enhance the zzso or zzso structure zzso We performed an zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulation of this zzso in explicit water zzso with five zzso Because the suitable umbrella potential was applied, the zzso zzso MD simulation reproduced zzso closer to experimental zzso than a temperature zzso MD simulation when the same numbers of the zzso were used, while the temperature zzso MD simulation does not require bias along any specific order zzso We calculated its zzso landscape and revealed the transformation pathways between the zzso and zzso structures and the folding pathways from an extended zzso Although the zzso of the zzso and zzso structures are less than those obtained by the experiment, the zzso difference between the two structures is calculated to be almost zero, which agrees with the experimental zzso
