The zzso blood group has been used extensively as a marker in population studies, zzso and forensic zzso However, until the cloning of the zzso it was not possible to determine the zzso of group A and B individuals without recourse to family zzso We have developed a method to determine the zzso zzso directly from human DNA using multiplex zzso and restriction zzso zzso Two zzso fragments spanning positions 258 and 700 of the zzso sequence are zzso The site at position 258 allows us to differentiate the O zzso from the A and B zzso The site at position 700 allows us to distinguish the B zzso from the A and O zzso Analysis at the two sites thus allows us to distinguish the three zzso The multiplex zzso product is zzso separately with four zzso two for each of the zzso The pair of zzso for each site cut in a zzso zzso Whereas one zzso for each site is theoretically sufficient for zzso the use of complementary pairs of zzso prevents the assignment of a false zzso as a result of false negative or partial zzso This method is fast and reliable, does not rely on probing of zzso and should be widely zzso
