In order to study the role of membrane proteins in zzso colonization by zzso zzso a zzso library was constructed by zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso strain zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso A second library was constructed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso DNA into zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA was transformed into zzso coli strain zzso and zzso onto zzso zzso containing 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso colonies were examined for the expression of zzso zzso zzso by colony zzso using rabbit zzso to strain zzso Nine positive clones were zzso Three of these clones produced proteins that reacted with rabbit zzso to strain zzso on a Western transfer, and seven of these clones reacted with rabbit zzso to strain zzso as measured by indirect zzso One zzso clone contained an zzso zzso zzso which directed the synthesis of a zzso with an Mr of 20,000 as measured by zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of a zzso leader sequence at the zzso zzso suggesting that the native protein is a membrane component of zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso can be expressed in zzso coli, and some of these proteins may be expressed on the zzso coli cell zzso
