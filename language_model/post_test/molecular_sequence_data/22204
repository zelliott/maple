zzso a zzso hormone produced by the stomach in zzso stimulates growth hormone release and food zzso Recently, zzso was identified and characterized in chicken zzso and shown to stimulate growth hormone release but inhibit feed zzso The purpose of this work was to identify and further characterize the zzso gene in chickens and in zzso Using molecular cloning techniques we have zzso zzso corresponding to chicken zzso zzso and turkey zzso zzso A total of 844 zzso or zzso zzso bases including the complete coding regions zzso and the zzso and zzso regions zzso were zzso zzso sequence zzso predicted a 116 zzso acid precursor protein zzso for both the chicken and the turkey that demonstrated complete conservation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso 3 of the mature zzso known to be a modification zzso site important for zzso zzso Additional zzso sequence was found in the zzso of both zzso and turkey zzso that was not present in zzso or the red jungle zzso The turkey zzso zzso zzso from zzso DNA templates, contained five zzso and four zzso a structure similar to zzso and chicken zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso with much lower levels of expression in other zzso such as zzso brain, and zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso levels relative to zzso zzso in zzso male broiler zzso The level of zzso zzso increased in zzso in response to zzso but did not decline with subsequent zzso Plasma zzso levels did not change significantly in response to zzso or zzso and did not appear to reflect changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels declined in broiler zzso after a 48 h fast and increased upon zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso for zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and a zzso form was detected in a variety of zzso collected from zzso male broiler chickens possibly suggesting zzso zzso These results offer new information about the avian zzso and zzso zzso genes and the potential role that this system might play in regulating feed intake and energy balance in zzso
