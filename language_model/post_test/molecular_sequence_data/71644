Based on zzso mapping data, we recently revealed an unexpected linkage of zzso genes in the human zzso the six genes zzso zzso muscle zzso I and zzso T zzso are located at three zzso sites, each of which carries a zzso zzso T gene zzso Here we have investigated the organization of these genes at the DNA level in isolated zzso and zzso zzso clones and demonstrate close physical linkage in two cases through the isolation of individual clones containing a complete zzso zzso T gene zzso As an initial step toward fully characterizing this pattern of linkage, we have determined the organization and complete sequence of the locus zzso cardiac zzso I and slow skeletal zzso T and thereby also provide the first determination of the structure and sequence of a slow skeletal zzso T zzso Our data show that the genes are organized head to tail and are separated by only zzso zzso of intervening zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso and despite their close zzso the cardiac zzso I and slow skeletal zzso T genes show independent zzso zzso Such close physical linkage has implications for the evolution of the zzso gene families, for their regulation, and for the analysis of zzso implicated in zzso
