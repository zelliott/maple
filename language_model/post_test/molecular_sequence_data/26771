A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a sea salt evaporation pond on the Island of Sal in the Cape zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed a clear affiliation of the zzso with members of the family zzso zzso similarities between zzso and the type strains of the species of the zzso zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso 8 zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso iso zzso zzso iso zzso zzso iso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The species represented by strain zzso could be distinguished from the species of the zzso zzso and zzso however, it was not possible to distinguish both zzso from each other using the zzso or zzso characteristics zzso zzso we propose that the species classified in the zzso zzso should be transferred to the zzso zzso We also propose that, on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a new species which we name zzso zzso
