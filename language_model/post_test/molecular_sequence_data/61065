This review gives an overview about the structural zzso of different evolutionary lines of all zzso capable of efficient zzso of hydrogen zzso Major potential applications in biotechnology and clinical medicine justify further zzso According to structural and functional similarities zzso can be divided in three zzso Typical zzso are zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of six representatives has been resolved to atomic zzso The central core of each zzso reveals a characteristic zzso zzso extremely well zzso among this zzso In the native zzso structure pairs of zzso tightly interact via exchange of their zzso zzso This zzso structures implies a highly ordered assembly zzso A minor zzso zzso zzso possesses an extra zzso zzso zzso A zzso or zzso 25 A long channel leads from the zzso surface to the deeply buried active zzso It enables rapid and selective diffusion of the zzso to the active zzso In several zzso zzso is tightly bound close to the zzso This zzso may prevent and reverse the formation of compound II, an inactive reaction zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins which probably arose via gene zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso No detailed structural information is currently zzso Even less is know about zzso zzso Their zzso reaction centers may be zzso
