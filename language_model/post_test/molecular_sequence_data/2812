We constructed a zzso zzso zzso virus zzso containing the transcribed coding and zzso sequences of zzso strain F zzso B zzso zzso a gamma 1 zzso fused to the zzso sequences of the zzso alpha 4 gene and inserted into the zzso zzso gene of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains an zzso zzso gene at the natural zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the alpha zzso gene was transcribed in the presence of zzso but underwent partial conversion to the zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the gene indicated that the zzso crossover occurred between zzso 107 and 117 upstream from the translation initiation site and that the 3' crossover occurred between the sequences specifying zzso acids 402 and 412 of the zzso zzso The zzso protein consisted of an zzso 405 to 415 zzso acids zzso by the zzso gene and a zzso zzso to zzso zzso acids zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the parental and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso lost zzso with four zzso zzso but gained zzso with three zzso zzso
