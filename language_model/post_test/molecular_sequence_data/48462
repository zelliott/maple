The essential bacterial protein zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso into a structure at the division site termed the zzso zzso During zzso the Z ring exerts a zzso force on the membrane by using the chemical energy of zzso zzso zzso However, the structural basis of this zzso remains zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso which exhibits a curved zzso zzso The structure reveals a zzso interface that is important for zzso The zzso zzso highlights a zzso zzso switch at the zzso loop that leads to zzso zzso between zzso which could generate sufficient force to drive zzso
