The core complex of zzso zzso is formed by the association of the zzso antenna 1 zzso and the reaction center zzso The zzso protein is essential for zzso zzso it is located within the core in a 1 : 1 zzso with the zzso zzso is required for a fast zzso exchange between the zzso site of the zzso and the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso complex is assembled in a zzso form, where zzso is involved as a structural zzso We have modified the zzso protein at the N and the zzso with progressive zzso The nine zzso obtained have been characterized for their ability for zzso growth, the zzso of zzso in the core zzso complex, the stability of the zzso and the zzso of zzso reduction of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 18 zzso at the zzso zzso the zzso in zzso without preventing zzso zzso The zzso (or a stable zzso does not seem to be a necessary requisite for the zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions impede the zzso of zzso while the complete absence of the zzso leads to the zzso of a zzso protein composed of only its first 53 zzso and does not affect the zzso growth of the zzso Overall, the results point to a complex role of the N and C zzso in the structural organization of the core complex; the zzso is suggested to be responsible mainly for zzso while the zzso is thought to be involved mainly in zzso zzso
