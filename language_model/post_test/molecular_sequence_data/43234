The characterization of novel zzso zzso and zzso proteins has been enhanced by a panel of zzso zzso specific for protein zzso of transforming and zzso zzso zzso These protein zzso have included the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was generated as part of this panel of zzso and was used to isolate the human gene for a zzso zzso The zzso sequence is zzso zzso in length with a predicted open reading frame consisting of zzso zzso zzso The zzso is largely zzso and highly zzso The central region of zzso has zzso identity with the entire zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso A zzso The zzso third of zzso contains a unique cluster of 10 zzso acid repeats with the consensus sequence zzso The zzso protein was found primarily in the zzso of zzso and is part of a zzso protein complex with prominent members of zzso zzso 64, 45, 40, 38, and 25 zzso Finally, we illustrate the conservation of zzso and its associated complex, and demonstrate its expression in different human zzso and cell zzso The data suggest that zzso is novel and has an important cellular function as a zzso structural zzso
