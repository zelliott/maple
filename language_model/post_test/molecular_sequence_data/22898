zzso also known as zzso was originally isolated from the culture medium of melanoma cells as a zzso promoting zzso It regulates cell growth, zzso and zzso through the production of zzso acid and zzso zzso Because zzso shows overall structural similarity to the zzso zzso it has been assumed to be a type II zzso protein that is expressed on the cell surface and is released into the zzso space after zzso zzso We found, however, that while zzso was efficiently zzso into the zzso space both in zzso and in zzso it was expressed neither on the surfaces of zzso cells nor on those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed that it was zzso at two zzso sites that match the consensus sequences for zzso by a signal zzso and zzso In addition, when translated in zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a signal sequence was zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso sequence of zzso functions as a signal zzso not as a zzso segment, and thus zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso
