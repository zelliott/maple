Previously we reported that the zzso sequence zzso of the zzso region of the zzso B virus surface zzso plays an important role on zzso zzso against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by affecting the B cell zzso zzso of a zzso existing within the sequence zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso zzso In this study, we try to map the zzso zzso binding site using a series of zzso peptides in the sequence zzso by competitive zzso zzso zzso were greatly reduced when the zzso 131 zzso 137 zzso 140 zzso 141 zzso and 142 zzso were zzso The zzso 133 zzso zzso zzso and 136 zzso had a slight affect on the zzso zzso whereas the zzso 135 zzso and 139 zzso had no effects on the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso however, three zzso zzso zzso showed the lowest zzso to the zzso zzso at position zzso These results suggest that the zzso against zzso zzso is zzso zzso
