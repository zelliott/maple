The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of utilizing a factor zzso zzso site within a zzso protein containing the zzso A chain zzso zzso zzso of zzso is believed to be an essential step during the zzso phase of zzso zzso Failure to incorporate such zzso sites in zzso containing zzso results in a loss of toxin action zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso and zzso zzso (1988) Gene zzso In this report we describe the introduction of a factor zzso site in the zzso of zzso which we use here as a model zzso Upon zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after expression in zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso does have access to the engineered recognition sequence (albeit at low zzso and that the presence of the latter does not interfere with zzso bond formation or the zzso activity of the zzso B chain zzso Upon zzso and reduction, the zzso zzso displays zzso ability, indicating that the presence of the modified zzso at its zzso does not interfere with its zzso zzso The general zzso of using such a zzso site in zzso zzso with zzso is zzso
