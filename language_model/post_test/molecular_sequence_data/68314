The zzso of the zzso method to the structural analysis of zzso zzso carbohydrates was investigated using fully zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid (1 and 2, zzso Both compounds were fully stable to reductive zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but were slowly zzso in the presence of zzso and promoters such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, after selective reduction of the zzso groups of 1 and 2 with sodium zzso the products (3 and 4, zzso underwent rapid reductive zzso to yield the expected zzso which were characterized as their zzso (8 and zzso by zzso The major product was also characterized as its zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The usefulness of this zzso method was demonstrated using zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso and the products were zzso Analysis by zzso revealed the products expected from terminal zzso zzso (8 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in relative zzso ratios of zzso zzso However, direct reductive zzso of the fully zzso zzso zzso yielded the fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the product zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso These experiments therefore established both the composition and the sequence of the zzso
