The E1 protein of human zzso zzso type 16 is the only known zzso E1 which does not contain any zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of its zzso zzso To ascertain whether this feature influences the activities of zzso zzso we generated a zzso zzso E1 zzso in which zzso are inserted in place of zzso in this site, making the zzso identical to its bovine zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso and zzso were produced, zzso and used to zzso for zzso ability, zzso activity and ability to complex with the zzso zzso zzso The results show that the lack of zzso in the zzso which is unique to zzso zzso significantly zzso its zzso and zzso activities without affecting its ability to complex with the zzso zzso zzso
