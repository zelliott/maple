A zzso form of mouse zzso zzso 17, the zzso contains several zzso responsible for transmission ratio distortion in zzso zzso carrying the zzso locus zzso have a high probability of zzso eggs at the expense of zzso zzso provided that zzso zzso zzso to zzso are expressed during zzso zzso has been mapped to the zzso region within a maximum of 155 zzso In the search for genes in the zzso region zzso we have identified the mouse zzso of human zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso on zzso zzso The complete mouse zzso gene is zzso in the region zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso It consists of at least 13 zzso spanning over more than 120 zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and in several adult zzso including zzso zzso covering 100 zzso of the zzso region or 120 zzso of the zzso region were zzso zzso covers about 65 zzso of the zzso region and appears to be incomplete at its zzso A correlation of the physical map provided here with the genetic mapping of zzso reported previously suggests that zzso is most likely zzso within a zzso of 30 zzso upstream or 20 zzso downstream of zzso These data will facilitate the isolation of zzso a prerequisite for understanding transmission ratio distortion in zzso
