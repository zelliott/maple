In zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso (Mr zzso and zzso (Mr zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso that mediate transport of zzso zzso to zzso Our studies have revealed the appearance of these putative receptors in zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso tissue extracts contain several zzso zzso activities and here we describe the affinity zzso of zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso that exhibited a molecular mass of zzso in zzso under reducing zzso It has also zzso with an zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting zzso similarities among the two zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso peptides of the zzso zzso in combination with de zzso sequencing allowed us to do partial zzso acid sequence determination of the zzso These data suggest that this zzso zzso is zzso to the known zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso dependent interaction with the immobilized zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso targeting zzso is zzso even among the zzso
