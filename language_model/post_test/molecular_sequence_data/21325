Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to pathogen zzso Resistance against zzso pathogens generally requires the zzso of the zzso acid zzso signaling pathway, whereas the salicylic acid zzso signaling zzso is mainly activated against zzso zzso zzso can antagonize zzso signaling and vice zzso Here, we report that the zzso pathogen zzso zzso exploits this antagonism as a strategy to cause disease zzso We show that zzso zzso produces an zzso which acts as an zzso of the zzso zzso In turn, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling pathway, thereby allowing the fungus to develop its disease in tomato zzso zzso zzso disease development occurs through zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso signaling zzso required for tomato resistance against zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso These data highlight a new strategy used by zzso zzso to overcome the plant's defense system and to spread within the zzso
