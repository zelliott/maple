Three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso share significant sequence identity with the human candidate tumor zzso zzso in their zzso zzso The zzso regions contain zzso finger zzso which have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso like human zzso is localized in the zzso zzso of zzso results in several zzso including an abnormal zzso zzso an inability to zzso zzso carbon sources, heat shock sensitivity, slow growth, temperature sensitivity, and sensitivity to zzso These zzso are suppressed by expression of either human zzso or zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and human proteins are functionally zzso zzso and zzso cells also share some of these zzso We demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso tests that zzso interacts with zzso a component of zzso zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrated by zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with zzso activities in zzso zzso and zzso evidence indicate that the zzso zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that the zzso zzso proteins are involved in zzso zzso They further suggest that these functions may be zzso in zzso and provide a possible mechanism for the human zzso candidate tumor zzso
