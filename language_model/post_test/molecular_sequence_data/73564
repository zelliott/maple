A convenient and straightforward synthesis of an zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compatible with zzso solid phase zzso synthesis strategy is zzso This zzso was used to incorporate zzso at an internal sequence position in an zzso zzso protein zzso After zzso from the zzso and standard zzso the zzso was zzso by zzso liquid zzso and characterized by mass zzso Through this methodology, flexible zzso of different lengths and containing various structures can be placed between the zzso backbone of peptides and metal zzso These peptides will provide a new class of affinity zzso zzso that can be directed against protein and zzso acid zzso
