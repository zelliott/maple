zzso analysis of zzso zzso has been efficiently accomplished by a consecutive mass zzso zzso molecular mass measurement of the protein to detect zzso and to determine the molecular mass change, and fragmentation analysis with zzso zzso to determine the site and type of zzso A flaw of this method is an inherent inability to detect a zzso associated with no or little change of the molecular zzso In the present study, the strategy was improved by incorporating genetic analysis prior to mass zzso which confirms the resulting zzso acid change and searches for possible zzso zzso The method was applied to an unknown zzso and zzso a substitution of zzso for zzso acid at position 43 of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
