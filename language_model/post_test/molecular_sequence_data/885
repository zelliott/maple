The zzso gene has been identified as zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso that is essential in zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso has been identified as a zzso of zzso programming in a variety of signal zzso pathways including zzso nuclear hormones, zzso and zzso zzso However, Skip has been also identified in zzso zzso complexes but an explicit role in zzso has not been identified in zzso zzso To determine if the Skip protein could function as a zzso factor we investigated if the zzso gene could functionally complement the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso the zzso deletion and zzso the lethal zzso These results show that the human zzso gene can functionally substitute for the zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso
