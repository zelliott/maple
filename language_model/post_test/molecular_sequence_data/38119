The structure of human zzso in the zzso form was determined at zzso A resolution by X-ray zzso The structure was initially solved by MAD phasing of an zzso crystal and was refined against data obtained from a zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso was stabilized by zzso interactions between mutually wrapped zzso There were two zzso motifs per zzso and each zzso bound one zzso with a different affinity zzso affinity of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso was stronger than that of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, replacement with zzso occurred in the zzso zzso only, suggesting a more flexible nature for zzso than for zzso This, combined with previous observations that the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a large zzso change upon calcium zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso plays a role as a trigger for zzso zzso zzso
