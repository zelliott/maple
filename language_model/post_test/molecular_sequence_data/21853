The zzso zzso zzso axis is established during zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to the anterior and zzso poles of the zzso Although genetic screens have identified some zzso factors required for the zzso of these zzso other factors may have been missed because they also function at other stages of zzso To circumvent this problem, we performed a screen for zzso and dominant zzso of the zzso zzso caused by expressing zzso in the female zzso Miranda zzso zzso zzso complexes to the zzso anterior by zzso them to the zzso zzso pathway, resulting in the formation of an anterior abdomen in place of the zzso In one class of zzso Miranda still binds zzso zzso complexes, but does not zzso to the zzso identifying an anterior targeting domain at the N zzso of zzso This has an almost identical sequence to the N zzso of zzso zzso which is also a large zzso zzso suggesting that it may be a divergent Miranda zzso In addition, we recovered 30 dominant zzso including multiple zzso of the zzso short stop, a lethal zzso group that prevents zzso zzso zzso and a female sterile zzso group that zzso the anterior zzso of zzso zzso in late zzso One of the single zzso zzso proved to be a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealing a previously zzso function of zzso in pole zzso zzso and the induction of zzso filaments by Long zzso zzso
