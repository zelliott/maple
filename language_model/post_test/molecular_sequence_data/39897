The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso of zzso gene as a molecular marker for the reliable discrimination and zzso of dairy zzso and the closely related zzso zzso of the zzso zzso varying in size between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso consensus zzso constructed by aligning zzso sequences of some zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes for the type and reference strains of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso to remove ambiguous positions present in the current database reports, such to improve the zzso scheme of zzso As found for other bacterial species, zzso sequences permitted a better distinction among the dairy zzso considered than zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso trees constructed on the zzso gene regions zzso and their putative translations appeared rather different and less statistically valid than the zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, the possibility of designing zzso identification and detection tests on the new zzso sequences was demonstrated by assessing specific amplification protocols for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
