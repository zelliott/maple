To the major zzso factors of zzso bacteria belong the zzso zzso which are very well characterized for their zzso pharmacological and zzso effects displayed in zzso cells and zzso In general, these zzso zzso comprise three regions, which can be differentiated by their structures, function, zzso and zzso zzso A, the core region and a zzso portion, which may be the zzso zzso zzso Common zzso zzso or a zzso zzso In the past, much emphasis has been laid on the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso A was proven to represent the toxic principle of zzso active zzso however, its toxicity depends not only on its structure but also on that of the core region, which is zzso linked to zzso zzso Thus, and since the core region possesses zzso properties, complete structural analyses of zzso core regions and of zzso relation are highly important for a better understanding of zzso zzso To date, quite a number of core structures from zzso of various zzso bacteria have been published and summarized in several zzso This short review adds to this knowledge those structures of zzso zzso that were published between January 2002 and October zzso
