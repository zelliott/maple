The rapid and dramatic induction of zzso proteins is accomplished by regulatory mechanisms acting at many different zzso Here we review current knowledge of two zzso mechanisms employed during the response in the fruit fly zzso zzso zzso zzso messages are translated with high efficiency during heat shock while most normal cellular messages are zzso zzso in the zzso leader of heat shock zzso govern their preferential zzso zzso The messages for zzso proteins are unstable at normal zzso During heat zzso however, they are very stable and accumulate in large zzso zzso in their zzso regions play a major role in determining their zzso
