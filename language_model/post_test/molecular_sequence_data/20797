Wild relatives of cultivated tomato zzso zzso are resistant to a wide range of zzso and zzso stress zzso In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms of salt stress resistance in the wild and cultivated zzso species, a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor was identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and named zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the three proteins are zzso identical among them and present high zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso factors described in different plant species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and tobacco zzso 50% zzso zzso of these zzso genes is zzso similarly in the three species by salt zzso The expression of zzso was further investigated in zzso zzso and found to be induced by drought, cold and zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of this zzso factor in response to zzso stress, a simple transient expression zzso was used for rapid analysis of genes regulated by zzso in tomato and tobacco by means of zzso zzso zzso leaves expressing zzso showed zzso of zzso genes such as zzso the zzso genes zzso and zzso the zzso factor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this class of zzso plays a role in zzso stress response in the zzso zzso
