zzso libraries were constructed from fast skeletal muscles of carp zzso to 10 and 30 degrees C for a minimum of 5 weeks and were screened for zzso zzso light zzso zzso and zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso Two types of zzso zzso clone were isolated and termed zzso and zzso their zzso sequences showed zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso zzso clones isolated was approximately zzso showing no apparent changes following temperature zzso The occurrence of the two zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso No zzso was, however, detected for zzso while zzso in the overlapping region between zzso and zzso zzso was only zzso even after the most probable zzso Southern zzso analyses zzso with zzso clones specific to zzso and zzso showed different zzso patterns from each other, demonstrating that carp zzso and zzso are zzso by different zzso These results are in marked contrast to those from higher zzso which express zzso and zzso from a single gene by alternative zzso zzso and two modes of zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the ratios of zzso zzso were significantly higher zzso in 30 degrees zzso than in 10 degrees zzso zzso zzso
