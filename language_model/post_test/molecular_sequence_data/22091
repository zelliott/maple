To further our understanding of zzso gene function during cardiac development, we zzso zzso to examine zzso role in the early steps of heart zzso We identified fragments of three fog genes in the zzso zzso database and isolated full-length coding sequences for each of these genes by using a combination of zzso and zzso One gene was similar to zzso zzso zzso while the remaining two were similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso proteins were able to physically interact with zzso and function as zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed zzso expression in the heart, the zzso system, and the brain, while zzso and zzso expression was restricted to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso directed against zzso resulted in zzso with a large zzso zzso and an zzso heart zzso This looping zzso could be rescued by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso repression zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of zzso proteins for zzso cardiac development and suggest a previously unappreciated role for zzso proteins in heart looping that is dependent on the zzso repression zzso
