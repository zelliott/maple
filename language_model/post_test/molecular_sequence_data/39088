Chlorella zzso cultures grown in a zzso zzso medium zzso in the dark rapidly zzso zzso zzso to red zzso This zzso process was investigated under different growth zzso Supply of nitrogen to the culture medium zzso inhibited zzso and the synthesis of zzso as did the addition to zzso of zzso or a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso had no zzso During zzso zzso breakdown was accompanied by the degradation of cellular proteins such as zzso complex II, zzso f and zzso zzso During growth in zzso zzso activity increased and proteins zzso zzso with an zzso against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso cells were used for differential and zzso screening to isolate zzso representing genes with zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso Several different zzso were identified with different patterns of expression during Chlorella growth but which were all expressed at higher levels during zzso Among these, zzso was most abundant and its expression was exclusive in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences showed that they zzso different proteins including a novel zzso acid carrier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several new zzso
