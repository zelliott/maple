The crystal structure of a complex between a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and human zzso has been solved and refined at zzso A to an R factor of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso zzso complex with zzso is highly potent with a Ki zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, lower than that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso portion of the inhibitor is linked to the zzso recognition zzso binding portion by a zzso zzso The strong zzso effect provided by the permanent positive charge on the zzso nitrogen makes the zzso zzso carbon more susceptible to zzso zzso In the zzso a zzso zzso complex is zzso The electron density surrounding the active site portion and the zzso of the inhibitor is very well zzso clearly showing the existence of a zzso bond between the zzso O gamma and the now zzso carbon of the zzso The decreased binding ability of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso is discussed as is the effect of replacing the zzso zzso with zzso The electron density surrounding the remainder of the inhibitor is generally well zzso the exceptions being the zzso zzso the highly flexible zzso zzso and some of the zzso side zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
