zzso zzso virus immediate early zzso gene zzso is regulated via the upstream zzso motif and involves the recruitment of the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso and a component of the zzso zzso into a zzso complex termed the immediate early complex zzso An upstream zzso element zzso has been zzso to mediate a response to zzso independent of zzso We have studied zzso formation in gel shift zzso using DNA fragments containing these sequence elements from the zzso zzso gene 3 promoter in different zzso The results show that a factor which zzso to the zzso zzso with zzso to increase zzso levels on a zzso motif located 5 zzso zzso to the zzso The factor alone is unable to promote zzso zzso We were unable to demonstrate any effect of this factor on a zzso motif located 16 zzso from the zzso suggesting that this effect is not universal for all zzso zzso
