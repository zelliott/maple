An zzso of the production and zzso processes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso B2 from zzso zzso zzso by zzso expression in zzso coli is zzso The genes zzso mature zzso were cloned into an zzso coli expression system and expressed as a fusion protein with a zzso zzso zzso zzso coli were cultivated following a zzso zzso process with zzso temperature and zzso zzso The zzso of the fusion proteins was improved by replacing zzso by zzso The fusion proteins were zzso by zzso zzso followed by affinity zzso The zzso fusion protein was removed by using zzso instead of zzso and the zzso were recovered by zzso zzso These zzso led us to produce up to 320 zzso of pure protein per liter of culture, which is four to ten fold higher than what is described for other zzso expression zzso
