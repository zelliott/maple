zzso proteins zzso are the most complex family of zzso peptides with distinct zzso and zzso Up to date, only the zzso zzso at positions 8, 17, and 22 have been zzso observed on zzso zzso zzso and at position 8 on basic zzso and zzso The presence of a zzso group at zzso was also noticed on zzso The main goal of this study was to identify new zzso and distinct zzso of zzso zzso using zzso Through the zzso zzso characterization of 20 different subjects from zzso zzso and Head and Neck Cancer groups, it was possible to identify the following zzso zzso zzso sites: two in basic zzso protein 2 zzso one in zzso and one in zzso zzso zzso sites: two in zzso and one in zzso zzso other terminal zzso sites: six in zzso two in zzso and two in zzso zzso other modifications such as zzso zzso zzso in zzso six in zzso eight in zzso and nine in zzso zzso zzso in zzso three in zzso one in zzso one in zzso and one in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso data analysis allowed the identification of 45 new zzso zzso mainly due to zzso zzso and conversion of zzso to zzso Moreover, comparing all subject groups, it was noticed a predominance of zzso zzso modification on zzso in the Head and Neck Cancer zzso
