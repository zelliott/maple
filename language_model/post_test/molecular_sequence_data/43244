The zzso protein zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso proteins and the zzso coli integration host zzso We recently proposed that zzso which binds with high affinity zzso was approximately 3 zzso to preferred sites within the zzso zzso zzso zzso identifies its binding sites based on zzso DNA zzso Here, we show that two zzso base pair steps coinciding with two previously proposed sites of DNA distortion are critical for complex zzso The affinity of zzso is reduced zzso when both of these zzso base pair steps are replaced with zzso zzso or zzso zzso only modest changes in affinity result when zzso are made at other base pairs of the zzso binding zzso Replacement of all zzso zzso with zzso decreases the affinity of zzso zzso zzso the high affinity is restored when the two zzso base pair steps corresponding to previously suggested sites of distortion are reintroduced into otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso spaced apart by 9 base pairs of duplex also generate zzso affinity of zzso We suggest that twin zzso base pair steps located at the proposed sites of distortion are key to target site selection by zzso and that recognition is based zzso if not entirely, on zzso DNA zzso
