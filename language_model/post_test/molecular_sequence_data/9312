zzso belongs to the family of background zzso channels with two pore zzso In native and zzso cells, zzso is detected mainly in recycling zzso In principal cells in the zzso zzso gene zzso leads to the loss of a zzso zzso zzso an unexpected effect that was attributed to zzso regulation of other zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso selectivity is modulated by zzso zzso Although zzso is zzso selective at neutral zzso it becomes permeable to zzso at the zzso pH found in zzso zzso recovery is slow after restoration of a neutral zzso Such zzso makes plausible a role of zzso as a background channel in which selectivity and resulting zzso or zzso influences on cell zzso rely on its recycling rate between internal zzso stores and the plasma zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cells are more polarized than control cells, confirming a zzso role of zzso in kidney and pancreatic zzso
