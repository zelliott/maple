We have characterized the zzso structure and expression of the mouse gene for zzso The cloned zzso gene spans a zzso region encompassing the promoter, five zzso four zzso and the zzso zzso All zzso junction sequences conform to the zzso zzso The promoter region has typical features of a zzso zzso a high G + C content zzso a high frequency of zzso zzso in particular within the region zzso zzso upstream of the site of initiation of zzso and the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrated the presence of multiple sites for initiation of zzso around a site 108 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the human gene for zzso zzso zinc finger zzso revealed a striking zzso of both their zzso and deduced protein zzso an identical zzso organization and high similarity in promoter architecture and zzso expression zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of zzso revealed numerous potential binding sites for zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso An element required for zzso zzso expression was mapped from zzso zzso to zzso This region also zzso stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso expressed zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is the zzso zzso of human zzso and, like it, belongs to the family of zzso zzso
