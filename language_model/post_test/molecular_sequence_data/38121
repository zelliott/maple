The zzso A zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso coli, zzso and zzso zzso conditions were screened using the zzso zzso method and resulted in two distinct crystal zzso Form I zzso zzso to zzso A and belong to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso Form II zzso zzso to zzso A and belong to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso and packing analyses for both crystal forms indicate that the zzso unit may contain one and two copies of the zzso zzso for crystal forms I and II, zzso
