zzso zzso of 111 zzso cross water zzso zzso zzso were collected in the zzso and zzso districts of Nepal from December 2009 to February zzso zzso worms showing a typical zzso character were detected in 13 of 53 zzso zzso in zzso and in 5 of 58 zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were identical to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso except for the length of the left zzso relative to the body zzso zzso electron zzso did not detect any further zzso differences regarding the collected zzso from Nepal compared with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso including internal transcribed zzso zzso 1 and 2, and a partial region of the zzso c zzso zzso I zzso of zzso DNA of the worms were characterized and compared with those of zzso zzso collected from zzso zzso wild zzso and monkeys in Japan and from cattle in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso worms had zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, with those of zzso zzso from the other host zzso The ITS regions exhibited higher variations between the zzso worms and zzso zzso from the other host zzso zzso identity for zzso and zzso identity for zzso The zzso also showed lower identities zzso although only a single zzso acid substitution was noted compared with the majority of zzso zzso samples collected in zzso Based on these molecular genetic characters in the zzso and zzso zzso DNA, together with a shorter left zzso length relative to body zzso the zzso worms isolated from zzso in Nepal might belong to a distinct local or zzso population of zzso zzso although its geographical distribution on the continent and host specificity remain to be zzso
