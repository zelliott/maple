The cellular zzso usage of numerous human zzso can differ significantly between zzso clinical zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso displays a zzso specificity as determined with a zzso complex consisting of zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso In this study, the cellular zzso interactions of zzso zzso clinical zzso with respect to their interactions with cell zzso zzso and zzso were compared to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso usage of zzso and zzso by zzso clinical zzso was confirmed by cell zzso and zzso binding zzso The cellular attachment of clinical and zzso zzso strains to cells that zzso zzso and zzso was not additive compared to the viral binding to cells expressing one or other zzso In fact, the binding data suggest there is an zzso of zzso cellular attachment in environments where high-level zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rendered cells susceptible to zzso infection by the zzso clinical zzso In a novel finding, three clinical zzso could, to various degrees, zzso and lyse zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of clinical and zzso virus zzso identified a number of coding changes that may contribute to the observed enhanced zzso usage zzso of the clinical zzso zzso None of the zzso acid changes was located in the previously zzso zzso zzso a zzso environment that was zzso on the zzso surface of all zzso clinical zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso strains of zzso can zzso target cells expressing either zzso or zzso alone and that such interactions extend tissue zzso and impact directly on viral zzso
