zzso is a zzso processing zzso that achieves zzso of zzso zzso units through its unique property of zzso the zzso chain internally with the release of zzso zzso zzso By chemically zzso the characteristic zzso product, zzso alpha zzso a number of potent zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso among which were zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), which, while blocking the in zzso action of the zzso had negligible effect on other zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although preparation of a large number of zzso alpha zzso derivatives did not yield a more effective zzso inhibitor it provided valuable information relating to the structural requirements for the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was found to be active not only on rat liver zzso but also on the zzso from a number of other sources including mouse zzso zzso zzso baby zzso zzso and zzso canine kidney cell zzso When tested in zzso in zzso and zzso canine kidney cells during a zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso interrupted the zzso processing zzso as evident from a zzso zzso of complex zzso formation and zzso zzso similarly the capacity of the zzso zzso mouse zzso cell line zzso to zzso complex zzso was blocked by zzso alpha zzso zzso could not be detected in Chinese zzso zzso cells by in zzso zzso and consistent with this these cells produced only zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso It would appear that by acting in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and related zzso agents could have the potential of influencing the exit of zzso from the zzso zzso and interfering with viral zzso
