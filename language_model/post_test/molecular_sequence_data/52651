zzso sequences of the 153 zzso acids have been designed to fit the zzso framework of the zzso whale zzso zzso structure based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso The previously designed artificial zzso zzso folded into a zzso zzso highly zzso and zzso form with overall dimensions similar to those of the target structure, but it lacked structural uniqueness at the zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso In this study, we redesigned zzso sites of zzso to improve the structural zzso Several zzso and Met zzso in zzso were replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso referring to the zzso profile of zzso to produce three redesigned zzso zzso These zzso replacements resulted in no significant changes of their zzso and zzso contents in the absence of zzso whereas they significantly affected the dependence of the secondary structure on the concentration of zzso zzso The analyses of the zzso zzso revealed higher global zzso of the designed zzso than that of natural zzso Among zzso zzso in which 11 zzso zzso of zzso are replaced with seven zzso and four Val zzso and one Met zzso is replaced with zzso displayed the lowest stability but the most cooperative zzso transition and the most dispersed zzso spectrum with the smallest line zzso The present results indicate that the replacements of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso acids at appropriate sites reduce the freedom of zzso zzso and improve the structural specificity at the expense of zzso
