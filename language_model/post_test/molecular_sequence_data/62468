zzso progression may be controlled by various fragments derived from zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso of type IV zzso We demonstrated previously that a zzso sequence from the zzso domain of the zzso collagen chain zzso the in zzso expression of zzso zzso in human melanoma cells through zzso binding to zzso zzso In the present paper, we demonstrate that in a mouse melanoma model, the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumor growth in a zzso zzso The decrease of tumor growth is the result of an zzso of cell proliferation and a decrease of cell invasive properties by zzso of zzso zzso mainly zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A shorter zzso zzso the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso shares the same zzso zzso The three-dimensional structures of the zzso and zzso zzso peptides show a zzso at the zzso zzso sequence level, which is crucial for biological zzso As well, the zzso zzso zzso keeps the zzso and the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which does not form the zzso at the zzso level, is devoid of zzso zzso zzso studies indicate a strong zzso relationship of the peptides and point to the zzso turn as necessary for biological zzso These peptides could act as potent and specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso in melanoma zzso
