The placement of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was proposed zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, upon further studies of zzso zzso In this study, zzso characteristics and zzso zzso data are presented and the transfer of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso The original description of the strain zzso zzso indicated that it was capable of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso and growth, utilizing nitrate as a terminal electron zzso during the zzso of organic acids and zzso but not aromatic zzso or zzso zzso The total fatty acid composition supported the assignment of strain zzso to the zzso and resembled that of members of the zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso gene zzso evidence, zzso and zzso characteristics and zzso zzso data supported the placement of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as representing a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
