We have previously shown that the zzso 2 zzso zzso gamma chain is a member of the zzso zzso zzso and is indispensable for the formation of zzso complexes with high and intermediate affinities for zzso The present study demonstrates that the alpha beta gamma zzso and beta gamma zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells can zzso zzso signals for zzso of zzso zzso and for induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso of the gamma chain lacking the zzso 68 zzso acids in its zzso region showed a loss of such zzso ability when incorporated into the zzso zzso complexes but brought no effect on zzso binding and zzso zzso Another zzso with a zzso deletion of 30 zzso zzso retained the ability to activate a zzso zzso and to induce zzso expression but lost the ability to induce zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that at least two distinct signals, one for zzso zzso which parallels zzso zzso zzso and the other for zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso from the zzso zzso complexes zzso on zzso zzso
