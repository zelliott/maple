zzso folding requires two zzso systems, zzso the 900 zzso zzso zzso referred to as the zzso complex or zzso which zzso folding of the zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso 180 zzso complex which zzso further assembly into zzso zzso zzso were expressed in rabbit zzso zzso and the effect of zzso zzso and internal deletions on the binding of zzso zzso to the 900 and 180 zzso complexes was zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso were also zzso These studies support the concept of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso similar in size to the zzso in the native protein were implicated in facilitated zzso zzso an internal or zzso composed of zzso approximately zzso which binds to zzso a zzso composed of zzso approximately zzso which interacts less strongly with zzso and may contain regulatory sequences for zzso release from the zzso and an zzso composed of zzso approximately zzso which apparently does not interact with zzso but does interact with the 180 zzso zzso The major zzso region, zzso approximately zzso (the zzso zzso overlapped portions of the zzso and zzso and included a putative zzso zzso segment which may be a preferential site of interaction with zzso This segment may also be important for zzso assembly and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso from the zzso end or zzso 27 zzso from the zzso and caused the zzso to arrest on zzso It is proposed that zzso and zzso regions of zzso structurally interact with zzso region approximately zzso to inhibit binding to zzso
