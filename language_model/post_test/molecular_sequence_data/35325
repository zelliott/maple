The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene inhibited completely electron transfer from zzso toward zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned and the protein zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques including CD, zzso and zzso zzso were used to characterize zzso This zzso contains one zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso coordination and unusual zzso zzso This reduction potential is zzso within the zzso zzso pH range, and is discussed within the context of the electron transfer mechanisms from zzso to zzso zzso
