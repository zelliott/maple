The zzso repeated zzso sequence in the zzso regulatory region of human zzso zzso zzso which has been reported to be zzso in different zzso was surveyed in zzso Chinese from 9 Han groups, 8 ethnic zzso and 36 individuals representing a zzso zzso zzso fragments were separated by zzso on zzso zzso zzso In addition to the reported double and triple repeats of the zzso sequence in zzso we also detected a novel zzso repeat in this zzso The transient expression activity of zzso with the zzso repeat is almost the same as that of the reported zzso with the triple zzso All three zzso of the repeat type zzso 3, and 5) were further confined by zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso 2 and 3 were zzso and zzso in totally unrelated Chinese samples, respectively, while the frequency of zzso 3 was variable in different Chinese populations with a range from 62 to zzso On the basis of the sequences of the different zzso the existence of the tandem repeats in each zzso might be explained by zzso zzso during DNA zzso
