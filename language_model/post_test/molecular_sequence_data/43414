We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zinc finger protein zzso that plays a role in regulating the zzso and spatial pattern of zzso zzso gene zzso This protein functions by interacting with the zzso factor zzso and modulating its zzso zzso zzso isolated via a zzso zzso screen, zzso a protein containing 29 zzso zinc fingers of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found in brain, eye, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso data indicated that zzso was expressed in the zzso layer, consisting of neural precursor cells and immature sensory zzso of the zzso zzso but not in the mature zzso zzso We showed that the zzso protein bound specifically to zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso The two proteins formed a stable complex in zzso and in zzso binding zzso Introduction of zzso and zzso into cells containing an zzso zzso zzso reporter demonstrated that zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso We propose that the function of zzso is to zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso and to act as a switch protein in the coordination of zzso sensory zzso zzso
