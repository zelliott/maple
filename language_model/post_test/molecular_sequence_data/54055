In previous studies, we established two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the human colon cancer cell line zzso and the human stomach cancer cell line zzso zzso Cellular contents of DNA zzso I zzso I) in the resistant cells were zzso less than those in the corresponding parental zzso In this study, we have shown expression of two species of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The longer zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso and the shorter zzso zzso zzso proved to have a deletion of zzso zzso zzso 58 - zzso or 59 - zzso that caused the zzso deletion of zzso acids 20 - 243 of human zzso zzso The deleted region is identical to zzso 3 - 9 of the zzso zzso The expression level of the zzso zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed only the zzso zzso zzso in lesser amounts than did zzso Mouse zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed higher sensitivity to zzso than the parental cells, whereas those zzso with the deleted zzso zzso showed levels similar to those of the parental zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso however, expression of the truncated zzso I was not detected in cells zzso with the deleted zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of the deleted zzso zzso led to the low expression of zzso zzso I in the resistant zzso
