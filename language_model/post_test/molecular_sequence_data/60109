The alpha zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso show characteristic zzso in zzso brain and restricted zzso Despite the functional importance of these zzso zzso channels and involvement in a number of diseases, little progress has been achieved in deciphering the zzso composition of the zzso zzso occurring in human zzso Thus, the association of alpha and beta zzso was investigated in cerebral zzso and white matter and spinal zzso from autopsy zzso zzso established the presence of zzso zzso and zzso in all the zzso with varying zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso A putative zzso of zzso was found in zzso zzso Both cerebral white matter and spinal zzso contained the zzso zzso and zzso similar to zzso matter, but both lacked zzso and the zzso zzso An apparent zzso zzso was detected in all the samples, whereas only the brain tissue possessed a putative zzso zzso In zzso matter, zzso was zzso with the zzso combination and zzso zzso In white matter, zzso was associated with zzso only, whereas zzso zzso with all the alpha zzso zzso This represents the first description of zzso zzso complexes in the human zzso and demonstrates regional variations, indicative of functional zzso
