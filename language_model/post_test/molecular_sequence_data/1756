zzso sequences have been discovered in the zzso zzso of Aedes zzso and Aedes aegypti zzso demonstrating for the first time an integration into a zzso zzso of a zzso sequence from an zzso virus that replicates without a recognized DNA zzso In the Aedes zzso zzso cell line, an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso processing zzso characteristic of zzso was zzso It is closely related to zzso genes of the Cell zzso Agent and zzso River virus and the corresponding zzso were zzso Integrated sequences zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso were zzso Overall, approximately two-thirds of a zzso zzso were zzso In the Aedes aegypti zzso cell line, a zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso of the Cell zzso Agent and zzso River virus was zzso These zzso integrated DNA sequences were detected in zzso and wild Aedes zzso and Aedes aegypti zzso demonstrating that their discovery is not an zzso resulting from the manipulation of zzso cell lines, since they exist under natural zzso This finding has major implications regarding evolution, as it represents an entirely different mechanism by which genetic diversity may be generated in zzso cells distinct from accepted zzso
