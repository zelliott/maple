The purpose of the present work was to formulate and evaluate zzso zzso as novel zzso gene delivery for colon cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso plasmids containing human FL gene and green fluorescent protein zzso reporter genes were zzso FL and zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared based on the zzso adherence principle and then zzso into zzso zzso The zzso particle size, and zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso were observed using an electron zzso zzso expression was observed by zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was evaluated by the zzso zzso 

zzso plasmids zzso are successfully constructed using gene cloning methods and confirmed by restriction zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso carrying zzso were observed by an electron zzso and showed uniform zzso or elliptical shapes and many zzso The zzso zzso images of zzso zzso zzso showed good expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of cell death indicated a significantly higher level of cell death between the FL group and the control group at 24, 48, and 96 hours after zzso 

zzso zzso show safe and zzso zzso as gene zzso Gene therapy has significant implications for colon cancer treatment in zzso
