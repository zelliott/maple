We have used zzso and chemical zzso to search for altered DNA zzso in the zzso zzso region of the gene for a high mobility group protein zzso from zzso This search was conducted in order to identify potential genetic elements that might be involved in the zzso control of the zzso zzso We identified, in zzso zzso DNA molecules containing a 900 base pair insert of the zzso region of the zzso an zzso site situated within an zzso sequence approximately 120 base pairs upstream from the start of the zzso zzso Chemical modification of zzso DNA with the zzso zzso zzso was limited to a region zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, a probe highly specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly at the boundaries of the zzso zzso These data are most consistent with the interpretation that the zzso sequence adopts a zzso structure when zzso stressed by negative zzso zzso I zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso protects two regions almost zzso from the center of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso DNA binding zzso
