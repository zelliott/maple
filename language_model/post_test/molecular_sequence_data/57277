Plant zzso proteins exhibit a relaxed zzso specificity for DNA sequence motifs containing an zzso zzso zzso mobility shift experiments employing ten different zzso plant zzso proteins demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso core affected binding specificity and identified three different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These ten different zzso proteins could be zzso into three groups according to their qualitative and quantitative specificity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso constant values zzso zzso of these zzso proteins for high affinity zzso and zzso elements and zzso competition gel mobility shift zzso confirmed our zzso zzso Group 1 proteins exhibit a stronger binding affinity for zzso zzso group 2 proteins bind both zzso and zzso motifs with comparable binding zzso whereas the group 3 proteins display a stronger binding affinity for zzso zzso Studies using a panel of zzso and zzso zzso differing in their zzso sequences identified high affinity binding zzso All ten plant zzso proteins zzso except zzso exhibited type A zzso binding activity preferring class I zzso zzso In contrast to the situation observed for zzso zzso zzso motifs displayed a very much more stringent zzso zzso requirement for binding zzso zzso binding experiments using scanning zzso of a high affinity zzso element and zzso hybrid elements demonstrated that zzso protein binding activity depends upon the affinity of protein zzso zzso for zzso zzso Information provided by our systematic analysis of plant zzso DNA binding specificity can be used to identify high affinity binding sites for the plant zzso proteins studied zzso Assuming that only high affinity zzso binding sites are likely to function in zzso identification of these sites will allow us to predict which genes are activated by a particular zzso zzso
