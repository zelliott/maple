zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and is involved in the early stages of numerous infectious zzso zzso is organized into a zzso enabling zzso interaction with zzso Once formed, the zzso complex can be zzso into compartments of increasing zzso We have studied the pH dependence of the zzso state and zzso of the entire zzso domain and neck zzso We present evidence for equilibrium between the zzso and zzso states of the zzso domain, which exhibits a marked dependence with respect to both pH and zzso zzso Using solution zzso scattering we have obtained a molecular envelope of the zzso domain in which a model has been zzso Our results highlight the central role of the neck domain in the zzso control of the zzso state, in the extended zzso of the zzso and in zzso recognition domain organization and zzso This work opens new insight into the molecular mechanism of zzso release and points to new avenues to block the first step of this important infection zzso
