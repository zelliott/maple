zzso cells zzso zzso enteric zzso into the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the most zzso of the mouse zzso peptides in zzso Here, zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso have been shown to zzso or eliminate zzso activity against all of the bacterial species tested regardless of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the C zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso chain eliminated in zzso zzso activity, blocked zzso zzso as well as zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso did not alter the zzso activity relative to zzso showing that zzso activity appears not to require the zzso side chain of zzso at those two zzso zzso restoration of zzso zzso activity occurred when an zzso zzso for zzso substitution was introduced at the zzso N zzso and the zzso zzso exhibited intermediate membrane binding zzso Also, the loss of zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso corresponded with diminished zzso zzso disruptive zzso zzso leakage from zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso was negligible relative to zzso and lower than that induced by zzso the inactive zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso function as zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso or enabling target cell membrane zzso The role of the zzso zzso however, was surprisingly independent of their position in the zzso zzso
