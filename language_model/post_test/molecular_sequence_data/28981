The zzso family of zzso proteins function in multiple capacities including zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso The newest zzso zzso differs from the classical zzso and binds to the zzso domain of zzso Recently, a novel zzso factor zzso was found to interact with zzso suggesting that zzso also possesses a nuclear zzso We isolated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from a zzso stage 17 zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain and three zzso zinc zzso The zzso transcript was present zzso and expressed throughout early embryonic zzso zzso spatial expression was defined via in zzso zzso and was found localized to the brain, eye, ear, zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated their mutual association, whereas related experiments employing zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso additionally zzso Finally, reporter zzso employing a zzso of zzso fused to the zzso DNA binding domain indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso functions throughout development and that its zzso functions may be most apparent in the context of neural zzso The significance of the zzso interaction has yet to be determined, but it may include zzso information from zzso zzso contacts to zzso processes within the zzso
