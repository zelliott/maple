zzso in the factor VIII gene have been discovered for barely more than half of the examined cases of severe zzso zzso To account for the unidentified zzso we propose a model based on the possibility of zzso between zzso sequences located in zzso 22 and upstream of the factor VIII zzso Such a zzso would lead to an inversion of all intervening DNA and a disruption of the zzso We present evidence to support this model and describe a Southern zzso zzso that detects the zzso These findings should be valuable for genetic prediction of zzso A in approximately zzso of families with severe zzso
