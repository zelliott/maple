zzso a human plasma zzso is a zzso of the membrane attack complex formation of the complement system as well as a zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, the positions of the zzso bonds in zzso were zzso zzso was zzso from human seminal plasma by affinity zzso using an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The protein was zzso with zzso and the fragments were separated by zzso zzso The peptides containing zzso bonds were zzso detected with zzso zzso The peptides containing more than two zzso bonds were further zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the fragments were isolated by zzso The zzso acid compositions and the zzso acid sequences of the peptides containing only a zzso bond were zzso zzso bonds thus determined were between zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since there was no free zzso groups in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso should also be linked by a zzso zzso It is notable that all of the zzso bonds in zzso are not only formed by zzso zzso but also appear to form an zzso zzso structure between the two zzso The unique structure could be related to the functions of zzso
