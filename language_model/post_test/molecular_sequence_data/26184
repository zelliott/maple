zzso zzso zzso the type A zzso zzso zzso as a approximately 150 zzso single chain zzso zzso zzso processing yields a approximately 150 zzso zzso protein composed of a approximately 50 zzso light and approximately 100 zzso heavy chain, which has higher zzso zzso action mimics the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso could occur at 4 zzso We have examined 2 such sites and defined the zzso sequences before and after zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the newly zzso approximately 150 zzso single chain zzso zzso remain intact at the zzso of the approximately 50 zzso light chain generated either in the zzso culture or in zzso with zzso or with a zzso zzso from the zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso the single chain zzso in zzso at 1/3 the distance from its zzso on the zzso side of zzso of the sequence zzso before zzso the bond zzso at a slower zzso The data indicate that the zzso zzso is formed in the bacterial culture in at least 2 zzso zzso at zzso produces a approximately 100 zzso heavy zzso zzso which is then zzso zzso 4 zzso downstream at zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso generates the mature heavy chain with Ala as its zzso zzso The approximately 100 zzso heavy chain generated in zzso by zzso the single chain zzso with zzso also has zzso as the zzso zzso
