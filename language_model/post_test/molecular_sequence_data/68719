We have studied the DNA binding properties of a zzso consisting of the zzso terminal 37% of zzso the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso origin of replication binding zzso Using a zzso virus expression system, we expressed and partially zzso this truncated form of zzso zzso which contains the zzso DNA binding zzso zzso specifically recognized zzso binding sites on a 200 base pair DNA zzso containing the zzso origin zzso and appeared to bind as a zzso to each zzso zzso I footprint analysis showed that zzso protected the two high affinity binding sites of zzso but unlike full-length zzso zzso did not induce a zzso change in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso complex, however, caused a zzso change in the origin to be zzso Our results suggest that a domain, or zzso in the zzso zzso are necessary for a zzso origin zzso change to occur and that zzso interactions between binding sites are zzso
