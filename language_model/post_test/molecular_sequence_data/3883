zzso of zzso zzso proceeds by zzso in zzso species also by extensive zzso zzso which predominantly lead to the restoration of zzso for structurally and/or functionally important, zzso zzso acid zzso So far, only one instance of editing outside coding regions has been reported - in the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso This site was proposed to have no functional zzso Here we present an evaluation of an editing site in the zzso zzso zzso region in a related group of zzso zzso zzso editing of this site, as well as the zzso conservation of the resulting zzso zzso point at an important role for the sequence restored by zzso Two potential functions can be zzso zzso zzso secondary structure predictions suggest that the zzso conversion at this site can lead to a modified zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso which could influence zzso zzso zzso zzso editing of the zzso zzso zzso region may tag a so far unidentified small zzso ORF, and lead to the restoration of a zzso zzso zzso A screen with specific zzso zzso against the putative zzso failed to detect such a zzso in zzso zzso However, this failure may be attributable to its low and/or zzso zzso
