Two genes zzso and zzso that zzso zzso of the energy zzso zzso I of the zzso zzso zzso system zzso have previously been identified on the zzso coli zzso We here report the presence of a third zzso coli zzso designated zzso that encodes an zzso I zzso here designated zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses an zzso domain zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso acids zzso joined via two tandem flexible zzso to the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso features of the putative zzso zzso including zzso regulatory signals, are zzso We suggest that zzso zzso functions in zzso regulation of zzso zzso together with previously described zzso proteins zzso within the zzso zzso It may thereby provide a link between carbon and nitrogen zzso zzso
