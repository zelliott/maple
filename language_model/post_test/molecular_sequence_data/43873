We recently reported the zzso cloning of a candidate gene for zzso zzso zzso called zzso which is a novel member of the major zzso complex class I zzso A zzso in this zzso zzso 282 zzso zzso zzso was found to be present in zzso of zzso patient zzso while a second zzso zzso 63 zzso zzso zzso was enriched in patients zzso for zzso The functional relevance of either zzso has not been zzso zzso studies of cell zzso from human embryonic kidney cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso binds zzso and that the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso completely abrogates this zzso zzso labeling and zzso zzso demonstrate that while the zzso and zzso zzso proteins are expressed on the cell surface, the zzso zzso protein is localized exclusively zzso This report describes the first functional significance of the zzso zzso by suggesting that an zzso in protein trafficking and/or zzso expression of zzso leads to zzso zzso
