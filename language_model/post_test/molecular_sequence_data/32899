The zzso of zzso zzso complex serves as a zzso specific zzso for zzso zzso It shares functional and structural features with zzso zzso zzso Here we report for the first time that the molecular zzso characterization and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso alpha from zzso zzso The full-length zzso comprises of a zzso untranslated region zzso of 167 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso and a large zzso of 630 zzso zzso expressed in all the zzso zzso Another two zzso are found derived from alternative zzso Two copies of rainbow trout zzso alpha zzso zzso were detected in the zzso by Southern zzso zzso Moreover, zzso evidence is also traced from other zzso The deduced zzso alpha of 243 zzso acids contains a 17 zzso signal zzso at zzso and a zzso region at zzso as well as a typical sushi domain included in the zzso zzso zzso tree analysis groups zzso alpha with other zzso zzso but separates it from zzso zzso In addition, a putative sequence was found in the sushi domain which is zzso and versatile among all species and this might relate to zzso zzso
