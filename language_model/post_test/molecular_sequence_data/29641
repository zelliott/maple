zzso zzso zzso attached to zzso core proteins are implicated in cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns, which are thought to be important for regulating zzso function, are generated by sequential reactions during zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which such diversity is generated remains zzso 

A novel zzso designated zzso was isolated from rat zzso by screening for floor plate specific zzso zzso and its zzso show zzso with other zzso and have a distinctive zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the floor plate, zzso zzso and cartilage in rat zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso protein is localized to the zzso apparatus and zzso zzso and is not present in the zzso It also appears to be localized on the cell zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso zzso forms a novel zzso in the zzso zzso It shows zzso with the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso apparatus and on the cell surface, however, suggests that it may play a role in regulating zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso during zzso or after zzso are presented in the zzso zzso
