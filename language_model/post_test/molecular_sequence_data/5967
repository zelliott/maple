Consensus zzso zzso specific for the zzso and E1 regions were used to amplify zzso zzso zzso The mixture of the viral fragments was then directly zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as sequencing zzso The linking of a consensus zzso zzso amplification with zzso zzso direct sequencing and computer data bank analysis provided precise, more objective viral detection in the simultaneous presence of different zzso zzso The method was successfully adapted for viral typing in clinical zzso which simultaneously contained different zzso zzso zzso
