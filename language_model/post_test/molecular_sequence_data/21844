zzso zzso bone zzso are by far the most commonly treated of all primary benign bone tumors zzso In zzso of cases, these tumors occur in the context of a zzso syndrome called multiple zzso zzso an zzso dominant skeletal disorder characterized by the formation of multiple zzso bone tumors at children's zzso zzso is caused by various zzso in zzso or zzso zzso large zzso deletions zzso zzso are responsible for up to zzso of zzso 

Here we report on the first molecular characterization of ten large zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were initially identified using zzso or FISH analysis and were subsequently characterized using an zzso zzso path zzso zzso zzso and sequencing zzso 

Within the set of ten large zzso the deleted regions ranged from zzso to 260 zzso One zzso zzso 8 deletion was found to be zzso All zzso were located outside the coding zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso replication dependent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were hypothesized as the zzso mechanisms in different zzso 

zzso characterization of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso indicates that zzso between zzso as well as zzso are zzso and that the majority of these deletions are zzso These observations emphasize once more the huge genetic zzso which is characteristic for zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing large zzso deletions in zzso and zzso
