The zzso modification of proteins and their regulation by zzso represent zzso mechanisms in zzso At the zzso of these two zzso we report that the primary zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso with select zzso zzso in proteins to form zzso zzso This reaction, which does not require zzso zzso but rather exploits the zzso of zzso was found by zzso profiling to be enriched on diverse classes of proteins and prominently in or around the active sites of zzso zzso zzso modifications inhibit zzso zzso and, in cells exposed to high zzso accumulate on these zzso to create a potential feedback mechanism that contributes to the buildup and zzso of zzso zzso to alternate zzso zzso
