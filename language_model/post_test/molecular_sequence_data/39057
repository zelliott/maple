A virus that could not be identified as a previously known zzso virus was isolated from the zzso cells of a zzso zzso zzso revealed enveloped zzso with zzso structures characteristic of viruses in the zzso zzso The virus failed to zzso chicken or guinea pig red blood cells and lacked zzso zzso Two viral genes were isolated from a zzso expression zzso Multiple sequence alignments of one gene indicated an average identity of zzso as compared to zzso N protein zzso A weaker relationship was found with zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso N zzso In the second zzso multiple open reading frames zzso were identified, corresponding to the arrangement of the zzso zzso and C zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Short stretches in the zzso regions of the P and C proteins showed limited zzso to viruses in the zzso zzso but no obvious relationship to viruses in other zzso The V zzso translation product contained a highly zzso zzso domain that is common to most viruses in the zzso zzso zzso of P gene zzso clones confirmed the use of a zzso editing mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso Based on the location of its origin it has been named zzso virus zzso
