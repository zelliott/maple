The mouse zzso gene was identified by virtue of its coordinate regulation with the mouse zzso zzso Both genes are expressed in the fetal liver, gut, and visceral zzso of the zzso zzso and are zzso shortly after birth in the liver and zzso They are both under the control of two zzso zzso zzso which affects the adult zzso levels of the two zzso and zzso which affects their zzso during liver zzso One crucial difference between the two genes is the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso skeletal and cardiac zzso As a strategy for explaining both the similarities and differences in their modes of zzso the regulatory zzso responsible for the expression of the zzso gene in liver were identified by zzso introducing the gene into a human zzso cell zzso Two regions necessary for high-level expression of the gene could be identified, a zzso domain immediately preceding the start of zzso and an zzso domain which lies between 5 and zzso zzso 3' of the zzso zzso The 3' domain consists of two zzso zzso zzso each of which exhibits the properties of zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons between the two zzso and three zzso enhancers revealed limited similarities which are candidates for binding of common regulatory zzso zzso which lie 3' of the gene are also required for the expression of the zzso gene following differentiation of zzso cells into visceral zzso
