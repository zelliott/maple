This report describes initial efforts to map the zzso site of the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso The conclusions are that this site is likely to involve a fairly extended sequence in the zzso of the zzso domain and requires interactions that are not provided by isolated zzso The region of the sequence involving zzso zzso is likely to participate in the zzso site based on several zzso Limited zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso domain zzso 174 and/or zzso nearly abolished the ability of the zzso domain to inhibit binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protected the zzso domain from zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso against the sequence encompassing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked binding of zzso to the zzso zzso However, the sequence zzso the zzso site is not sufficient for high affinity binding of zzso A zzso acid zzso zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso zzso was inactive in zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Further evidence for a complex zzso site is that zzso zzso against two different, zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso both inhibited binding of zzso to the zzso zzso and were only zzso as effective as zzso against the entire zzso zzso Finally, the zzso site of the zzso zzso did not zzso following sodium zzso zzso zzso and transfer to zzso paper even though zzso did recover ability to bind zzso under the same zzso Thus, the zzso site is not defined by a short continuous zzso A simple consensus sequence for zzso regions in other proteins is not zzso
