The cell culture model zzso in this study represents one of the most widely used zzso of zzso in zzso After 14 days, zzso harvested from the zzso rat brain are considered zzso However, it is clear that this represents a somewhat arbitrary zzso In this paper, we provide a zzso definition of such zzso zzso More than 7,000 known genes and 1,000 expressed sequence tag clusters were zzso zzso zzso were defined as sequences consistently expressed in all zzso samples zzso zzso 388 genes were identified as zzso zzso Another 1,440 sequences were detected in a subset of the zzso Genes consistently expressed by zzso included genes known to be involved in the cellular immune response, brain tissue zzso zzso migration as well as zzso The expression profile reported here provides a baseline against which changes of zzso in zzso can be zzso zzso expression profiling of normal zzso will help to provide the presently purely operational definition of zzso zzso with a molecular biological zzso Furthermore, the data reported here add to our understanding of zzso biology and allow projections as to what functions zzso may exert in zzso as well as in zzso
