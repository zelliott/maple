The use of zzso bacteria zzso is a cost-effective route to treat zzso contaminated waters and zzso zzso The isolation and characterization of a zzso strain from an zzso in a Brazilian tropical region site was carried zzso With a moderately zzso pH zzso the zzso strain began its growth and with continued growth, modified the pH zzso The strain under these conditions reduced zzso at the same rate as an experiment performed using an initial pH of zzso The zzso zzso molecular approach was used for the characterization of this strain and its zzso affiliation was similar to zzso zzso zzso The results show an zzso isolate with unexpected zzso reducing capacity in moderately zzso conditions, bringing new possibilities for the treatment of zzso as acid water would be neutralized to a mildly zzso zzso
