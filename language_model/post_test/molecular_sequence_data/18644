Whether G zzso receptors zzso exist in plants is a fundamental biological zzso Interest in zzso new zzso arises because of their importance in zzso Within plants, this is controversial, as zzso analysis has identified 56 putative zzso including G zzso zzso zzso which is reportedly a remote zzso to class A, B, and E zzso Of these, zzso is not a zzso more recently, it has been proposed that none are, not even zzso We have addressed this disparity between zzso analysis and biological evidence through a structural zzso study, involving fold recognition methods, from which only zzso emerges as a strong zzso To further probe zzso we have developed a novel zzso method, which has been zzso against the class zzso zzso F zzso zzso In addition, we have presented a mutually consistent set of alignments of zzso zzso to class A, class B, and class F zzso and shown that zzso is closer to class A and/or class B zzso than class A, class B, or class F zzso are to each zzso To further probe zzso we have aligned zzso zzso 3 of zzso to each of the six zzso zzso zzso comparisons provide additional evidence that zzso zzso have the zzso zzso From the alignments and a zzso comparative model, we have identified motifs that are common to zzso class A, B, and E zzso We discuss the possibilities that emerge from this controversial evidence that zzso has a zzso zzso
