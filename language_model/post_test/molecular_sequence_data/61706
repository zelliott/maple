The zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso tightly to zzso but the molecular biology underpinning this process is not well zzso zzso enrichment procedures were used to isolate zzso of zzso zzso 8 that are defective in zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso strains was reduced 50% compared to that observed with the zzso strain, and cellulose zzso was also shown to be slower in these zzso zzso suggesting that bacterial zzso and cellulose zzso are inextricably zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that all three zzso studied were impaired in the production of two zzso zzso zzso when they were cultured with either zzso or zzso The identities of these proteins were determined by a combination of mass zzso methods and zzso sequence data for zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso is a family 9 zzso zzso zzso and the other is a family 48 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso possess a modular architecture, zzso possesses features characteristic of the zzso (or theme zzso group of family 9 zzso zzso and zzso is structurally similar to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso could be recovered by cellulose affinity procedures, but neither zzso nor zzso contains a zzso suggesting that these zzso are retained on the bacterial cell surface, and recovery by cellulose affinity procedures did not involve a zzso zzso zzso Instead, both proteins possess a single copy of a novel X module with an unknown function at the C zzso Such X zzso are also present in several other zzso zzso zzso zzso and are zzso distinct from the zzso zzso and X zzso identified so far in other zzso zzso
