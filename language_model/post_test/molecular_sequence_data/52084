The putative zzso region of human transforming growth zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be contributed by two zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that includes a zzso zzso zzso zzso An approach to the synthesis of zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso linked zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing zzso activity is zzso The synthesis was achieved by the zzso method using the zzso protecting group zzso The single zzso of the zzso was activated as a mixed zzso with zzso to form the zzso zzso bond with zzso or zzso of the zzso on the zzso zzso Prior to this reaction, the zzso zzso protecting group of zzso or zzso was removed by zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso and side chain protecting groups including the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso were zzso zzso by high zzso The zzso zzso with two unprotected zzso was formed in the presence of an zzso zzso This zzso zzso bond formation was usually not feasible under the zzso scheme at basic pH since zzso interchange would occur faster than zzso zzso To prevent the zzso zzso a new method was zzso The zzso zzso bond zzso was zzso by zzso at an zzso zzso at which the zzso interchange reaction was zzso The desired product was obtained with a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
