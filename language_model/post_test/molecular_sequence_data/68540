The cell zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a loss of focal zzso plaques from spread zzso cells and zzso To zzso the site on zzso that has focal zzso activity, we initially tested zzso fragments of zzso for zzso The zzso zzso has significant focal zzso activity, whereas the zzso zzso zzso had no significant zzso These results were consistent with previous data that showed that both a zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso neutralized zzso zzso zzso from putative zzso binding sequences of the zzso zzso domain of zzso were zzso and tested for their ability to cause loss of focal zzso The zzso I zzso zzso acids zzso caused zzso loss of focal zzso and was active at zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso III zzso were zzso The activity of the zzso I zzso was neutralized by the addition of zzso and zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso The basic zzso acids in the zzso I sequence appear to be required for focal zzso activity, because modification of the zzso zzso at zzso acids 24 and 32 rendered the zzso completely zzso In addition, a zzso from the analogous sequence of mouse zzso 2, in which basic zzso are zzso was nearly as active as zzso I from zzso These data show that the zzso activity of zzso is zzso in both zzso and zzso and that the active site is located in a zzso acid sequence in the zzso domain of zzso
