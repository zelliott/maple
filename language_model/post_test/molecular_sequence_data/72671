zzso of zzso is thought to be a three-step process consisting of an initial zzso zzso of the zzso precursor to big zzso zzso trimming by a zzso and further processing of the big zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso To further clarify the mechanism of processing in the zzso of zzso we introduced a point zzso into zzso zzso to replace the zzso in the zzso position of the recognition motifs of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso or zzso by zzso When zzso zzso were expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, they failed to be processed at the zzso processing zzso suggesting that the zzso motifs of zzso are recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso at zzso is not essential for zzso by zzso but that zzso at zzso is zzso Although a zzso form of zzso is produced by processing by zzso without zzso at zzso it did not evoke zzso transient in zzso zzso In conclusion, prior zzso at zzso by zzso zzso is absolutely necessary for zzso by zzso at zzso to produce mature zzso
