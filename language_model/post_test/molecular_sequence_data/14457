Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from bamboo zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso produced zzso aerial zzso and a yellow soluble zzso on zzso zzso zzso observation revealed that strains zzso and zzso produced zzso spore chains with zzso zzso Both zzso had zzso activity against zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the major fatty acids and zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences of strains zzso and zzso showed that they grouped within zzso cluster II and had highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (both zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso and zzso data, strains zzso and zzso could be distinguished from the type strains of zzso related zzso They are therefore considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a reference strain zzso
