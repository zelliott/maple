Human zzso zzso have been zzso into three species zzso but the recently discovered zzso strains are not fully characterized zzso This study aimed to undertake a molecular and zzso characterization of zzso strains infecting children hospitalized over one year in two large research hospitals in zzso zzso zzso from single zzso infections were zzso subjected to zzso analysis on two zzso zzso the central part of the zzso Region zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 4 gene with the zzso portion of the zzso gene zzso zzso different strains were identified in 73 zzso children: zzso of the cases were zzso zzso zzso and only zzso zzso zzso cases were less frequent than zzso during summer months and more frequent in cases presenting zzso with respect to zzso Species distribution was similar with respect to patient age, and zzso differed during summer months with fewer zzso than zzso zzso On admission, a significantly higher number of zzso cases presented with zzso with respect to zzso The zzso and zzso zzso in zzso was higher than in zzso in particular, zzso patient zzso sequences were highly divergent zzso at the zzso level from those of their reference zzso but zzso zzso acid sequence was highly zzso In zzso zzso the region preceding the zzso zzso the zzso acids involved in zzso zzso the zzso zzso site and the zzso replication element were highly zzso zzso zzso zzso acid conservation was significantly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso especially in the zzso exposed zzso This study confirmed the high number of different zzso zzso infecting hospitalized children over one year and reveals a greater than expected zzso in zzso zzso zzso potentially suggestive of differences in zzso
