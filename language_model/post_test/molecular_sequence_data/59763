zzso hairpin zzso containing a zzso consensus sequence are the most frequently occurring zzso in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso play important functional roles in zzso zzso in zzso zzso interactions and as protein binding zzso Homo and zzso zzso zzso have been used to determine the structures of the most abundant members of the zzso zzso family: the zzso zzso and zzso zzso closed by a zzso base zzso Analysis of the structures of these three hairpin zzso reveals a network of zzso hydrogen zzso The zzso contain a zzso base pair, a G zzso hydrogen bond and several 2' zzso hydrogen zzso These zzso interactions and the extensive base stacking in the loop help explain the high zzso stability and give insight into the diverse biological roles of the zzso zzso zzso
