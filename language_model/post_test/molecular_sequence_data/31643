zzso syndrome zzso is a clinically zzso disorder zzso by distinctive zzso features in addition to zzso and cardiac zzso It has been described in different populations and is presumed to follow zzso zzso zzso In an effort to identify the underlying genetic cause of zzso affected individuals from a First Nations zzso community in northern zzso Canada, were enrolled in this zzso 

zzso mapping by zzso array and zzso sequencing of the candidate genes in a zzso zzso on zzso zzso were performed on zzso DNA from eight zzso zzso patients, eight of their parents and five unaffected individuals zzso subjects) from this geographic zzso 

All eight patients were zzso for a novel zzso site zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed an approximate zzso reduction in the relative amount of a zzso transcript lacking zzso zzso A zzso reduction in the amount of zzso protein was observed on western zzso 

We have identified a zzso in zzso as the cause of the form of zzso zzso in our zzso The ubiquitous expression and highly zzso nature of zzso the product of zzso is consistent with the complex and zzso nature of this zzso
