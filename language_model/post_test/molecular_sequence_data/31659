DNA zzso join 3' zzso and zzso zzso ends in double stranded DNA and are necessary for maintaining the integrity of zzso The gene zzso a new zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was cloned and zzso The gene contains an open reading frame with zzso base pairs, zzso 475 zzso acid zzso zzso of the entire zzso acid sequence showed that zzso DNA zzso has a high degree of sequence zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso gene was expressed under the control of the zzso promoter on the zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso was then zzso zzso by a metal affinity zzso zzso activity of the zzso DNA zzso was zzso by an in-house zzso zzso
