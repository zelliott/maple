The zzso sequences of three zzso zzso and of some species close to zzso zzso have become available, leading to new relationship zzso Moreover, the automatic zzso zzso of the zzso bacteria zzso zzso has been manually corrected by a consortium of experts, leading to zzso modifications of start sites predictions among the 3198 open reading frames zzso zzso This new zzso coupled with the results of automatic zzso tools of the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso (including zzso to 9 zzso close to zzso provides numerous data sets related to predicted functions, zzso properties and zzso zzso To made these results available, zzso a functional zzso database of the corrected sequence zzso of zzso zzso has been built, using the zzso zzso approach and a zzso database zzso A friendly zzso user interface has been zzso and users can carry out different kinds of information by three levels of zzso zzso the basic search use the classical zzso or sequence zzso zzso the original advanced search engine allows to combine (by using logical operators) numerous criteria: zzso zzso zzso zzso related to the zzso function, family zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso characteristics zzso zzso such as zzso point or molecular weight and structural criteria such as the zzso length or the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity scores with zzso coli and 10 species zzso close to zzso zzso zzso complex queries can be performed by using a zzso field, which allows all queries respecting the zzso zzso The database is publicly available through a Web server at the following zzso zzso
