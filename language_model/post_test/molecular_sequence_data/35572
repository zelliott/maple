zzso how climate warming has an impact on the life cycle schedule of zzso organisms is critical to evaluate zzso vulnerability to environmental zzso Despite recent advances identifying the molecular basis of temperature responses, few studies have incorporated this knowledge into zzso zzso Here we develop a method to forecast flowering zzso by zzso regulatory dynamics of key zzso genes in perennial life zzso The model, zzso by controlled laboratory experiments, accurately reproduces the seasonal changes in gene zzso the corresponding timing of floral initiation and return to zzso growth after a period of flowering in complex natural zzso A striking scenario forecast by the model under climate warming is that the shift in the return time to zzso growth is greater than that in floral zzso which results in a significant reduction of the flowering zzso Our study demonstrates the usefulness of gene expression assessment to predict unexplored risks of climate zzso
