Studies were conducted to determine whether the zzso protein zzso can bind to and activate promoter elements in both the zzso and zzso genes that are necessary for zzso zzso Four zzso cell lines that zzso express the zzso zzso and zzso genes were examined for their ability to activate zzso and zzso promoter zzso containing sequences necessary for zzso expression zzso zzso containing one zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similarly expressed in each of the four cell zzso Of the plasmids containing two zzso zzso zzso was always activated to a greater extent than zzso zzso with this relative zzso being stronger in zzso and zzso cells than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were used to show that the zzso and zzso zzso specifically bound two highly abundant nuclear proteins zzso and 33 zzso The two proteins were present at similar levels in all four zzso cell lines and were recognized by a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso cells did not activate zzso zzso or zzso plasmids and did not contain nuclear proteins that specifically bound to the zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso of these cells with the expression zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso also contained zzso and zzso nuclear proteins that bound to the zzso and zzso zzso These results show that zzso is present at levels in zzso cell lines that are sufficient to activate the minimal elements in both the zzso and zzso promoters necessary for zzso expression of these zzso
