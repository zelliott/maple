zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso across the bacterial outer membrane is accomplished by the zzso function contained within the zzso zzso beta domain of zzso zzso precursor zzso Recently, we reported that zzso beta from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso fused to a zzso passenger zzso facilitated its transport across the outer zzso leading to surface exposure of the zzso In the present work we show, by systematic zzso zzso of zzso zzso that the functional and structural unit, termed zzso zzso zzso to the zzso approximately zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso This minimal region retains all the essential features necessary for the zzso of an zzso attached passenger across the outer membrane of zzso coli, and for its own correct integration into the outer zzso even in the absence of a passenger zzso The zzso zzso zzso constitutes a zzso entity found in the zzso regions of zzso beta zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso N zzso of the zzso beta zzso vary in size and zzso Based on secondary structure predictions, the key structural feature of the core is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by hairpin turns and zzso which is common to many integral outer membrane proteins of zzso zzso We propose that the core has been zzso in evolution, to provide a selective outer membrane export channel for zzso attached zzso
