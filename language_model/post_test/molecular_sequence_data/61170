In humans, zzso in zzso result in a skeletal zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso The present study investigated two major classes of CD zzso 1) point zzso in the high mobility group zzso domain and 2) zzso and zzso that alter the C zzso of the zzso We analyzed the effect of one novel zzso and three other point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso on the DNA binding and DNA zzso properties of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain shows negligible DNA zzso the zzso zzso shows minimal DNA zzso whereas the zzso zzso shows near wild type DNA binding and zzso DNA zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso has altered DNA binding zzso but also zzso DNA zzso The effects of the point zzso were interpreted using a molecular model of the zzso zzso zzso We analyzed the effects upon zzso of zzso resembling the zzso and zzso zzso in CD patients, and found that progressive deletion of the C zzso causes progressive loss of zzso zzso zzso by zzso requires both the zzso domain rich in zzso zzso and zzso and the adjacent domain composed entirely of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, CD arises by zzso that interfere with DNA binding by zzso or zzso the zzso zzso domain and thereby impede the ability of zzso to activate target genes during organ zzso
