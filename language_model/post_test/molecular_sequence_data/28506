zzso zzso zzso zzso currently lack optimal reference quality-control material for cellular protein zzso To address this problem, we identified peptides that mimic the site on the native zzso to which the primary zzso zzso binds and used them as surrogate zzso zzso 

We identified zzso candidates from a zzso zzso zzso library that mimic the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso clones were zzso Several zzso peptides were then zzso and analyzed for affinity and zzso 

We identified zzso clones that specifically bound to the zzso zzso zzso The binding was specific, in that the zzso clones did not bind to two other zzso zzso Their ability to bind the zzso zzso zzso was related to the presence of a consensus zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was not recognized by any of 15 other zzso commonly used for clinical zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso was able to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso zzso to native zzso indicating that the zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso at or close to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso controls behave like the native zzso in terms of affinity and zzso This technology may be especially useful when the native zzso is in short zzso
