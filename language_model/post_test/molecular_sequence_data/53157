zzso are zzso zzso transport motor proteins that move cellular cargo on zzso zzso It has been shown that the sea zzso zzso zzso associates with a zzso zzso zzso forming a zzso complex in zzso called the zzso Here we describe isolation of a zzso clone corresponding to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our sequence analysis of the zzso zzso shows that it shares high zzso with the zzso zzso We also describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares extensive zzso with the sea zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso structural analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso presented here suggests that these may form a zzso zzso We also describe the presence of a zzso zzso consensus motif in zzso first found in zzso that suggests a possible role for the zzso in signal zzso
