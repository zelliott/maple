An in zzso selection system was devised to select zzso based on their zzso structural stability, independent of zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted on the zzso domain from the zzso zzso group I zzso an autonomous zzso unit that contains several important zzso folding motifs including the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules were selected based on their ability to fold into compact structures using native gel zzso in the presence of decreasing zzso of zzso After 10 rounds of the selection process, a number of sequence zzso were identified that stabilized the zzso zzso One of these, a single base deletion of zzso within the zzso zzso significantly stabilized the zzso zzso and would not have been identified by an zzso selection because of its essential role for zzso zzso Additionally, the sequence analysis provided evidence that stabilization of secondary structure may contribute to overall zzso stability for zzso This system for probing zzso structure irrespective of zzso activity allows analysis of zzso zzso relationships by identifying zzso or motifs important for folding and then comparing them with zzso sequences required for zzso
