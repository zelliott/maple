The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso In the overall reaction, the zzso component zzso introduces a zzso group into the zzso ring of zzso using molecular oxygen and reduced zzso while the zzso component zzso provides free reduced zzso for zzso The crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso form, the zzso form, and the zzso complex with zzso and zzso were zzso In the zzso form, two large grooves are present at the zzso zzso and are occupied by water zzso A structural analysis of zzso containing zzso revealed that zzso has a low occupancy, indicating that it is not tightly bound to zzso This was further confirmed in zzso zzso experiments, showing that zzso can be released from zzso The structure of the zzso complex revealed that zzso and zzso are bound in the groove in the extended and folded zzso zzso The zzso ring of zzso is sandwiched between the zzso ring of zzso and the zzso ring of zzso The distance between zzso of the zzso ring and C4 of the zzso ring is about zzso A, sufficient to permit hydride zzso The structures of these three states are essentially zzso however, the side chains of several zzso show small zzso changes, indicating an induced fit upon binding of zzso zzso with respect to zzso can be explained as instability of the binding of zzso with the zzso charged zzso group buried inside the complex, as well as a possible repulsive effect by the zzso of zzso zzso A comparison of the binding mode of zzso with that in zzso from zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso as a prosthetic group, reveals remarkable zzso differences in a less zzso loop region zzso involved in the binding of the zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that variations in the affinities for zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family may be attributed to difference in the interaction between the zzso zzso of zzso and the less zzso loop region which possibly shows structural zzso
