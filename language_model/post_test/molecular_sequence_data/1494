zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of cocaine to form the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso Here, we report zzso and structural studies that characterize the zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The binding pocket is fairly shallow and mainly zzso but with a cluster of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the transition state analogue zzso indicates that these zzso are appropriately positioned to coordinate the zzso zzso of the zzso and, zzso form an zzso zzso zzso modification of the zzso with zzso reduced zzso activity to background zzso The contribution from these and other zzso to zzso and zzso binding was explored by zzso zzso of zzso expressed in a single chain zzso variable zzso zzso The zzso zzso had zzso reduced activity, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso revealed a similar arrangement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso hole that zzso the transition state for zzso zzso Furthermore, the crystal structure of the bacterial cocaine zzso zzso also showed that the zzso employs a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and structural data are consistent with the zzso zzso providing zzso stabilization as its major contribution to zzso
