zzso factors of the zzso protein family are important regulators of zzso processes such as zzso and zzso development in zzso Recently a zzso zzso named zzso zzso was identified as a master regulator of zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso is a zzso relative of zzso which is likely to be involved in growth of blood vessels by the induction of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in response to zzso In the present study we describe zzso cloning and zzso expression pattern of mouse zzso factor zzso a novel close relative of zzso alpha which is expressed most prominently in brain zzso zzso cells and other blood vessels as well as in zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso In addition, smooth muscle cells of the zzso zzso brown zzso tissue and various zzso zzso express zzso zzso as zzso High expression levels of zzso zzso in embryonic zzso zzso and kidney zzso places where zzso is highly zzso suggest a role of this factor in zzso gene zzso similar to that of zzso zzso Given the similarity between zzso of the zzso system and the zzso vascular system, the expression pattern of zzso in the zzso and the zzso tree raises the possibility that this family of zzso factors may be involved in zzso
