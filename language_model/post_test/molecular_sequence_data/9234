Human zzso displays a unique zzso role as a zzso of zzso and gene zzso However, the zzso or regions of zzso that participate in those functions have not been zzso Here we have performed zzso analyses of zzso guided by identification of zzso regions in the zzso gene family by zzso zzso We show that zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso harbor only one zzso zzso and in the common zzso of zzso zzso may have arisen by gene zzso In keeping with these data, we show that human zzso regulates zzso and that different zzso and zzso proteins display zzso zzso The use of molecular evolutionary information has been instrumental to determine the regions that participate in zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins share two highly zzso regions zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso region 2, zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in region 1 of zzso zzso are part of a nuclear export zzso zzso reduces zzso activity, and blocks nuclear exit and zzso activity under zzso zzso We also identify a functional and zzso zzso motif zzso in region 1 of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in region 2 of zzso reduces zzso activity, zzso nuclear exit in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our data reveal zzso and zzso as dual regulators of zzso and zzso and identify two zzso regions in the zzso family that concentrate multiple functions crucial for zzso and zzso
