Four members of the zzso zzso family of cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified as receptors for zzso disease virus zzso in zzso and zzso are believed to be the receptors used to target zzso cells in the infected zzso To zzso roles of the zzso zzso from a susceptible species as viral zzso we have cloned sheep zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and compared them to those of other zzso The coding sequences for sheep zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and 787 zzso zzso zzso The sheep zzso zzso and zzso zzso share many structural features including zzso binding domain and zzso region with zzso of other zzso zzso trees and similarity analyses showed the close relationship of zzso genes among zzso zzso cattle and zzso camels that are susceptible to zzso infection, which were distinct from the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that host zzso of zzso may be related to divergence in zzso zzso among different zzso
