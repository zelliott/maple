The product of the zzso zzso gene has been localized in the inner zzso envelope membrane zzso et zzso 1993) and found to display sequence zzso with the zzso zzso product which is altered in zzso defective in CO2 transport and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso located between the zzso and zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein of 500 zzso which is considerably larger than its higher plant zzso because of a long zzso that separates the zzso N and C zzso Using zzso zzso we have disrupted zzso with the zzso zzso expression cassette and examined the zzso of the zzso zzso These were found to grow both zzso and zzso under low light, thereby revealing that the zzso product is not essential for the zzso zzso However, under high light these zzso did not grow zzso and barely zzso The increased light sensitivity of the zzso appears to result from a limitation in zzso energy zzso and/or dissipation which zzso with a greatly diminished zzso response to zzso zzso + zzso especially under conditions where the zzso zzso carbon transport system is not zzso Mass zzso zzso with either whole cells or isolated zzso from the zzso revealed that the CO2 and zzso zzso systems have a reduced affinity for their zzso The results suggest the existence of a zzso system within the zzso envelope which promotes efficient zzso carbon zzso zzso into zzso
