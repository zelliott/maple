zzso protein zero zzso is a member of the zzso gene zzso with single zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso of zzso adhere adjacent zzso wraps to each zzso zzso is also necessary for zzso zzso since mice which lack zzso develop severe zzso zzso in which zzso is dramatically zzso zzso zzso in humans cause the inherited zzso zzso zzso Some zzso cause the severe zzso of infancy designated as zzso disease, while others cause a zzso zzso zzso disease Type zzso zzso zzso with normal early milestones but development of disability during the first two decades of zzso Still other zzso cause a zzso that presents in adults, with normal nerve zzso zzso designated as a zzso form of zzso To correlate the zzso of patients with zzso zzso with their zzso we identified and evaluated 13 patients from 12 different families with eight different zzso zzso In addition, we zzso the clinical data from 64 cases of zzso from the zzso zzso to our expectations, we found that most patients presented with either an early onset zzso with signs and symptoms prior to the onset of walking or a late onset zzso with signs and symptoms at around age 40 zzso Only occasional patients presented with a zzso CMT zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso with their zzso demonstrated that addition of either a charged zzso acid or altering a zzso zzso in the zzso domain caused a severe early onset zzso Severe zzso was also caused by zzso of the zzso domain or zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that early onset zzso is caused by zzso zzso that significantly disrupt the zzso structure of zzso and thus interfere with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, late onset zzso is caused by zzso that more subtly alter zzso structure and which probably disrupt zzso zzso zzso
