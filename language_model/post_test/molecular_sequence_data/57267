The synthesis of 11 zzso ranging in composition from 9 to 17 zzso acid zzso by zzso methodology was accomplished with the purpose of studying how the zzso and zzso character, the size of the zzso and the charge distribution zzso the zzso zzso It was found that peptides composed of 16 and 17 zzso acid zzso with high zzso zzso due to zzso or zzso and zzso zzso to zzso character distributed along opposite zzso faces, showed considerable zzso activity against clinically isolated bacteria together with Gram positive and Gram negative zzso bacterial zzso However, the zzso capacity of the peptides was also zzso zzso the zzso character of the zzso by replacing zzso or zzso with zzso zzso while maintaining the basic contribution of zzso drastically reduced the zzso activity and only slightly decreased the zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso acid zzso with high zzso and basic nature possess zzso activity but, in general, are less active than the larger counterpart zzso By replacing all zzso zzso of a short zzso by zzso zzso the activity was considerably zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso showed that shorter peptides with very low zzso content, and thus deprived of zzso character, still have appreciable zzso This zzso coupled with the fact that due to their small size they cannot span the bacterial outer zzso zzso may suggest different mechanisms of action for zzso zzso zzso zzso
