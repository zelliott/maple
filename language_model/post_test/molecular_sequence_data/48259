zzso enteric zzso zzso is associated with zzso in zzso and to date it is the only zzso enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence analysis of zzso clones and reverse zzso products, zzso zzso has an zzso zzso of zzso zzso excluding its 3' zzso zzso The zzso is organized in two open reading frames zzso similar to the organizations of the human zzso viruses zzso and the zzso zzso encodes the zzso that is fused to and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end encodes a small basic protein of zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso has the highest zzso acid sequence identities in the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions with the zzso indicating that zzso is genetically most closely related to the zzso The complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso comparisons revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso sequence identities in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso has one silent zzso in its zzso two zzso acid changes and a silent zzso in its zzso zzso and five zzso zzso in its zzso that result in one distant and three clustered zzso acid changes and a silent zzso These zzso may be associated with adaptation of zzso zzso to cell zzso The zzso zzso should be a useful model for studies of the zzso zzso and possible rescue of zzso human enteric zzso
