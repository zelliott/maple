Genes zzso zzso and zzso of wheat germ zzso zzso 2 zzso were chemically zzso and expressed in the zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso harboring either a zzso or a zzso gene expression zzso zzso a mature form of zzso into the culture zzso The amount of zzso zzso by the strain zzso which has a zzso zzso causing a zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso greater than that zzso by the zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso from the cells containing the zzso gene expression zzso was zzso to zzso by a three-step zzso zzso zzso As in zzso the zzso signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso culture was processed to form an zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, we found that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso had also been processed in zzso Using zzso zzso mass zzso we found the processed zzso to be zzso in both zzso zzso zzso from zzso and in authentic zzso The major component of the zzso zzso contained two additional zzso acids at its zzso compared to that of authentic zzso In spite of this difference in the zzso the zzso zzso exhibited a sugar binding activity that was indistinguishable from that of authentic zzso
