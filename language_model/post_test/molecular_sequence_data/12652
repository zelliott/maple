A study of the molecular zzso of the horn fly, zzso zzso zzso zzso has resulted in the isolation and sequencing of a zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame was found, the deduced zzso zzso acid sequence of which encodes a protein with zzso identity to zzso a member of a zzso family of zzso it contains an zzso or zzso zzso zzso Northern and Southern zzso analyses do not reveal significant differences in the expression of the gene zzso to zzso when comparing zzso horn flies that are susceptible or resistant to zzso zzso
