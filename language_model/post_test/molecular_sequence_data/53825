zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso are zzso proteins stored in and released from hormone zzso in zzso and neuroendocrine zzso The zzso are zzso to serve as zzso to generate biologically active zzso which may influence hormonal release and vascular functions or have zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso regions show some species zzso acid zzso the zzso as a whole display considerable zzso differences, which prevents their use in comparative studies of biological zzso We present four new zzso for the measurement of defined zzso regions of zzso and zzso A new zzso for measurement of intact bovine zzso has also been zzso With these zzso and two previously published ones, we have compared the zzso of zzso from man, zzso zzso zzso pig and horse and compared zzso content and serum levels of zzso from these zzso We have also studied the influence of zzso zzso and the zzso strength of the mobile phase on molecular weight zzso zzso with zzso directed against the zzso parts of zzso and zzso showed sufficient zzso zzso to allow comparative zzso of the circulating levels in man, zzso zzso zzso pig and zzso zzso measuring the intact human or bovine zzso were not suitable for comparative purposes in samples from zzso zzso pig and zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso material and intact bovine zzso were demonstrated in gel zzso studies, suggesting that conclusions about the degree of zzso processing from zzso profiles should be made with zzso Reliable zzso comparison of zzso is difficult, but zzso with zzso zzso may be helpful to study zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
