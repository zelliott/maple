zzso zzso III zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso for zzso zzso In this paper we report the results of cloning a zzso segment of zzso DNA which includes the region zzso the zzso end of the zzso dogfish zzso III zzso A total of zzso base pairs of sequence zzso the start zzso was zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that the zzso start site is the G located 114 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso zzso The first zzso has 240 base pairs, including the zzso untranslated region, the coding sequence for the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and the four zzso zzso acids of the mature zzso The boundary of the first zzso and the first zzso of the zzso III gene is zzso with that of rat and zzso zzso zzso zzso I, which have been suggested to have evolved from zzso zzso The putative zzso box zzso zzso is located at position zzso with an uncommonly found C at the third zzso Two zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso were identified in the promoter region, which suggests that zzso dogfish zzso III might be subjected to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso as has been reported for rat zzso zzso The preparation and binding of a zzso zzso protein (the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the two zzso dogfish zzso binding sequences are zzso Two putative zzso binding elements were also identified in the promoter zzso
