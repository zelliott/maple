zzso repetitive zzso consensus zzso sequence zzso was studied in zzso zzso strains isolated before and after the zzso epidemic in Brazil (in 1991), along with epidemic strains from Peru, Mexico, and India, by zzso A total of 17 fingerprint patterns zzso were detected in the zzso zzso strains zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and zzso of the zzso zzso strains were found to belong to the same zzso group zzso four fragments zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso also yielded four fragments but constituted a different zzso group zzso A total of 15 different patterns were observed among the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patterns were observed most frequently for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which have zzso with five fragments, and zzso of which have zzso with two zzso Three fragments, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be common to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains as well as to group zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso Two fragments of group zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was common to all strains and zzso of zzso zzso zzso It is concluded from the results of this study, based on DNA zzso of environmental zzso that it is possible to detect an emerging virulent strain in a zzso zzso zzso constitutes a powerful tool for determination of the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso strains isolated in surveillance programs and for molecular zzso zzso
