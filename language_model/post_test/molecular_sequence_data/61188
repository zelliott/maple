zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in cellular transformation and is associated with a variety of human zzso Multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification and zzso zzso and zzso controls contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso One of the components of these regulatory mechanisms is a short upstream open reading frame zzso in the zzso zzso that zzso downstream translation in a variety of cell zzso Here we explore the mechanism by which this zzso exerts its zzso zzso As judged by comparisons of protein and zzso abundance and by zzso distribution zzso the zzso zzso translation of the zzso zzso or of a zzso reporter zzso Despite its conservation among zzso species, the zzso sequence of the zzso is not required for this zzso zzso Rather, the majority of zzso that load on the zzso zzso most likely translate the zzso and are then unable to zzso at the downstream zzso zzso in part due to the short zzso zzso A minority of zzso gain access to the zzso initiation zzso either by leaky scanning past the upstream zzso zzso or by zzso after having translated the zzso despite the short zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso controls synthesis of this zzso by limiting zzso access to downstream initiation zzso
