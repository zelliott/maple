zzso sequences of heavy zzso and light zzso chain variable region zzso determining regions have been determined from in zzso amplified zzso isolated from a panel of zzso zzso zzso raised to a synthetic zzso zzso representing the zzso portion of human zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso reported to contain an zzso zzso These zzso vary in affinity for the synthetic zzso and native zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All 10 zzso studied were found were found to zzso restricted zzso V zzso 2, zzso and J zzso 1 family zzso zzso differences in the length and sequence of D elements were zzso however zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso two broad ranges of affinity could be determined based on the presence of zzso or Ala at zzso 101 in zzso
