zzso zzso which generate zzso breaks in DNA, must be carefully regulated to ensure that chemically active DNA complexes are assembled zzso In the zzso zzso DNA inversion reaction, two zzso oriented zzso sites on the same DNA zzso assemble into a synaptic complex that uniquely generates inversion zzso The zzso zzso zzso together with zzso constraints directed by DNA zzso functions to regulate zzso synaptic complex formation and zzso We have isolated a collection of zzso zzso in 22 positions within the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso using two genetic screens and by zzso zzso One genetic screen measured zzso in the absence of zzso and the other assessed zzso induction as a zzso of increased DNA zzso These zzso together with molecular zzso identify important sites of dynamic zzso and zzso interactions that regulate assembly of the active zzso zzso zzso Of particular interest are interactions between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the same zzso that function to hold the zzso in an inactive state in the absence of the zzso zzso Among these is a relay involving a zzso of zzso that are proposed to switch positions during the transition from zzso to the zzso active zzso Novel zzso zzso that generate synaptic complexes that are blocked at steps prior to DNA zzso are also zzso
