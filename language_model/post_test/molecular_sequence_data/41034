The dimensions of unfolded and zzso zzso proteins are highly dependent on their zzso acid composition and solution conditions, especially salt and zzso zzso However, the quantitative implications of this behavior have remained zzso largely because the effective zzso the central reference point for the underlying zzso collapse transition, has eluded experimental zzso Here, we used zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso to determine the zzso points for six different zzso While the zzso zzso of all proteins zzso to zzso at high zzso zzso as expected for a zzso in good zzso the zzso regime in water strongly depends on sequence zzso The resulting average zzso zzso of zzso for the four zzso protein sequences in our study suggests that the zzso cellular milieu is close to effective zzso conditions for unfolded zzso In contrast, two zzso zzso proteins do not reach the zzso under any of our zzso conditions, which may reflect the zzso of their expanded state for the interactions with cellular zzso zzso analyses based on our results imply that zzso sequences with more compact unfolded states are a more recent result of protein zzso
