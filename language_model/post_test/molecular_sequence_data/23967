Cotton fibers are zzso hairs that zzso to several zzso long from the seed coat zzso of the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, cotton fiber is a unique system to study the mechanisms of rapid cell zzso Previous work has shown a transient closure of zzso during fiber zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plant Cell zzso zzso To examine the importance of this closure in fiber zzso we compared the duration of the zzso closure among different cotton zzso differing in fiber zzso zzso imaging of the zzso fluorescent zzso zzso revealed a zzso difference in the duration of the zzso closure that positively zzso with fiber length among three zzso zzso and two zzso zzso In all cases, the closure occurred at the rapid phase of zzso zzso blue zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso deposition and degradation at the fiber base zzso with the timing of zzso closure and zzso zzso Northern analyses showed that the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso when zzso was deposited at the fiber base but became evident at the time of zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso expression was high in the short fiber zzso and weak in the intermediate and long fiber zzso The data provide zzso and zzso evidence that zzso zzso closure appears to play an important role in zzso cotton zzso zzso zzso deposition and degradation may be involved in the zzso closure and zzso respectively, and zzso the expression of zzso could play a role in this process by degrading zzso thus opening the zzso
