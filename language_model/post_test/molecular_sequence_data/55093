zzso zzso of sex zzso is thought to be zzso in organisms with zzso sex determination zzso zzso zzso zzso due to extensive divergence and zzso zzso between the two zzso However, proper segregation of sex zzso during zzso requires zzso occurring within the zzso regions zzso Recent studies reveal that zzso in the form of gene conversion, is widely distributed within and may have played important roles in the evolution of some zzso regions within which zzso was thought to be zzso such as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a major human zzso zzso has an unusually large zzso locus zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the two opposite zzso show extensive zzso sequence divergence and zzso zzso mirroring characteristics of sex zzso zzso zzso was assumed to be zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso A previous study identified zzso hot spots zzso the zzso zzso zzso and these hot spots are associated with high zzso zzso Here, we investigated a zzso zzso region located within the zzso locus of zzso zzso to establish if this region also exhibits unique zzso behavior during zzso zzso zzso analysis of natural zzso zzso zzso revealed signals of homogenization spanning this zzso zzso region within different zzso zzso zzso consistent with a model in which gene conversion of this region during zzso prevents it from diversifying within each zzso By analyzing zzso progeny from laboratory zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs around the zzso zzso region at a frequency equal to or greater than the zzso zzso frequency observed in other zzso zzso We discuss the implications of these findings with regards to the possible functional and evolutionary importance of gene conversion within the zzso zzso zzso locus and, more generally, in zzso
