zzso is a zzso complex essential for maintenance of zzso DNA at linear zzso zzso The zzso core of zzso zzso comprises a zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and the essential La family protein zzso zzso and crystal structures of zzso zzso domain and its complex with stem IV of zzso reveal that zzso recognition is achieved by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso bend in zzso The domain is a zzso zzso zzso recognition motif with a zzso zzso extension that forms an zzso zzso in the complex necessary for zzso assembly of zzso with zzso This work provides the first structural insight into zzso and assembly of zzso with a zzso zzso Additionally, our studies define a structurally zzso domain zzso in genuine La and zzso proteins and suggest a general mode of zzso binding for zzso of their diverse zzso zzso
