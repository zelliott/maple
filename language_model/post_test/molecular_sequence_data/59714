This study investigated whether zzso affected the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso copper and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso type II zzso zzso cells and lung zzso zzso were exposed in zzso to air zzso or to zzso oxygen zzso for 24 zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells decreased significantly after 1 day in hypoxic zzso The decrease in zzso zzso zzso was greater than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso protein A transcript expression remained zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression decreased similarly in lung zzso cultured during zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso measured in lung zzso exposed to air or zzso for 24 h decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso h zzso The zzso for the zzso decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso h zzso Neither zzso nor zzso protein expression in zzso cells changed significantly during zzso zzso decreases expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells and lung zzso in part by decreasing stability of the zzso zzso
