zzso is expressed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and has been implicated in the zzso modification of low density zzso during early stages of zzso To establish an animal model of zzso zzso we created transgenic rabbits that express at high level the human zzso in zzso zzso but not in liver, heart, zzso zzso or other zzso The expression level of the zzso in zzso zzso is comparable to that of zzso 4 zzso human zzso but more than zzso higher than in zzso of normal zzso The transgenic zzso zzso zzso acid to zzso 11 zzso acid zzso and zzso acid to a mixture of zzso 8, 10, 14 zzso acid zzso and zzso 8, 11, 14 zzso acid zzso The zzso ratio varied between zzso and zzso indicating a remarkable zzso in the zzso specificity of the transgenic zzso zzso from normal rabbits consistently produced zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso rabbits may be used for further zzso studies on the implication of zzso in zzso they are also an ideal model for testing the in zzso action of zzso zzso
