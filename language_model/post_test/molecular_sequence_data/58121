zzso of human zzso with gamma zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of a zzso protein of unknown nature and zzso We report the identification of this protein through zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso demonstrated that this protein was zzso zzso zzso et zzso Gene zzso 1991, zzso zzso number zzso This result was validated by the sequencing of zzso zzso Identification of the zzso zzso protein was confirmed by zzso with an zzso directed against beef zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using a synthetic zzso zzso probe evidenced a zzso transcript in zzso cells indicating that the gene was regulated at the zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso zzso in zzso the expression of an zzso directly involved in protein zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso in treated cultured zzso might be involved in the zzso activity of gamma zzso
