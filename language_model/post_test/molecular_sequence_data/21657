The orange pigmentation of the fungus zzso zzso is due to the zzso of the zzso zzso and precursor zzso Two key reactions in the synthesis of these zzso the formation of zzso from zzso zzso and the introduction of zzso cycles in zzso zzso products, are zzso by two zzso of a zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso We have determined the sequence of nine zzso zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso content in the corresponding zzso One of the zzso is reddish and it is zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso and the remaining eight zzso are zzso and harbor different zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso are expected to produce truncated zzso A strain lacking most of the zzso domain contained trace amounts of a zzso zzso tentatively identified as the zzso zzso product zzso In support, trace amounts of this compound were also found in a zzso zzso for gene zzso but not in that for gene zzso coding for the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso from two zzso zzso was investigated by zzso expression in an appropriately engineered zzso coli zzso One of the zzso zzso predictably with only zzso of the zzso domain, showed full zzso activity, suggesting functional independence of both zzso However, the second zzso showed no zzso activity, indicating that some zzso in the zzso zzso segment affect the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed a diminished zzso of zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso compared to the wild type strain, suggesting a zzso effect between reduced expression and impaired zzso activities in the generation of their zzso zzso
