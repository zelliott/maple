zzso binds specifically to zzso and is zzso zzso to the zzso alpha chain by activated factor zzso zzso This reaction is important for wound zzso Here we investigate zzso zzso of zzso and some of its fragments to a zzso zzso representing the zzso 30 zzso of the zzso alpha chain zzso zzso zzso zzso Only zzso and those fragments containing an intact zzso were able to form zzso zzso As many as 10 of the 17 zzso in alpha zzso can serve as zzso donors in this zzso Analysis of the rate of zzso zzso of zzso zzso peptides and fragments with alpha zzso revealed that the presence of the first type I zzso module zzso the zzso zzso addition of fingers zzso had no further zzso
