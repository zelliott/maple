zzso is a membrane protein of rat zzso and zzso zzso It has not been described in other cell types, and no zzso acid or DNA sequence data are available about zzso Here we show that zzso zzso are present in rat zzso and zzso In resting zzso the zzso are mainly zzso but become surface exposed after zzso zzso as shown by zzso and flow zzso By Western zzso zzso zzso has an apparent Mr of zzso zzso slides of rat bone zzso show that zzso zzso recognize large zzso cells also expressing zzso indicating that the cells are zzso From a rat zzso zzso library we isolated a clone covering the zzso zzso of rat zzso Its putative zzso or zzso zzso are zzso or zzso zzso respectively, with the human and rabbit zzso zzso The truncated zzso domain extends to include two of the four zzso zzso shared by zzso zzso By Northern zzso a zzso zzso cortical transcript is zzso By in zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso zzso cells, and zzso and by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso are shown to contain zzso zzso Our results show that rat zzso is a zzso of the previously cloned zzso proteins and suggest that also in zzso zzso has a role in zzso as previously shown in the zzso
