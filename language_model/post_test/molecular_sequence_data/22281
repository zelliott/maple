Whole animal studies have indicated that zzso zzso by the gastrointestinal tract is regulated by the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso and established, by using zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso important for zzso zzso and for zzso the zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso to the membrane fraction of isolated sea zzso zzso revealed the existence of a single zzso zzso zzso (K zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction with specific zzso for sea zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso expression of only the later zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels in zzso but had no effect on total zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso bound efficiently to the zzso but were severely defective in stimulating zzso in zzso cells indicating that the first six zzso of zzso zzso although not important for zzso zzso are essential for zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso acts on the gastrointestinal tract through zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and might regulate zzso zzso at this zzso zzso binding and activity throughout the zzso appears to be allocated to the same zzso acid zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso
