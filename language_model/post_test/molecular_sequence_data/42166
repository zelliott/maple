The effects of copper on metal regulatory factors were studied in cultured human zzso using mobility shift zzso and protein zzso A mobility shift was apparent on zzso gels when zzso whole cell extracts were reacted with a zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was specific, since the shifted band was not zzso away by zzso zzso containing two base zzso Known zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not compete with the zzso metal regulatory element binding protein zzso for binding to the zzso zzso When zzso were grown in 200 or 800 zzso copper, binding of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed by zzso cell zzso zzso onto zzso and probing with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso band, apparent in zzso cell nuclear extract as well as zzso whole cell zzso was not influenced by the presence of copper in the growing zzso A zzso zzso also present in both zzso cells and zzso appeared to zzso with the protein causing the mobility zzso zzso added to the zzso growth media enhanced binding of the zzso protein to zzso using the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is a positive regulatory factor influenced by zzso Human zzso can be employed to further study metal regulatory factors whose binding to metal regulatory elements is influenced by copper and other heavy zzso
