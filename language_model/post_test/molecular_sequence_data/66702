The zzso B3 3A protein forms zzso and plays important roles in both viral zzso zzso replication and the viral zzso of zzso protein zzso The molecular zzso that are required for each of these functions are yet poorly zzso Based on the zzso structure of the closely related zzso 3A zzso a molecular model of the zzso B3 3A protein was zzso Using this structural model, specific zzso were designed to study the zzso relationship of zzso The zzso were tested for their capacity to zzso support zzso zzso and block protein zzso A zzso interaction between the zzso and an zzso salt bridge were identified as major zzso required for zzso We show that zzso is important for both efficient zzso replication and zzso of protein zzso In addition, zzso were identified that were not required for zzso but that were essential for either one of the biological functions of zzso The combination of the in zzso and in zzso results obtained in this study provides important insights in both the structural and functional aspects of zzso
