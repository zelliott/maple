Recent molecular research on Antarctic zzso organisms has challenged traditional zzso zzso suggesting that our current perceptions of Antarctic zzso and species zzso must be thoroughly zzso Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the zzso level remains poorly zzso particularly in eastern zzso We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two sibling zzso species that could be collected on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso networks and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of zzso with several occurring in zzso and at least one likely to have a true zzso zzso Within species, gene flow was often highly zzso consistent with a brooding life history and in some cases suggestive of current or future zzso zzso zzso of genetic structure were not always zzso one cryptic species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation across zzso zzso in eastern zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso yet another was remarkably zzso across zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso diversity also varied among cryptic species, independent of sample size zzso zzso zzso These results indicate several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic zzso that are neither apparent from previous zzso or ecological studies nor predictable from their life zzso Such genetic diversity and structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic zzso organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent zzso of populations on the shelf, and highlight our misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species zzso
