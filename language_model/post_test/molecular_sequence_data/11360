Close sequence zzso between strains of zzso have been used to corroborate cases of zzso identified zzso As an alternative to extensive DNA sequence analysis, genetic zzso between pairs of zzso zzso was estimated using the reduced zzso zzso of zzso envelope DNA zzso through zzso zzso All six infections acquired in a dental practice in the late 1980s and four of six infections acquired through blood product zzso and sexual contact in zzso could be rapidly zzso A rising level of genetic diversity within zzso zzso B facilitated the detection of later transmission zzso zzso linkages could be detected up to 4 years following zzso The simple and rapid technique of DNA zzso tracking can therefore assist zzso investigations of zzso transmission and potentially of other genetically variable infectious zzso
