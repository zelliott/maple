We have isolated and identified all four zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso and zzso clones from a Japanese zzso zzso zzso library and bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso Numerous zzso transcripts were zzso to examine the zzso against zzso zzso and were shown zzso on their zzso region 3 zzso zzso Among zzso zzso delta showed a long and broad length distribution, indicating greater similarity to that of zzso From zzso sequences and zzso gene analysis of each chain, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta have two different C gene zzso while the zzso alpha C region exists as a single zzso The zzso C zzso and C zzso showed different lengths in the connecting zzso zzso region between the different types of zzso The C delta 1 gene consists of two zzso one that encodes an zzso zzso domain zzso 1) and the other that encodes either a very short or possibly a lacking zzso region, a zzso region, and a zzso tail zzso zzso these are located within zzso alpha gene zzso Southern zzso analysis, using the bacterial artificial zzso zzso DNA zzso revealed that the C delta 2 gene segment, which has a long zzso region and different zzso organization to the C delta 1 zzso exists on same gene locus as the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso possesses very unique zzso DNA organization and gene zzso for zzso C zzso delta 1, and C zzso delta zzso
