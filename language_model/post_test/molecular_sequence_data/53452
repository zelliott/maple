Ten peptides with differential zzso activity against the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso coli, and the zzso zzso zzso were isolated from an extract of the skin of a North American frog, the green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of three previously characterized families of zzso zzso first identified in the North American zzso zzso zzso In addition, five structurally related peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 13 zzso acid zzso and containing a zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso family first identified in the European common zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso families, previously isolated from the skins of Asian and European zzso zzso were not identified in the zzso The data support the hypothesis that the distribution and zzso acid sequences of the skin zzso peptides are valuable tools in the identification and zzso of zzso zzso
