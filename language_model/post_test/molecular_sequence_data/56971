The DNA sequence of zzso zzso from the chicken zzso zzso coli zzso strain was determined by direct zzso sequencing of zzso chain reaction zzso DNA and was compared with those of zzso zzso from zzso and human zzso zzso coli strains zzso 299 and H zzso The structural genes of the A and B zzso of chicken zzso zzso were identical to those of human zzso zzso from the human H zzso zzso Moreover, 67 base pairs of the upstream and 60 base pairs of the downstream region of the chicken zzso zzso gene were also identical to that of the human zzso zzso from strain H zzso However, the patterns of plasmids from the zzso and H zzso strains were zzso The zzso strain had no band corresponding to the zzso zzso of the H zzso strain zzso the zzso zzso gene but it had a smaller zzso These data suggest that although the DNA sequence of chicken zzso zzso is identical to that of human zzso zzso the zzso zzso the chicken zzso zzso gene in the chicken might be different from that zzso the human zzso zzso gene in the H zzso zzso
