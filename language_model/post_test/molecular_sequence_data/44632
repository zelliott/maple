A protein with zzso activity against zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of the fall zzso zzso zzso larvae challenged with live zzso zzso A zzso protein of about 14,000 zzso in mass was zzso by zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso The optimum pH and optimum temperature range for activity were around pH zzso and 50 degrees C, respectively, in a 100 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of this protein was determined and the corresponding zzso was isolated and zzso The deduced protein of 142 zzso acid zzso was composed of a putative leader sequence of 20 zzso and the mature zzso of 122 zzso The cloned zzso gene was strongly induced in response to bacterial injection, zzso that the zzso is a part of the immune response of zzso zzso zzso with other known zzso sequences shows that our zzso belongs to the chicken zzso
