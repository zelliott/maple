The class 1 protein is a major protein of the outer membrane of zzso zzso and an important zzso in zzso The complete zzso sequence for the structural gene of a class 1 protein has been zzso The sequence predicts a protein of 374 zzso zzso preceded by a typical signal zzso of 19 zzso The zzso profile of the predicted protein sequence resembles that of the zzso coli and zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence of the class 1 protein exhibits considerable structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso studies also reveal zzso zzso zzso between the class 1 zzso zzso and zzso A restriction zzso from the class 1 gene zzso to zzso zzso fragments in Southern zzso In addition to the class 1 gene coding region there is a large open reading frame on the opposite zzso
