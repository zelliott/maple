zzso zzso share little or no sequence zzso with the exception of zzso or zzso that recognize and cleave the same DNA zzso We present here the structure of a zzso zzso zzso bound to the same DNA sequence zzso as that zzso with zzso We show that zzso is a more minimal version of zzso lacking not only the zzso and zzso zzso but also an internal zzso zzso and containing zzso that are shorter than those in zzso Despite these structural differences, zzso recognizes the DNA in a remarkably similar manner to zzso including zzso contacts via zzso zzso that appear to zzso for the minor zzso However, the arms are shorter than in zzso We observe similar zzso affinities between zzso and zzso but zzso has higher star activity (at zzso compared to zzso Together, the zzso and zzso structures offer a rare opportunity to compare two restriction zzso that work on exactly the same DNA zzso
