In human zzso a detailed knowledge of linkage zzso zzso is considered a prerequisite for effective zzso high-resolution gene mapping and zzso Similar opportunities exist for plants; however, differences in breeding system and population history need to be zzso Here we report a detailed study of localized zzso in different populations of an zzso crop zzso We measured zzso between and within four gene zzso within the region surrounding the zzso locus in three different gene pools of barley zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso extends to at least 212 zzso in elite barley zzso but is rapidly eroded in related zzso ancestral zzso Our results indicate that zzso sequence analysis in multiple populations will provide new opportunities to adjust the resolution of association studies in zzso crop zzso
