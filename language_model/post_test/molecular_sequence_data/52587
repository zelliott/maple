zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was previously identified as a specific regulator of the zzso gene during early liver development and in response to hormonal signals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Green, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report a functional analysis of zzso interactions with the zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso core promoter contains two zzso zzso sites and a third, zzso site shared with other zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso reporter genes with the zzso promoter linked or not linked to zzso I indicate that zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso core promoter, more efficient than zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor 1, a close zzso zzso which binds to the same DNA motif and is expressed zzso in zzso cells, seems to be an even stronger zzso than zzso Point zzso of the zzso sites indicate direct zzso zzso effects on the core promoter and the use of both zzso sites for productive interaction between the core promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso further indicate that zzso and zzso are the most efficient partners for zzso of the zzso core promoter, which may largely account for the zzso zzso and the early amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behaves as a dominant negative zzso to compete all three zzso sites and strongly zzso core promoter interactions with zzso zzso this suggests possible new ways to interfere with zzso zzso
