zzso is a rare, zzso zzso zzso disorder causing incomplete formation of the zzso usually characterized by iris zzso It can also appear with other zzso anomalies, such as zzso glaucoma, zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the majority of cases, it is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso but it can also be caused by zzso that involve the zzso zzso Twelve unrelated patients of Polish origin with a clinical diagnosis of zzso were screened for the presence of zzso in the zzso region by means of multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso Additionally, the coding regions of the zzso gene were zzso in all zzso zzso examination revealed different size deletions of the zzso region in five zzso In three cases, deletions zzso the entire zzso gene and a few adjacent zzso In one case, a zzso of the zzso gene was deleted zzso In the final case, the deletion did not include any zzso zzso Our molecular findings provide further evidence of the existence of the distant 3' regulatory elements in the downstream region of the zzso zzso which is known from other studies to influence the level of protein zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed the three different point zzso in the remaining four patients with zzso All the detected zzso were reported zzso Based on accomplished results, the great diversity of the molecular basis of zzso was zzso It varies from point zzso to different size deletions in the zzso region which zzso partly or completely the zzso gene or cause a position zzso
