The primary structures of two zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso und zzso were derived from automated zzso degradation data, zzso acid composition and manual zzso degradation results of zzso fragments and zzso with other zzso type zzso zzso The highest degrees of zzso were observed between zzso or zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso beans zzso I, IV and zzso zzso zzso peas zzso zzso and, in part, zzso beans zzso I, II and zzso zzso Similarly, the primary structure of the zzso inhibitor from the same source, zzso was deduced which showed highest zzso with that of the zzso inhibitor zzso II from garden beans zzso followed by zzso zzso from garden beans zzso and zzso from soybeans zzso In contrast, zzso between zzso and zzso on the one hand and zzso on the other was relatively low zzso
