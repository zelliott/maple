zzso small zzso proteins zzso protect zzso II and zzso zzso during heat and other zzso and zzso production levels are related to plant zzso However, to date, a paucity of zzso sequences from C4 or zzso species, or from other extremely zzso species, has precluded an examination to determine if zzso genes or proteins might differ among plants with zzso pathways or between zzso and zzso zzso To investigate this, we isolated and characterized novel zzso genes in four plant zzso two moderately zzso C4 species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two very zzso zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso walking and zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso has confirmed the presence of zzso zzso common to previously examined zzso As expected, the transit zzso was found to be the most variable part of these zzso zzso analysis of these genes revealed differences in zzso versus zzso and C4 species that were independent of a general difference between zzso and zzso observed for the entire zzso zzso gene and protein expression indicated that zzso protein levels were correlated with zzso of zzso electron zzso and that in most cases protein and transcript levels were zzso Thus, available evidence indicates little variation in the zzso acid sequence of zzso mature proteins between zzso and zzso species, but that variation in zzso protein production is related to heat tolerance or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is driven by promoter zzso Key message We isolated and characterized four novel zzso genes with promoters from wild plants, analysis has shown qualitative and quantitative zzso variations in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso plant zzso
