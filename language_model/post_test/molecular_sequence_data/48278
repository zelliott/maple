The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso control the programmed deaths of specific zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso functions to kill these zzso by zzso regulating the protective activity of zzso zzso encodes a protein closely related to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso factors, and a zzso zzso may play a role in regulating programmed cell death in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso encodes a Snail family zinc finger zzso most similar in sequence to the zzso zzso differentiation protein zzso We define an element important for zzso regulation and provide evidence that zzso can bind to a site within this element and thus may directly repress zzso zzso Our results suggest that a zzso cascade controls the deaths of specific cells in zzso zzso
