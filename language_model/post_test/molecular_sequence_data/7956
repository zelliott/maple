A zzso zzso cell line, designated zzso was established from zzso zzso of a patient with zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso arose in the pelvis and ran an aggressive clinical zzso zzso analysis of the cell line exhibited a complex zzso including the loss of zzso zzso To evaluate the molecular events in the cell line that may be associated with the development of the lymphoma, we investigated the expression and/or zzso of several classes of human zzso including zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso located on the zzso zzso was extremely reduced in zzso cell line, as compared with that in a normal zzso tissue and other 4 zzso cell lines by the reverse zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso of the zzso gene might play a role in the zzso of the case of zzso
