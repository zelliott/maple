zzso zzso has been used to delineate the essential recognition elements for stable folding in zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso The unfolded zzso and zzso zzso fragments formed by limited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso fold into an active zzso structure on interaction with one zzso The corresponding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso however, was not capable of structurally zzso the zzso zzso fragment, indicating that zzso zzso among these zzso zzso is sensitive to the sequence differences between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and folding activity could be recovered with hybrid sequences of these zzso zzso Complete zzso scanning of the zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the sequence recognition elements required for complex zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that abolished binding affinity with the zzso zzso zzso correlate well with highly zzso zzso among zzso zzso that are either zzso involved in core packing or found at the interface between zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso acid to zzso was found to have a significant effect on zzso A single additional zzso of zzso to zzso acid allowed for recovery of native structure and increased the zzso stability of the designed zzso zzso by 18 degrees zzso This modification appears to relieve an zzso surface zzso interaction, demonstrating the importance of surface charge interactions in protein zzso
