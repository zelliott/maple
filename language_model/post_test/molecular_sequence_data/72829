A zzso clone zzso rabbit zzso was obtained by library screening and zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame coding for zzso zzso acids which shows an overall identity of zzso to human zzso the cell zzso zzso zzso A 50% zzso to zzso zzso within the zzso core domain was also zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that three transcripts existed in all six rabbit zzso examined but their expression levels varied over a wide zzso The putative zzso coding region was highly expressed in zzso coli as a zzso protein which was zzso to zzso The ability of this expressed protein to form a zzso bond with zzso showed that it was functionally zzso The ability of this protein to catalyze the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso was also zzso
