The zzso B core zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and in zzso zzso A zzso tag was introduced at the C zzso of the zzso coli expressed protein allowing its zzso by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso expressed zzso was isolated following heat zzso The two zzso zzso were zzso further on a zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis suggested that zzso was zzso only in zzso zzso and reaction with zzso zzso allowed the zzso respectively, of zzso and zzso mole of free zzso groups per mole of zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso coli and the zzso zzso proteins formed zzso particles with, respectively, a diameter of 34 and 28 zzso zzso acid components were found zzso in both particles but protected from zzso treatment only in the zzso zzso derived particles suggesting structural discrepancies between the two zzso zzso The high purity of these zzso zzso allowed the development of a sandwich zzso to detect zzso to zzso zzso in human zzso The preliminary results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso produced zzso is more suitable than the zzso zzso coli zzso for detection of zzso in this diagnostic zzso
