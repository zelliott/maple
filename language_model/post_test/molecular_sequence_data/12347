zzso E zzso a 299 zzso acid zzso is a zzso for the low density zzso zzso zzso It has been established that basic zzso acids situated between zzso zzso 136 and 150 participate in the interaction of zzso with the zzso Evidence suggests that zzso is zzso on zzso in its zzso and in its ability to react with cell surface zzso Our goal was to produce zzso that could serve as zzso zzso of the zzso binding site of zzso We used a series of zzso zzso that have zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 152, and 158 to identify the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that inhibit zzso binding to the zzso We show that most of the zzso that have reduced zzso with the LDL zzso also have reduced zzso with the zzso The zzso for both zzso appear to include zzso 143 through 150 and thus coincide with the zzso site of zzso It is notable that zzso zzso but not zzso resembles the zzso in showing a reduced zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso While most of the zzso zzso involve replacement of zzso zzso directly implicated in zzso substitution of zzso by zzso is thought to indirectly affect binding of zzso to the zzso by altering the zzso of the zzso zzso To determine whether the similarity in zzso of the zzso and the zzso reflect structural similarities, we cloned and characterized the zzso zzso the light and heavy chains of both zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that, although these two zzso react with overlapping zzso their respective zzso determining regions zzso share little zzso especially those of their heavy zzso The two zzso therefore, likely recognize different zzso or zzso within a limited surface of the zzso zzso Four zzso charged zzso acids were present in the second zzso of the zzso heavy chain that could be approximately aligned with zzso zzso acids within the consensus sequence of the zzso zzso zzso This could indicate that zzso zzso and the zzso use a common mode of interaction with zzso
