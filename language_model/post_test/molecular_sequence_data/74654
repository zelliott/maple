The zzso zzso family of zzso is of crucial importance throughout the life cycle of higher zzso zzso nuclear import is required for most zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso is dependent on two related proteins called zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso with zzso playing the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso impaired Response 1), a related pair of zzso factors, which thus indirectly control zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso interact with the zzso form of zzso but the mechanism by which they enable zzso zzso in the nucleus remains zzso zzso comparison of numerous zzso proteins indicates that only the zzso located at the zzso and the zzso domain located at the zzso are zzso We demonstrate that these two parts of zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso is inhibited in the presence of high levels of zzso zzso unable to enter the zzso Furthermore, nuclear zzso of zzso becomes zzso and zzso when an zzso sequence is fused to zzso strongly suggesting that zzso mediates nuclear import of zzso zzso In accordance with this idea, zzso and zzso become functionally zzso in zzso expressing a zzso nuclear version of zzso Our data suggest that the mechanism uncovered in zzso is zzso in higher zzso Moreover, this mechanism allows us to propose a model explaining why zzso needs a specific nuclear import zzso
