zzso a zzso zzso protein containing nine zinc finger zzso is an zzso zzso III zzso factor responsible for the assembly of a zzso complex on the 5 S zzso zzso We have analyzed the effect of deleting various regions of zzso zzso on its ability to bind to the internal control region of the zzso 5 S zzso zzso to recruit zzso into the zzso complex and to promote in zzso zzso of the 5 S zzso zzso A truncated zzso containing only the three zzso zinc fingers retained the ability to bind specifically to the internal control region of the 5 S zzso zzso The zzso complex formed with this three zinc finger module was able to recruit zzso but could not promote zzso An zzso acid domain, which interrupts the repeating zinc finger motifs between fingers 8 and 9, was found to be essential for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso that extends beyond the ninth zinc finger motif had no effect on the in zzso activities of the zzso zzso the zzso deletion to include the ninth zinc finger led to reduced zzso zzso We speculate that the ninth zinc finger serves to anchor the zzso portion of zzso on the 5 S zzso zzso correctly zzso the zzso acid domain to serve its role in promoting zzso zzso of the region of the protein zzso to the first zinc finger motif was without zzso zzso the zzso deletion to include the first zinc finger appeared to decrease the affinity of zzso for DNA without affecting the specificity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex was defective in recruiting zzso and did not support zzso
