zzso zzso directed against the major zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso were used to monitor cloning and expression of the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of the gene was zzso and zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso zzso A DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene revealed the presence of an open reading frame that zzso a protein having 336 zzso acid zzso and a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso indicating that there was zzso modification of the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso sequence we identified motifs corresponding to consensus zzso promoter elements which could be zzso by the cloned zzso gene when it was expressed in zzso coli zzso The deduced zzso protein sequence exhibited high levels of zzso to sequences of zzso proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The levels of sequence similarity for the zzso and zzso portions were about 65 and zzso zzso DNA sequence information on the zzso gene was used to design zzso for gene amplification by the zzso chain reaction method, and by using this method zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA could be zzso Our results provide a basis for further zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso investigation of the role of this protein in zzso zzso and development of a standardized zzso for diagnostic systems for zzso zzso zzso
