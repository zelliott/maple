zzso butterfly wing patterns show repeated convergence between species and have zzso value in mimicry and mate choice, offering an opportunity to connect zzso changes in zzso with their underlying zzso Here we study zzso zzso pigmentation in zzso zzso We clone two new zzso zzso genes for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ), and analyze the expression patterns of all known zzso genes across zzso wing zzso In combination with published work, this generates the first comparative gene expression data for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In both species zzso expression zzso with the zzso band, but the expression pattern of zzso differs significantly between the zzso This demonstrates that both shared and divergent expression patterns are associated with zzso zzso between zzso zzso Two genes not studied in zzso zzso scarlet and possibly zzso also show enhanced expression in the zzso band of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of several members of this zzso zzso during pattern zzso
