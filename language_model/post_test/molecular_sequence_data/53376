We previously demonstrated that zzso a member of protein zzso B family, is activated by a number of growth factors via Ras and zzso zzso signaling zzso Here, we report the frequent zzso of zzso in human primary zzso cancer and induction of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses in 91 zzso cancer specimens revealed elevated levels of zzso activity zzso in 33 cases zzso The majority of tumors displaying activated zzso were high grade and stages III and zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses using a zzso zzso zzso that detects the activated form of zzso zzso zzso at zzso confirmed the frequent zzso of zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso in tumor specimens localized to the cell membrane and zzso but not the zzso To address the mechanism of zzso zzso we measured in zzso zzso zzso activity in 43 zzso cancer zzso including the 33 cases displaying elevated zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso activity were observed in 20 cases, 15 of which also exhibited zzso zzso The remaining five cases displayed elevated zzso zzso Among the cases with elevated zzso but not zzso zzso activity (18 zzso three showed zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells exhibiting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso of zzso is a common occurrence in human zzso cancer and that zzso zzso zzso may be an important target for zzso cancer zzso
