The zzso zzso which is required for zzso I zzso division during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso DNA sequencing has identified an open reading frame of 173 zzso that encodes the putative zzso protein and has no significant sequence similarities to known zzso The last 15 zzso acids of this putative protein have a high negative charge, which appears to be required for zzso A second zzso zzso designated zzso was found adjacent to zzso and shown to be necessary for efficient spore zzso The two genes are zzso on opposite DNA strands with only 103 zzso between the termination zzso Up to 700 zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts are zzso and the 3' untranslated region of the longest zzso transcript is complementary to all or nearly all of the zzso zzso A strain zzso for an zzso which removes the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso has an efficiency of zzso number of spores per zzso and spore viability identical to those of a zzso zzso The zzso therefore has either no function or only a subtle function in zzso and zzso
