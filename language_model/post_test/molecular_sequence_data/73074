zzso is an zzso zzso zzso involved in cell zzso and migration events in a range of important zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells to the zzso may contribute to the breakdown of normal tissue function associated with various zzso The adhesive properties of zzso may be zzso by its interaction with zzso the most abundant zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso has been localized to a 42 zzso zzso zzso on the basis of this zzso affinity for zzso collagen zzso This zzso domain contains the only type 2 zzso zzso found in the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for the affinity of these proteins for zzso zzso of the structure of zzso will provide insights into its interactions with other zzso and will contribute to our understanding of the structure and function of the zzso zzso in both normal and zzso zzso 

We have determined the solution structure of the first zzso zzso module from human zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso module is similar to that of a shorter zzso zzso zzso from the bovine seminal plasma protein zzso The zzso module has two zzso zzso beta sheets oriented approximately perpendicular to each other, and enclosing a cluster of highly zzso aromatic zzso five of which form a zzso zzso zzso The zzso extension in zzso brings the N and C zzso of the module into close zzso 

The close proximity of the N and C zzso in zzso allows for interactions between zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, instead of forming an extended, linear chain of zzso the domain may have a more zzso zzso zzso A pocket in the zzso zzso zzso surface may bind zzso zzso in the putative zzso site of the zzso zzso component type I zzso
