zzso syringe zzso a producer of zzso is resistant to high zzso of the zzso Two possible mechanisms of resistance have been zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso even in the presence of sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene responsible for this last activity, zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein and is immediately followed by a second open reading frame, which shows sequence similarities to zzso zzso zzso uses zzso as a zzso in an zzso reaction that can be reversed with alkaline zzso Other zzso zzso cannot be zzso for zzso in this zzso No relationship between zzso and the previously described genes of zzso resistance was zzso
