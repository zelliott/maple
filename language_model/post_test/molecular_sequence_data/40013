zzso P functions as a zzso zzso but a zzso full inverse zzso on the zzso zzso Through a systematic deletion and substitution analysis of this zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as the core structure, which itself displayed relatively low inverse zzso zzso zzso analysis at 17 selected positions in the main zzso zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso apparently interacts only with zzso in the middle part of the pocket zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the inverse zzso peptides bind in a pocket that extends all the way from the zzso end of zzso zzso across between zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso The potency of the main inverse zzso could be improved up to zzso by a number of zzso zzso located relatively deep in the binding pocket at key positions in zzso zzso and zzso It is proposed that the inverse zzso prevent the spontaneous zzso zzso by inserting relatively deeply across the main zzso pocket and zzso blocking the movement of zzso and zzso into their zzso active zzso The combined zzso analysis of both the zzso and the zzso allowed for the design of a novel, zzso zzso analog of zzso which rescued the zzso selective inverse zzso that was dependent upon both zzso and zzso The identified zzso can possibly serve as the basis for targeted discovery of also zzso inverse zzso for the zzso zzso
