We have used two kinds of zzso techniques, zzso interference and zzso radical protection, to explore the way that zzso recognizes its specific target zzso Our results lead us to conclude that zzso recognizes DNA primarily through contacts with the minor groove, an unprecedented mode for a zzso binding zzso We have also determined that, although zzso is a small protein that protects a large region of DNA, only a single zzso zzso is present at each binding zzso zzso zzso the DNA to which it zzso We have combined this fact plus our zzso and zzso data together with the crystal structure of a related zzso the zzso DNA binding protein zzso to propose a model for the way in which zzso binds to its DNA zzso
