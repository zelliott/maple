The zzso gene which encodes a zzso zzso is critical for zzso resistance in zzso A putative zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso which is not known for zzso production, was identified by zzso analysis and cloned by zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso of soluble protein zzso of zzso revealed a zzso increase in zzso activity as compared to the zzso control, thus confirming its zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was also found to be of intermediate resistance to zzso although it does not produce zzso thus suggesting the role of zzso in zzso or zzso As such, the prevalence of zzso genes in the environment may be more common than previously zzso
