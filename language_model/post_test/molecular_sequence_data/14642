zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10) is a zzso protein that is able to enhance the retention and zzso of Ras proteins in the zzso apparatus, subsequently leading to a sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the zzso and functional zzso of zzso In the present study, we extensively dissected and zzso the structure of zzso The zzso analysis reveals that zzso is an integral membrane protein with its zzso facing the zzso Multiple zzso including the zzso region at the zzso the zzso region at the zzso and the three zzso facing the zzso were found to be required for zzso to reside in the zzso apparatus, to stimulate zzso zzso and to zzso Ras to the zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso was artificially forced to be expressed in the zzso zzso it could neither mobilize Ras to the zzso apparatus nor increase zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso that lost zzso zzso failed to promote differentiation of zzso zzso zzso the results of the present study indicate that zzso zzso is indispensable for zzso to implement its regulatory functions in the Ras zzso zzso
