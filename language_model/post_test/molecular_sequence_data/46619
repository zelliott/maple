zzso zzso zzso in humans and in animals are fatal zzso diseases with long incubation zzso The putative cause of these diseases is a normal host zzso the prion zzso that becomes zzso This abnormal prion protein is found mostly in the brains of infected individuals in later stages of the disease, but also can be found in zzso and other zzso in lower zzso In order to eradicate this disease in animals, it is important to develop a system that can concentrate the abnormal prion protein and an zzso that is very zzso The sensitivity that can be achieved with zzso zzso makes it possible to detect the abnormal protein in zzso A zzso from the zzso terminal region, zzso acid positions zzso was labeled with zzso during the synthesis of the zzso at the zzso zzso zzso that have been produced to this zzso were affinity zzso and used in a zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso labeled zzso in the zzso was 50 zzso Blood was obtained from normal sheep and zzso from sheep infected with zzso and elk infected with chronic wasting zzso zzso coats and plasma were prepared by a conventional zzso After treatment with zzso K, which destroys the normal protein but not the altered one, the blood zzso were extracted and tested in the zzso zzso zzso for the abnormal prion zzso The abnormal prion protein was detected in zzso from blood from infected animals but not from normal zzso This zzso makes a zzso zzso possible for these diseases and could be adapted to test for the abnormal prion protein in process materials that are used for manufacture of pharmaceuticals and products for human zzso
