This report describes the correlation between zzso zzso and zzso sequence as an approach to the identification of individual human zzso genes using zzso zzso zzso complementary to specific motifs within individual zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso and post washing processes permits discrimination of single zzso differences between probe and zzso This feature is used both to identify individual zzso as well as to detect zzso in genes by sequential zzso with multiple zzso In addition to the general strategy, specific details are provided for the identification of 12 zzso genes and 14 zzso zzso
