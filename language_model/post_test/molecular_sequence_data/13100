We have measured the zzso of zzso initiation and pausing by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso late promoter, zzso in growing zzso zzso initiating zzso from zzso pauses after zzso 16 or 17 zzso and escape from this pause could in theory be the zzso step in promoter zzso We tested this hypothesis by analyzing pausing and zzso zzso of both the zzso promoter segment and a more active zzso version of zzso we measured reporter gene expression and used zzso zzso to measure directly occupancy of the promoter and pause sites in growing zzso We find that zzso paused at zzso does not limit expression of zzso However, zzso paused at zzso does limit expression from the more active promoter by zzso formation of open zzso zzso the activity of the late gene regulatory protein Q to suppress the early pause, in addition to its zzso activity, is unlikely to be important in zzso gene zzso
