zzso is a synthetic zzso sharing a sequence of 11 zzso acids with the zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso recognize zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of 43 patients, treated with zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso plates were used for zzso testing in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 43 zzso zzso binding to zzso 22 zzso contained zzso that also recognized zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso was inhibited by more than zzso by zzso with high doses of zzso However, if zzso zzso plates were used, high zzso of zzso inhibited only 2 of the 43 positive zzso by more than zzso Therefore zzso zzso must be zzso The clinical consequences of this zzso are unknown but zzso targeted by zzso of patients treated with zzso zzso could potentially boost zzso zzso in such patients or even trigger an immune response by zzso zzso significant zzso formation in response to zzso zzso has not been observed, zzso Yet, as zzso and zzso zzso have recently been implicated in severe zzso zzso caution is warranted when using zzso in patients previously treated with zzso
