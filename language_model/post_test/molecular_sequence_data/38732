A new method of zzso mapping based on zzso zzso zzso disease zzso viruses produced by fusion zzso zzso chain zzso Seven out of 16 zzso and zzso newly produced zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso isolate zzso and zzso Using fusion zzso eight zzso viruses were produced containing different supplementary pieces of the zzso region of both parent zzso Using these zzso viruses we were able to map the zzso regions zzso by these seven zzso and zzso zzso This new method, using zzso viruses produced by fusion zzso is particularly valuable for the zzso mapping of zzso zzso
