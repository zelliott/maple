To study the zzso regulation mechanism of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso 

Total zzso were extracted from the zzso zzso strain and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension zzso was used to detect the promoter activity (the amount of primer extension zzso of zzso in zzso and that in zzso Then, quantitative zzso was done to calculate the zzso variation of zzso between the zzso and zzso The entire zzso region of the zzso gene was amplified by zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso under native conditions with zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso columns zzso Then, the zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was applied to analyze the zzso activity of zzso to zzso promoter region in zzso Finally, zzso coli zzso consensus was deployed to predict the zzso binding site to zzso promoter zzso 

The primer extension zzso detected only one zzso start site located at zzso zzso of zzso whose transcript was under positive regulation by zzso The zzso analysis indicated that zzso bound to a single region from 111 zzso to zzso upstream of zzso 

The zzso of zzso was directly activated by zzso in zzso zzso
