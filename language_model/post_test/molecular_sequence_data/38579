zzso amplification of the zzso element is frequently associated with the large zzso deletions responsible for genetic instability in zzso zzso zzso Five zzso were found in a 7 zzso region directly adjacent to zzso The putative products of zzso zzso and zzso showed similarities to zzso cassette (ABC) sugar zzso the deduced protein sequence of zzso displayed similarities to zzso whilst no zzso to proteins with known functions was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and the protein zzso and zzso An zzso activity was detected using the synthetic zzso zzso zzso Of the many zzso tested, only zzso was zzso at a measurable rate zzso activity zzso units zzso zzso but no growth of zzso zzso zzso on zzso was zzso A strain in which zzso was disrupted showed the same low zzso activity as strain zzso and in both strains no stimulation of activity was seen by zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso activity about zzso This probably resulted from induction of a second zzso zzso The zzso element contains three 1 zzso repeats which zzso zzso proteins necessary for zzso zzso In strains with a unique 1 zzso zzso disruption of the repeat led to a significant increase in the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso proteins of zzso have a dual zzso they are the zzso of the zzso genes and they promote amplification of zzso
