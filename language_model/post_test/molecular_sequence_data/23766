zzso T cells can be induced by altered zzso zzso to switch zzso and zzso zzso The underlying molecular mechanism is critical for understanding of zzso of zzso T cells and development of novel therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that analog peptides of an zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso zzso with zzso substitution at zzso and zzso had a unique partial zzso property in the induction of zzso or zzso zzso in zzso T cell clones typical of zzso zzso The observed zzso switch involved differential zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso More specifically, zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso correlated with enhanced zzso and zzso activities, while zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso activity and a zzso level of zzso and zzso zzso Further characterization revealed that a specific inhibitor for zzso selectively prevented zzso zzso of zzso T zzso zzso specific zzso for zzso and zzso blocked zzso zzso in the same T cell preparations induced by zzso zzso The findings have important implications in our understanding of regulation of zzso zzso and zzso by altered zzso zzso and their role in zzso regulation and zzso switch of zzso T zzso
