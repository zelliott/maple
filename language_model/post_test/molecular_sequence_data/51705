We have used zzso flow zzso to identify a population of zzso zzso zzso B cells which emerges in zzso of zzso mice following zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso produced by single, sorted zzso zzso cells in both zzso zzso and in zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso B cell population includes both zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso memory B zzso Each functionally discrete population of zzso B cells expresses a distinctive surface zzso defined by a wide range of B cell zzso In particular, zzso zzso cells were uniquely identified by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso B cell population emerging in the day 7 primary response was assessed for zzso diversity by amplification and direct sequencing of the rearranged zzso heavy chain variable region gene expressed by single, ex zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso Memory B cell zzso distinguished by zzso diversity, carried either no zzso or a single zzso within rearranged zzso suggesting isolation of these cells at the onset of the zzso zzso This novel approach, therefore, allows the direct and zzso identification and characterization of individual B cell zzso during their initial selection and zzso in zzso responses in zzso
