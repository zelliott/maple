The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is of importance in zzso development, zzso and zzso in the zzso central nervous zzso The functional zzso zzso is a zzso zzso two zzso and two zzso or zzso zzso We have carried out evolutionary trace zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences to identify and characterize the zzso forming the binding zzso We have also modeled the zzso binding core zzso of zzso zzso zzso using the recently available crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso binding core which shares approximately zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso A short molecular dynamics simulation of the zzso form of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure shows considerable zzso at the hinge region of zzso segment, where pore forming zzso zzso are located in the native zzso It is suggested that the disruption of domain closure could affect zzso zzso and thereby lead to zzso in normal animal zzso In conclusion, we identified the zzso acids that form the zzso pocket in many zzso zzso receptors and studied their hydrogen bonded and zzso interaction zzso Finally, the disruption in the zzso domain zzso (of zzso zzso crystal zzso has been studied with a short molecular dynamics simulation and correlated with some experimental zzso zzso see zzso The figure shows the binding mechanism of zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is shown in zzso hydrogen bonds in dotted lines and zzso acids in zzso The zzso acids shown here are within a zzso radius of the zzso zzso
