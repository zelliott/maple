zzso zzso are among the largest zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso consist of 79 different zzso proteins zzso that each are zzso by two to six zzso zzso It is unknown whether the zzso are incorporated into the zzso and whether the relative incorporation of zzso zzso varies in response to environmental zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso leaves fed with zzso zzso zzso samples were analyzed by zzso using both zzso and classical zzso zzso features obtained by using these two methods were identified using MASCOT and zzso Global zzso searching the theoretical sequences of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes 237 zzso and zzso of these were identified with zzso peptides for most of the identified zzso These zzso were identified with average protein sequence coverage of zzso observed by zzso zzso Interestingly, the analysis shows that the abundance of zzso zzso in the zzso changes in response to zzso zzso This is particularly evident for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results show that protein synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso involves a zzso zzso zzso The implications of these findings in the regulation of translation are zzso
