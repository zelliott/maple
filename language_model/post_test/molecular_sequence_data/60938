zzso B, and C comprise the zzso zzso factor known as nuclear factor Y zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso binds many zzso and Y box (an zzso zzso box, zzso zzso zzso of these elements that disrupt the binding of zzso result in decreased zzso from various zzso and zzso zzso We employed a zzso zzso system to screen a human liver zzso library in an effort to isolate proteins that interact with zzso and that may play a role in zzso or zzso promoter zzso Using a zzso of the zzso zzso as bait we isolated a zzso that encodes most of the open reading frame of the human zinc fingers and zzso 1 zzso zzso The complete open reading frame was subsequently isolated and found to zzso a protein of 873 zzso acids that contains two zinc fingers and five zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso isolated from various zzso revealed two major zzso transcripts of about zzso and 5 zzso Both transcripts were expressed zzso although the zzso transcript is of greater abundance in most zzso zzso The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso zzso
