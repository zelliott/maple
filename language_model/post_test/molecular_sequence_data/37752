The zzso system of zzso can sense four basic taste qualities, bitter, sweet, salty and sour, as well as zzso the taste of zzso Previous studies suggested that the detection of bitter and sweet zzso by taste zzso cells in the mouth is likely to involve zzso zzso Although two putative zzso zzso taste receptors have been identified, the chemical diversity of bitter and sweet compounds leads one to expect that there is a larger number of different zzso Here we report the identification of a family of candidate taste receptors (the zzso that are members of the zzso zzso zzso and that are specifically expressed by taste zzso zzso A cluster of genes zzso human zzso is located adjacent to a zzso gene zzso which in mouse is tightly linked to the zzso genetic locus that is involved in detecting the bitter compound zzso zzso Another zzso gene is found on a human zzso assigned to zzso zzso the location of a genetic locus zzso that controls the detection of the bitter compound zzso in zzso
