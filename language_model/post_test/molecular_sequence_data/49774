The zzso family zzso factor zzso functionally zzso with serum response factor zzso and plays an important role in cardiac zzso To determine the function of zzso in the smooth muscle cell zzso zzso we mapped the pattern of zzso gene expression and examined the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso activity of zzso in zzso and embryonic stem zzso zzso The human and zzso zzso genes were expressed in vascular and visceral zzso at levels equivalent to or exceeding those observed in the zzso During embryonic development, the zzso gene was expressed abundantly in a precise, zzso regulated pattern in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso regulatory elements in zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was not observed in zzso zzso cells but could be rescued by forced expression of zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of a zzso zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso alpha promoter activity in zzso Most importantly, forced expression of zzso activated expression of the zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso and zzso genes in zzso mouse zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso program that regulates zzso development and zzso
