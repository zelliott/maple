zzso is regarded as a high terrorist risk for the public due to its high toxicity and ease of zzso Currently, there is no therapeutic or vaccine available against zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso developed previously in our laboratory, can strongly neutralize zzso and is therefore a good candidate for zzso zzso of zzso variable regions was achieved by a zzso region zzso zzso The humanized zzso zzso variable regions were further grafted onto human heavy and light chain constant regions to assemble the complete zzso zzso A zzso zzso 2A zzso sequence was introduced between heavy and light chain DNA sequences to cleave the zzso protein into a functional full-length zzso zzso from a single open reading frame driven by a single promoter in an zzso zzso After expression in zzso cells and zzso the zzso was demonstrated to have zzso expression of the full-length zzso heavy and light zzso More importantly, the zzso exhibited high affinity to zzso with zzso of zzso zzso comparable to its parental zzso zzso zzso zzso In a mouse model, zzso zzso administration of zzso at a low dose of 5 zzso per zzso 4 hours after the zzso challenge with zzso zzso was found to rescue zzso of the zzso In addition, administered 6 hours zzso zzso could still rescue 50% of the zzso The zzso has the potential to be used for zzso or therapeutic purposes against zzso zzso
