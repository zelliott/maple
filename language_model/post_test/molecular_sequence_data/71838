In analysis of a zzso region of zzso mouse zzso 7 and human zzso zzso we have isolated a novel mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 1), zzso a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso located within 30 zzso of a known imprinted zzso zzso zzso expressed gene zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso is also zzso the gene is expressed mainly from the maternal zzso and at high levels only during embryonic and zzso zzso In contrast to most zzso zzso is expressed zzso in zzso and adult brain with slightly more input from the maternal zzso zzso produces multiple transcripts that range in size from zzso to 15 zzso The zzso zzso transcript is expressed at highest levels and appears to be zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is expressed at significant levels in the zzso zzso zzso of the limb buds during zzso suggesting a potential role of zzso in limb zzso We have identified the potential human zzso of zzso near zzso in a zzso zzso region of human zzso zzso The close juxtaposition of zzso imprinted genes has also been seen in other imprinted regions, such as human zzso ( zzso zzso zzso ) and suggests that the two genes may be zzso These and other data suggest the presence of an zzso zzso imprinted domain in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso
