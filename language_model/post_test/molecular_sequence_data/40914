zzso surface protein E zzso is a complement factor zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso It is usually absent from in zzso grown zzso zzso although in zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso We analyzed the presence and sequence spectrum of the zzso genes in zzso in zzso zzso DNA samples from the skin, serum and zzso fluid zzso of patients with infections caused by zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso in the corresponding patient zzso were detected by zzso zzso using zzso zzso as an zzso zzso genes were found in 20 of 23 zzso zzso zzso skin zzso with zzso zzso in 2 zzso skin zzso with unknown underlying subspecies, in 5 of 9 zzso zzso with zzso zzso and in 1 of 4 zzso samples of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso All zzso sequences from zzso zzso samples were zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso origin showed more zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that all zzso subspecies, but not necessarily all zzso causing human infections can carry zzso genes to protect themselves against complement attack in zzso
