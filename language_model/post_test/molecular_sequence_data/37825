We have recently identified a distinct zzso sequence pattern that occurs with limited sequence variations in many zzso coiled coils but not in zzso zzso or zzso This zzso trigger pattern was demonstrated to be indispensable for the assembly of the zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso I from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso With the aim to extend our knowledge on trigger sequences we have investigated the human zzso scavenger zzso type A zzso domain as a representative of zzso coiled zzso We prepared a variety of zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso from the full-length zzso domain by zzso gene expression in zzso coli and assessed their ability to form zzso zzso structures by circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping identified a distinct zzso sequence that was absolutely required for proper zzso formation, supporting our previous results that zzso repeats alone are not sufficient for zzso The finding that all fragments containing this particular sequence exhibited similar zzso zzso indicates primarily a stabilizing function of the zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso we suggest that functionally related sites are present in other zzso zzso zzso
