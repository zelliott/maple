Based on the literature and our own results, this review summarizes the most recent state of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso research, not as a general survey of the subject but as a case zzso For this purpose, we have selected here four typical zzso to discuss their unique structures and properties in zzso These include zzso zzso which served as a zzso for the unusual zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showing a high degree of zzso zzso zzso evolved with a truncated zzso and zzso zzso carrying an enigmatic zzso zzso These proteins are not grouped by any common features other than the fact they have zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a matter of course, various zzso functions other than the conventional oxygen transport or storage have been proposed so far to these primitive or ancient zzso or zzso but the precise in zzso activity is still zzso In this review, special emphasis is placed on the stability properties of the zzso zzso Whatever the possible roles of zzso zzso and zzso may be (or might have zzso the binding of molecular oxygen to zzso must be the primary event to manifest their zzso functions in zzso However, the zzso and stable binding of zzso to zzso is not a simple process, since the zzso form of zzso or zzso is oxidized easily to its zzso zzso with the generation of zzso zzso The zzso or zzso thus produced cannot bind molecular oxygen and is therefore zzso zzso In this respect, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of particular interest in their very unique zzso Indeed, both proteins have been found to have completely different strategies for overcoming many difficulties in the zzso and stable binding of molecular zzso as opposed to the irreversible zzso of zzso zzso Such comparative studies of the stability of zzso or zzso are of primary importance, not only for a full understanding of the zzso evolution, but also for planning new molecular designs for synthetic oxygen carriers that may be able to function in zzso solution and at zzso zzso
