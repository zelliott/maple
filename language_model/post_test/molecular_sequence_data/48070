zzso protect themselves against bacterial infection by zzso a battery of zzso peptides into the zzso Despite recent progress, important zzso questions, such as the precise bacterial targets, the nature of any cooperation that occurs between zzso and the purpose of multiple zzso zzso remain largely zzso We report zzso the chemical synthesis and preliminary zzso investigation of zzso an 82 zzso zzso that contains regions similar to two different types of zzso zzso A zzso highly practical synthesis of the precursor zzso allowed us to produce sufficient quantities of the zzso for zzso zzso The zzso full-length zzso proved to be active in growth zzso zzso with an zzso of approximately 250 zzso a concentration similar to that found in the insect zzso Biological analysis of zzso fragments indicated that the main zzso of zzso activity lay in the zzso region that is similar to the zzso zzso although the zzso segment, related to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso that activity by zzso In all zzso activity appeared zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso lacked structure both in plain buffer and in the presence of zzso zzso increased the zzso of the outer and inner zzso of zzso coli zzso cells, suggesting possible mechanisms of zzso The ability to access zzso of this type through chemical synthesis will facilitate further zzso zzso
