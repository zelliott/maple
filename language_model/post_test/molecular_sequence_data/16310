zzso are zzso zzso which are considered as zzso between zzso and zzso and which have been found in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso region of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso containing genes coding for zzso and zzso has been zzso The gene coding for zzso is split by a zzso zzso which has a secondary structure typical for zzso structured zzso and which is closely related to the zzso located in the corresponding gene from zzso and higher plant zzso It appears therefore that these zzso genes are all derived from one common ancestral gene which already contained a zzso zzso
