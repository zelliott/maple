The binding of restriction zzso zzso to synthetic zzso zzso 11 to 30 zzso long was investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso under zzso conditions in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso two types of specific zzso complexes were shown to be zzso Their mobility in gel was close to that of the zzso and the zzso of the marker zzso The number of such complexes in solution depended on the ratio of the zzso zzso of restriction zzso zzso and the DNA zzso The possible structure of the complexes is zzso
