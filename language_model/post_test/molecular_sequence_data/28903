During colonization of the alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variation, resulting in the appearance of colonies with different zzso Among zzso zzso three zzso C, zzso and S were selected, with the C zzso showing colony zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso strain and F and S having a translucent and diffuse zzso zzso zzso F and S were shown to zzso colonize zzso parts of the roots and showed zzso in zzso swimming faster than the C zzso and swarming under conditions that did not allow swarming of the C zzso The zzso behavior correlated with overproduction of the zzso protein zzso but not with zzso zzso of the F and S zzso were several times longer than those of the C zzso and overproduction of zzso was regulated at the zzso zzso zzso F showed zzso in traits that have been shown to be important for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso production, and these zzso were zzso by a cloned zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in zzso F suggested selection of the zzso in the zzso zzso F was also affected in other zzso such as zzso structure and zzso in zzso liquid zzso which were not zzso by the zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso showed that most of the zzso variation was due to the activity of this zzso indicating that phase variation occurs during zzso zzso
