The zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences were determined for beluga whale zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and they were compared with known sequences for five other zzso with particular attention to regulatory zzso The zzso for whale zzso and zzso zzso respectively, proteins of 582 and 640 zzso zzso zzso alignments suggest that the whale zzso like those for rat and chicken, has an zzso zzso targeting sequence of 56 zzso zzso There is a high degree of zzso acid conservation between the beluga whale proteins and those of other zzso including regulatory elements and functional zzso that have been defined in other zzso Both whale proteins contain three zzso regulatory motifs suggesting that zzso zzso may be regulated by zzso The zzso zzso contains an iron responsive element in its zzso region indicating that its expression may be zzso regulated by cellular zzso This extensive structural similarity and the presence of the same regulatory elements found in other zzso indicate that regulation of ALS in beluga whale is similar to that in other zzso
