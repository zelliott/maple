Studies using transgenic mice have shown that the mouse zzso collagen gene contains a zzso zzso which directs expression in the majority of collagen zzso cells during development and in response to tissue zzso In this study, we have investigated the minimal functional region required for the zzso effect and studied the role of the three hypersensitive sites zzso that overlap this zzso The results of deletion experiments indicate that the minimal functional unit of this zzso is a zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso This region includes the core sequences of zzso and zzso but not zzso The zzso sequences are essential for the functional integrity of the zzso whereas zzso represents zzso elements that direct expression in zzso cells of internal zzso and body wall zzso The zzso region appears to bind a complex of zzso factors illustrated by large regions of protected zzso A zzso sequence located between zzso and zzso is also essential for the zzso because its deletion results in increased zzso to the zzso zzso
