A novel zzso acid zzso in which the intended zzso zzso zzso were replaced by a zzso acid zzso was observed in a zzso protein expressed by zzso zzso The zzso was identified by zzso mapping and liquid zzso mass zzso analysis on zzso peptides of the protein and verified using the corresponding synthetic peptides containing the zzso zzso Analysis of the distribution of the zzso zzso and their zzso usage shows strong correlation between this zzso and the use of rarely used zzso within the zzso coli expression zzso zzso in this study suggest that the usage of the rare zzso zzso has resulted in a zzso for zzso zzso
