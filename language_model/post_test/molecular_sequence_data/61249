A novel DNA virus zzso was identified recently in Japanese patients with zzso zzso zzso and has been implicated as a cause of acute and chronic liver diseases of unknown zzso in some zzso The frequency of zzso infections was investigated in zzso blood donors, 105 patients with different liver disorders before and after liver transplantation zzso as well as in 64 patients with chronic zzso C who received zzso zzso zzso infections were found more frequently by zzso in patients with liver disorders zzso as compared to blood donors zzso zzso occurred independently of the zzso of the liver disease zzso zzso zzso zzso alcoholic zzso zzso zzso zzso failure zzso zzso and chronic zzso C zzso zzso After zzso a high rate of zzso de zzso infections zzso was zzso However, zzso zzso after zzso (in 56 out of the 105 zzso was not associated with graft zzso Analysis of patients with chronic zzso C zzso with zzso who have been treated with zzso alpha alone or in combination with zzso revealed that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences suggest that at least four different zzso and several zzso exist in zzso In conclusion, the high prevalence of zzso infections observed in patients with zzso risk factors is an argument in zzso of transmission of the virus via blood and blood zzso A relevant zzso capacity of zzso however, seems unlikely, considering the observation that in the majority of patients, zzso infection after zzso was not accompanied by graft zzso
