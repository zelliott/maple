zzso are approximately zzso zzso molecules that play important roles in zzso zzso We have performed small zzso sequencing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have zzso up to 400 million years ago, to establish the repertoire and evolutionary dynamics of zzso in these zzso In addition to previously known zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate expression of many of their zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identified in total more than 100 novel expressed zzso zzso the majority of which belong to zzso zzso Interestingly, more than half of all identified zzso genes are zzso at the seed level in all four zzso species, whereas only a few zzso appear to be species zzso In our compendium of zzso we observed evidence for known mechanisms of zzso evolution including zzso zzso and arm zzso as well as zzso family expansion through gene zzso In addition, we identified a novel mode of zzso evolution, termed zzso zzso in which an alternative hairpin is formed with zzso or downstream zzso leading to shifting of the hairpin and creation of novel zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso in all four zzso including zzso zzso where the upstream zzso motif is more zzso The identification and systematic analysis of small zzso repertoire in four zzso species described here provides a valuable resource for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of zzso gene zzso
