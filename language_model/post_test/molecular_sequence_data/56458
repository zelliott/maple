The small zzso heat shock proteins zzso of zzso are zzso by a complex zzso zzso In a previous report, we described the genetic information from zzso zzso two different members of the zzso In this communication, we report the isolation and characterization of zzso and zzso clones zzso information for a third member of this zzso family zzso DNA fragments containing zzso sequences common to, or specific for, each of these characterized zzso genes were prepared and used as zzso to assess the expression of these genes during zzso and development of the zzso in an zzso line of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate zzso that zzso transcripts zzso the zzso zzso are expressed and/or accumulate during zzso and zzso that genes zzso two of the characterized zzso zzso are expressed and/or accumulate zzso in a zzso manner during zzso These observations imply that the zzso expression of particular zzso zzso genes results from zzso regulation during zzso and zzso development rather than from an overall zzso of the heat shock or stress zzso
