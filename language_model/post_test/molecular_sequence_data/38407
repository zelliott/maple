zzso zzso zzso zzso are important for zzso zzso binding and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, by using zzso zzso zzso we identified two zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso that are, in zzso necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso In this study, we generated additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso point zzso to identify specific zzso within the zzso zzso region that contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and the binding of several zzso was zzso We present evidence that the zzso region zzso is important for zzso binding and that, in particular, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are essential zzso for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify an additional zzso zzso zzso that not only is important for zzso binding by zzso (a strong positive zzso but also plays a crucial role in the binding of the zzso zzso (a zero zzso and zzso (a weak negative zzso in the zzso binding zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggest that this zzso may be part of a zzso within the zzso binding site that is important for binding zzso This separation of zzso zzso for competitive zzso zzso lends insight into the structural zzso governing the divergent effects of these zzso
