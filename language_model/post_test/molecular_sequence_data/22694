The present study examined the in zzso role of zzso a zzso family small zzso in brain zzso zzso was expressed by zzso zzso cells, which primarily develop to zzso zzso during their stay in the zzso zone of embryonic cerebral zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and a zzso active zzso but not a negative zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells by in zzso zzso disturbed their zzso and migration to upper zzso These results indicate that zzso functions in zzso as a regulator of the migration and zzso changes associated with the development of zzso zzso
