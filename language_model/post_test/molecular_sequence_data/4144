Remarkably few changes of significance seem to have occurred within the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso during an extensive portion of the empirical strain improvement zzso carried out at Lilly Research zzso over many zzso None of the promoters for zzso zzso zzso genes or for regulatory elements changed within this part of the zzso nor were any zzso detected in other zzso zzso although the full set was probably not zzso Of five regulatory genes within the zzso zzso only zzso was altered, having undergone a single point zzso that zzso its product (a zzso zzso Also unchanged was a gene with zzso zzso Since point zzso affecting zzso zzso are unlikely to have played a major role in empirical strain improvement, enhanced zzso production levels appear to have resulted, in large measure, from zzso zzso occurring outside the zzso zzso
