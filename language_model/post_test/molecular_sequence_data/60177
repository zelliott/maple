zzso protein A zzso consisting of three zzso is a zzso zzso DNA zzso protein involved in DNA zzso repair and zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a zzso large zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is remarkably smaller than that from other zzso zzso approximately 70 zzso and is actively expressed in both free zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso large zzso has also been characterized from one other zzso zzso zzso Three distinct zzso have been identified in the zzso large zzso of humans and zzso an zzso protein interaction domain, a central zzso area, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso large zzso differs from that of other zzso in that only the zzso required for zzso binding and zzso formation are zzso It lacks the zzso domain necessary for the binding of proteins mainly involved in DNA repair and zzso This major structural difference suggests that the mechanism for DNA repair and zzso in some zzso differs from that of other zzso Since replication proteins play an essential role in the cell cycle, the fact that zzso proteins of zzso zzso differ from those of its host suggests that zzso be explored as a potential zzso target for controlling zzso and/or diseases caused by other zzso
