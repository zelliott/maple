Mercury resistance zzso by zzso zzso zzso is widespread among bacteria and operates under the control of zzso zzso represents a unique class of zzso factors that exert both positive and negative regulation on gene zzso zzso and bacteria are zzso yet little is known about the biological role of mercury in zzso or whether a resistance mechanism occurs in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso and low-level zzso resistance could be induced by metal zzso zzso zzso analysis of open reading frames zzso and zzso clarified their identity as zzso of zzso and zzso Northern analysis established that zzso zzso responded to mercury challenge, since zzso levels were zzso induced and, when zzso to zzso zzso zzso values for other highly expressed zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso zzso predicted a zzso zzso box with zzso zzso start site zzso The functional roles of zzso and zzso were clarified further by gene zzso The zzso zzso exhibited mercury sensitivity relative to wild type and was defective in zzso mercury zzso while the zzso zzso was mercury zzso Northern analysis of the zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso was zzso and that transcript abundance was at maximum zzso These findings constitute the first report of an zzso heavy metal resistance system; however, unlike bacteria the level of resistance is much zzso The zzso system employs a divergent zzso protein that acts only as a negative zzso regulator of zzso zzso
