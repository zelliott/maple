The fate of zzso zzso cells differs among zzso zzso zzso cells fuse with the zzso in zzso zzso whereas the zzso cells undergo zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso is involved in the regulation of these zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso prevents cell fusion of potential zzso cells and specifies the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that displayed zzso of the zzso precursor cells were isolated, and point zzso in zzso were zzso Thus, the evolution of these zzso cell fates is driven by different intrinsic properties of zzso zzso
