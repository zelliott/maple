Metal implants are in general not compatible with the zzso of the human body, and in particular, blood exhibits a severe zzso zzso zzso we present results of a technique to mask the surface of metals with a natural zzso zzso zzso zzso has minimal adverse interactions with blood and other zzso but attachment of zzso peptides can promote specific biological zzso In this study, stainless steel was cleaned and then zzso by zzso attachment of an zzso zzso The zzso was subsequently converted to an zzso functional group and reacted with zzso through an zzso zzso linkage, thus zzso zzso the zzso onto the steel zzso Fluorescent labeling of the zzso showed that the surface had a fairly uniform covering of zzso When human zzso rich plasma was placed on the zzso surface, there was no zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso containing the zzso zzso sequence was also bound to the stainless zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as exemplified by the attachment and spreading of zzso on this zzso Furthermore, when the zzso zzso was replaced with the nonsense zzso zzso minimal zzso of zzso was zzso This type of controlled biological activity on a metal surface has potential for modulating cell growth and cellular interactions with metallic zzso such as vascular zzso orthopedic zzso heart valve zzso and zzso
