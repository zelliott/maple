CW zzso zzso of reduced zzso clusters of zzso zzso soluble domain appear to produce features resulting from the interaction of the electron spins of the two adjacent zzso which can be explained by employing the local spin zzso This model favors the reduction of the zzso iron with zzso and zzso zzso which is supported by zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso showing one strongly coupled nitrogen from the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso also exhibit at least two different zzso located near diagonal in the zzso zzso with zzso approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the other approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso but did not show any of the larger splitting approximately zzso zzso previously seen with zzso zzso Further analysis with partially zzso protein indicates that zzso zzso zzso produce resolved features zzso in the zzso spectrum but contribute much less than zzso coupled zzso nitrogen species to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is suggested that these quantitative data may be used in future functional and theoretical studies on the zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso
