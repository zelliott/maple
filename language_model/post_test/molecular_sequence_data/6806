An in zzso zzso zzso was used to study zzso from synthetic zzso corresponding to the 3' zzso of influenza A virus zzso zzso zzso influenza virus zzso was used as a source of active zzso zzso zzso at two regions of the 13 zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso were shown to reduce zzso zzso by the short added model zzso The first region, at positions 1 and 2 from the 3' zzso was shown to be affected by the exact nature of the zzso primer used in the in zzso zzso reactions and may not be relevant in zzso The second region, zzso on positions 11 and 12, may be involved in base pairing with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso Evidence for this comes from the finding that zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso but zzso to restore the zzso base pairing with the zzso 3' ends, could partly restore zzso zzso of the influenza virus zzso complex to a set of zzso zzso was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to two regions of the zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated, at positions 1 to 3 and positions 8 to zzso Together, these observations suggest that a zzso forms from the zzso of the zzso zzso and that this structure may play a role in zzso to produce zzso zzso
