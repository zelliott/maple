The zzso family of human genes currently consists of seven related members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso and zzso These genes are expressed to varying degrees in zzso of immune cells zzso B, natural killer, and zzso zzso and may function as zzso or zzso This set of zzso related to zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso are found clustered close together in the human zzso on zzso zzso Four of these family members zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso zzso motifs in their zzso tails that enable them to bind zzso signaling molecules zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso disease zzso and studies in zzso patients have shown that improper signaling via molecules that bind zzso contributes to the zzso We have identified two new members of the zzso family zzso which we term zzso and zzso which are expressed in immune cells and map in the zzso gene zzso zzso does not contain zzso motifs in its short zzso zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso in T cells, binds both zzso and zzso The data suggest that signaling through zzso together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso is controlled by zzso and therefore contributes to the zzso of zzso
