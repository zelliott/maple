zzso interactions effectively mediate molecular zzso They are the result of specific interactions between protein zzso and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to zzso For the most part, selection restricts zzso acid zzso accounting for the conservation of binding zzso However, in some cases, change in one protein will be zzso by zzso change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary zzso There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of zzso Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so zzso probable zzso However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these zzso zzso Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both zzso zzso change and zzso evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting zzso We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be zzso This permits an integrated view of zzso zzso their evolution, and zzso
