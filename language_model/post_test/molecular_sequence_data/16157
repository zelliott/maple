A single zzso gene is known to generate a variety of zzso zzso zzso that distinguish various cell lineages and stages of differentiation within the zzso zzso compartment of the zzso Systems zzso to zzso are known in rats and in zzso The complete zzso organization of the zzso gene is described in this zzso The zzso gene occupies about 120 zzso of zzso 1 and comprises 34 zzso of which 32 zzso to zzso are protein zzso zzso zzso and parts of zzso and zzso are zzso In all zzso clones zzso either zzso or zzso was represented, but not both, zzso that zzso and zzso in zzso zzso may be mutually zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso protection mapping were used to identify initiation zzso sites for zzso The finding of putative cap sites for zzso and zzso and of corresponding zzso zzso suggests the presence of two zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso clones the next zzso is zzso which has a zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso is unusually long, about 50 zzso Evidence is given that zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso is another alternative zzso that is selectively zzso alone or together with zzso or zzso or both, to generate actual or potential zzso zzso by alternative zzso
