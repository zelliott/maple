We have cloned a zzso zzso channel from zzso zzso lobe termed zzso Multiple overlapping zzso zzso clones differed from one another at specific positions by zzso zzso To test whether the zzso transitions were generated by zzso editing, we compared a 360 zzso zzso sequence with corresponding zzso sequences zzso zzso isolated from individual animals and lying on a single gene and zzso zzso sequences differed from zzso sequence at 17 positions, resulting in 28 unique zzso There was zzso an zzso in the zzso sequence and a zzso in the edited zzso zzso Two of the zzso altered the rates of channel closure and slow zzso These results extend selective zzso editing to zzso zzso and represents a novel mechanism for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
