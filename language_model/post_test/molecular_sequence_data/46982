zzso zzso zzso termed zzso are observed in a variety of zzso Four members of a gene family zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso have been zzso The regional expression and cellular zzso of the four zzso channel types in mouse brain was investigated using in zzso zzso The expression of zzso was restricted to the zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, zzso superior zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were found at high levels nearly zzso in the brain, and the strongest signals were seen in the zzso bulb, zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso was zzso expressed at very low levels throughout the zzso Finally, zzso transcripts were prominently expressed selectively in the zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso expressed two or more zzso channel transcripts including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low levels of zzso 4) and zzso relay zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that each zzso channel transcript has a unique distribution in the zzso Furthermore, they suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso may be, at least in part, due to the differential expression of zzso channel zzso
