zzso out of 120 zzso zzso zzso fish were found to be naturally infected with zzso zzso The infection appeared as clusters of zzso to zzso zzso being embedded within the zzso cartilage of the zzso organ of the zzso zzso studies indicate tissue distortion at the sites of zzso The continuous growth of the zzso led to deformation of the filament structure as well as disorganization and displacement of the zzso zzso Also, a severe zzso occurred in the zzso cartilage of the zzso and also in the zzso zzso Based on the structure and zzso of fresh spores by light zzso this zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso are oval in shape, and they measure 13 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso length by zzso It has two polar capsules inside, each measures 3 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso length by zzso Each polar capsule has a zzso coiled zzso zzso polar zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso were surrounded by zzso zzso The zzso cells and the early zzso stages were arranged at the periphery of the zzso while immature and mature spores were centrally zzso The zzso stages characterizing zzso zzso and zzso of the present zzso were zzso zzso The small zzso 18 S zzso zzso zzso gene sequences from different zzso was zzso and compared with the sequence of the same gene from the zzso zzso isolated from zzso The zzso position of the present zzso zzso within the zzso was determined using sequence analysis of all related zzso available in zzso and the zzso tree derived from this study is zzso and compared with the current zzso of the available zzso zzso of the zzso sequences and divergence showed that the zzso zzso gene of this zzso species revealed zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differing in 30 zzso with lower divergence zzso
