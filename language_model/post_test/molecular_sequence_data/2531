The zzso zzso zzso zzso chain locus on zzso zzso is zzso involved in zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso We have analyzed three acute zzso leukemia samples carrying a zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso cell hybrids and molecular zzso In all cases studied the zzso splits the zzso delta chain zzso zzso cell hybrids containing the human zzso zzso resulting from the zzso retain the human terminal zzso gene mapped at zzso and the diversity and joining, D delta zzso delta 1, regions of the zzso delta chain, but not the V alpha region zzso region of the zzso alpha zzso demonstrating that the split occurred within the V zzso delta 2 zzso zzso cloning of the zzso junctions revealed that the zzso delta chain sequences involved are made from the D delta 2 zzso The zzso zzso are clustered within a region of approximately 263 base pairs of zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso of the zzso delta chain locus to a locus on zzso which we have designated zzso results in deregulation of this putative zzso leading to acute zzso zzso
