To test whether the promoters of two zzso genes from zzso virus 3 were similar in zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso an zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso of 489 zzso zzso and have shown that the protein product of this gene is approximately 46 zzso The zzso and 3' ends of the transcripts from this zzso as determined by zzso bean zzso analysis, were zzso The promoter region was zzso upstream from a zzso zzso zzso zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso As with the previously zzso zzso virus 3 zzso gene zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells required zzso by a zzso zzso Although the promoter region of the gene zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso motifs similar to those of typical zzso zzso it showed no significant zzso to the zzso promoter, indicating that the zzso zzso expression of these two genes is not due to similar promoter zzso
