zzso a three-legged zzso composed of three zzso heavy chains zzso and three light chains zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso heavy chain in zzso were cloned and characterized for the first time in zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso including 29 zzso and 28 zzso and zzso encodes a zzso zzso including 28 zzso and 27 zzso The high similarities of gene structure, protein sequences and zzso models among zzso and zzso zzso and zzso suggest their similar functions in zzso zzso gene is predominantly expressed in zzso roots instead of ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso with a typical predicted salicylic acid zzso element and four predicted zzso elements zzso in the promoter sequence of zzso the expression of zzso instead of zzso in zzso roots is significantly zzso by zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso gene may be involved in the zzso signaling zzso in zzso defense zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso genes in zzso are zzso by zzso or cold treatment, further revealing the energy requirement of zzso and suggesting that zzso in plants is sensitive to low zzso
