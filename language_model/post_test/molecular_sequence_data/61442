We established stable human zzso zzso organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso and zzso from polarized pig kidney zzso zzso Human zzso was mainly localized in the plasma membrane of zzso and in the zzso membrane of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso C4 zzso into zzso membrane zzso was enhanced compared with empty zzso zzso zzso values in zzso membrane zzso were zzso zzso for zzso and 175 zzso for zzso Drug sensitivity to zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso Cellular zzso of zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso The zzso of zzso into zzso membrane zzso was inhibited by zzso administration of zzso or zzso but not that of zzso Moreover, this zzso was more enhanced in the presence of zzso These consequences indicate that drug resistance to zzso or zzso appears to be modulated by human zzso through transport of the agents, possibly in direct or indirect association with zzso
