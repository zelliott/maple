In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface are responsible for signal conversion and termination in zzso signaling by zzso zzso Here we present zzso and complex structures of the rat zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso including a high-resolution structure with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso binding modes shows how zzso engage the same zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso We find that this dual specificity is achieved at the expense of base zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that a zzso zzso water is replaced by the zzso product immediately after zzso zzso zzso base specificity for zzso in zzso is based on a different zzso base binding site for zzso zzso A comparison of the bacterial zzso in six independent crystal forms shows that zzso can undergo a domain closure motion of at least zzso
