The zzso nuclear basic proteins zzso from a sea zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and characterized for the first zzso They consist of two zzso members of the zzso zzso family with Mr zzso and zzso They amount to about zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso Their zzso acid composition and the primary structure of their zzso core indicate a strong relation to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of birds and zzso as well as to other high zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso distant zzso The major presence of zzso zzso protein in the zzso of an zzso belonging to such a low zzso group provides experimental support to the hypothesis that zzso may all have evolved from a primitive zzso zzso
