The study was aimed to explore the relationship between patterns of zzso or deletion and the development of acute zzso and further to clarify the possible mechanism in the development of adult acute zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was adopted to analyze zzso gene zzso or deletion patterns in 82 adult acute leukemia patients with different zzso and zzso The results indicated that rate of zzso gene zzso was zzso in 82 adult acute leukemia patients, among them, zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso It were found that zzso of de zzso zzso patients and zzso of relapsed zzso patients developed the zzso of zzso zzso Out of the 82 patients, 6 seemed to have deletion of zzso zzso including 1 zzso zzso and 5 ALL zzso There were no zzso or deletion of zzso gene in the 16 zzso It is concluded that zzso of zzso gene may play a more important role than zzso deletion of zzso gene in the zzso and progression of adult acute zzso
