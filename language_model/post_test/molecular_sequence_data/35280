A zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from the junction between the North Pacific Ocean and a freshwater spring at zzso island, South zzso zzso zzso was found to grow zzso at zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso zzso species, zzso consistently with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it exhibited zzso and zzso sequence similarity values, zzso zzso similarities to the type strains of the other recognized zzso species were zzso zzso zzso was found to contain zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso one unidentified zzso and one unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was determined to be zzso and its mean zzso zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 19 and zzso zzso The differential zzso properties, together with the zzso and genetic zzso revealed that strain zzso is separated from other zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is proposed to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
