zzso C2 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso formation by competing with zzso for the binding of zzso The zzso zzso of the first zzso domain zzso has a strong zzso with a sequence in the zzso chain, which is responsible for the binding of zzso Since the zzso and alternative zzso (AP) zzso zzso have many functional and structural similarities, we further investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso The factor zzso zzso of factor B zzso was blocked by zzso By zzso and zzso zzso was shown to bind zzso zzso had no zzso activity on the zzso complex as compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso to FB did not interfere with the assembly of zzso zzso In a zzso zzso using zzso serum, zzso zzso with zzso complement zzso
