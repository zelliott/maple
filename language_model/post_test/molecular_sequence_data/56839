zzso zzso A zzso is known to show a circular zzso zzso spectrum suggestive of substantial secondary zzso Thus, zzso may be a molten zzso form of zzso zzso We find that any secondary structure present in zzso does not provide measurable protection against zzso zzso exchange, and zzso does not belong to the class of structured molten zzso CD zzso of short peptides show that the zzso zzso affects these zzso in a way that could be mistaken for secondary structure zzso thus, caution must be used in interpreting CD zzso of peptides and proteins taken in zzso zzso
