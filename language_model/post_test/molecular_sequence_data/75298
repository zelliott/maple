The structural organization of the entire rat zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene was determined by analysis of overlapping zzso clones isolated from a rat zzso library using the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These clones together span 30 zzso of rat zzso DNA, with the rat zzso zzso gene lying in the zzso The zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso long and contains three zzso interrupted by two zzso The first zzso contains almost the entire zzso untranslated zzso The second zzso codes for the zzso site I, the third zzso codes for site II and the 3' untranslated zzso Therefore each of the zzso zzso is zzso by single, separate zzso The zzso initiation site was identified by zzso zzso mapping and primer zzso A consensus sequence zzso is localized 31 zzso upstream from the cap site and the zzso lies upstream from the zzso zzso Single zzso and zzso repeats are present in the second zzso together with an zzso zzso zzso elements are present 5 zzso upstream from the cap site and in the 3' zzso zzso zzso of the known rat zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso is more closely related to the zzso protein than to the zzso zzso There is no evidence to indicate that zzso zzso has arisen from the zzso zzso
