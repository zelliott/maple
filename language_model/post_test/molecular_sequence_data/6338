zzso derivatives of horse zzso c zzso modified at each of 18 different zzso zzso groups have been prepared using zzso and zzso to zzso by zzso liquid zzso These derivatives were characterized by determination of: zzso the location of the zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso visible and zzso zzso and by zzso measurement of electron transfer activity with zzso zzso No significant changes in structure were zzso except for the zzso forms of the derivatives modified at zzso 72, 73, and 79 which are discussed zzso The electron transfer activity of the zzso zzso c with bovine heart zzso zzso was decreased to zzso dependent on the position of the zzso zzso a secondary modification which reverses the charge change, restored the electron transfer rate to that observed with the unmodified zzso zzso irrespective of the location of the primary zzso These results afford a direct experimental demonstration that zzso in zzso with zzso electron transfer partners resulting from modifications which cause a change of the charge of surface side chains are solely due to the zzso zzso Of the many chemically modified zzso c prepared to date, the zzso zzso zzso zzso c are likely to be particularly useful as the zzso allows zzso linkage of any zzso zzso to a zzso location on the protein surface by a simple zzso even when the secondary modifier is relatively zzso a crucial advantage not otherwise readily zzso
