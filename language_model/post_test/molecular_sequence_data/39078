We identified the zzso trio zzso which encodes a zzso family protein carrying two zzso zzso zzso zzso each of which potentially activates zzso family zzso Trio was distributed along zzso in the central nervous system zzso of zzso and was strongly expressed in zzso of brain regions, including the mushroom body zzso zzso trio zzso resulted in the zzso or stall of zzso in zzso and also caused zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso were attributed to zzso in the intrinsic nature of zzso as revealed by zzso zzso Thus, Trio is essential in order for zzso to faithfully extend on the correct zzso In addition, the zzso of Trio in the adult brain suggests its zzso role in zzso zzso
