We report novel zzso binding zzso zzso surface zzso that permit plasma zzso zzso efficiency zzso determination by zzso zzso without the use of liquid zzso or internal standards such as chemical or zzso zzso Two model zzso were constructed on zzso zzso zzso zzso and used to evaluate the clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso in zzso The SAM zzso were designed to improve zzso efficiency by zzso of zzso zzso of abundant proteins present at zzso the concentration of the zzso zzso In the first zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was performed with zzso enrichment of the reaction zzso and product to SAM zzso The second zzso examined zzso zzso via a surface zzso zzso where different zzso were zzso immobilized to the SAM at controlled surface density for zzso zzso zzso The results show the zzso zzso zzso platforms provide limits of zzso to zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso h analysis time, a zzso improvement over other zzso zzso zzso Implementation of a zzso zzso zzso provided good zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability permitted zzso determination without internal standards with observed values zzso improved versus conventional zzso zzso Application of the zzso to 12 clinical plasma samples demonstrated zzso for clinical zzso Overall, this work demonstrates that rationally designed surface zzso for zzso zzso may serve as an alternative, zzso methodology with potential for a wide range of biotechnology applications related to targeted zzso molecular zzso
