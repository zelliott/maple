Faithful transmission of genetic information depends on accurate zzso segregation as cells exit from zzso and errors in zzso segregation are catastrophic and may lead to zzso which is the hallmark of zzso In zzso an elaborate molecular control system ensures proper orchestration of events at zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso is a major control mechanism for cellular proliferation and the activities of protein zzso zzso and zzso must be zzso Although zzso zzso are well zzso zzso involved in zzso remain largely zzso Here we identify a novel zzso of mouse protein zzso zzso containing domain 1 zzso that we named zzso zzso is a zzso related zzso zzso Our newly identified zzso shared a significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso and other zzso family of zzso By zzso zzso zzso was found to be enriched in the zzso and nuclear zzso with zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso zzso was zzso regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner with zzso abundance during zzso followed by nuclear zzso during zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso exit with decreased levels of some zzso zzso Moreover, zzso failed to zzso with the zzso marker zzso suggesting it as a zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso appears a zzso zzso of zzso with probable zzso zzso The identification of this new zzso suggests the existence of an interacting zzso network that controls zzso zzso and provides new drug targets for zzso zzso
