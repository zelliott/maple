A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a seawater sample collected from the Arctic zzso zzso growth of strain zzso was observed at 25 zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was closely related to zzso algae zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the new isolate and zzso algae and zzso zzso was far lower than zzso which indicated that strain zzso is a novel zzso species of the zzso zzso The major fatty acids zzso were zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso as the respiratory zzso and zzso unknown zzso and unknown polar lipids as polar zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analyses and differential zzso zzso it is suggested that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso be assigned to the zzso zzso as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
