On zzso zzso one important mechanism to generate pain signals is the zzso of zzso zzso which are membrane proteins gated by zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso receptors rapidly zzso and then recover zzso One unique property of zzso receptors is the recovery acceleration by zzso zzso that can play the role of the zzso of zzso function only when zzso receptors are zzso To study zzso charged sites potentially responsible for this action of zzso we zzso 15 zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso and expressed such zzso receptors in human embryonic kidney cells studied with patch zzso Unlike most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso very slowly, indicating that this zzso is important for generating zzso Recovery appeared structurally distinct from zzso because zzso and zzso had a much faster recovery and zzso and zzso had a much slower one despite their standard zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso or zzso zzso showed lessened sensitivity to the action of zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso were important for the effect of this zzso on zzso zzso This study is the first report identifying several negative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso contributing to the general process of zzso zzso At least one zzso was important to enable the development of rapid zzso whereas others controlled recovery from it or the zzso action of zzso Thus, these findings outline diverse potential molecular targets to zzso zzso zzso function in relation to its functional zzso
