The aim of this study was to investigate zzso zzso methods to distinguish 27 zzso zzso zzso from zzso in South zzso The zzso zzso sequences of the 27 zzso zzso zzso showed zzso similarities to each other and to reference sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso gene sequences of 25 of the 27 zzso zzso zzso were zzso identical to each other, and these sequences were also zzso identical to reference sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were used for a zzso sequence typing zzso and a zzso sequence typing zzso among zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso seven genes showed higher genetic divergence patterns, and the zzso were separated into three distinct groups in zzso zzso
