zzso gel zzso followed by zzso laser zzso of flight zzso mass zzso zzso is a commonly used protein profiling zzso However, observed changes can be explained in multiple ways, one of which is by the protein turnover zzso In order to easily and rapidly obtain information on both the identity and turnover of individual zzso we applied a combination of protein labeling with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While the spectrum reveals the identity of a zzso mass zzso analysis provides information about the rate of protein labeling as a measure of synthesis or zzso Using this approach on mature zzso zzso we were able to discriminate between rapidly and slowly zzso zzso In our zzso proteins of the zzso appeared to be slowly zzso whereas components of the zzso zzso in particular collagen type I alpha 1 zzso and collagen type I alpha 2 zzso showed rapid zzso of newly zzso zzso Both proteins appeared to be zzso in the same ratio as they are present in collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, functionally related proteins were also readily zzso Taken together, we have shown that a combination of stable isotope labeling and protein profiling by gel zzso and zzso analysis can simultaneously provide information on the identity and relative zzso rate of proteins in zzso cells in a simple, zzso and zzso zzso
