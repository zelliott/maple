The zzso cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from a patient, zzso zzso This was the first successful attempt to zzso zzso cells in zzso The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of zzso cells resulted in its broad zzso intentionally and through widespread zzso for the past zzso it has served a role analogous to that of a model zzso The cumulative impact of the zzso cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than zzso zzso abstracts zzso zzso The zzso architecture of zzso remains largely unexplored beyond its zzso partly because like many zzso its extensive zzso renders such analyses zzso We carried out zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso strain, examined zzso and zzso variations, mapped zzso variations and loss of zzso regions, and phased zzso across full zzso zzso We also investigated variation and zzso profiles for zzso zzso and eight additional zzso We find that zzso is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with few new zzso accumulating after early zzso zzso resolution facilitated reconstruction of an zzso highly rearranged region of zzso zzso at which integration of the human zzso virus type 18 zzso zzso occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated zzso We combined these maps with zzso and zzso Project data sets to phase the zzso zzso This revealed strong, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the integrated zzso zzso approximately zzso upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and zzso These data provide an extensively zzso high-quality reference zzso for past and future experiments relying on zzso and demonstrate the value of zzso resolution for characterizing cancer zzso and zzso
