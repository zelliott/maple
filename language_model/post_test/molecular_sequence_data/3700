zzso reactions to fish zzso represent one of the most frequent causes of food zzso We have constructed an expression zzso library from carp zzso zzso muscle in zzso zzso zzso and used serum zzso from a fish allergic patient to isolate 33 zzso clones that coded for two zzso zzso zzso c zzso and zzso c zzso with comparable zzso binding zzso Both zzso represented zzso proteins that belonged to the zzso of zzso The zzso c zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli, and zzso c zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis and mass zzso showed that zzso c zzso represented a folded protein with mainly zzso secondary structure and a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso reacted with zzso from all zzso patients tested zzso zzso zzso induced specific and zzso zzso zzso release, and contained most of the zzso zzso zzso present in natural zzso extracts from cod, tuna, and zzso zzso it may be used to identify patients suffering from zzso fish zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso c zzso is indicated by our findings that rabbit zzso raised against zzso c zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso zzso 25) in zzso patients to zzso c zzso between 35 and zzso zzso mean zzso and that depletion of calcium strongly reduced zzso recognition of zzso c zzso The latter results suggest that it will be possible to develop strategies for zzso for fish zzso that are based on zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso
