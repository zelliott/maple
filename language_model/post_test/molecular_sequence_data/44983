zzso transport of zzso acids is a key zzso of zzso flow in zzso liver and is associated with cholesterol zzso zzso formation, and numerous inherited and acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso enriched fraction zzso from zzso zzso also exhibit zzso zzso acid zzso zzso transport of zzso acids by the zzso fraction was independent of the zzso zzso zzso responded to changes in the zzso sensitive zzso space, and was zzso exhibiting a zzso of 63 zzso for zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso gene was isolated from zzso DNA by zzso chain reaction amplification using zzso zzso zzso to zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid transport was abolished when the zzso coding region was deleted from the zzso and restored upon zzso of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicts that zzso is an zzso protein zzso zzso acids in zzso similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso proteins of unknown zzso Information obtained from the zzso zzso gene may aid identification of the gene zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso
