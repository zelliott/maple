The skeleton of zzso is built of zzso consisting of zzso Using the zzso system from zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso are zzso at the surface of growing zzso as well as in the zzso filament located in the zzso zzso It is assumed that these two zzso are responsible for the deposition of zzso In search of additional potential structural molecules that might guide the zzso process during zzso to zzso zzso electron microscopic studies with zzso against zzso and zzso were zzso These studies showed that zzso forms a complex with zzso the zzso of this complex are intimately associated with the surface of the zzso and arranged zzso around zzso zzso fibers are near the zzso zzso The zzso formed from zzso display a lower degree of orientation than the collagen fibers arranged in a highly ordered pattern around the zzso These data indicate that zzso formation of zzso involves a network of zzso regulatory zzso controlling zzso zzso zzso this zzso process proceeds on a zzso organic zzso
