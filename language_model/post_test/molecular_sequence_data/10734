zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso first identified as a protein stored in specific zzso of the human zzso The protein is believed to bind small zzso substances such as bacterial derived zzso and zzso zzso and might function as a zzso of zzso To characterize the regulation of zzso further, we have cloned and zzso a zzso region of the zzso gene including zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region and a zzso coding region encompassing seven zzso and six zzso The zzso start sites were identified by an zzso protection zzso The zzso gene is highly zzso to the mouse gene zzso zzso was expressed in bone zzso and in zzso that are prone to exposure to zzso Potential zzso elements were identified in the promoter region of the zzso gene by computer analysis and include binding sites for zzso the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso and the zzso factor zzso zzso
