Flowers zzso zzso are short, specialized axes bearing closely zzso zzso They are typical for seed plants zzso and are prominent in flowering plants zzso zzso zzso where they often comprise an attractive zzso There is evidence that zzso evolved from zzso plants with a zzso mode of reproduction called zzso It seems zzso therefore, that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the exact mode and molecular basis of early seed and flower evolution is not yet zzso Comparing flower zzso control genes to their zzso from lower plants that do not flower may help to clarify the zzso We have isolated and characterized zzso genes expressed in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The data indicate that at least two different zzso genes zzso to floral zzso genes existed in the last common zzso of contemporary vascular plants, some descendants of which underwent multiple zzso and zzso and were recruited into novel zzso networks during the evolution of floral zzso
