The gene for the zzso zzso of cellulose zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned by using an zzso probe designed from the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso (an 83 zzso zzso of the cellulose zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso The gene was located on a zzso zzso zzso III zzso of zzso zzso DNA that was cloned in the zzso zzso DNA sequencing of approximately 3 zzso of the zzso III zzso led to the identification of an open reading frame of zzso base pairs coding for a zzso of 80 zzso Fifteen zzso acids in the zzso region zzso 6 to zzso of the zzso acid zzso deduced from the DNA zzso match with the zzso zzso acid sequence obtained for the 83 zzso zzso confirming that the DNA sequence cloned codes for the zzso zzso of cellulose zzso which transfers zzso from zzso to the growing zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso during zzso of the 83 zzso zzso zzso the first 5 zzso acids at the zzso end of this zzso as observed from the deduced zzso acid zzso and also from sequencing of the 83 zzso zzso zzso from zzso that were not treated with zzso zzso analysis suggests that the cellulose zzso zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein with 6 zzso zzso There is no signal sequence and it is zzso that the protein is anchored in the membrane at the zzso end by a single zzso zzso Two potential zzso sites are predicted from the sequence analysis, and this is in agreement with the earlier observations that the 83 zzso zzso is a zzso The cloned gene is zzso among a number of zzso zzso zzso as determined by Southern zzso
