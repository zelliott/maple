zzso zzso coli frequently expresses zzso which bind to Gal alpha zzso receptors present on the zzso zzso of these zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and not by the major zzso which constitutes the bulk of the zzso zzso The zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in only a few copies each at the zzso zzso Surface exposure of both zzso and zzso is required to achieve zzso zzso The zzso sequences for the genes zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were determined for two zzso coli clones expressing P zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and compared with the corresponding sequences established for proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the zzso between the zzso tip proteins and the equivalent proteins in zzso and zzso zzso We present data showing that, like the major zzso zzso zzso varies its structure and zzso properties among zzso of different zzso In contrast, the zzso protein was highly zzso and zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso with the zzso proteins of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein from zzso and zzso zzso differed by only five zzso acids out of zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso showed only zzso zzso acid zzso with the other two zzso
