We examined the amount and nature of variation revealed by zzso zzso zzso markers in Norway spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso using 39 pairs of zzso zzso that were based upon arbitrary genes in black spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso A panel of 22 diverse Norway spruce zzso was screened for variation that could be observed directly using standard zzso gel zzso without additional manipulation of amplification zzso zzso of marker segregation among zzso zzso revealed that nine markers behaved in a zzso manner, two markers had zzso length zzso and zzso zzso and four others had dominant length zzso DNA sequencing of zzso zzso at seven zzso indicated that most zzso zzso were in zzso regions and that zzso often differed by the presence or absence of direct repeats that ranged in size from three to 23 zzso The nine markers that showed exclusively zzso zzso in Norway spruce had an average observed zzso of zzso and an average of zzso zzso in the panel of 22 zzso These levels of variation are similar to those previously found for similar sets of markers in other zzso and appear to be at least as high as those revealed by zzso zzso markers in Norway zzso zzso at one zzso locus suggested a higher affinity between Norway spruce and white spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso than between either of these zzso and black zzso The zzso markers described in this report should be useful in a variety of applications in Norway zzso including population studies and zzso zzso
