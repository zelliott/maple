The gypsy zzso mobile element of zzso contains two closely spaced regions which bind proteins from nuclear zzso One of these is an imperfect zzso having zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso the other contains a reiterated sequence zzso zzso zzso to the zzso that is the core of many enhancers and upstream promoter zzso zzso expression of deletion zzso has shown that these DNA regions are negative and positive regulators of zzso As was demonstrated earlier by other authors, zzso induced by the presence of gypsy in different zzso are suppressed zzso to either repression or zzso of gypsy zzso in zzso strains carrying zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso We have shown that binding to a negative regulator zzso is weakened in nuclear extracts isolated from fly stocks carrying zzso zzso which activate gypsy zzso therefore the zzso gene seems to code for a protein capable of gypsy zzso Furthermore, binding to a positive regulator is weakened in nuclear extracts isolated from fly stocks carrying zzso gene zzso which decrease the level of gypsy zzso therefore, the zzso gene most likely encodes a protein which activates gypsy zzso
