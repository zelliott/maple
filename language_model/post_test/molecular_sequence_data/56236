A zzso zzso zzso h gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso (called zzso was isolated using zzso zzso zzso zzso and represents the first zzso h gene isolated from a higher zzso It encodes a zzso of 118 zzso acids with the zzso zzso active site zzso This gene comprises two zzso which have lengths of 1071 and 147 zzso respectively, and three zzso which zzso peptides of 29, 41 and 48 zzso zzso zzso This zzso h shows zzso identity with the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso and only around zzso with the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso do not have any signal peptides and are most probably zzso Using the 3' regions of the zzso two zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Southern zzso analysis shows that zzso sequences are present in only two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso and a zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso Analysis of the ancestors of the zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but that zzso zzso is absent from both putative zzso Thus, the zzso zzso gene has probably been recently introduced in to zzso zzso as a gene of zzso importance, or linked to such zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that both genes are expressed in zzso zzso mostly in zzso or zzso that contain growing zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
