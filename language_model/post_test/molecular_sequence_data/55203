Ginger zzso zzso zzso is prone to zzso under intense zzso zzso light can be dissipated by the zzso cycle, where zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus from the damage of excessive zzso We isolated zzso of ginger zzso zzso gene promoter, which contained the zzso box, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated the zzso promoter was active in almost all zzso especially green zzso zzso zzso activity driven by zzso promoter was zzso rather than activated by high zzso zzso activity was altered by hormones, growth regulators and zzso zzso which increased with zzso acid and decreased with zzso acid, salicylic acid, zzso salt zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso activities with zzso or zzso acid increased in the short-term zzso and decreased in the long-term zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso flank deletion found two crucial functional regions residing in zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis found zzso to be regulated by the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found a region necessary for regulating the zzso rhythm and another for the basic promoter zzso Key message A novel promoter, named zzso promoter, was first isolated and analyzed in this zzso We have determined one region crucial for promoter activity and another responsible for keeping zzso zzso
