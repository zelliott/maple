zzso zzso in the zzso density zzso of zzso is zzso by scaffolding proteins such as zzso and Shank, which ensure proper function of receptors at the zzso The zzso family of scaffolding proteins contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and have been implicated in the zzso of many zzso proteins including zzso receptors in zzso We have identified and characterized zzso the only zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene shows approximately zzso identity over 1000 zzso acids to rat zzso zzso protein is localized in various zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppression of zzso did not cause zzso or zzso zzso However, suppression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which has a defective zzso zzso zzso resulted in animals with altered zzso zzso Our data suggest a possible role of zzso in affecting function of zzso receptors in zzso zzso
