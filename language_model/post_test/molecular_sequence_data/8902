Ariel is a mouse zzso that suffers from skeletal muscle zzso zzso due to the rapid zzso of large zzso protein zzso This zzso disease is caused by an zzso zzso zzso resulting in an zzso change within the motor domain of the skeletal muscle zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Although normal at birth, zzso mice develop zzso paralysis from Day 13, consistent with the timing of the switch from zzso to adult zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso Notwithstanding the speed of the process, zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed the presence of proteins typically found in human zzso zzso suggesting that the genesis of zzso zzso follows a zzso zzso shared with other zzso protein diseases of skeletal zzso In contrast, zzso mice are overtly and zzso indistinguishable from control zzso zzso is present in muscles from zzso mice at only zzso of the levels of the zzso zzso resulting in a small but significant increase in force production in isolated single zzso and indicating that elimination of the zzso protein in zzso prevents the pathological changes observed in zzso zzso of the zzso change in the functional equivalent of mouse zzso in human muscles, zzso results in a more zzso zzso
