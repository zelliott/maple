We have isolated and characterized an zzso of protein zzso zzso gene from rat liver and a rat liver zzso library by zzso amplification of zzso zzso The gene zzso contains the zzso region of the zzso zzso but the zzso is derived from a sequence in the zzso of zzso preceding the zzso domain by differential zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso gene is absent in this zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso analyses indicated that zzso was specifically expressed only in rat liver, and its expression increased with liver zzso zzso of zzso was found to be reduced in three rat zzso cell lines zzso A promoter trap experiment suggested that a promoter was located in the zzso preceding the zzso domain of zzso and zzso from this novel promoter generated the new zzso zzso zzso of zzso Thus zzso was generated by both alternate promoter usage and differential zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso at zzso in zzso and its equivalent site in zzso zzso a role for zzso zzso in the zzso of both zzso We demonstrated the interaction between the zzso domain of zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and pull-down zzso In contrast to the effect of zzso zzso was found to decrease the zzso function of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso abolished this zzso These results suggest that zzso may serve as a dominant negative competitor of zzso as suggested zzso
