The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently used in the zzso of zzso fusion proteins because of its efficiency and high zzso In this work, we present a new zzso form of zzso termed zzso zzso for high-level production and zzso of zzso zzso from zzso coli and compare it to the zzso zzso zzso version of zzso The effects of varying the host strain, the bacterial induction temperature zzso 30 and zzso and the zzso zzso concentration on production and zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression were obtained in the zzso coli zzso strain under an induction temperature of zzso in the presence of zzso at zzso zzso In these conditions, soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso accounted for about zzso and zzso of total soluble zzso zzso About zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to near zzso zzso zzso via a simple, single step zzso zzso zzso protocol based on the presence of zzso zzso The higher production of zzso zzso coupled to its zzso and zzso efficiencies make it an attractive alternate to zzso
