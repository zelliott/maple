Certain zzso transport proteins similar to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso have been identified by zzso searches from available zzso zzso These proteins exhibit conservation of zzso acid zzso that participate in sugar binding and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso based on the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence similarities reveals a common overall fold for sugar zzso belonging to the Major zzso zzso zzso and suggest new targets for zzso zzso searches for sequence similarities also identify zzso proteins bearing striking resemblance to MFS sugar zzso Like zzso the zzso proteins are predicted to have 12 zzso zzso zzso and many of the irreplaceable zzso for sugar binding and zzso zzso in zzso appear to be largely zzso The overall size of the zzso zzso is about twice that of zzso zzso with longer N and C zzso and zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The human gene zzso protein zzso consists of six zzso located on more than 60,000 zzso of DNA sequences and requires zzso to produce mature zzso Cellular zzso predictions suggest membrane zzso with possible zzso at the N zzso and expression studies with the human protein zzso demonstrate membrane zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso sugar transport candidates suggests an important role in cellular zzso particularly in brain and zzso zzso is observed in the zzso of both the zzso and zzso proteins that contain zzso involved in sugar binding and zzso zzso in zzso
