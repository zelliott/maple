zzso have been raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to different parts of the zzso zzso These zzso stain different kinds of zzso zzso in the zzso formation in zzso disease, suggesting the existence of different states of zzso and/or folding of zzso zzso An zzso directed against the middle region of zzso stained mostly zzso plaques without cores, whereas an zzso directed against the zzso region of zzso stained only zzso plaques with zzso An zzso directed against the zzso zzso of zzso stained numerous zzso cells and bodies, as well as the zzso component of plaques and zzso zzso These zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso were used to demonstrate a close spatial relationship between zzso deposits and zzso zzso
