zzso is used to partially alleviate the effects of surgically induced global zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this zzso remain to be zzso To improve the understanding of the molecular processes modulating the effects of global zzso and the zzso afforded by zzso we constructed rabbit heart zzso libraries and isolated, zzso and identified a compendium of zzso zzso for use in zzso and zzso zzso New Zealand White rabbits were used to compare the effects of global zzso and zzso compared with control zzso zzso The effects of zzso and protein synthesis on the zzso afforded by zzso were investigated separately by zzso with either zzso or zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso partially ameliorates the effects of global zzso and that the zzso is modulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso enrichment analyses indicated that global zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso function and energy production, zzso zzso and the generation of precursor zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso significantly increased zzso expressed zzso associated with the zzso and zzso function and significantly zzso the biological processes of muscle contraction, zzso muscle contraction, zzso acid and fatty acid zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso
