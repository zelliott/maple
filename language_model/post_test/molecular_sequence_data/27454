zzso parallel sequencing has reduced the cost and increased the zzso of zzso sequencing by more than three orders of zzso and it seems likely that costs will fall and zzso improve even more in the next few zzso Clinical use of zzso parallel sequencing will provide a way to identify the cause of many diseases of unknown zzso through simultaneous screening of thousands of zzso for zzso zzso and by sequencing biological specimens for the zzso signatures of novel infectious zzso In addition to providing these entirely new diagnostic capabilities, zzso parallel sequencing may also replace zzso and zzso sequencing in clinical applications where they are currently being zzso zzso clinical use of zzso parallel sequencing will require higher zzso better ways to select zzso zzso of interest, and improvements in the zzso speed, and ease of use of data analysis zzso In addition, substantial enhancements in laboratory computer infrastructure, data storage, and data transfer capacity will be needed to handle the extremely large data sets zzso zzso and laboratory personnel will require training to use the sequence data zzso and appropriate methods will need to be developed to deal with the incidental discovery of zzso zzso and zzso of uncertain clinical zzso zzso parallel sequencing has the potential to transform the practice of medical zzso and related fields, but the vast amount of personal zzso data produced will increase the responsibility of zzso to ensure that the information obtained is used in a medically and socially responsible zzso
