A series of competitive, zzso zzso zzso zzso based on an zzso acid scaffold have been developed and biologically zzso The lead compound in the series, zzso zzso demonstrates competitive zzso of zzso functional responses through B2 receptors in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso is a specific for the zzso B2 zzso it is inactive at both the B1 and B2 zzso zzso In conscious guinea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but does not zzso a similar response to zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso display a zzso zzso relationship, strongly suggesting binding in a specific manner to the B2 zzso zzso data suggest that a zzso binding pocket that prefers large aromatic groups in a specific zzso orientation exists in the zzso zzso binding zzso This class of zzso zzso zzso zzso may lead to the design of other compounds with enhanced zzso affinity and optimal in zzso biological zzso
