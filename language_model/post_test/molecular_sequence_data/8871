Despite the long history of cocaine use among humans and its social and economic significance today, little information is available about the zzso and molecular aspects of cocaine zzso in zzso zzso zzso in comparison to what is known about the formation of other zzso zzso zzso in species of the zzso In this work, we investigated the site of cocaine zzso in zzso zzso and the nature of the first zzso The two principal zzso zzso of zzso zzso cocaine and zzso cocaine, were present in highest zzso in buds and rolled zzso These are also the zzso in which the rate of zzso zzso was the highest based on the incorporation of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in the zzso are zzso in the roots and zzso to the zzso A collection of zzso sequences from a zzso library made from young zzso zzso leaves was employed to search for genes zzso the first step in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were identified zzso two candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activities of the corresponding proteins confirmed by zzso expression in zzso coli and zzso of a zzso zzso The transcript levels of both zzso and zzso genes were highest in buds and rolled leaves and lower in other zzso The levels of both zzso and zzso themselves showed a similar pattern, so it was not possible to assign a preferential role in cocaine zzso to one of these zzso
