zzso at the ends of linear zzso zzso important for integration define the viral DNA attachment zzso zzso Whereas zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso important for replication in T zzso have been extensively zzso regions of the zzso site important for viral spread have not been thoroughly zzso Previous zzso zzso of zzso complexes isolated from infected cells revealed enhanced regions of zzso zzso zzso near the ends of zzso zzso in the regions of the zzso zzso Here, we identified the zzso zzso sequences zzso during in zzso zzso and used this zzso information together with results of previous work to construct and characterize 24 zzso site zzso zzso We found that although zzso zzso sequences contributed to zzso zzso the identities of these bases were not critical for zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso CA zzso located at the ends of zzso contributed significantly to virus replication and zzso zzso containing one intact CA end displayed delays in peak virus growth compared to the wild zzso In contrast, double zzso viruses lacking both zzso were replication zzso The A of the CA appeared to be the most critical zzso of integration, because two different zzso zzso viruses containing the substitution of zzso for CA partially reverted by changing the G back to zzso We also identified a zzso deletion zzso in which the CA played a crucial role in reverse zzso
