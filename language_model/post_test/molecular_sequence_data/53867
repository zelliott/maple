In cells of the zzso zzso zzso the existence of an zzso protein zzso gene consisting of 285 zzso was confirmed by Southern analysis that zzso DNA of zzso zzso could zzso with the zzso of mature zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Except for the absence of two zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso gene was identical to that of the zzso gene of zzso zzso in positions zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene could not be transcribed into its zzso in zzso zzso cells as examined by zzso using total zzso of zzso zzso as zzso Furthermore, zzso could not be detected either directly from the culture medium of zzso zzso or by Western zzso However, the zzso gene could be actively expressed like the zzso of zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso exhibited similar zzso activity as native zzso
