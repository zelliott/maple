The zzso zzso exporter zzso zzso resistance to a wide range of structurally dissimilar zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the functional importance of zzso segment 10, which is thought to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in which 35 zzso acid zzso in the putative zzso zzso and its zzso regions were replaced in turn with zzso zzso accessibility analysis of the introduced zzso zzso using zzso zzso indicated that zzso segment 10 of zzso contains a zzso zzso core and may extend from zzso to zzso zzso analysis and zzso transport zzso of these zzso showed that zzso is important for the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is only important for the zzso of zzso zzso and probably forms part of the zzso zzso zzso together with zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso treatment on zzso and zzso export zzso by the zzso zzso suggest that the face of zzso segment 10 that contains zzso may also be close to the zzso zzso zzso making this zzso an integral component of the zzso zzso zzso
