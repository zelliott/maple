To study the DNA zzso events in normal and cloned rabbit zzso we investigated the zzso status of a satellite sequence and the promoter region of a zzso gene using zzso zzso During normal rabbit zzso development, both sequences maintained zzso status until the 8- to zzso stage when progressive zzso took zzso In cloned zzso the zzso gene promoter sequence was rapidly zzso and zzso de zzso zzso while the satellite sequence maintained the zzso zzso status in all examined zzso Our results indicate that unique sequences as well as satellite sequences may have zzso zzso patterns in cloned zzso
