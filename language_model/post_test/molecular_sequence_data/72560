Among zzso zzso and viral zzso the zzso from zzso zzso has the unique property of zzso zzso acids linked to the internal zzso of zzso In this study, we examined the ability to cleave the internal zzso acids of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso from several bacterial and zzso origins, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso could liberate the zzso acid of zzso at the highest rate, and was the only zzso which could cleave zzso zzso among the zzso zzso The zzso zzso derived from the culture medium of zzso zzso was comprised of four zzso with different molecular weights and zzso points, the zzso that zzso zzso zzso being L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not S zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed the highest specific activity toward zzso acid among the four zzso
