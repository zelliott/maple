We report the analysis of a zzso case of zzso zzso that is a compound zzso for two zzso located within the metal zzso dependent zzso site zzso of the zzso zzso The patient inherited a maternal zzso carrying the zzso substitution and a paternal zzso that changes zzso to zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso 1 zzso showed that the zzso zzso complex in the patient was mostly accounted for by the zzso zzso zzso that does not bind to zzso zzso The patient showed zzso binding of zzso to zzso but neither binding to zzso nor cell zzso could be zzso most likely due to the minute expression zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso showed a diminished surface expression of zzso enhanced zzso to immobilized zzso and spontaneous zzso in the presence of soluble zzso suggesting that zzso may zzso zzso activity to the zzso zzso A distinct feature of these cells is the failure of zzso to enhance the binding to soluble zzso and the formation of cell zzso The substitution of zzso by either a polar or a positively charged zzso acid restored the surface exposure and function of the zzso receptors whereas a zzso charged zzso did zzso
