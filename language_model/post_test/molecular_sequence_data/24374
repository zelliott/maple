zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso is involved in several steps of gene expression zzso zzso zzso virus, a member of the zzso is the primary cause of illnesses such as dengue fever, dengue zzso fever, and dengue shock zzso In mature DEN virus zzso the core protein is a structural protein that forms a zzso complex with zzso zzso Very little of its zzso functions is zzso Here, using an in zzso binding zzso and zzso analysis, we report a zzso interaction between the DEN virus core protein and zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the DEN virus core zzso spanning zzso acid zzso 73 to 100, is required for such zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding zzso indicated that the core zzso K interaction might be abolished in the presence of zzso K zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in a zzso experiment, the repressive effect of zzso K on zzso zzso zzso could be reversed by full-length DEN virus core protein but not by a truncated form containing zzso acids zzso Our results suggest that, on DEN virus infection, the multiple functions of cellular zzso K may be affected by the virus core zzso
