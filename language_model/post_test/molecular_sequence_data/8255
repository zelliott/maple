zzso molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso and zzso complexes of zzso zzso protein are performed in zzso environment for 500 zzso using the zzso force zzso The zzso structures are mutually compared as well as to the X-ray structures zzso zzso zzso de Vos, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Kim, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso The simulations show areas of flexibility, with zzso from the original zzso The parts that show differences between the two zzso forms are those from zzso 12 to 17, 25 to 38, 41 to 51, 57 to 73, 99 to zzso and 120 to 152, zzso with areas of zzso Some of these areas also show differences between the X-ray structures and are part of zzso on the surface of the zzso Many of the zzso in the ends of these zzso undergo zzso transitions during the zzso zzso Of all the zzso transitions observed, zzso occur around the ends of these zzso This suggests that the ends of the areas from 12 to 17, 25 to 38, and 57 to 73 are the hinge points of the zzso transition between the zzso and the zzso zzso The study of the zzso interactions in the solution forms shows that zzso 29, 30, and 35 establish contacts with the zzso and the sugar ring of the zzso and thus these contacts could be proposed as the possible levers of the zzso transition that accompanies zzso zzso
