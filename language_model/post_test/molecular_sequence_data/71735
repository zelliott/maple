zzso zzso zzso and fusion are zzso by the assembly of a stable zzso core complex of zzso which include the synaptic zzso membrane protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso We have now identified another zzso zzso called zzso zzso was enriched in zzso and exclusively located on synaptic zzso zzso It associated with the zzso complex through direct interaction with zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso blocked the association of the zzso complex with zzso Introduction of zzso and peptides containing the zzso binding sequence into zzso superior cervical zzso zzso in culture zzso inhibited synaptic zzso These results suggest that zzso is an important component of the neurotransmitter release process through its zzso of the sequential interactions between the zzso and zzso
