A large number of familial zzso disease zzso zzso were examined to determine whether zzso in the zzso precursor protein zzso gene could be responsible for the zzso Previous studies have identified three zzso at zzso zzso zzso which are zzso for zzso disease zzso zzso from affected subjects were examined for zzso in zzso 16 and 17 of the zzso zzso A combination of direct sequencing and zzso zzso zzso analysis was zzso zzso zzso and normal controls were also examined by the same zzso Five sequence zzso were zzso One zzso at zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso This is the same zzso as the zzso cerebral zzso with zzso type zzso zzso Another zzso change at zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso acid zzso at this zzso Two point zzso and a zzso deletion were identified in the zzso sequences surrounding zzso zzso None of the zzso could be zzso determined to be responsible for zzso The larger families were also analyzed by testing for linkage of zzso to a highly zzso short tandem repeat marker zzso that is tightly linked to zzso zzso negative zzso scores were obtained for the family groups tested, and linkage was formally excluded beyond zzso zzso zzso for the zzso German zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso scores for linkage of zzso to markers zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also negative in the three family zzso These studies show that zzso zzso account for zzso in only a small fraction of zzso zzso
