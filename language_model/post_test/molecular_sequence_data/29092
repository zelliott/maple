The zzso affinity and zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso were investigated after expression in zzso zzso zzso displayed anomalous zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso whole cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) and 235 zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso These values compare well with the zzso affinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel measured under the same conditions, suggesting that zzso zzso binding is a zzso feature of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the pore region had no significant effect on zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso significantly decreased zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso affinity zzso zzso 25 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite a zzso decrease in zzso affinity in zzso zzso zzso properties and the zzso zzso ratio remained comparable to values for zzso zzso Together, our observations suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso affinity but not in zzso zzso in zzso
