zzso by the zzso zzso P requires the presence of zzso metal zzso of which zzso promotes most efficient zzso Here we have studied the importance of there being zzso in zzso P zzso zzso It is demonstrated that addition of zzso resulted in a shift of the zzso site and that this shift was associated with a change in the kinetic constants, in particular zzso Our data further suggest that the influence of zzso on zzso site recognition depends on the zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso P zzso zzso Based on our data we suggest that zzso in the presence of zzso as the only zzso metal zzso proceeds through an intermediate which involves the establishment of the zzso zzso in the zzso By contrast, addition of zzso zzso an alternative zzso which results in a shift of the zzso zzso We also studied the influence of zzso on zzso site recognition and the zzso of zzso using various zzso P zzso derivatives carrying zzso in the region of zzso P zzso that zzso with the 3' terminal end of the zzso From these results we conclude that a change in the structure of this zzso P zzso domain influences the involvement of a zzso metal zzso in the chemistry of zzso
