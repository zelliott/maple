zzso an inhibitor of the normal zzso activity of the nuclear zzso zzso II, can induce a secondary acute zzso leukemia characterized by zzso DNA zzso The schedule of drug administration appears to be a clinical risk factor for this devastating treatment zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of leukemia cells in zzso to low zzso of zzso compared with short zzso to high zzso could produce equivalent or greater desired zzso effects, with decreased occurrence of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso events zzso zzso 

We used the frequency of zzso zzso zzso deletions of zzso 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso A zzso chain zzso technique was used to measure zzso 2 + 3 deletions in human zzso leukemia zzso cells 6 days after either zzso or 24-hour treatment with zzso at clinically relevant zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso by the number of viable cells present in the treated compared with the control zzso zzso zzso were measured 6 days after treatment of the zzso The frequency of the zzso 2 + 3 deletion following the two zzso conditions was compared by use of the zzso zzso All P values resulted from zzso zzso 

zzso increased with increasing zzso concentration and exposure zzso as zzso By day 6, the frequency of zzso 2 + 3 deletions was significantly higher zzso P value zzso zzso after the zzso treatment than after the 24-hour treatment, regardless of whether the frequency was assessed at zzso zzso achieving equivalent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso or at equivalent zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Thus, the ratio of desired zzso to zzso zzso effects was higher with the 24-hour zzso After the treated cells were zzso at limiting zzso the frequency of the zzso 2 + 3 deletion increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso event is not necessarily zzso 

For all drug zzso and levels of zzso studied in zzso cells, there was a greater ratio of zzso to genetic zzso following prolonged exposure to zzso than following brief zzso 

These data suggest that zzso is not inextricably linked to zzso If confirmed in the clinical setting, the use of prolonged dosage schedules may provide a means to decrease the risk of zzso acute zzso leukemia without compromising treatment zzso
