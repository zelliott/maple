The recently discovered zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso which zzso several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the prototypes protein zzso A zzso G zzso and C zzso zzso of a zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso loop (also known as the zzso of these zzso is a critical step in their zzso and is typically accompanied by additional zzso elsewhere in the zzso zzso of the zzso loop is a common regulatory mechanism shared by most zzso as well as zzso zzso as it zzso alignment of zzso acid zzso in the active site which are involved in the zzso zzso Therefore the discovery of zzso as the zzso which mediates this event in many protein zzso introduced a new and important step in signaling pathways which regulate numerous important cellular processes including cellular survival, zzso transport and zzso tumor progression as well as protein zzso Moreover, the finding that zzso function is zzso in part by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also provided an explanation as to how the zzso products of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulate the zzso of protein zzso signaling zzso These initial landmark observations were followed by many important studies which provided additional zzso insight into both zzso regulation as well as the role of this zzso in cellular zzso This review will focus on the regulation of zzso and the various mechanisms which it uses to contribute to the zzso of target zzso
