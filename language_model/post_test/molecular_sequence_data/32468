In zzso species, several transfer zzso genes have been reported to contain zzso zzso Although most of the zzso are located at zzso loop regions between zzso positions 37 and 38, a number of zzso at zzso sites and six cases of zzso genes containing two zzso have also been zzso However, these zzso genes are often missed by zzso the software most widely used for the zzso of zzso zzso We previously developed zzso a zzso tool to identify zzso genes containing one zzso at a zzso position on the basis of its zzso zzso zzso but the software was limited in the detection of zzso genes with multiple zzso at zzso zzso In this study, we initially updated the system as zzso in order to correctly predict known zzso genes as well as novel ones with multiple zzso By a comprehensive search for zzso genes in 29 zzso zzso using zzso we listed 43 novel candidates that contain zzso at zzso zzso As a result, 15 contained two zzso and three contained three zzso within the respective putative zzso zzso Moreover, the candidates completely zzso all the zzso of two zzso species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5, with novel candidates that were not zzso by zzso zzso
