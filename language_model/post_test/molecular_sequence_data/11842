zzso zzso zzso like most zzso zzso zzso undergo fundamental biological changes to survive outside the zzso of their zzso host by zzso into zzso zzso This complex process zzso the coordinated production, processing, and transport of zzso wall constituents for assembly into a protective zzso zzso Yet, little is known about this process and the identity of zzso wall zzso We previously identified a zzso zzso wall zzso zzso In the present work, using zzso zzso to zzso wall zzso we cloned the gene that encodes a novel zzso zzso wall zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was induced during zzso with identical zzso Soon after zzso these two proteins combine to form a stable complex, which is concentrated within the zzso zzso zzso before incorporation into the zzso zzso Both proteins contain five tandem copies of a zzso zzso zzso a motif implicated in zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso has an extremely basic zzso zzso extension that might be involved in the sorting of these proteins to the zzso zzso
