A detailed three-dimensional structure of a zzso is a necessary, but not sufficient prerequisite to understanding its zzso Crystal structures are lacking for protein receptors and zzso zzso However, the zzso acid sequences for representatives of the most important zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso are zzso To address the problem of three-dimensional structure and, zzso the dynamic properties of these zzso a holistic approach was applied to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the sodium channel of nerves zzso and zzso zzso to build zzso zzso For zzso and zzso the chains are placed within an envelope derived from image analysis of electron zzso Physical organic principles suggest how to zzso binding groups as well as structures for zzso channels, leading to the identification of the most common feature of channels, the positively charged zzso segment and the ever-present zzso segment of zzso zzso which has zzso counterparts in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to the zzso and rat zzso zzso and has a novel positively charged control zzso
