A low order neural network-based filter was designed as a rapid screening agent for zzso zzso regions in an integrated zzso zzso A rapid screening zzso was seen as a compromise between costly zzso techniques and simple rules that gave a high zzso rate for zzso The filter was applied to a library of zzso anonymous zzso zzso which resulted in 61 zzso zzso of the zzso with two other dissimilar computer prediction zzso yielded strong zzso predictions for 15 of the zzso while 8 of the zzso resulted in a definitive negative zzso zzso searches performed on the sequences with detection reports yielded 13 zzso in the predicted reading frame, four of which are membrane zzso
