In zzso each of the three zzso muscle types zzso zzso slow zzso and zzso contain distinct zzso of a number of different zzso proteins including zzso I zzso The functional characteristics of these proteins have a significant influence on muscle function and zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize which zzso gene and protein zzso are expressed in the different muscle types of rainbow trout zzso zzso and to determine whether zzso expression changes in response to cold zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso was used to characterize the expression of seven different zzso zzso The sequence of these zzso cloned from Atlantic salmon zzso zzso and rainbow trout, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso zzso gel zzso and tandem mass zzso were used to identify the zzso protein zzso expressed in each muscle zzso Interestingly, the results indicate that each muscle type expresses the gene transcripts of up to seven zzso zzso There are significant differences, however, in the expression pattern of these genes between muscle zzso In addition, cold zzso was found to increase the expression of specific gene transcripts in each muscle zzso The zzso analysis demonstrates that fast skeletal and cardiac muscle contain three zzso zzso whereas slow skeletal muscle contains zzso No other zzso muscle to date has been found to express as many zzso protein zzso zzso this study underscores the complex molecular composition of zzso zzso muscle and suggests there is an zzso value to the unique zzso profiles of each muscle zzso
