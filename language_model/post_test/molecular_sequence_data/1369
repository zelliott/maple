We report the cloning and molecular analysis of zzso zzso zzso factor B2 zzso a protein that plays a role in zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso replication in zzso An zzso interference zzso construct was designed that reduces expression of zzso to zzso of its normal level in Schneider zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces the abundance of specific zzso zzso transcripts zzso to zzso and decreases the copy number of zzso approximately zzso In a zzso manner, we find that zzso of zzso increases both the abundance of zzso zzso transcripts and the copy number of zzso In a comparative experiment, we find that zzso of zzso zzso zzso factor A zzso increases zzso copy number with no significant effect on zzso zzso This argues for a direct role for zzso in zzso zzso and suggests that, if zzso serves a role in transcription, its zzso level limits zzso copy number but not zzso Furthermore, we suggest that zzso increases zzso copy number by increasing the frequency of initiation of DNA zzso whereas zzso serves to stabilize and package zzso in zzso zzso Our work represents the first study to document the function of zzso in zzso establishing a dual role in regulation of both zzso and zzso and provides a benchmark for comparative zzso studies in various animal zzso
