The zzso zzso mediates the synthesis of zzso by incorporating zzso into specific zzso zzso upon translation of zzso that zzso zzso zzso The mouse gene zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library and zzso The mouse sequence is zzso with its zzso product, and contains a C to T transition relative to the zzso genes in other zzso except zzso zzso control motifs found zzso to the zzso coding region included a zzso element, a zzso element and an zzso motif which is associated with an zzso zzso A Northern zzso analysis showed highest expression in the zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, liver, heart and skeletal zzso Surprisingly, the expression level was lowest in embryonic stem zzso These results suggest a zzso zzso zzso Using restriction zzso length zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene was mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso 7, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso
