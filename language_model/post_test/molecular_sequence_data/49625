We report the occurrence of an zzso with a putative zzso structure involved in both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso generated a double zzso zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso and its zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso only zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso gene only zzso the zzso zzso The discovery of this zzso which has a zzso zzso has implications for the evolution of zzso pathways and may prove to be important for understanding the evolution of the zzso
