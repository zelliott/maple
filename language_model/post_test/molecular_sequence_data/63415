The crystal structures of the zzso fragments of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and of zzso from zzso zzso have been zzso Almost half of the zzso follow the chain fold of the zzso type A family of zzso the other half forms large zzso zzso that are likely to zzso specificity for the respective targeted zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso In the zzso the active center of zzso contained no zzso and was zzso whereas that of lethal zzso which was zzso with the donor zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso Surprisingly, the structure of lethal toxin with zzso (instead of zzso at the zzso position showed a bound donor zzso with a zzso active center, indicating that the strictly zzso coordination sphere of zzso is indispensable to the integrity of the zzso The zzso structures of zzso without zzso distorted lethal toxin with zzso plus zzso active lethal toxin with zzso plus donor and the zzso zzso zzso toxin B with a zzso donor have been lined up to show the geometry of several reaction zzso Interestingly, the structural refinement of one of the three zzso independent molecules of zzso lethal toxin resulted in the zzso zzso zzso expected for zzso that retain the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso A zzso of six zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso yielded the position of the zzso zzso atom with a zzso of zzso zzso The resulting zzso geometry suggests that the reaction runs as a circular electron transfer in a zzso ring, which involves the zzso of the zzso by the zzso group of the donor zzso zzso
