The E6 zzso derived from the zzso human zzso zzso types zzso the zzso degradation of several cellular proteins by zzso them with the cellular zzso zzso zzso This is a zzso zzso zzso that was originally identified through its involvement in the zzso degradation of the cellular zzso zzso protein zzso Here we have investigated, in more detail, the nature of the zzso interaction using binding peptides isolated from an zzso zzso The selected peptides were either predicted or shown to have an zzso core resembling the zzso motif on zzso as well as zzso acid zzso that increased their affinity for zzso These peptides were potent zzso of the zzso zzso Further analysis of the effects of these peptides on the ability of E6 to direct the zzso degradation of its various zzso including zzso zzso and the zzso family of zzso as well as using zzso zzso revealed striking differences in the mechanism by which E6 targets its cellular zzso for zzso These results suggest that the site on E6 bound by zzso is also most likely occupied by other, as yet unidentified, zzso zzso
