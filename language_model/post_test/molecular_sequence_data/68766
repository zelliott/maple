Little information is available on the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso bone zzso We used zzso acid zzso zzso to begin to investigate the regulation of bone zzso at the molecular zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso and may play an important role in the bone zzso zzso zzso we isolated the zzso zzso gene from a mouse zzso zzso library and characterized its zzso A restriction map was generated for the 17 zzso zzso zzso A 2 zzso zzso fragment, containing the zzso region, was zzso and the zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of numerous candidate zzso factor binding zzso including those for zzso and zzso The zzso site matches the consensus sequence for the zzso zzso zzso An zzso was identified at zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso The presence of an zzso was confirmed by zzso analysis of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicated the presence of a zzso initiation site at zzso zzso from the zzso The region from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso drove the transient expression of a zzso reporter gene when zzso into zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso approximately zzso These data suggest that the zzso promoter is complex and contains multiple regulatory zzso The availability of the zzso promoter may also permit production of transgenic mice, which can be used to develop previously unavailable zzso cell zzso
