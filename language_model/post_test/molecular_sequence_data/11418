The zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso was prepared in high yield by a zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso equilibrium and zzso data showed that the synthetic zzso zzso 1, was zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were also zzso The circular zzso spectrum of 1 showed a high zzso content, which increased upon addition of DNA containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift experiments showed that protein 1 bound sequence specifically to the zzso zzso sequence with a binding constant of zzso zzso and had an affinity for other E box sequences as zzso Comparisons between the zzso structure of zzso zzso with DNA and structural studies in solution showed lower zzso contents in solution as would have been predicted from the crystal zzso
