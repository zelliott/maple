To maintain normal metal zzso bacteria use zzso zzso to control zzso of metal resistance zzso Depending on their zzso states, the zzso zzso change their interactions with DNA to suppress or activate zzso To understand their functions zzso we study how zzso a zzso zzso zzso interacts with DNA, using an engineered DNA Holliday junction zzso as a zzso interaction reporter in zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso By analyzing the zzso structural dynamics of the engineered zzso in the presence of various zzso of both zzso and zzso we show how zzso interacts with the two zzso of the engineered zzso forming variable zzso complexes at different protein zzso and changing the zzso zzso We also show how zzso and zzso differ in their interactions with DNA, and discuss their similarities and differences with other zzso zzso The surprising finding that zzso binds more strongly to DNA than to zzso suggests functional differences among zzso zzso in particular in their mechanisms of switching off gene zzso after zzso The study also corroborates the general zzso of engineered zzso as zzso reporters for zzso zzso which are fundamental processes in gene zzso transcription, zzso and zzso
