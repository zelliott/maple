The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso stretch zzso zzso that includes a short zzso zzso the elements of which form a mirror repeat at and near the zzso initiation zzso A DNA zzso that included this sequence was inserted into zzso and the resulting plasmids were introduced into zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of these zzso derivatives to zzso by zzso zzso following isolation from zzso coli, indicated the formation of an open, zzso structure within and just downstream of the zzso zzso Replacement of two zzso zzso in one of the repeat elements by zzso resulted in the elimination of the zzso open structure from the zzso To analyze the effect of the zzso sequence from zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso these contained the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso promoter with the aforementioned zzso in the mirror zzso zzso The zzso zzso resistance gene zzso was fused downstream of the zzso and the resulting zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso grew significantly more slowly on zzso zzso plates and contained a noticeably lower level of the bar transcript when compared with the zzso obtained with zzso These results suggest that an unusual structure induced by the zzso sequence is required for efficient gene expression from the zzso zzso
