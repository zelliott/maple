Early zzso zzso zzso to early zzso is zzso by a zzso region, which includes a zzso binding zzso a zzso interaction site, and a zzso domain that selectively binds zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso region bound to zzso zzso reveals an zzso zzso assembly consisting of a parallel coiled zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso observations support a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso in which domain organization, zzso and zzso structure amplify the weak affinity and modest specificity of head group interactions with zzso zzso A unique mode of membrane engagement deduced from the zzso structure of the zzso region provides insight into the structural basis of zzso zzso
