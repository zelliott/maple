When challenged by mechanical zzso the zzso gene of soybean zzso extreme resistance zzso against zzso mosaic virus zzso strain zzso but not zzso and its zzso evolved zzso zzso zzso provokes a lethal systemic hypersensitive response zzso whereas zzso zzso systemic zzso Thus, for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both virulent virus zzso The zzso function of zzso provoking zzso zzso was recently mapped to zzso and the influence of zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso of the precursor zzso of zzso on evasion of zzso recognition provoking zzso was zzso We have now extended this study to zzso Initially, zzso acids corresponding to those of zzso at these positions were zzso individually or in zzso All the zzso remained replication competent on zzso zzso however, none lost the zzso function provoking zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was precisely replaced with zzso of zzso or zzso and vice zzso All the zzso were replication competent on zzso zzso but surprisingly zzso and zzso failed to gain zzso on zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso lost zzso and this loss of zzso function was mapped to the zzso domain of zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso zzso provokes zzso zzso however, zzso on zzso soybean is not solely a consequence of the absence of the zzso zzso functions provoking zzso zzso and zzso
