In order to characterize the specificity of expression of the neurotransmitter zzso gene zzso zzso zzso the identification of proteins that interact with the zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso expression zzso library screened with the zzso zzso The zzso is a member of the zzso class, and is zzso by several zzso zzso The zzso contain the same sequence in the zzso and 3' coding and zzso zzso but diverge in sequence zzso to the zzso This family of zzso zzso is named zzso zzso zzso transcripts are found only in zzso zzso zzso and in cell lines derived from those zzso The zzso zzso contains two binding sites for the zzso zzso and both sites contribute to zzso activity of the zzso zzso When introduced into tissue culture, zzso regulates the zzso activity from the zzso promoter, and also from the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The pattern of expression of the zzso zzso the presence of the zzso and the zzso regulatory properties suggest that this family of proteins may be involved in the specificity of expression of the zzso zzso zzso
