zzso II of zzso c zzso is a zzso zzso protein required for cellular zzso A zzso zzso strain has been isolated and shown genetically to carry a zzso in the zzso II structural gene zzso The zzso strain produces no zzso II zzso and is missing two major transcripts of the zzso II zzso The zzso first mapped by zzso zzso rescue to the zzso end of the zzso has been localized precisely, by DNA sequencing, 58 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso initiation zzso The zzso strain carries a single zzso change (A to zzso relative to the wild type zzso This zzso occurs in a sequence with substantial zzso to a previously identified zzso zzso promoter consensus zzso These results provide the first in zzso evidence for the importance of the consensus sequence for promoter zzso
