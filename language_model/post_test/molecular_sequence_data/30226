A 60 zzso region of a zzso virus 40 DNA zzso was zzso to determine zzso that are critical for the zzso to zzso The zzso zzso saturated this region with all possible single zzso zzso The mobility of each zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso at 4 degrees C and at 65 degrees C to assess the degree of zzso Four conclusions can be zzso First, interruptions within the A tracts and changes in the phasing of the A tracts alter the degree of zzso Second, G tracts phased at a zzso turn from an A tract are additive to the zzso Third, zzso zzso in a zzso contact with the A tracts modify the zzso Fourth, some zzso that do not obviously relate to the A tracts also alter the DNA bend and suggest clearly that base steps other than zzso are involved in zzso DNA zzso
