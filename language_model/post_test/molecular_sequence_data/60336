The zzso factor zzso plays a key role in regulating cell cycle zzso zzso zzso activity is itself tightly controlled by a series of zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso domain interacts with a zzso activity which zzso two sites, zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso observed in cell extracts and that zzso zzso interacts in zzso with zzso a component of zzso during S zzso When the two zzso sites in zzso are zzso to zzso the stability of the zzso zzso domain is greatly zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso plays a role in triggering zzso degradation during S zzso
