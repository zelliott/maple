zzso filaments in simple zzso cells are zzso of zzso 8 zzso and zzso 18 zzso zzso The assembly of these zzso into intermediate filaments is a complex zzso phenomenon that involves several levels of zzso These molecular associations are not very well zzso zzso zzso zzso with defined zzso can be used to probe these associations and to isolate various zzso in the assembly zzso Here we describe the specificity of a zzso zzso that has been widely used in zzso expression zzso We report that the zzso zzso does not recognize individual zzso zzso but it instead zzso with a complex of zzso with zzso The zzso also did not react with complexes of zzso or zzso with other zzso By allowing the zzso to react with complexes zzso from zzso fragments plus the complementary zzso we have mapped the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which must associate together to achieve zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of complementary zzso associate directly during filament zzso This would explain why zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to disrupt zzso zzso Furthermore, it may also help to explain the mechanism of filament disruption in some skin blistering syndromes induced by spontaneous zzso in the zzso zzso
