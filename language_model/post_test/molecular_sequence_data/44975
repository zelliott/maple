zzso were designed to test the idea that A zzso anchor proteins zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso to surfaces of zzso that are bounded by zzso zzso zzso one of three zzso proteins zzso by a zzso zzso zzso was studied as a zzso zzso zzso When zzso was expressed in zzso cells, the anchor protein was targeted to zzso and excluded from other cell zzso The zzso zzso site is located in the zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not associated with zzso isolated from control zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells triggered a zzso of zzso of total zzso to zzso Thus, the zzso region of the zzso anchor protein is properly oriented and avidly binds zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso Two critical zzso in zzso were zzso zzso 1 to 30 govern zzso of the zzso into the outer zzso zzso zzso acids zzso constitute the zzso zzso Properties established for zzso in zzso and in zzso strongly suggest that a zzso function of this protein is to concentrate and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso face of a zzso zzso
