zzso protein zzso zzso the plant zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a sensor that maintains cellular energy zzso via control of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso affects zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus extending the role of this zzso to regulation of zzso zzso zzso and 7 were zzso in zzso by a zzso activated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso identified zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso in the nucleus of transformed zzso tobacco zzso but, in contrast to zzso the zzso zzso zzso state alone did not modify its nuclear zzso Using a zzso zzso system, consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was shown to be abolished by zzso and by the zzso form zzso , but not by the zzso form zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso double zzso plants showed an attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves and inability to undergo zzso Furthermore, this severe zzso was not observed in zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results establish that the energy sensor zzso plays a zzso role in the control of cell proliferation in zzso zzso plants through zzso of zzso biological function by zzso
