zzso zzso zzso produces zzso for the synthesis of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The native zzso from zzso is pale yellow and has zzso zzso at 338 and zzso zzso from vitamin zzso zzso colorless, and pink forms of the protein are obtained by treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to the native zzso the zzso zzso zzso maximum in the yellow zzso is enhanced and the 338 zzso maximum reduced while the zzso zzso has a heightened maximum at 338 zzso and a barely zzso peak at zzso zzso The pink zzso has an zzso maximum at zzso zzso When the native and zzso zzso are repeatedly diluted in zzso M zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso is released and the 338 zzso maximum zzso Thus the 338 zzso zzso maximum is associated with zzso bound zzso zzso zzso reduction proved that the zzso at zzso zzso is from zzso zzso zzso bound by a Schiff base to the zzso When the native, colorless, and yellow zzso were subjected to zzso zzso mass zzso the B6 zzso zzso from the protein and gave a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for protein zzso and they reacted with the native and yellow zzso but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to the protein after zzso zzso zzso zzso attached zzso to the zzso produced an additional mass peak, zzso mass units higher, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
