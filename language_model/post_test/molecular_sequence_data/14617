zzso zzso serve predominantly as zzso hard skeletal systems in zzso from zzso sponges zzso zzso class zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso sponges form their skeletal zzso the zzso from zzso calcium zzso zzso Treatment of zzso from zzso zzso with sodium zzso zzso results in the disintegration of the zzso in those skeletal zzso Until now a distinct zzso involved in zzso metabolism could not been identified in those zzso We applied the technique of zzso display zzso libraries to identify zzso that bind to zzso zzso those zzso allowed us to detect proteins that bind to those zzso Two molecules have been identified, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso that are involved in the zzso of zzso The complete zzso were isolated and the zzso proteins were prepared to raise zzso In turn, zzso zzso of tissue slices and zzso analyses have been zzso The data show that zzso cultivated under standard condition (10 zzso zzso show low levels of zzso for zzso zzso or zzso compared to those animals that had been cultivated under zzso condition (1 zzso zzso Our data identify with the zzso zzso and the zzso the first two molecules which remain zzso in cells, potentially involved in zzso skeletal zzso from sponges zzso to human zzso
