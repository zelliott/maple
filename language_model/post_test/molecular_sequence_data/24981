We have established a panel of human zzso zzso against human zzso virus type 1 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso have been identified to be two of the most zzso in zzso zzso zzso against zzso Here we report on a further zzso zzso of similar in zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to a novel zzso C terminal of the zzso sequence recognized by zzso which has been so far the only described broadly zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso bind only zzso to infected cells compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but show potent in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not only tissue zzso strains but also primary zzso of different zzso including A, B, C, D, and zzso zzso that were found to be resistant to zzso were neutralized by zzso and vice zzso none of the tested zzso was resistant to both zzso zzso This confirms that the region recognized by zzso and zzso is essential for viral zzso and may be important for vaccine zzso Moreover, our results suggest that zzso should be further investigated for passive zzso zzso
