zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso cell zzso protein that acts as a carrier of zzso in the male zzso zzso zzso has been characterized from a wide range of animal species, including man, rabbit and zzso However, it has been widely accepted that mice do not produce zzso zzso We have used zzso and molecular biological techniques to demonstrate that the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso is present in mouse zzso and zzso but at zzso to zzso the level of rat zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso with rat zzso zzso was identified in mouse zzso and zzso cells by Northern zzso zzso but at a much lower level than in the zzso An zzso zzso was isolated from a mouse zzso zzso library and zzso a protein zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso acid zzso identical to rat zzso including a signal zzso Our results indicate that zzso is expressed in the mouse and past failures to detect zzso activity were due to the low level of zzso zzso
