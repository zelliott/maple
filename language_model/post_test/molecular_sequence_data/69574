zzso zzso beta 1 from zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso mode of zzso We show here that this replication zzso is dependent on a zzso replication protein zzso but not on a DNA structure typical for origins of most zzso plasmids and zzso is initiated by DNA zzso I zzso zzso beta 1 minimal zzso shares no zzso with highly zzso zzso zzso which use zzso for initiation but do not zzso a zzso or with zzso and zzso zzso which require zzso for replication and zzso a zzso We propose that zzso beta 1 and a number of other naturally occurring and closely related plasmids from a distinct zzso zzso
