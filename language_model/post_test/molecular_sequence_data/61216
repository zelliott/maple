We have characterized the human natural zzso repertoire that contains zzso recognizing the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso A panel of zzso zzso fragments zzso selected from zzso and zzso zzso libraries generated from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of a healthy, zzso zzso individual was zzso reflecting that only zzso but not zzso zzso were able to recognize zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were not restricted to any particular heavy chain variable region zzso germ line zzso However, the recognition of zzso is associated to zzso zzso and all display zzso zzso This zzso with the absence of any maturation process as zzso zzso or zzso switch as the zzso sequence analysis of the variable regions reveals they are expressed near to zzso zzso In addition, none of the zzso showed any zzso activity on zzso zzso reflecting that the natural zzso repertoire is not sufficient to neutralize zzso zzso
