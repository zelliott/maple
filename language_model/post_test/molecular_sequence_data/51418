Using a zzso model in the rat hind zzso the present study undertook to examine the relative contribution of sensory nerves and zzso oxide zzso to the inflammatory response induced by zzso zzso Using this model, combined with laser zzso zzso we were able to simultaneously monitor two parameters of the inflammatory response, namely zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso of BK zzso 10 or 100 zzso over the zzso base zzso both zzso and zzso responses which were zzso The zzso response was of rapid zzso sustained at the lowest concentration (1 zzso and showed zzso at the highest two zzso (10 and 100 zzso The zzso response, however, was delayed in onset at the lower concentration but the response was maintained at all zzso The zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso 100 zzso was used as an internal control and zzso a rapid maintained zzso zzso In rats zzso as zzso with zzso to destroy primary sensory zzso the inflammatory response to 10 zzso BK was significantly smaller zzso and zzso decrease in zzso and zzso zzso The selective inhibitor of NO zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso significantly attenuated the inflammatory response to BK in control rats zzso and zzso decrease in zzso and zzso zzso with a further decrease in the response in zzso zzso zzso The inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the inflammatory response to zzso The zzso response to zzso was intact in zzso zzso rats and was not affected by either zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
