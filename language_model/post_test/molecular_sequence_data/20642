The identification of zzso zzso is important for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso intended as therapeutic zzso zzso has proven to be a powerful tool for the study of zzso molecular interactions such as those involved in zzso zzso zzso In this work, we described a novel methodology for mapping a linear zzso based on direct mass zzso measurement of zzso zzso To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we employed two approaches, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to study a model system consisting of a zzso zzso zzso with specificity toward the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso complex was treated with zzso zzso and the zzso complexes were directly monitored by zzso under native zzso Mass differences between the zzso complex and the zzso control revealed the size of zzso peptides that were bound to the zzso Using the zzso extraction approach, zzso was first zzso by zzso and the zzso containing the zzso was selected by zzso zzso Data analysis allowed mapping of the zzso to zzso which is in good agreement with previously unpublished zzso The utility of the methodology was demonstrated by zzso the binding zzso for two full-length zzso zzso
