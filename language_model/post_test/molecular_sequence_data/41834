We have characterized the human gene zzso the major peripheral zzso protein zero zzso and assigned it, by in zzso zzso to the zzso region of human zzso zzso This region is known to contain a cluster of zzso genes coding for the related human zzso receptors of the zzso portion of the zzso G zzso gamma zzso II, zzso This zzso was refined by the finding of a zzso artificial zzso zzso of the Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso library, zzso to the zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso demonstrating their physical zzso These data may have important implications in zzso diseases studies like zzso disease type zzso zzso
