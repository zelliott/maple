zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that are sometimes associated with zzso zzso zzso the genes involved in such cases provide an interesting approach to understanding zzso abnormalities in zzso As a first step towards zzso such zzso marker zzso need complete zzso By combining zzso isolation by flow sorting and the zzso zzso primed - zzso chain zzso we have constructed a DNA library specific for a marker zzso found in a child with severe zzso zzso We used fluorescent in zzso zzso of the library onto normal zzso spreads zzso zzso zzso and were thus able to determine that the marker consists of the zzso part of zzso 7, the zzso region of the long arm of zzso 5 and the zzso region of the short arm of the zzso zzso we zzso normal zzso libraries of the relevant zzso onto zzso containing the marker zzso zzso zzso zzso and could in this manner establish the precise location of the different zzso regions on the marker zzso zzso This is a general approach suitable for outlining marker zzso in detail, and will aid the identification of the genes zzso
