To investigate the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso reaction in insects, we zzso a zzso protein from injected beads into zzso zzso zzso When a zzso clone was isolated, the zzso protein showed high zzso with zzso and human zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein was present in the zzso but not in the zzso When the zzso zzso beads were coated with zzso protein zzso and zzso into zzso zzso larvae, any further zzso reaction was zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso recognition in zzso cellular defense zzso
