The zzso gene zzso zzso protein 1 zzso 1) from zzso zzso was cloned by a reverse genetic zzso zzso 1 was zzso from zzso zzso of zzso strain zzso by zzso zzso affinity zzso and used to obtain an zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso based on this protein sequence and a highly zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso acid motif found in all class A zzso zzso were used to isolate the zzso 1 gene zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein containing all of the zzso sequence motifs found in class A zzso and expression of the gene in zzso coli resulted in the appearance of a new zzso that zzso with zzso 1 zzso from zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso gene to its zzso isolated from zzso zzso revealed a high degree of identity between the two gene products, with the greatest zzso found at the zzso zzso of the two deduced zzso 1 protein zzso
