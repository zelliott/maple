zzso rich repeat zzso domain, characterized by a repetitive sequence pattern rich in zzso zzso is a universal zzso interaction motif present in all life zzso zzso repeats interrupted by sequences of zzso zzso zzso island domain, zzso have been found in some plant zzso zzso zzso zzso and animal zzso receptors zzso Recent studies provide insight into how a single ID is structurally integrated into an zzso zzso However, structural information on an zzso protein with two zzso is zzso The zzso protein zzso 2 zzso is an zzso and has important roles in controlling plant growth and development by perception and zzso of hormone zzso Here we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso containing two zzso from zzso The structure reveals that both of the zzso are zzso and located at the central region of the single zzso zzso One of them binds to the inner surface of the zzso whereas the other one mainly interacts with the lateral zzso zzso a long loop immediately following the zzso capping domain of zzso is presented toward and sandwiched between the two zzso further stabilizing their embedding to the zzso zzso A potential zzso binding site formed by the two zzso and the zzso is located at the zzso side of zzso The structural information of zzso zzso our understanding toward the large family of zzso proteins and provides insight into zzso zzso
