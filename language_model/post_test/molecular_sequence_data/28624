zzso linkage within zzso zzso populations is in zzso yet the physical linkage map indicates a relatively stable zzso structure, despite an apparently vast potential for zzso between repeated sequences zzso between the multiple zzso or zzso zzso or through zzso of any of the numerous small repeated sequences that are liberally scattered throughout the zzso zzso the stability of the physical linkage map suggests that zzso zzso between repeated sequences is a rare zzso This study was undertaken to explore some of the parameters that may govern deletion events between short direct zzso repeats, using a zzso locus that appears to be especially prone to deletions (the zzso expression zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that deletion formation at zzso occurs primarily through zzso error following a zzso zzso illegitimate zzso zzso events can occur, but they are zzso In contrast, when genetically engineered zzso deletion zzso were constructed and placed in the zzso deletions at the zzso zzso were zzso even under zzso zzso A model is presented in which the zzso zzso and zzso proteins promote zzso deletions through a zzso event that is zzso or zzso by a zzso zzso
