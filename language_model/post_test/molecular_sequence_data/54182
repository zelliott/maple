Lower Red zzso is an acid mine drainage site in Pennsylvania where zzso zzso zzso has created a large, zzso iron mound downstream of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemistry, mineral zzso microbial communities, and zzso zzso zzso rates for this site were analyzed in the context of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were defined as pools, zzso or zzso based on zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the distance downstream from the zzso The sediments were composed entirely of zzso zzso and cemented organic zzso The zzso zzso were identified as zzso at all locations, regardless of zzso zzso composition was studied with zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a zzso zzso community at the spring, to a zzso zzso zzso zzso community at the upstream end of the iron zzso to a zzso zzso zzso community at the downstream end of the iron zzso zzso community structure was more strongly correlated with pH and zzso conditions than zzso zzso zzso pieces of terrace and pool sediments from upstream and downstream locations were used in zzso laboratory zzso to measure the rate and extent of zzso zzso zzso No change in zzso concentration was observed with zzso sediments or with zzso controls, indicating that zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso sediments attained lower zzso zzso zzso compared to downstream zzso regardless of zzso zzso
