Following zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes associated with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence represents a potential zzso motif in the zzso zzso tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso In the present study, we performed a double zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to test the functional significance of this zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wild type zzso zzso expressing either wild type zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent zzso cells failed to spread, form focal zzso or initiate protein zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso motif in zzso zzso we examined the ability of the zzso zzso to interact with zzso in a solid phase binding zzso Both wild type and zzso zzso zzso by zzso affinity zzso bound to a similar extent to immobilized zzso Additionally, zzso zzso failed to interact with peptides containing the zzso sequence indicating that the zzso binding domain in the zzso zzso zzso does not reside in the zzso zzso In contrast, specific binding of zzso to peptides containing the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a zzso protein zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso head domain of zzso zzso In addition, zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to immobilized zzso indicating that an zzso site is present in the zzso zzso head zzso zzso these studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso motif regulates zzso binding functions of zzso in a manner independent of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to bind through its zzso head domain to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso
