Gene knockout experiments are often essential in functional zzso and zzso engineering zzso However, repeated multiple gene knockout experiments are laborious, time consuming and sometimes impossible to perform for those genes that are essential for cell zzso Small regulatory zzso zzso are short zzso zzso in zzso that can finely control the expression of target genes in trans at the zzso zzso Here we describe the protocol for synthetic zzso gene expression control, including zzso design zzso zzso synthetic zzso consist of a scaffold and a zzso zzso and they can be created by simply replacing an existing zzso sequence with one that is complementary to the target zzso to be zzso while retaining the zzso Our zzso synthetic zzso system does not require zzso zzso and it enables one to perform zzso studies on the effects of zzso on host cell zzso and it further allows the simultaneous screening of target genes in different zzso coli strains for applications in zzso engineering and synthetic zzso Once an zzso zzso zzso is constructed, customized synthetic zzso can be made within zzso zzso after this time, the synthetic zzso can be applied to the desired zzso
