zzso accumulates after DNA damage and arrests cellular zzso These findings suggest a possible role for zzso in the cellular response to DNA zzso We have previously shown that the C zzso of zzso binds DNA zzso and assembles stable zzso In this study, we have zzso zzso segments of human and zzso zzso to determine which zzso zzso may participate in a DNA damage response zzso We find that the zzso 75 zzso acids of human or zzso zzso are necessary and sufficient for the DNA zzso and zzso activities of zzso In addition, both full-length zzso zzso and the zzso 75 zzso acids display an increased binding affinity for DNA damaged by restriction zzso zzso I treatment, or zzso zzso In contrast, the central zzso zzso domain together with the zzso domain does not have these zzso We propose that interactions of the C zzso of zzso with damaged DNA may play a role in the zzso of zzso in response to DNA zzso
