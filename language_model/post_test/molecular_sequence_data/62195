zzso (also known as zzso is a zzso zzso factor that functions as a tumor zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Target promoters have been identified primarily through the use of differential expression strategies and candidate gene approaches but not zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we identified protein zzso zzso as a direct zzso target gene and demonstrate that zzso zzso binds the zzso protein zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso site within the zzso promoter binds zzso in zzso mobility shift analyses and zzso zzso responsiveness on a zzso zzso Changes in zzso activity affect zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and a zzso form of zzso protects zzso cells from zzso stimuli previously shown to be dependent on protein zzso zzso This protection can be reversed by the zzso expression of protein zzso zzso Together these findings demonstrate that protein zzso zzso is a zzso downstream target of zzso and links zzso to a zzso zzso zzso
