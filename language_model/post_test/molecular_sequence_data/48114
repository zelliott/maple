The life cycle of the zzso zzso zzso zzso includes two structurally and zzso different cell zzso a zzso zzso that is arrested in the cell cycle, and a zzso cell zzso that feeds and zzso These two cell types offer an exceptionally zzso system for the isolation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cellular zzso zzso screening of a zzso zzso library using a zzso zzso probe yielded zzso clones that represent zzso transcripts and one clone that represents a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that seven zzso including the only zzso one, represent unknown zzso whereas five clones could be identified by sequence zzso Two of the clones appear to zzso proteins that are involved in the regulation of growth and zzso The deduced sequences of three clones resemble potential cell cycle zzso Data are presented on a putative member of the zzso protein zzso family and on a zzso zzso which is the first such sequence to be described since the discovery of the rat zzso zzso Furthermore, a unique new sequence is zzso whose features suggest that it represents a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell zzso It includes zzso characteristic of two different protein families, zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which are known to be cell cycle zzso Based on our results we propose a model for cell cycle regulation in zzso zzso
