The zzso zzso zzso of zzso species zzso which is composed of two zzso alpha and zzso zzso the zzso of various zzso compounds to the corresponding zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and the fragments obtained by digesting each of the two zzso with zzso zzso were determined for preparation of synthetic zzso as zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which contained DNA sequences zzso to several of the zzso was cloned in zzso in zzso zzso The zzso sequences together with the determined zzso acid sequences indicated that the alpha and beta zzso of zzso consisted of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and 212 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame for the alpha zzso includes that for the beta zzso with a short zzso of only 26 base zzso the two genes are probably translated in a zzso zzso Although large amounts of the zzso and zzso proteins were produced as zzso forms in zzso coli when the cloned genes were placed under the control of the zzso promoter, no zzso activity was zzso The activity of the zzso was zzso to some extent, by zzso of the proteins with 8 M zzso and subsequent dialysis for zzso at pH 10 in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso
