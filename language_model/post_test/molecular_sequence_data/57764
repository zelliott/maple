The membrane surface of polarized zzso cells can be divided in zzso and zzso zzso that differ in molecular composition and zzso zzso of the zzso are involved in critical steps of both generation and maintenance of cell zzso Generation of polarity is controlled by zzso that serve as zzso aligned and polarized zzso guiding structures for the zzso and selective transport of zzso carrier zzso to the zzso cell zzso zzso of membrane proteins to the zzso cell surface does not depend on zzso but follows the zzso bulk flow of zzso Once inserted into the zzso zzso several membrane proteins such as the kidney zzso zzso 1 zzso and the sodium pump become immobilized at specialized zzso of the lateral cell zzso Evidence is provided that both membrane proteins are linked via zzso to the zzso membrane zzso that zzso the zzso membrane zzso zzso of these and other integral membrane proteins to the zzso may not only place them to specialized sites of the plasma membrane but may also prevent these zzso from zzso and zzso thus helping them to stay at the cell zzso In search of sequence motifs involved in binding of integral membrane proteins to components of the zzso we found that the binding interface of zzso to protein zzso (an zzso and zzso zzso zzso consists of a cluster of five zzso acid zzso namely zzso in zzso and zzso on protein zzso This motif may play a more general role in zzso membrane zzso
