zzso channel inhibitor peptides from scorpion zzso zzso have greatly advanced our understanding of zzso channel structure and function, Because of their high affinity interaction with the outer zzso zzso have zzso in identification of zzso acids lining the pore and of proteins zzso functional zzso The zzso display a large range of affinities for different zzso channels with differences in binding free energy exceeding approximately 8 zzso These differences in affinities are the foundation of zzso specificity and have aided in revealing the zzso and zzso roles of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso display gross differences in specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, many zzso channels are largely untouched by zzso zzso in toxin binding free energy provide a quantitative framework for defining zzso As a practical criterion for specificity a minimum binding free energy difference of zzso zzso is zzso zzso free energy differences for zzso and zzso toxins and channels can point to zzso acids underlying specificity and to unique features of zzso channel outer zzso Known zzso structures of zzso channels in combination with zzso sequence alignment of over 60 zzso channels reveal significant variation in zzso binding zzso zzso zzso models of zzso channels zzso with zzso in combination with zzso of toxin binding free energy, will further our understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso
