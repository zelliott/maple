zzso bacteria contain zzso zzso iron zzso zzso and respond to magnetic zzso Polar zzso bacteria in vertical chemical zzso are thought to respond to high oxygen levels by swimming downward into areas with low or no oxygen zzso zzso north in the Northern Hemisphere and zzso south in the Southern zzso We identified populations of polar zzso bacteria in the Northern Hemisphere that respond to high oxygen levels by swimming toward zzso south, the opposite of all previously reported zzso zzso The percentage of zzso bacteria with south polarity in the environment is positively correlated with higher zzso zzso The coexistence of zzso bacteria with opposing zzso in the same zzso environment conflicts with current models of the zzso value of zzso
