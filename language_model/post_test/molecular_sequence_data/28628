Group II zzso are novel genetic elements that have properties of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso of plants and lower zzso group II zzso are now being discovered in increasing numbers in bacterial zzso Few of the newly zzso bacterial zzso are correctly identified or zzso by those who zzso zzso Here we have compiled and thoroughly analyzed group II zzso and their fragments in bacterial DNA sequences reported to zzso zzso distribution in bacterial zzso differs markedly from the distribution in zzso zzso zzso zzso are not inserted into zzso zzso are often inserted outside of genes altogether and are frequently fragmented, suggesting a high rate of zzso gain and zzso Some zzso have multiple natural zzso sites while others insert after zzso zzso All bacterial group II zzso identified to date zzso reverse zzso open reading frames and are either active zzso or derivatives of zzso Together, these observations suggest that group II zzso in bacteria behave primarily as zzso rather than as zzso and that the strategy for group II zzso survival in bacteria is fundamentally different from zzso survival in zzso
