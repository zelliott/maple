zzso to host zzso is a critical step in the zzso of most bacterial zzso zzso zzso coli zzso remains one of the principal causes of infectious zzso in zzso The recent identification of additional zzso surface molecules suggests that new targets may be exploited in vaccine zzso The zzso protein identified in zzso zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso requires its putative partner zzso for zzso across the outer membrane zzso We investigated the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso We showed that zzso is zzso zzso protein localized to the zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso is able to form pores in zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso suggesting its functional zzso The pore of zzso frequently assumes an opened zzso and fluctuates between three zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence and molecular modeling suggest that zzso is similar to the well-known zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso and has a zzso zzso zzso domain that is zzso by an zzso zzso an zzso loop, and two zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these data confirm that zzso is a zzso protein mainly folded into a zzso zzso and indicate that zzso presents typical features of the zzso zzso zzso
