A functional zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso alters the risk of disease as well as brain zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso is functionally zzso The zzso zzso which is the L zzso with a common G zzso creates a functional zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso in 62 zzso cell lines representing the six zzso and in zzso zzso cells showed zzso zzso action and low, nearly equivalent expression for the S and zzso zzso accounting for more variation in zzso expression than previously zzso The zzso zzso zzso was approximately twice as common in 169 whites with obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso than in zzso ethnically matched zzso We performed a replication study in 175 trios consisting of zzso with zzso and their zzso The zzso zzso was twofold zzso to the patients with zzso The zzso zzso zzso exerts a moderate zzso effect on risk of zzso which zzso the evidence that the zzso gene has a role in zzso
