We have shown that the zzso zzso derived from zzso domain of zzso protein and of its zzso forms differ in their zzso zzso A strong increase of zzso activity was observed for zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here the zzso sequences of respective protein fragments were zzso and investigated by plaque forming cells and delayed type hypersensitivity zzso The change of zzso activity toward zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was inactive in both tests, and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso peptides produced zzso in plaque forming cells as well as in delayed type hypersensitivity zzso
