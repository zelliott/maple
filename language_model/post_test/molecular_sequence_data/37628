Chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso acids showing approximately zzso sequence identity with the long zzso of zzso zzso zzso and contained a putative signal zzso a single zzso domain and the zzso box 1, 2 and 3 motifs in the zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso expression were observed in zzso and brain, and less abundant expression of the zzso was detected in liver, kidney and zzso in juvenile females and sexually matured zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso did not change during sexual maturation in most zzso but the zzso level in the zzso was higher in matured zzso than in zzso zzso treatment was found to enhance the zzso zzso expression in the zzso but not in other zzso
