zzso acid replacements have been introduced in specific sites of zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso to assess the role that these changes have on zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso acids in the zzso region of zzso was zzso and the effects that these changes had on the kinetic and physical properties of this zzso were zzso The zzso introduced were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the resulting zzso possessing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, relative to that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso dialysis was performed on the zzso and zzso zzso to determine the binding zzso for zzso and zzso and while in most cases the extent of binding of these zzso to the zzso proteins was reduced when compared with zzso zzso the number of binding sites involved remained about 1 or less for the zzso complex and almost 2 for the zzso zzso Heat and zzso stability studies revealed that the zzso with the highest zzso activity, zzso was the most zzso while zzso analyses revealed that the structures of zzso and zzso were zzso relative to the zzso and zzso zzso These studies are in agreement with others implicating the zzso zzso zzso zzso as playing an essential zzso role in the zzso process promoted by zzso The zzso zzso acids on either side of this zzso although also highly zzso do not appear to affect the zzso mechanism directly, but may do so indirectly through their influence on the zzso at the active site as well as other regions of the zzso zzso acids replacements were introduced also into the folate and zzso zzso binding sites of the zzso zzso to ascertain the potential role that these zzso acids play in the zzso zzso These positions were selected on the basis of previous chemical modification and X-ray zzso studies on zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 48 and 49, which are in the putative folate binding site, were converted from zzso to zzso in the former case, the zzso zzso had less than zzso of the zzso activity while in the latter, the zzso zzso still retained about zzso of its zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
