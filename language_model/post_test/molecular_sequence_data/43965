zzso the molecular mechanisms behind extreme temperature stability is of relevance for the protein folding problem and for designing proteins for industrial and medical zzso A powerful approach for understanding the structural basis of zzso is the comparison of high resolution structures of zzso proteins from zzso and zzso The zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with those of zzso zzso zzso analysis of structural differences reveals that zzso is achieved without large changes of the overall zzso chain zzso The most striking differences include the formation of additional hydrogen bonding networks involving both zzso and zzso zzso These networks are mainly connecting turns and strongly fix the zzso to the central core of the zzso increasing the overall rigidity of zzso zzso zzso Other possibly stabilizing factors are the zzso of a zzso exposed surface loop, the increased content of zzso in the second zzso and the replacement of three zzso close to the zzso zzso which are in energetically zzso zzso in other zzso by zzso
