zzso vaccination strategies designed to induce zzso zzso zzso are being widely considered for cancer zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso vaccine that codes for ten zzso zzso derived from five melanoma zzso zzso in an artificial zzso or zzso zzso Target cells infected with the melanoma zzso zzso were recognized by three different zzso zzso lines derived from zzso melanoma patients, and zzso responses to seven of the zzso were generated in at least one of six zzso mice zzso with the zzso zzso lines derived from vaccinated transgenic mice were also able to kill melanoma cells in zzso Multiple zzso within the zzso construct were therefore shown to be individually zzso illustrating the feasibility of the zzso approach for melanoma zzso zzso escape from zzso zzso through down regulation of individual tumor zzso and zzso zzso might be overcome by zzso vaccines, which simultaneously target multiple cancer zzso
