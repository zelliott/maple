zzso synthesis zzso by DNA zzso beta at 1 zzso gaps occurs in the main zzso of zzso base zzso zzso DNA zzso beta has no zzso zzso ability, and exhibits high error frequency during DNA zzso zzso continuous correction of zzso DNA damage by zzso repair synthesis might lead to a high spontaneous zzso rate, unless subsequent steps in the repair zzso allow for selective removal of incorporation zzso We show here that both human DNA zzso I and III discriminate strongly between a correctly paired versus a zzso zzso at the 3' position of a zzso in DNA, when zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso The resulting delay in joining after zzso by DNA zzso beta during gap filling could allow for removal of the mismatched terminal zzso by a distinct 3' zzso
