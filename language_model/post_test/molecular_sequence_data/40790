zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause the diseases zzso and zzso zzso A well-studied aspect of zzso by these zzso bacteria is their ability to invade and multiply within zzso zzso In contrast, the means by which zzso zzso and zzso zzso adhere to cells are poorly zzso The purpose of this study was to identify adherence factors expressed by these zzso 

Comparative sequence analyses identified a gene product in the published zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso # zzso that resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso this zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was expressed in zzso coli and shown to significantly increase adherence to human zzso cell lines, specifically zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso II zzso as well as to cultures of normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso with these findings, disruption of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso reduced adherence to all three cell types by zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were also found to contain zzso and zzso of the gene in zzso considerably decreased binding to zzso of zzso and zzso cells and to zzso zzso second zzso gene product highly similar to zzso zzso zzso was identified in the published zzso sequence of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso # zzso The gene specifying this zzso termed zzso appears to be zzso zzso zzso attachment zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso coli expressing zzso displayed greater binding to zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed decreased adherence to these respiratory zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso strain lacking expression of both zzso and zzso was impaired in its ability to thrive inside zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible role for these proteins in survival within professional zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes specify zzso that mediate adherence to zzso cells of the human respiratory zzso The zzso gene product is shared by zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso appears to be a zzso zzso adherence zzso
