zzso small channel zzso found in a variety of organisms are members of the major intrinsic protein zzso zzso and have been shown to facilitate water transport when expressed in zzso zzso We isolated two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exhibits a high degree of sequence zzso to zzso and zzso and thus may belong to the zzso intrinsic protein zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso intrinsic protein zzso is highly zzso to zzso and zzso and therefore may belong to the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the two genes showed a different expression zzso The zzso gene was expressed in a zzso manner, for example, its highest transcript level is found in flowers, relatively low levels in zzso and very low level in leaves and zzso In contrast, zzso was expressed in nearly equal amounts in all the zzso we zzso Also, the expression of zzso and zzso showed a zzso regulation zzso For example, the highest expression level was at 1 week after zzso In addition, the transcript levels of zzso and zzso were increased upon zzso and zzso zzso The biological function of the 2 genes were investigated using two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells expressing these 2 genes were more resistant to high zzso zzso The results suggest that the proteins zzso by these genes may be involved in the zzso in plants under high zzso stress such as under a high salt zzso
