zzso DNA zzso variation in the zzso b gene was determined for two divergent zzso of pocket zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two zzso zzso in a narrow contact zone, but zzso of nuclear markers such as zzso or zzso does not extend much beyond the hybrid zone zzso et zzso zzso We found that despite their zzso the two subspecies shared very similar zzso zzso By a comparison of zzso histories derived from nuclear markers zzso and from zzso zzso sampled in different populations of zzso zzso from New Mexico, we show that apparent similarity is due to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso Evidence of zzso is not limited to the zzso contact zone between these two zzso but extends at least 75 zzso away from zzso The zzso zzso coexists along with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which are inhabited by otherwise pure zzso zzso zzso while further north only typical zzso zzso were zzso Of several potential mechanisms which could lead to such a geographical pattern of variation, we argue that a combination of range shifts due to zzso zzso and genetic drift are most zzso zzso gene transfers due to zzso are historical events which seem rather common among pocket zzso Although they can be identified with careful zzso study using independent data sets, the potential for zzso a gene tree as an zzso tree is great in this and other groups of zzso
