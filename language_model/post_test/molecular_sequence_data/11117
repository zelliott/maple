The zzso technique has been the accepted method for zzso class I typing since the early zzso However, it is often difficult to distinguish two related zzso expressed in an individual due to the zzso nature of the zzso used in this zzso This is especially evident at the zzso zzso whose more than 180 zzso fall into only 4 major interrelated zzso zzso zzso To estimate the error rate in zzso typing due to the zzso nature of zzso we used zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso amplification to zzso 40 individuals who were previously typed as zzso zzso locus zzso zzso revealed that 10 of these 40 individuals zzso were actually zzso at their zzso zzso The zzso locus zzso of 9 of these 10 zzso individuals were further analyzed by zzso zzso gel zzso followed by direct zzso The sequence analysis confirmed that all nine individuals were indeed zzso locus zzso This surprisingly high error rate in zzso definition of zzso molecules argues for the use of rapid zzso techniques in zzso class I zzso even in the setting of solid organ zzso
