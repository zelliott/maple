The bacterial community in soil was screened by using various molecular approaches for bacterial populations that were activated upon addition of different zzso zzso zzso spores, zzso sodium zzso and cabbage plants were added to activate specific bacterial populations as an aid in screening for novel zzso to plant zzso DNA from growing bacteria was specifically extracted from the soil by zzso zzso The captured DNA was zzso by terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso The composition of the dominant bacterial community was also analyzed directly by zzso and by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso After zzso addition to the soil, some bacterial populations increased dramatically and became dominant both in the total and in the actively growing zzso Some of the emerging bands on zzso gels from zzso soil were zzso and found to be similar to known zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some of these sequences could be matched to specific terminal restriction fragments on the zzso zzso After addition of zzso spores, an increase in specific zzso could be observed with zzso zzso for zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso or a combination of molecular approaches, for investigating the composition of complex microbial communities in zzso
