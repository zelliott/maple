The flow of information from zzso receptors to nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso genes is critically dependent on interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso A zzso zzso zzso was selected from zzso zzso libraries based on the zzso zzso motif of zzso This zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso genes in T cells, without affecting the expression of other zzso that require zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence into the natural zzso zzso site increased the zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso that interfere selectively with the zzso interaction without affecting zzso zzso activity may be useful as therapeutic agents that are less toxic than current zzso
