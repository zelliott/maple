Plant height is an important zzso zzso zzso increase in wheat yield during the zzso zzso is mainly due to the widespread zzso of the zzso height zzso zzso We analyzed the natural zzso variations of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in Chinese wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso collections and the zzso zzso in over 1,500 bred zzso and zzso using a modified zzso We identified six new zzso zzso variations zzso eight new zzso zzso variations zzso and six new zzso zzso variations zzso These zzso variations contain single zzso zzso zzso or small insertions and deletions in the coding or zzso regions, involving two zzso zzso and 15 zzso Of which, zzso and zzso resulted in the loss of interactions of zzso zzso could increase plant zzso We found that the zzso contains the same zzso and 197 zzso zzso zzso as reported in zzso Further detection of zzso in zzso wheat zzso and wheat relatives indicated that zzso may originate from zzso These results suggest rich genetic diversity at the zzso zzso and provide new resources for wheat zzso
