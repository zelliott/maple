The new zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which reacted with 28 of a panel of 56 zzso zzso zzso All 28 zzso cells expressed the zzso zzso zzso whereas 10 zzso cells were not recognized by the zzso None of the 17 zzso zzso cells were positive with zzso Thus, zzso divided the zzso zzso zzso of the cell lines into two subgroups, zzso zzso and zzso and therefore defines a new zzso zzso zzso reacted strongly with some zzso cell lines and zzso or not at all with others, suggesting a new split of zzso Compared with cell lines, zzso reacted more zzso with freshly isolated T cells from zzso The zzso rat zzso zzso partially blocked the binding of zzso zzso to a zzso cell zzso By using cell lines zzso with hybrid genes between zzso zzso and zzso zzso as targets in flow zzso critical zzso for the zzso zzso could be mapped to the zzso acid region zzso of the zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso cells indicated that a zzso zzso at position 95 destroyed the zzso zzso and that one or more of the zzso in positions 24, 45, and 46 may be critical, suggesting that it is a zzso zzso It is notable that none of these zzso are located on zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
