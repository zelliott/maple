zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso acts in catalyzing zzso bond formation by zzso its zzso to newly zzso zzso We have found that the two central zzso within the active site zzso motif are critical in determining the exceptional zzso power of zzso zzso that change these two zzso can alter the equilibrium zzso potential of zzso by more than zzso A quantitative explanation for the very high zzso potential of zzso was found by measuring the zzso of a single zzso zzso The zzso of zzso varied dramatically from zzso to zzso and could accurately predict the zzso power of each zzso zzso zzso
