zzso between viruses and zzso the main primary producers in the zzso affect global zzso cycles and zzso Recent studies are increasingly revealing possible cases of gene transfers between zzso and zzso which might have played significant roles in the evolution of zzso zzso However, little has been documented about the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in zzso zzso zzso Here we report zzso evidence for the transfer of seven genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso between the cosmopolitan zzso zzso zzso zzso and its large DNA virus zzso zzso zzso indicate that these genes are prevalent in zzso zzso and zzso strains isolated from different geographic zzso zzso of protein and gene sequence conservation support that these genes are functional in both zzso zzso and zzso This is the first clear case of horizontal gene transfer of multiple functionally linked zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We examine arguments for the possible direction of the gene zzso The zzso direction suggests the existence of ancient viruses that controlled the complex zzso zzso in order to zzso primitive zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso direction suggests that the serial acquisition of genes involved in the same zzso zzso might have been a strategy for the zzso of zzso to stay ahead of their closest relatives in the great evolutionary race for zzso
