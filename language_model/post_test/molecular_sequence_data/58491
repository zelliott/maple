zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso mediates both positive and negative control of zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso is activated by zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The latter is stabilized by cooperative interactions between zzso and zzso Similar interactions at the other zzso units of the zzso zzso coordinate expression of the transport proteins and zzso required for zzso zzso A fundamental question in both zzso and zzso gene regulation is how zzso mechanisms of this sort regulate differential zzso To understand the zzso control mechanism at zzso we have used quantitative footprint and gel shift analysis of zzso and zzso binding to evaluate the distribution of zzso zzso By comparison to zzso for other zzso zzso we hope to understand the roles of individual states in differential gene zzso The results indicate that zzso binds specifically to multiple sites at zzso including both the well recognized zzso site flanked by zzso and zzso and also sites zzso with zzso and zzso zzso to these multiple sites yields both cooperative and competitive interactions between zzso and zzso Based on these findings we propose that zzso functions as a differential zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso Additional high affinity specific sites are located at zzso and near the middle of the zzso pair sequence separating zzso and zzso zzso of the DNA sequence requirement for specific zzso binding suggests that a limited array of zzso and overlapping zzso sites exists at zzso Similar extended zzso but with different arrangements of overlapping zzso and zzso sites, are found at the other zzso zzso We propose that competition and zzso in zzso and zzso binding are important to differential regulation of these zzso
