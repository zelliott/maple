The molecular responses induced during and after an acute exposure to zzso zzso were zzso in liver, zzso and blood cells of juvenile zzso zzso with the aim of developing molecular zzso of environmental zzso zzso Changes in the zzso expression levels of the cell cycle zzso zzso gene and the zzso of zzso expressed genes by suppression zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the liver, and related to well-established zzso zzso zzso expression and assessment of the DNA integrity using the comet zzso and flow zzso zzso exposure resulted in increased zzso zzso levels, suggesting that zzso might be involved in the metabolism of zzso Global DNA damage, detected by the comet zzso was observed in the three zzso zzso but only blood cells showed zzso zzso as zzso by flow zzso Although DNA damage was found in the liver, no induction in zzso gene was observed in this zzso The global zzso approach revealed that zzso of genes related to zzso zzso immune processes and zzso dynamics were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso highlighting the complexity in the response observed in fish exposed to a zzso agent and providing directions for new zzso zzso
