zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso in zzso zzso of the chicken zzso begins with zzso of zzso zzso releasing zzso which in turn release invasive zzso The zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso body type II zzso in zzso and the zzso inner wall of zzso Here we describe that this zzso also binds to the zzso body of zzso and significantly zzso in zzso zzso of zzso Using affinity zzso and protein sequence analysis, zzso is shown to recognize zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, this zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso display library presenting zzso zzso zzso as fusion proteins with the gene VIII product on the surfaces of zzso particles and identified the novel zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso is expressed predominantly at the zzso stage, as detected by Northern zzso Southern zzso analysis in combination with data from the zzso zzso zzso project revealed that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with approximately 12 to 22 copies in zzso zzso Conspicuously, zzso is also zzso and is localized adjacent to another zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that amplification is common for genes zzso zzso wall zzso
