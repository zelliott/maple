The effects of zzso on the spectral properties and zzso stability of different zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso form of bovine or goat zzso resulted in spectral shifts, in both the zzso and zzso zzso similar to those induced by zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso of zzso zzso underwent a pronounced blue shift, zzso with a decrease in quantum zzso Also, in the presence of zzso zzso stability was zzso In contrast, in the case of human and to some extent also zzso zzso the shifts of the CD and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were in the opposite zzso zzso competition of zzso with zzso could be observed for binding to the zzso site of bovine zzso As the main binding mode of zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have assumed that binding occurs primarily at this site with one of the zzso ammonium zzso In order to accommodate the remaining positively charged ammonium groups of zzso a binding model was constructed by computer zzso based on the atomic coordinates of both interacting zzso This model makes use of the cluster of zzso charged zzso zzso present in the zzso sequence of bovine zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be nicely fitted in a space delineated by the zzso site, on the one hand, and zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso Our model, which has been extended to the shorter zzso zzso and zzso is able to fully account for the observed stabilization of bovine (and zzso zzso against zzso zzso and for the observed CD and zzso spectral zzso It also explains why human (and zzso zzso behave zzso
