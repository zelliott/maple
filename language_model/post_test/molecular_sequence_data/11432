zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was applied to the detection and differentiation of viral zzso zzso virus zzso and infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso using primer pairs designed for the amplification of zzso zzso gene fragments of the two zzso The products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, were amplified from the total zzso extracts of zzso cells infected with a total of 9 different strains of either VHS virus or zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso and DNA sequencing of the zzso products demonstrated specificity of the zzso The zzso amplification of zzso or zzso zzso was found to be a simple, highly specific and sensitive method allowing differential diagnosis of VHS and zzso within 8 zzso
