zzso clones of zzso zzso for zzso and basic zzso were isolated from libraries of tobacco mosaic zzso zzso zzso tobacco and zzso The tobacco zzso clones for zzso zzso fell into two different groups, whereas all zzso zzso clones had the same zzso Also, tobacco zzso clones were isolated and one was zzso This zzso zzso corresponding to one of the zzso zzso showed that this zzso zzso gene contains two zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso as deduced from the zzso zzso fully agreed with partial sequences derived from peptides obtained from zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences showed that zzso and zzso are 93 and zzso respectively, identical to the zzso zzso All deduced zzso sequences indicated the presence of an zzso highly zzso signal zzso In addition, the zzso domain present at the zzso of basic zzso from mature tobacco is not present in these zzso zzso Furthermore, the complete coding sequence for the zzso zzso constructed downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter, was used to transform zzso The resulting zzso gene was zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was targeted to the zzso zzso In contrast, a basic zzso of zzso expressed from a zzso zzso was found in total leaf extracts but not in preparations of zzso zzso
