The zzso inward zzso zzso channels have a broad tissue distribution and are implicated in a variety of functional zzso At least seven classes zzso of structurally related inward zzso zzso channels are known, and there are no selective small zzso tools to study their zzso In an effort to develop selective zzso zzso we performed a zzso screen zzso of more than 300,000 small molecules within the zzso for zzso of zzso zzso Here we report one potent zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso and 290 zzso at pH zzso but exhibits little selectivity against other members of zzso family zzso However, zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso and displays weak activity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso making zzso the most selective small zzso inhibitor of the zzso family reported to zzso Because of the high zzso within the zzso zzso channels share a common design of a pore region flanked by two zzso zzso of zzso critical for zzso specificity would be an important basis for future development of more specific and potent zzso zzso Using zzso channels between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso we have identified zzso and zzso within zzso segment of zzso as molecular zzso critical for the potency of zzso zzso zzso Double zzso of the corresponding zzso of zzso to those of zzso zzso and zzso transplants zzso zzso to zzso Together, the combination of a zzso zzso family selective inhibitor and identification of molecular zzso for the specificity provides both a tool and a model system to enable further zzso studies of zzso of zzso inward zzso zzso zzso
