zzso zzso of a zzso zzso activity from zzso cells that stimulates zzso alternative 3' zzso sites in a zzso manner resulted in the identification of zzso a novel general zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso protein of unknown function, were previously identified in mouse and zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and has an zzso motif preceded by an extensive zzso zzso zzso human zzso expressed in zzso functionally zzso with zzso proteins and strongly activates zzso of both zzso and alternatively spliced zzso We conclude that zzso is not only a potential regulator of alternative zzso but may also play a more fundamental role as a general zzso of zzso zzso
