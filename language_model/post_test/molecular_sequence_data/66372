The human zzso precursor protein zzso is the precursor of zzso a zzso with the potential to create zzso plaques in zzso zzso in the human zzso gene are associated with the familial form of Alzheimer's zzso In addition, differential expression of three alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and 770 zzso acids is linked to the zzso In this study, two novel transcript zzso of zzso zzso have been identified, producing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These are highly zzso to zzso zzso from other zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the gene is expressed in all 30 examined zzso zzso and in a selected subset of these, differential representation of the three major zzso transcript zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of 770 zzso acids clearly zzso in zzso zzso while in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and 770 zzso acids are expressed at equivalent zzso zzso a zzso cell hybrid panel, the zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso 13 in either the zzso or zzso zzso A large pig population was screened for single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 17 and zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso were zzso however, the zzso zzso of two silent zzso and two zzso zzso varied significantly among zzso
