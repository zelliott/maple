zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso protein family, which zzso in alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 10 in zzso zzso symbol zzso may play an important role in regulating the functional activity of zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso In this study, we found that 297 consecutive zzso zzso zzso this alternatively spliced zzso 10 were identical between human, green zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso consecutive zzso zzso were identical between human and bird zzso In addition, a zzso sequence spanning this zzso region showed 85 and zzso conservation in zzso and bird DNA, zzso Unexpected zzso sequence conservation between human and mouse zzso has recently been zzso We have now identified zzso zzso sequence conservation from zzso to zzso The striking conservation of this large segment of zzso zzso sequence suggests an important role in zzso zzso site selection and may function in regulating the production of functional zzso
