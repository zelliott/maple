The robotic mouse is an zzso dominant zzso that arose from a large-scale chemical zzso zzso It has a zzso zzso gait and develops zzso zzso cell loss in the zzso in a striking zzso pattern, as well as zzso zzso and physical mapping of the disease locus led to the identification of a zzso zzso in a highly zzso region of zzso a putative zzso factor that has been previously implicated in zzso We demonstrate that zzso is specifically expressed in zzso cells, and we zzso that the expression of zzso zzso leads to zzso This function was not identified through zzso studies, highlighting the power of zzso zzso in the mouse to identify new pathways involved in neurological zzso
