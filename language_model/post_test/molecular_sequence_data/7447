A marked increase in zzso zzso concentration was observed in rat plasma collected after intravenous infusion of zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso AM concentration increased already after 1 h exposure to 5 zzso of zzso and was elevated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 h after injection in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso control zzso Plasma zzso level increased in a zzso manner in a range of zzso to zzso zzso of zzso AM gene zzso in zzso rats was zzso more than zzso in zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso even in skeletal muscle, in which AM was not thought to be produced in zzso These results, along with our recent data that AM production in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells zzso is zzso with zzso indicate that AM production is highly zzso in blood vessel, lung and zzso by administration of zzso Since zzso express zzso zzso zzso AM is deduced to actually exert a zzso effect especially in the zzso zzso
