zzso zzso proteins zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit blood zzso with zzso zzso constants, and have been targeted as novel pharmaceutical zzso zzso and zzso inhibit factor zzso by binding to its active site, whereas zzso binds to factor zzso at a different, as yet unidentified, site and the zzso zzso complex zzso the tissue zzso zzso zzso We have undertaken zzso studies of zzso including the calculation of a solution structure, and found that the protein is zzso with five zzso bonds, but is extremely flexible, especially in the zzso zzso The zzso secondary shifts and zzso zzso zzso indicate the presence of some beta structure and a short zzso but the intervening zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of large zzso motions on a zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso and in the zzso loop, indicating that the zzso zzso observed in the zzso structures is due to flexibility of the zzso chain in these zzso zzso may well be an important factor in the zzso function of zzso because it must interact with other proteins in the zzso of blood zzso We suggest that this inhibitor is likely to become structured on binding to factor zzso because the zzso of the tissue zzso zzso complex requires both zzso and factor zzso
