In experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variable zzso gene usage by zzso T cells has been reported to be zzso restricted at the zzso zzso This study was designed to verify zzso usage by zzso T cells at the protein zzso We generated two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for a zzso associated zzso expressed by the majority of zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso T cells either exhibited a dominant usage of the zzso zzso chain recognized by the recently generated zzso zzso and zzso or showed diverse zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso or of zzso actively induced with the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso led to a zzso but zzso reduction of clinical zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso had no clear effect on active zzso Our data show that at least three different zzso are used by zzso zzso T cells in zzso an animal model for human inflammatory zzso
