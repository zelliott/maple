The chemical shift assignments and secondary structure of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso protein of molecular mass 20 zzso have been determined from zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired on a zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure elements were defined on the basis of chemical shifts, zzso alpha H zzso zzso zzso zzso and the location of slowly exchanging zzso zzso The protein contains four zzso the relative zzso of which were determined on the basis of zzso zzso zzso The four zzso are arranged in an zzso orientation, as found in other zzso bundle zzso The overall zzso of zzso is similar to that of the X-ray zzso structure for zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 77, zzso zzso between the X-ray structure and the solution structure are evident in the zzso tail, where the solution structure has a zzso compared with the zzso found in the crystal structure and the small zzso zzso encompassing zzso in the zzso and CD loop in the crystal structure is less zzso
