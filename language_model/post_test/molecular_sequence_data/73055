A zzso protein present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat zzso has been isolated, the sequences of two zzso peptides were zzso and on the basis of these its zzso partially zzso The zzso protein is almost certainly identical to a major integral zzso of this size in the rat zzso plasma zzso since its predicted zzso sequence is the same as that recently determined for this zzso by zzso acid zzso Moreover, the predicted partial sequence zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein is highly zzso to the corresponding region of a human zzso zzso zzso which was cloned simultaneously and proposed to be a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the protein consists of a very short zzso zzso domain followed by a single zzso segment and a large zzso domain containing the zzso zzso Thus this study establishes the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the first integral membrane zzso zzso to be zzso The membrane zzso zzso was more abundant in the plasma zzso than the low density zzso of the zzso and in contrast to some other proteins found in zzso zzso it did not zzso to the plasma membrane in response to treatment of the cells with zzso
