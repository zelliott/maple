zzso zzso zzso are the zzso for zzso targeting of newly zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The zzso responsible for the initial step in the synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an zzso arrangement that requires a zzso for zzso Recent cloning of zzso and genes zzso these zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso are zzso by a single gene as a zzso whereas the zzso is zzso by a second zzso The zzso plots of the deduced zzso acid sequences suggested that the zzso and zzso but not the zzso contain zzso zzso Access to these zzso allowed us to express a soluble form of human zzso zzso by removing the putative zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso Because this modification prevented precursor processing to mature zzso and zzso the native zzso sequence was replaced by a zzso site for zzso When the modified zzso zzso precursor and wild type zzso zzso were zzso in zzso or zzso cells, a zzso zzso activity in these cells zzso the precursor and produced an active and processed soluble zzso with an zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso exhibited specific activity and zzso preferences similar to the wild type bovine zzso and was able to zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso
