An integral zzso membrane protein zzso of zzso has previously been zzso cloned and zzso and suggested to function as a zzso import zzso However, this protein has also been proposed to function as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Phelps, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso Here we have zzso zzso after expression of its gene in zzso coli and zzso its ability to bind to various zzso containing signal sequences for protein zzso into zzso zzso or the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso contains a binding site specific for the signal sequence region of zzso zzso These data are consistent with the previous assignment of zzso as an import zzso and are discussed with regard to the apparently conflicting assignment of this protein as zzso zzso
