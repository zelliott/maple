zzso zzso virus zzso zzso many species of cat, and is related to zzso causing a similar zzso zzso selective 2' zzso zzso zzso by primer extension zzso a technique that allows structural interrogation at each zzso was used to map the secondary structure of the zzso packaging signal zzso Previous studies of this zzso showed four zzso zzso extensive long-range interactions zzso and a small, zzso zzso zzso within the gag open reading frame zzso that may act as a zzso initiation site zzso enabling the virus to package two copies of its zzso Our analyses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest that although the four zzso zzso are zzso structures, the zzso and 3' regions previously shown to form zzso also adopt an alternative, yet similarly zzso zzso in which the putative zzso is zzso and which may thus zzso zzso and zzso functions over zzso SHAPE and in zzso zzso zzso were used to examine zzso zzso zzso contacts appear to be made between zzso loop sequences in zzso As this zzso is located within the gag ORF, recognition of a zzso zzso provides a possible mechanism for the specific packaging of zzso over spliced viral zzso
