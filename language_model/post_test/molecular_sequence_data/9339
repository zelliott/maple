The aim of this study was to characterize viral strains involved in this zzso 

The sequences of zzso junction of zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso samples, were used for zzso zzso 

All but 1 of the zzso sequences were zzso zzso 1 was zzso zzso A zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso This cluster included also 2 zzso strains isolated in Germany zzso and France zzso from zzso that, in turn, were reported to be genetically correlated to zzso strains circulating in Tuscany in zzso Among the males harboring an zzso strain belonging to the zzso zzso reported to be zzso and zzso were zzso 2 with acute zzso zzso 

The outbreak occurred in Rome in zzso involving high proportion of zzso zzso is sustained by a zzso zzso strain, circulating around the same period also in other European zzso zzso factors zzso zzso spread among zzso zzso such as high risk behavior and prolonged zzso zzso need to be further zzso zzso identification of outbreaks with one or the same source of infection may be helpful to implement preventive measures addressing at risk zzso
