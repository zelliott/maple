In this study, we have cloned a novel zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso This gene was expressed in zzso coli using the zzso promoter system, and the zzso was characterized after partial zzso First, the partial DNA zzso zzso zzso was amplified from the total zzso via zzso using zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso was prepared via the screening of the zzso zzso zzso library using the zzso partial DNA zzso As a result, the zzso gene was determined to consist of a zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso which encodes for a zzso acid zzso which is itself composed of an zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso a zzso mature zzso and a long zzso region encompassing zzso zzso The predicted molecular weights of the zzso and the mature protein were calculated as zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso The results of sequence analysis and alignment revealed a significant degree of sequence similarity with other zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which characterize the C1 family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequences of the novel gene were deposited into the zzso database under the zzso numbers, zzso and zzso zzso The results of Northern zzso analysis revealed the zzso zzso size of the transcript and ubiquitous expression throughout the entirety of the body, head, gut, and skin, which suggested that the zzso may be grouped within the zzso zzso zzso The region zzso for the mature form of the zzso was then zzso into the zzso expression zzso following zzso amplification using the designed zzso including the initiation and termination zzso The zzso zzso zzso were generated in a range of zzso to zzso of the total cell proteins in the zzso coli zzso strain for 8 zzso The results of zzso and Western zzso analysis indicated that a zzso zzso of approximately 25 zzso zzso zzso was zzso The optimal pH and temperature of the zzso were determined to be approximately zzso and 35 degrees, respectively, thereby indicating that the zzso zzso is a member of the alkaline zzso zzso The evaluation of zzso specificity indicated that the zzso zzso was more active towards zzso or zzso and did not efficiently cleave the zzso with zzso zzso acids at the zzso zzso The zzso evidenced zzso activity on the zzso zzso plate zzso
