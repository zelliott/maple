Human zzso 6 zzso and 10 zzso are zzso zzso zzso We previously found that zzso and zzso are highly zzso in zzso zzso tumors and demonstrated that serum levels of zzso and zzso are valuable zzso for zzso cancer diagnosis and zzso Our aim is to purify and characterize these two zzso from zzso fluid of zzso cancer zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso were measured with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were then subjected to zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed with synthetic zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were present in zzso cancer zzso fluid at zzso ranging from zzso and zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso were present in the free zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso fluid were zzso with a molecular mass of 30 zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity, whereas no zzso activity was observed for zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso could be suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso 

The majority of zzso zzso by the zzso tumor cells into the zzso fluid are present in the zzso zzso form, possessing weak zzso zzso zzso All zzso present in zzso cancer zzso zzso are in the zzso zzso form and have no zzso zzso zzso
