The zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is characterized by adult onset zzso resulting from zzso in zzso a gene zzso an zzso protein with a putative zzso zzso As zzso is also induced in zzso motor zzso the zzso of its function can shed light on previously zzso mechanisms common to degenerative and zzso zzso zzso modeling revealed that zzso and three related gene products constitute a new zzso of zzso with a distinctive zzso zzso To test whether the zzso domain is functionally essential, transgenic mice were generated that expressed zzso or a zzso site zzso of zzso selectively in zzso cells using the zzso zzso When bred onto a zzso zzso background, wild type but not zzso zzso rescued zzso behavior and zzso cell zzso zzso loss of zzso in zzso cells leads directly to their zzso and zzso zzso domain is essential for survival of these zzso
