zzso DNA sequences in plasmids can adopt zzso zzso structures zzso zzso in response to negative zzso stress and low zzso A zzso insert adopts two zzso zzso structures, which differ in degree of zzso zzso The zzso forms of individual zzso were separated by zzso gel zzso and their zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso patterns of the individual zzso indicate that in the more mobile form zzso the zzso of the zzso strand zzso in a triplex while in the other zzso the zzso forms the zzso The zzso form is more stable than the zzso form at low negative zzso zzso Because of the difference in zzso zzso the zzso form becomes relatively less stable as the zzso density zzso zzso models of the two forms show that providing there is no linkage at the tips of the triple zzso segments one more positive twist is localized in the zzso form than in the zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso strand of the zzso form is less accessible to zzso than that of the zzso form as assessed by its lower zzso to zzso Consideration of a zzso loop model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso suggests that the unique stability of the zzso form results from zzso base pairs between zzso of the zzso loop and the zzso strand as it exits the zzso
