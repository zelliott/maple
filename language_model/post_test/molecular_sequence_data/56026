zzso a protein present in rabbit bone zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to bind zzso in a zzso regulated zzso We have zzso zzso from such extracts and determined the partial zzso zzso The sequence obtained shows zzso similarity with the sequence of the plasma zzso zzso from other zzso zzso This difference is consistent with the difference between zzso from different zzso We conclude that the rabbit zzso zzso is related to zzso The similarity between zzso and zzso is reinforced by analysis with Western blots of one- and two-dimensional zzso These show that zzso like zzso is present in serum and that migration of zzso from serum and zzso zzso zzso on two-dimensional gels, zzso with that of human zzso zzso zzso from serum, zzso zzso extracts and in zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso cross react with human zzso These data imply that the rabbit zzso zzso is closely related to zzso but do not rule out the possibility that these molecules are functionally zzso
