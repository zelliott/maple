The complete zzso zzso sequence of the red zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso is presented zzso zzso zzso zzso the circular DNA contains 233 zzso genes and 29 zzso zzso In addition, several genes previously unknown to red zzso zzso are present in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso and another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are very similar in sequence and share significant zzso In contrast, less zzso is shared between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso representatives of zzso and zzso Nevertheless, the gene content of all six red zzso zzso zzso here studied is highly zzso and a large core repertoire of zzso genes can be discerned in zzso
