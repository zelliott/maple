Species of zzso with zzso zzso include important forest pathogens and agents of blue stain in zzso They are commonly found in association with forest zzso such as bark zzso During a survey of zzso zzso in eastern parts of Finland and neighboring Russia, species belonging to the zzso zzso were isolated from 12 different bark zzso species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the most economically important zzso in the zzso Identification of these zzso was based on zzso DNA sequence comparisons for three gene regions and zzso zzso A total of ten zzso were zzso These belonged to six different species complexes in zzso The zzso analyses provided an opportunity to redefine the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to consider the species emerging from the survey within the context of these zzso The species included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso described here as zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, species closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated but their identity could not be zzso The overall results indicate that the diversity of zzso species in the zzso forests remains poorly understood and that further studies are needed to clarify the status of several species or species zzso
