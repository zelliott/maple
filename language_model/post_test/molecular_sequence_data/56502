zzso in the steel zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are associated with impaired germ cell development in zzso Two forms of zzso zzso one more steadily associated with the plasma membrane and one more easily released as a soluble zzso We report here that the expression of the two zzso coding for the two different form of zzso is zzso regulated in mouse zzso At birth the two zzso are expressed at an equal zzso Starting after 6 days of life, and in parallel to initiation of germ cell zzso the zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso becomes more zzso zzso cells, and especially zzso express zzso thus zzso zzso could mediate zzso between zzso cells and germ zzso We find, in fact, that zzso cells from zzso zzso mice, which do not express the zzso for the zzso form of zzso are unable to bind germ zzso Introduction of a zzso expressing the zzso form, but not the soluble form, of zzso restores the ability of zzso cells from zzso zzso mice to bind germ zzso These data suggest that preferential expression of the zzso form of zzso in zzso cells may have a role in zzso zzso of zzso germ cells to zzso zzso
