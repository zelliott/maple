A synthetic DNA probe designed to detect coding sequences for zzso factor 4 and zzso zzso zzso III zzso human zzso zzso zzso was used to identify several similar sequences in total human zzso zzso analysis of a corresponding zzso zzso zzso isolated from a human zzso library demonstrated the existence of a zzso of zzso factor 4, designated zzso The gene for zzso consisted of three zzso and two zzso zzso 1 coded for a zzso zzso leader sequence that had zzso sequence zzso with the leader sequence for zzso but, in contrast, contained a zzso zzso region with four zzso zzso zzso 2 coded for a zzso segment that was zzso identical with the corresponding segment of the mature zzso sequence containing the zzso and zzso core zzso zzso 3 coded for the zzso zzso region corresponding to a domain specifying zzso and cellular zzso However, zzso had zzso acid differences at three positions in the zzso zzso end that were all zzso among human, zzso and rat zzso These differences should significantly affect the secondary structure and zzso properties of the protein based on considerations of the bovine zzso crystal zzso By comparing the zzso zzso sequence with the known human zzso and the rat zzso zzso zzso we identified potential genetic regulatory regions for zzso zzso zzso and human zzso genes had identical zzso sequences zzso to the promoter zzso The zzso positions appeared to zzso approximately to the boundaries of the protein functional zzso
