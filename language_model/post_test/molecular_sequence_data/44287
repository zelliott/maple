zzso zzso is a potent T cell zzso However, the signaling pathways by which zzso mediates its zzso effect are not fully zzso One of the members of the zzso protein zzso zzso family, zzso zzso is known to be activated by zzso We have now investigated the response to zzso of two other members of the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which respond primarily to stressful and inflammatory stimuli zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso and another T cell growth factor, zzso activate both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso activity with a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso that prevents zzso of its downstream zzso zzso protein zzso correlated with suppression of zzso and zzso T cell zzso These data indicate that in T cells zzso zzso has a role in zzso the zzso zzso
