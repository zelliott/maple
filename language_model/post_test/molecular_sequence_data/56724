A zzso DNA zzso the zzso gamma zzso response region zzso is necessary for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso gamma zzso and sufficient for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso By using extracts from zzso cells, three protein complexes will assemble in zzso on a zzso core region in the 3' domain of the zzso The sequence of this core resembles the zzso sequence zzso described for the zzso zzso zzso in this zzso core region prevent complex assembly and result in the loss of zzso induction of reporter zzso containing the zzso In addition to the zzso core region, a zzso region of the zzso is necessary for optimal zzso induction and for formation of one of the zzso zzso By zzso zzso we show that a zzso zzso first identified as a component of zzso the zzso zzso complex, is present in at least two of the zzso zzso zzso can induce the formation of the zzso zzso zzso complex but not the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso does not result in appreciable zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso or zzso containing the zzso Thus, these data demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein is required for zzso induction of zzso gamma zzso and suggest that an additional complex may be required for optimal expression and zzso
