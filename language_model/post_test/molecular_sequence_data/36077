The zzso sequence of two zzso DNA fragments of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been determined, completing the sequence analysis of the so-called variable region (see also de zzso et zzso 1988, zzso zzso zzso 27, zzso Analysis of the entire zzso variable region sequence revealed the presence of a zzso cluster of imperfect, zzso repeated zzso flanked by DNA of unique zzso Both repetitive and unique DNA evolve zzso but comparison to the closely related strain zzso zzso indicated that the repetitive cluster is more prone to sequence and size zzso The variable region is transcribed into zzso of varying lengths but appears to be devoid of genes zzso zzso proteins or zzso as judged from computer zzso Moreover, genes that could zzso guide zzso involved in producing the known edited zzso zzso sequences are also zzso The repetitive DNA cluster within this region consists of 14 blocks each containing one 130 zzso repeat and a variable number of 19 zzso zzso A duplicated sequence was identified zzso which proved to be identical to the zzso zzso zzso of the universal zzso zzso involved in initiation of leading strand zzso This suggests a role for these sequences in the initiation of zzso DNA zzso With the data presented in this report, the zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been zzso
