zzso initially identified as an zzso zzso has additional functions at DNA damage zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso formed nuclear zzso minutes after zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was required for zzso of these zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso factor in the DNA damage response zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, decreased levels of zzso were detected in several types of human cancer, with zzso expression being zzso correlated with zzso instability and zzso These results identify zzso as a crucial DNA damage regulator in the zzso pathways and suggest that it functions as a tumor zzso zzso
