Class switch DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are central to the maturation of the zzso zzso Both processes involve DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso proteins are recruited to zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby promoting zzso region zzso and introduction of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the last complement of the zzso set of zzso zzso It is highly zzso in evolution and is essential to zzso and zzso zzso We used the recently generated knockout zzso mice to address the role of zzso in zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso alters both zzso and zzso zzso B cells switched in zzso to zzso and zzso but displayed preferential targeting of the zzso (R zzso A or G, Y zzso C or zzso W zzso A or zzso motif by zzso and zzso zzso and introduced more insertions and fewer zzso zzso in zzso and zzso DNA zzso as compared with zzso B zzso zzso mice showed only a slight decrease in the frequency of zzso in the zzso DNA downstream of the rearranged zzso zzso However, the residual zzso were altered in zzso They comprised a decreased proportion of zzso at zzso and showed preferential zzso targeting by zzso at zzso Thus, the zzso zzso protein plays a role in both zzso and zzso
