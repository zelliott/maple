Recent zzso analyses of DNA sequences suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are extant sister zzso zzso the shared aquatic zzso of these zzso may be zzso This molecular view is contradicted by zzso data that overwhelmingly support a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a close relationship between zzso and extinct zzso zzso According to the fossil evidence, zzso zzso and anatomical zzso between zzso and zzso are interpreted as zzso or primitive zzso In this report, competing interpretations of whale origins are tested through zzso analyses of the zzso protein gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dogs, and zzso In combination with published DNA zzso the zzso data zzso support a zzso zzso and are inconsistent with the zzso zzso If the zzso favored by fossil evidence is accepted, the convergence at the DNA level between zzso and zzso is remarkable in its distribution across three genetic zzso zzso the linked milk zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
