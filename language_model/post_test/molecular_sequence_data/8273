The guinea pig zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso is zzso to participate in the interaction between the zzso and egg plasma zzso The beta zzso of guinea pig zzso zzso zzso contains a domain with zzso to zzso snake zzso proteins that bind to zzso via an zzso domain containing the zzso zzso This raises the question of whether an egg zzso serves as a zzso for zzso Although mouse eggs express zzso zzso their role in mouse zzso is zzso zzso we examined zzso for two different hallmarks of zzso function, zzso dependence of zzso binding on zzso zzso and the ability to inhibit zzso binding with zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso binding to zzso zzso eggs is supported by zzso zzso or zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient for zzso fusion, with zzso zzso zzso being the most effective zzso In addition, zzso could be partially inhibited with various zzso zzso which caused a decrease in zzso fusion by zzso This partial zzso of fusion with zzso peptides prompted the cloning of the mouse zzso of zzso beta zzso referred to as zzso zzso to determine if it possessed the zzso zzso or a different zzso acid sequence in its zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed during zzso and zzso zzso of zzso shares significant similarities to zzso beta throughout the length of the zzso from the signal sequence to the zzso zzso The full-length deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso beta has the zzso zzso (instead of zzso in its cell recognition zzso zzso containing this zzso sequence decrease the binding and fusion of zzso with zzso zzso eggs by approximately zzso suggesting that the zzso domain of zzso beta zzso in the interaction between zzso and egg zzso
