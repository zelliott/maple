The zzso beta zzso of the four human zzso hormones are zzso and mapping studies are zzso in many laboratories to delineate the zzso acid zzso responsible for zzso binding and zzso zzso on the human zzso beta zzso zzso zzso obtained using synthetic zzso chemically modified zzso and zzso forms prepared via zzso zzso have suggested that zzso acid zzso enclosed by the zzso zzso loop between zzso and zzso may contribute to zzso binding and perhaps zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso acid sequence is referred to as a zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso to prepare single zzso acid zzso replacements at positions not previously investigated in full length beta zzso these include zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was studied in an effort to determine whether changes immediately adjacent to the zzso loop alter zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for zzso beta were zzso into a zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso cells containing a zzso integrated gene for bovine zzso The zzso of total expressed zzso beta in zzso form with the bovine alpha zzso were determined by zzso The zzso zzso were zzso in zzso using a competitive binding zzso with zzso and zzso production, both in the transformed zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso beta zzso containing the replacements zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited normal alpha zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
