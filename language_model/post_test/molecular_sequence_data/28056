zzso contains 8 zzso zzso distributed across the zzso zzso To study their possible functions, we have replaced them one at a time by zzso in addition, zzso and zzso have been replaced by zzso The zzso were prepared by cassette zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso expression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The replacement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and of zzso and zzso by zzso did not significantly alter the zzso zzso or affect their zzso zzso However, substitution of the remaining zzso by zzso had the following zzso 1) zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave zzso zzso by 20 zzso and resulted in reduced zzso pumping to about zzso 2) As also reported previously zzso zzso zzso Stern, zzso zzso Chao, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused large blue shifts zzso and 40 zzso zzso in the zzso and affected zzso zzso 3) The substitution of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso acid instability on these zzso The spectral shifts indicate that zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso interact with zzso It is proposed that these zzso probably along with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form a retinal binding zzso We discuss the role of zzso zzso that are zzso in zzso zzso and the related family of zzso zzso
