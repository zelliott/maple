zzso is a member of the zzso zzso a newly discovered class of DNA breakage and reunion zzso These zzso are involved in the formation of zzso closed hairpin DNA ends that are found in linear zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are generated by zzso resolution, where the zzso linear DNA ends are processed by DNA breakage followed by joining of DNA free ends to the complementary strand of the same zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso hairpin formation through a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso and type zzso zzso In the present study we have zzso the reaction mechanism of zzso The zzso was found to efficiently zzso a zzso with a zzso zzso at each zzso site, similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso Using such a zzso to trap the zzso zzso zzso coupled with affinity zzso and mass zzso we report a new, zzso approach to directly determine the position of the zzso acid in the zzso which is linked to the zzso We report that zzso 335 is the active site zzso in zzso strengthening the link between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a distinct pattern of zzso zzso with similarities, but distinct differences from the above zzso was zzso The differences include the apparent absence of a general acid zzso as well as the zzso of the final zzso in the zzso zzso Finally, two signature motifs zzso and zzso near the zzso zzso of aligned zzso zzso are zzso
