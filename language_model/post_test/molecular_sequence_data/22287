The naturally occurring zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso bacterial species, can prevent the induction of the tumor necrosis factor zzso induced by enteric zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A can exist in two forms, namely as a zzso or zzso As it is unknown which of these forms is responsible for the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso A, compound 4 was prepared, and its inflammatory properties were zzso This compound contains a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which prevents zzso and therefore is zzso suited to determine whether the zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso 4 was zzso by a highly zzso approach with a key zzso building block zzso with a set of zzso protecting zzso The novel synthetic compound lacks zzso properties, as indicated by an absence of zzso protein zzso This compound was, however, able to antagonize the production of zzso induced by enteric zzso this indicates that the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso A is responsible for its biological zzso
