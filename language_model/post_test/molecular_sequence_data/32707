zzso zzso was isolated from feces of a Korean zzso dog with mild zzso and the isolate was genetically zzso zzso zzso was detected in the feces using a commercial zzso zzso detection kit and zzso effects were observed in a cell line zzso with the zzso The virus isolate zzso was identified as zzso zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The strain displayed zzso and zzso identity with the zzso genes of a canine zzso isolate zzso from Italy and the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso However, the zzso isolate exhibited only zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with the zzso zzso canine zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso strain led to the zzso of zzso in a different cluster than other canine zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the cluster of canine zzso zzso zzso The Korean isolate was thus more closely related to the zzso isolate than the other zzso for which sequence data is zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region revealed 6 zzso acid variations between the new isolate and zzso After 5 passages in cell culture, the zzso strain remained zzso for young zzso in which zzso resulted in zzso and virus shedding in the zzso
