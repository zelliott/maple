zzso zzso zzso channels zzso by zzso and zzso genes are required for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Here we report the identification and the characterization of zzso a new zzso channel zzso found in zzso zzso zzso contains six putative zzso regions and a zzso zzso domain that show high zzso with zzso channels of higher animals as well as zzso The expression of zzso is detected from early stages in zzso development and restricted in five sensory zzso of zzso including zzso zzso While a zzso zzso zzso displays normal zzso to volatile zzso the zzso worms exhibit impaired zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso a new member of zzso channel zzso may play a critical role in sensation or response of zzso stress in zzso zzso
