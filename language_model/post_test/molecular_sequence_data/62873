zzso is a zzso factor with an essential role in eye, central nervous system, and zzso zzso Its expression pattern is restricted to these specific zzso within the developing zzso Here four zzso elements are identified in zzso zzso 7, showing a high level of sequence conservation between human, zzso zzso and zzso Three of these are shown to act as zzso zzso directing expression of a reporter gene to distinct zzso of the zzso expression zzso zzso regulates gene expression in late eye development, zzso drives expression in the zzso and in the developing heart tube where zzso is not normally zzso while zzso directs expression in zzso zzso is shown to be zzso in the zzso responding to absence of zzso We identify a highly zzso zzso recognition site and demonstrate its ability to bind zzso zzso zzso is embedded in a zzso island, and we identify a novel zzso transcript which zzso from this zzso zzso analysis of evolutionary zzso sequences zzso novel zzso elements that govern the regulation of the complex zzso and quantitative expression of zzso
