zzso zzso zzso and zzso members of a novel protein family in the zzso zzso zzso are putative sensors or receptors in the stress zzso zzso characterization suggests that the zzso family are upstream regulators of the zzso zzso zzso cascade and are required for the heat shock response and for maintenance of cell wall zzso The zzso proteins share sequence zzso at their N zzso they have a zzso motif and a zzso domain predicted to be zzso a zzso domain suggested to be zzso and a zzso highly charged C zzso that may be involved in zzso zzso Although a role for the zzso genes in maintenance of cell wall integrity has been firmly established, little is known about the properties of the zzso As reported here, to study its properties in zzso we zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso with the membrane zzso after high-speed zzso zzso experiments show that zzso is an integral membrane protein present in two zzso one zzso by zzso the other zzso zzso zzso Our results also show that zzso is zzso and zzso To characterize the contribution of different zzso to the function of zzso we generated various deletion zzso Analysis of the properties and function of the zzso proteins shows that the predicted zzso zzso domain is required for zzso zzso as well as its zzso A zzso zzso protein lacking the putative zzso domain is not functional and partitions to the soluble zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso cell growth, with the N zzso alone being sufficient for this zzso This suggests that zzso may function in a complex with at least one other protein important for normal cell zzso
