The region zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the class II zzso zzso chain protein is essential for its functional interaction with zzso zzso A zzso set of peptides that zzso this region, designated the class II zzso zzso peptides zzso bind to many zzso proteins and inhibit the binding of zzso zzso The zzso of the reactions between zzso and five different zzso class II zzso proteins have been zzso zzso of zzso binding was confirmed by competition with zzso zzso Large differences in the reaction rates were zzso For example, zzso of zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso bind to zzso zzso at a site that involves the zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that the zzso binding site is within the zzso binding zzso It is further suggested that these differences in kinetic zzso of zzso protein complexes might affect the diversity of zzso peptides bound to class II zzso zzso
