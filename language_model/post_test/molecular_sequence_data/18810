zzso zzso are enteric pathogens that are detected in stool samples from zzso Five zzso are currently described in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and within the zzso sequences are further divided into zzso according to genetic zzso and zzso zzso In this study, stool specimens from Belgian cattle were screened by zzso All of the sequences that were detected were zzso related to zzso III zzso 2 bovine zzso confirming their higher prevalence in comparison with strains from zzso zzso When other sequences from around the world were introduced, zzso zzso allowed neither the determination of zzso lineages over time nor the deduction of zzso for zzso 2 bovine zzso Three complete zzso 2 bovine zzso sequences were also compared genetically zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the genetic divergence of the complete zzso of these three strains was relatively low, but a region of the zzso protein zzso by zzso the zzso region of the zzso gene zzso by zzso and a region of the minor structural protein zzso by zzso seem to be the most exposed to genetic zzso zzso zzso also showed that genetic evolution of zzso III, zzso 2 bovine zzso over a 30-year period seemed to be lower than that already reported for zzso from the zzso 3 and 4 in zzso zzso
