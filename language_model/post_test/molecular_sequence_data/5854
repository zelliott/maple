The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso and characterized by zzso zzso It has a total molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and contains 1 zzso and 12 zzso atoms per zzso The zzso activities for hydrogen consumption and production were determined to be 174 and 89 zzso zzso zzso As isolated, under zzso conditions, this zzso exhibits zzso signals characteristic of the zzso centers in zzso zzso zzso signal at zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso and zzso signal at zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso as well as an intense zzso signal centered at g zzso zzso due to the oxidized zzso zzso The zzso profile under hydrogen atmosphere is remarkably similar to that of other zzso zzso The signals observed for the oxidized state disappear, first being zzso by the zzso type signal zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso which upon long incubation under hydrogen yields the split zzso signal due to interaction with the reduced zzso zzso
