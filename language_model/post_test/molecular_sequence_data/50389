Clara cell zzso protein zzso is an abundant zzso protein zzso and zzso by zzso zzso cells lining the respiratory and terminal zzso of the zzso zzso gene expression is an zzso zzso marker within the zzso zzso zzso cellular differentiation in the zzso respiratory zzso during late fetal and early zzso zzso To define the mechanisms that establish and maintain gene expression within this zzso zzso growth hormone zzso gene zzso were created and used to generate transgenic zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from F1 transgenic offspring and normal zzso revealed that zzso elements within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene were sufficient to direct zzso expression of human growth zzso In zzso zzso and zzso of individual zzso revealed that human growth hormone expression in the respiratory zzso of these mice was confined to Clara cells, consistent with observations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso founder animals and F1 transgenic offspring exhibited an unusual zzso of growth zzso and delayed hair appearance, suggesting a unique effect of human growth hormone on normal zzso zzso zzso growth hormone transgenic mice provide a model to dissect the zzso mechanisms regulating gene expression during pulmonary zzso cell growth and zzso Definition of the zzso elements determining such zzso expression will be of value in strategies for the zzso gene therapy of human pulmonary zzso
