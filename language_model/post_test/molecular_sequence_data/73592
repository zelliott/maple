zzso chain reaction analysis of a large collection of zzso with zzso zzso revealed four zzso that are zzso related to all the zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso under stringent conditions to only a limited portion of the T4 zzso that encodes virus head, zzso joining and zzso tail zzso Except for this region, no extensive zzso was detected between most pairs of the different zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed substantial zzso sequence divergence from T4 zzso zzso to zzso and random zzso sequencing of this zzso indicated that more than a third of its sequences had no zzso zzso to zzso Among those sequences related to the zzso genes were zzso structural components including the constituents of the zzso base zzso Only a few sequences had zzso to T4 early zzso these included zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and the large zzso of DNA zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by restriction zzso that are unable to digest the zzso zzso which contain zzso zzso zzso This suggests that only limited zzso modifications must be present in the zzso zzso zzso Conservation of much of the zzso region of these diverse zzso zzso may reflect particularly strong sequence constraints on these gene zzso However, other explanations are considered, including the possibility that the various zzso segments were acquired by the zzso zzso zzso by modular zzso These results support the notion that zzso evolution may proceed within a network of both closely and zzso related zzso
