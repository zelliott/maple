A zzso zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated using the anchored zzso To investigate the mechanism of regulation for this zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso containing five deletions zzso zzso zzso zzso and F5 were introduced into tobacco zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The functional properties of each promoter zzso were examined by zzso zzso activity in the leaves of transgenic tobacco treated with zzso stresses zzso zzso and low zzso The zzso activity in transgenic tobacco with zzso zzso to zzso construct showed highest increase under all the three zzso zzso Thus, the study provided a potential promoter induced by the salt, zzso and cold for the plant genetic zzso
