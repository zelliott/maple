The zzso seen in zzso zzso is believed to be zzso by zzso forms of the prion protein zzso A zzso encompassing zzso zzso of human zzso has been shown to be zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso appears to be dependent upon its adoption of an zzso zzso zzso To examine the role of the zzso core, zzso on zzso zzso we performed zzso analyses by substituting two or more zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso to decrease its zzso A zzso with a deleted zzso was also zzso We found all the peptides except the deletion zzso were no longer toxic on mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the nontoxic zzso peptides had a marked decrease in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso had zzso in zzso as measured by zzso zzso red zzso and zzso zzso using electron zzso These data show that the zzso core sequence is important for zzso toxicity probably by influencing its assembly into a zzso zzso The zzso sequence may similarly affect zzso and toxicity observed in prion zzso
