We have identified a new zzso zzso element, zzso in the zzso zzso region of a zzso zzso gene zzso that is normally induced by transferring cells of carrot suspension cultures to fresh liquid medium zzso or dilution zzso The initial integration into zzso occurred more than 4 years after culture zzso zzso was first detected in zzso zzso clones of a zzso library made from cells of the same cultured cell line 7 years after its initiation and thus following repeated zzso Twelve years after zzso about zzso of the cells had zzso inserted into the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso into zzso occurred in one (or more) zzso during the first zzso years of zzso These zzso cells did not disappear during numerous zzso instead the proportion of cells having this zzso inserted into zzso has been increasing over the last 5 zzso The promoter activity and the zzso by zzso of the zzso gene harboring zzso is reduced relative to wild zzso Finally, we show that zzso of a zzso element is one of the mechanisms that can cause variation of plant cell cultures during repeated zzso
