The zzso zzso cassette zzso of zzso zzso is composed of the soluble zzso zzso zzso and a zzso complex zzso one copy each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso During the transport process the zzso are thought to undergo zzso changes that might zzso alter molecular contacts between zzso and zzso In order to map sites of zzso interactions we have used a comprehensive zzso mapping approach zzso large-scale zzso of zzso zzso and array zzso In particular, we screened the binding of zzso zzso soluble zzso peptides to immobilized zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso cellulose zzso zzso The first approach identified seven peptides zzso each of zzso and zzso that specifically bound to zzso The peptides were localized to zzso 3 and 6, zzso loop zzso and zzso zzso C2 and zzso of zzso while zzso peptides localized to the N zzso zzso zzso zzso loop zzso and zzso loop zzso zzso from zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso and zzso partially zzso the zzso zzso known to be crucial for interaction with zzso These results were basically confirmed by screening zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso This approach also allowed us to perform complete zzso analyses of peptides in zzso The results led to the construction of zzso zzso that were subsequently analyzed for functional consequences in zzso Growth experiments revealed that most of the zzso had no zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso themselves are not critical but part of a zzso binding zzso However, two novel zzso affecting zzso from the zzso motifs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, displayed severe growth zzso indicating their functional zzso Together, these experimental outcomes identify specific molecular contacts made between zzso and zzso that extend beyond the zzso zzso zzso
