The structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to an zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso difference from ideal values for bonds and angles is zzso A and zzso degrees, zzso The structure is closely related to that of the same zzso from zzso zzso The zzso difference for zzso C alpha atoms is zzso A, with zzso sequence zzso The zzso in the active site are zzso while zzso of the interface zzso are the same in the two zzso A few structural variations provide the basis for the differences in zzso and zzso properties between the two zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso to zzso zzso zzso leaves a buried zzso zzso located at the zzso interface and in proximity of the zzso ring, zzso to any zzso zzso probably providing an explanation for the lower stability of the zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso Six surface zzso which previously could not be accurately positioned in the zzso zzso structure, are well defined in zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso structure, the six zzso could be correctly defined also in the zzso zzso zzso This is an unusual case where similar refinement zzso applied to two crystal forms of closely related proteins led to electron density maps of substantially different zzso The correct definition of these surface zzso is likely to be an essential step for revealing the structural basis of the interactions between zzso zzso and the other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
