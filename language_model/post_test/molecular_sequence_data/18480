The proper development of zzso circuits during zzso and zzso formation is critically dependent on a coordinated and intricate series of molecular and cellular cues and zzso Although the cortical zzso zzso is known to play a key role in zzso relatively little is known about the specific molecules important for this zzso Using linkage analysis and zzso sequencing on samples from families from the Amish community of Ohio, we have demonstrated that zzso in zzso zzso zzso cause a syndrome typified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our zzso analyses in primary zzso cell cultures showed that zzso and zzso zzso associates with dynamic zzso zzso structures and that this association is lost upon introduction of the identified zzso Taken together, our studies have identified zzso zzso responsible for zzso and zzso delay and define zzso as a zzso crucial for normal human zzso
