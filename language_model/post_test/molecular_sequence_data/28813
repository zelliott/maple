zzso protein zzso is a potent regulator of zzso zzso release known to be involved in the development of rat zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso and transport of zzso a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso sequence of zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso A zzso gold zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were employed to zzso zzso and zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso was rapidly incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso pits and zzso was clearly observed followed by transport and sorting of zzso zzso into zzso bodies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also examined in primary zzso cell cultures where a similar pattern of zzso and transport via zzso pits and zzso was zzso Fluorescence zzso using a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is zzso distributed on the zzso prior to zzso at 4 degrees zzso Following a zzso incubation at 37 degrees C zzso was concentrated in the zzso particularly in areas surrounding cellular projections and the zzso zzso studies employing zzso zzso and an zzso heavy chain zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso We also observed a marked increase in zzso zzso of a zzso protein in response to zzso stimulation in zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and transport in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso activity may result in zzso zzso zzso
