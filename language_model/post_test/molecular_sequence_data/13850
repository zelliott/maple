zzso zzso regulate zzso cell function via specific cell surface zzso These receptors are members of a large zzso of zzso proteins and are zzso by a 200 zzso acid zzso sequence zzso the zzso binding zzso Several of the genes for members of this zzso have now been zzso at the molecular level revealing a highly zzso zzso and a number of these genes have been zzso zzso The recent finding that genes for the zzso and zzso zzso alpha chain zzso zzso to a small region of the zzso region and the observation that the zzso zzso locus is present in a cluster of zzso genes on zzso 5 suggest the possibility that zzso of zzso zzso genes may be zzso into zzso This possibility is discussed and the potential significance of zzso zzso gene clusters is zzso Several of the zzso genes are known to be involved in inherited disorders and there is evidence to suggest zzso in zzso zzso genes could have a role in zzso We review the gene zzso zzso and involvement in disease for the known zzso zzso zzso This large family of receptors is expanding with the steady discovery of new zzso of which have the potential to be involved in human zzso
