Vitamin A zzso in male rats arrests zzso and leads to the loss of advanced germ zzso zzso treatment of these rats seems to result in a zzso zzso initiated from the remaining type A1 zzso To determine at a molecular level the onset of the M phase of the cell cycle occurring in the zzso germ cells, the zzso zzso zzso activity associated with the zzso zzso B complex was zzso This zzso activity is an excellent molecular indicator of zzso zzso zzso since it is known to be high only for approximately 2 h between the zzso phase transition of the cell cycle and the zzso of zzso This activity was low in vitamin zzso zzso increased by 4 h after zzso treatment, and reached a zzso level at 12 zzso These results suggest that the germ cells of vitamin zzso zzso begin to enter the M phase around 4 h after zzso injection, with the highest percentage of cells entering at 12 zzso These results are consistent with placing the origin of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at the end of the S phase of the cell zzso
