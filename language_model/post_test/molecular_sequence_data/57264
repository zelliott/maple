zzso C virus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso related to the zzso and zzso zzso These viruses replicate through the formation of a zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso which is subsequently zzso zzso and released from infected zzso zzso zzso is not found in the mature, circulating zzso of zzso In an attempt to study the relative amounts of viral plus and minus strand in the liver and serum of zzso individuals, we have developed a technique to amplify specifically each of the viral strands using a modified reverse zzso chain reaction protocol on extracted zzso Liver tumor and zzso tissue from a patient with zzso zzso was analyzed using this zzso In both cases, viral plus and minus strands were zzso although the zzso signal was several fold stronger than zzso signal by Southern zzso zzso from 11 zzso zzso patients with abnormal serum zzso levels were similarly zzso In all cases viral plus strand was zzso and in 10 of 11 cases viral minus strand was zzso The zzso signal was always much weaker than the zzso signal and the ratio of plus strand to minus strand varied among zzso No correlation was found between the level of minus strand detected or its ratio to plus strand with the level of serum zzso or any other clinical zzso
