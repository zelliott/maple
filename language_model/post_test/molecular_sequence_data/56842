A zzso protein was produced with the zzso domain zzso acids zzso of zzso I and the core of zzso V zzso acids zzso This zzso zzso zzso has a similar zzso requirement for binding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso this protein has a strong potency to zzso zzso zzso as is shown by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was employed to study zzso the phenomenon of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso bound by zzso zzso on the zzso zzso is zzso to its surface coverage and can be inhibited by zzso of zzso V on the zzso zzso or by shielding the zzso surface of the zzso with blood zzso factor zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso does not bind to pure PC zzso but its zzso on zzso zzso zzso brings about the capacity to bind pure PC zzso This suggests that zzso zzso generates or exposes after binding to zzso zzso another zzso binding site, that differs from the zzso V zzso binding zzso zzso the data suggest that two-dimensional cluster formation of zzso zzso on a zzso with zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso
