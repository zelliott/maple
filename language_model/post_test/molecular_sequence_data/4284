Many zzso genes from zzso contain a group I zzso An zzso is also inserted in the same gene at the same position in zzso the bacterial zzso of zzso suggesting an ancient bacterial origin for this zzso A group I zzso has also been found in the zzso gene of some zzso but not in zzso suggesting a more recent origin for this zzso In this study, we investigate the zzso zzso of the two zzso among zzso from the earliest branching to the more derived zzso The zzso distribution of the zzso zzso follows the zzso of zzso zzso being either absent or present in zzso of closely related species, with only one exception in the zzso zzso Our data support the notion that the zzso zzso was inherited by zzso and zzso through a common zzso zzso the zzso zzso has a sporadic distribution, zzso that many gains and losses occurred during zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso tree zzso from zzso sequences clearly separates the different zzso zzso suggesting that each family has its own evolutionary zzso
