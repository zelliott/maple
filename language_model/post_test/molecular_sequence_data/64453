We introduced a series of Pro zzso within and near the zzso zzso a part of the zzso region, in human DNA zzso zzso and analyzed if this region is involved in determination of zzso drug sensitivity in a zzso sensitive zzso strain zzso zzso Among the 19 zzso generated, zzso and zzso showed resistance to zzso and zzso at the zzso temperature, where cell growth depends on activity of the human zzso For these zzso zzso with an Ala substitution were further created, in which zzso also showed resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and subjected to in zzso measurement of drug zzso They generated lower amounts of the zzso zzso complexes, and were also found to have lower zzso activity than the zzso In the crystal structure, the zzso equivalent of zzso is found in the vicinity of the zzso a putative zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso DNA zzso These results suggest that zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso are involved in the zzso activity and drug sensitivity of human DNA zzso zzso via interaction with zzso zzso
