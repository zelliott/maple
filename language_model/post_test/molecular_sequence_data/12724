The hypothesis is advanced that hormonal zzso in the zzso zzso act through zzso between base pairs in partially zzso zzso Using published X-ray coordinates of the complex of the zzso hormone response element zzso with the zzso zzso DNA binding domain, the interface between the protein and the gene was zzso The site zzso previously shown to accommodate cortisol was found in the first two bases of the zzso half sites, zzso These base pairs were sufficiently exposed at the zzso interface to permit access by the zzso zzso of cortisol into the zzso complex resulted in a favorable van der zzso zzso Given the general lack of correlation of zzso binding with hormonal activity, we propose that hormone action involves an additional step in which the zzso protein in concert with other zzso factors zzso the hormone into the zzso This notion provides an explanation for earlier paradoxical observations including structural analogies between base pairs and steroid zzso The zzso hypothesis suggests that zzso bound zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso control of zzso functional groups on the DNA followed by zzso and release of the zzso between base pairs at zzso
