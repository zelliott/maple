The zzso family comprises proteins that move zzso zzso zzso acids and zzso across the plasma membrane into the zzso In zzso deletion of zzso family members has dramatic zzso consequences, but in the model zzso zzso zzso little is known about this family of zzso zzso in this study we carried out an initial analysis of 21 known or putative zzso family members from the zzso zzso zzso sequences from these genes zzso into either zzso zzso including the novel insect zzso acid zzso zzso or into a group of zzso related sequences not affiliated with a recognized zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis and in zzso zzso showed that seven of these genes are expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso revealed that two previously cloned zzso members, the zzso and zzso zzso were localized to zzso zzso zzso that previously zzso for these zzso zzso for zzso (the putative zzso zzso and zzso (a member of the novel insect zzso acid zzso zzso was localized in cells likely to be zzso of zzso while zzso for zzso zzso (both members of the orphan neurotransmitter zzso zzso and zzso (a putative zzso zzso were expressed broadly throughout the cellular zzso of the zzso Eight of the 21 sequences were localized outside the zzso in the zzso canal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for six sequences was not found or not attempted in the adult zzso We used the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso to independently identify zzso zzso in the adult zzso zzso for zzso was detected in a limited number of cells in the central brain and in a beaded stripe at the base of the zzso in the position of zzso but not in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso observations in conjunction with likely zzso based on zzso zzso are a first step in defining the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
