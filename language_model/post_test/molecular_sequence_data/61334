The zzso group of zzso zzso zzso into the major groove of double zzso zzso The structural influence of this zzso zzso has been examined using a zzso 160 zzso zzso in which zzso zzso were replaced with zzso zzso We show that the zzso substitution and the zzso deletion of the zzso group affects the zzso of DNA by zzso I and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso I zzso sites, in terms of di and zzso indicates that zzso tracts of zzso become significantly more susceptible to zzso I zzso when zzso is zzso for zzso zzso The results indicate that removal of the zzso zzso groups from the major groove at AT tracts zzso structural zzso that transmit into the opposite minor groove, where they can be detected by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso I zzso experiments with different zzso and zzso drugs reveal that zzso substitution does not markedly affect zzso zzso recognition in the minor or major groove of the double zzso The consequences of zzso of zzso zzso are discussed in terms of changes in the minor groove zzso connected to variations in the flexibility of DNA and the intrinsic zzso associated with AT zzso The study identifies the zzso group of zzso as an important molecular zzso controlling the zzso of the minor groove and/or the flexibility of the zzso
