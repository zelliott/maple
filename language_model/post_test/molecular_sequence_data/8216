zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to focal zzso and zzso zzso by the engagement of beta 1 zzso However, it is unclear how zzso is linked to zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is directly associated with zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso binding and has zzso zzso zzso which are essential for zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso analysis reveal that zzso zzso fusion zzso which bind to zzso zzso to focal zzso whereas fusion proteins with no zzso activity do not zzso to focal zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso is localized to focal zzso by the direct association with zzso
