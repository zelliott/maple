The design, zzso and zzso relationships zzso for the development of selective zzso zzso for both of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso The zzso developed is used to design a zzso with equal zzso binding affinity for both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso selective compounds having zzso binding affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso 53, and zzso zzso Other compounds such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso - zzso zzso are zzso compounds having zzso binding affinities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso and zzso zzso Further to these, zzso zzso zzso is a mixed zzso zzso with a zzso binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso ratio of zzso The zzso selective compounds are shown to be zzso in zzso tests on the rat zzso nucleus of the zzso with an equilibrium constant zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso and are also shown to be zzso in the mouse zzso box test with a minimum effective dose of zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso selective compounds are also shown to be competitive zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from pancreatic zzso cells with a zzso value of 16 zzso for zzso In zzso tests on the rat zzso zzso (an area rich in zzso zzso zzso had a zzso value of zzso zzso The mixed zzso compound zzso showed zzso properties in both zzso and zzso zzso thus it inhibited zzso zzso zzso from pancreatic zzso cells and is zzso in the zzso box zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
