The zzso family of zzso filament binding proteins have highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso also known as zzso are the most similar members of this family, with zzso lacking a zzso zzso found in zzso This zzso has been zzso to serve as a zzso zzso keeping zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the zzso of severing by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso We find that the relationship between severing rate and calcium zzso concentration differs between zzso and zzso and suggest that calcium controls one zzso step in the zzso of zzso and two in the zzso of zzso In contrast, both proteins are activated equally by zzso and have identical severing zzso at zzso below zzso The temperature sensitivity of severing by zzso and zzso is remarkably different, with zzso increasing its severing rate zzso per 10 degrees C increase in temperature and zzso increasing its rate only zzso per 10 degrees C increase in zzso Analysis of the zzso construct lacking the zzso zzso demonstrates that this zzso is responsible for the regulatory differences between zzso and zzso These results support the zzso latch hypothesis for the calcium zzso zzso of zzso
