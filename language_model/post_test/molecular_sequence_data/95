Small zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family are key regulators of membrane trafficking events between the various zzso compartments in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein required in the late zzso zzso and in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is necessary for trafficking from the zzso to the zzso and for zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified and characterized a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to the zzso zzso zzso deleted for zzso exhibit normal growth rates and zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso zzso contains large zzso in contrast with the small fragmented zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso does not enhance or alleviate the temperature sensitivity or zzso fusion zzso of zzso zzso Like zzso cells, zzso of zzso caused fragmentation of zzso and zzso zzso fusion under zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso zzso zzso act zzso in regulating zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso protein showed that zzso zzso zzso fusion versus zzso largely depends on the zzso region of the zzso including a part of zzso
