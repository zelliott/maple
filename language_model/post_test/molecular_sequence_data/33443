The potential for microbial nitrogen fixation in the zzso methane zzso sediments in a mud volcano, the number 8 zzso zzso was characterized by molecular zzso zzso A total of 111 of the zzso (a gene coding a nitrogen fixation zzso zzso zzso clones were obtained from different depths of the core zzso and the zzso analysis of the clones indicated the genetic diversity of zzso zzso The zzso group detected zzso zzso group zzso representing zzso of zzso zzso was zzso related to the zzso sequences obtained from the zzso species but was most closely related to the zzso sequences potentially derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The recovery of the zzso gene clusters including the zzso sequences of the methane zzso group 2 and the subsequent reverse zzso detection of the zzso and zzso genes strongly suggested that the genetic components of the gene clusters would be operative for the in zzso zzso of molecular nitrogen zzso by the host zzso zzso quantitative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso (a gene zzso the zzso M zzso alpha zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso genes demonstrated the similar distribution patterns of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso groups zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso genes through the core zzso These results supported the idea that the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be the zzso hosting the zzso gene clusters and could play an important role in not only the in zzso carbon zzso cycle but also the nitrogen cycle in zzso zzso
