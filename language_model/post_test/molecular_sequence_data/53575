zzso zzso zzso chains derived from bovine zzso cartilage have been examined using both one-dimensional methods and the two-dimensional experiments zzso and zzso for zzso shift correlations and a modified zzso zzso zzso for long-range zzso approach for zzso shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal assignments for zzso within the intact zzso chain are zzso data derived from the repeat region signals and from chain cap zzso are assigned by comparison with published data derived from zzso obtained through zzso of zzso zzso zzso chains using zzso and zzso II and are discussed in zzso The one-dimensional zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso contain highly crowded signal clusters for which data analysis is not directly zzso zzso analysis allow the correlation and assignment of many zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso chemical shift region while from the zzso correlation spectrum data are zzso for some signals within the complex set of carbon zzso which fall in the region between 68 and 86 zzso This work using material from zzso cartilage has permitted the first detailed combined zzso and zzso zzso examination of the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso this sequence forms the basis for the more complex members of the zzso zzso family present in other zzso such as zzso cartilage and cornea where further zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid are also zzso This zzso method of analysis zzso the currently available zzso methods for structure determination which may then subsequently be zzso
