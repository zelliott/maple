zzso is a virulent zzso that zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso is indistinguishable from the well-known zzso zzso zzso but DNA zzso indicated that it was zzso distant from T4 and thus it was classified as a zzso zzso To further characterize zzso we randomly zzso small fragments corresponding to about zzso of the approximately zzso zzso Most of these zzso sequences lacked sufficient zzso to T4 to be detected in an zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso about zzso of them zzso proteins with zzso to T4 zzso Among these sequences were the numerous components of the zzso and the zzso DNA replication zzso zzso the zzso genes revealed that many of them had the same relative order found in the T4 zzso The complete zzso sequence was determined for the two regions of zzso zzso that contain most of the genes involved in DNA zzso This sequencing revealed that zzso has zzso of all the essential T4 replication zzso but, as expected, their sequences zzso considerably from their T4 zzso Many of the zzso T4 genes are absent from zzso and have been replaced by unknown zzso The zzso sequences of zzso are less zzso than the coding zzso and in at least some cases, zzso has evolved alternative regulatory zzso For example, an analysis of zzso in zzso revealed a simpler pattern of regulation than in zzso with only two, rather than three, classes of temporally controlled zzso These results indicate that zzso and T4 have zzso substantially from their last common zzso The different zzso zzso appear to contain a set of common genes that can be exploited differently, by means of plasticity in the regulatory sequences and the precise choice of a large group of zzso zzso
