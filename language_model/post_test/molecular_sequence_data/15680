The distribution of the zzso of zzso gene zzso in the Iranian cattle breed zzso was studied by the zzso zzso zzso using restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the examined cattle breed (65 zzso 32 zzso have been identified one of which being described for the first time zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso region of zzso 2 of this zzso has been determined and submitted in the zzso database under zzso number zzso The submitted sequence has maximum zzso zzso with the previously described sequence zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and differs from it by 24 zzso zzso which result in 16 zzso acid zzso The zzso (on the basis of the reconstructed zzso acid zzso has zzso identity to the sequence zzso by the zzso 188 locus zzso zzso The results obtained permit the sequence described by us to be considered as a new zzso of the zzso gene zzso The total frequency of the main six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occurring with a frequency of over zzso is about zzso in Iranian zzso zzso Fifteen zzso have zzso zzso The highest frequency was observed for zzso zzso zzso like in other previously described breeds of zzso zzso (up to zzso The Iranian breed zzso has a high level of similarity by the spectrum of zzso zzso and their zzso to other zzso zzso breeds and significantly differs by these criteria from the zzso zzso zzso The Iranian zzso zzso under study includes zzso associated with to resistance to leukemia zzso and zzso and to different forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although their zzso are low (from zzso to zzso On the whole, a high level of diversity of zzso gene zzso and the availability of zzso associated with resistance to different diseases makes this breed of interest for breeding zzso
