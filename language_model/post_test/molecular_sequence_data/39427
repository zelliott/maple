The study of genetic variation will promote our understanding of the differential predisposition to common diseases and variation in drug responses of individuals and ethnic zzso Such genetic variation is zzso structured into blocks of zzso in zzso zzso a comprehensive zzso map based on the most abundant form of genetic variation, single zzso zzso will be zzso At the present time, however, our knowledge of the similarities and differences of zzso structure among different ancestral populations is still zzso 

To determine whether common underlying zzso patterns existed across ethnic zzso we analyzed data derived from African and European Americans for zzso genes spanning a total of 516 zzso and the zzso zzso data across 500 zzso on zzso zzso from three major world zzso 

We observed that strong zzso linkage zzso zzso between zzso selected from populations having African ancestry was highly zzso across other zzso zzso Common zzso described by these zzso zzso demonstrated a simple evolutionary structure with up to three major zzso which were likely ancestral backgrounds upon which more recent zzso have been zzso Also, zzso block boundaries defined in populations having African ancestry revealed completely zzso zzso zzso across all zzso providing a consistent definition of block zzso Finally, a large fraction of regulatory zzso described in the literature appeared to tag these zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting their significance for disease association and zzso zzso
