zzso zzso was transformed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso and analyzed zzso and by circular zzso The zzso zzso zzso I was recognized by zzso raised to zzso zzso zzso I but was found in multiple molecular weight species on zzso zzso zzso content determination and zzso western analysis indicated that the zzso protein was zzso although a species very similar in molecular weight to the zzso zzso zzso could be isolated zzso The zzso zzso zzso I also demonstrated activity toward soluble and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although at a level significantly lower than the zzso zzso More seriously, the zzso zzso showed zzso secondary structure by circular zzso We conclude that zzso zzso may not serve as an adequate host for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
