We have identified a gene zzso a new member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor family, zzso The predicted zzso zzso contains a single zzso zinc finger zzso along with a zzso adjacent basic zzso zzso zzso is present in all stages of zzso zzso development but is most abundant in zzso zzso gene analysis and zzso zzso show that zzso is first expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso cells, and in zzso cells of the head and tail, immediately after the final embryonic cell division that gives rise to these zzso No expression is seen in the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is maintained at a constant level in the zzso until the zzso stage of development, after which reporter gene expression declines to a low level and zzso protein can no longer be detected by specific zzso A second phase of zzso expression in cells immediately anterior and zzso to the gut begins in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two genes known to be important in zzso and maintenance of zzso cell zzso We have found that zzso is required for the formation of most, but not all, zzso zzso In contrast, zzso function does not appear necessary for zzso zzso Finally, we have zzso the candidate zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Many features of the zzso zzso and transcript structure are zzso between the two species, suggesting that zzso is likely to perform an zzso significant function during zzso
