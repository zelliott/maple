zzso zzso is characterized by an abundance of C zzso T and zzso zzso T transitions at zzso zzso It is not known how these zzso might zzso One hypothesis is that zzso zzso occur only after zzso of the zzso or zzso within the zzso zzso It is not clear how zzso of zzso at the zzso influences zzso and how this affects zzso We have now conducted experiments with a zzso zzso shuttle zzso that was zzso with zzso and then incubated at 37 degrees C to allow time for zzso before passage through a human cell line to establish zzso This led to a significantly increased frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of transition zzso at zzso zzso A spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene was determined using the mismatch zzso activities of zzso protein in combination with zzso zzso zzso at the zzso position promoted the zzso of zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and these two events combined led to a significantly increased frequency of zzso transition zzso at zzso zzso Under these conditions, the majority of all zzso zzso were transition zzso at zzso and they clustered at several zzso hot zzso Exactly these types of zzso are frequently observed in the zzso gene of zzso skin zzso This particular zzso zzso may become prevalent under conditions of inefficient DNA repair and slow proliferation of cells in the human zzso
