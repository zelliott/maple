Current zzso methods have been slow in addressing the growing need for zzso A new generation of more empirical zzso zzso tools is needed to aid the advance of this important zzso To this end, we have developed a new zzso screening platform for identification of zzso peptides that specifically bind zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso This method involves screening of random sequence zzso libraries in zzso zzso zzso format with the newly developed zzso zzso dot zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli on a zzso consisting of 10,000 zzso zzso features revealed minor differences, while comparison of zzso from zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso produced sets of highly specific zzso zzso strongly binding to the zzso coli zzso were highly enriched in aromatic and zzso zzso zzso and most of these inhibited growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that some of these peptides bind zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso selections against zzso zzso were largely composed of zzso forming zzso acids in accordance with dramatic compositional differences in zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso While the main value of this approach lies in the ability to rapidly differentiate bacterial and possibly other complex zzso the peptides discovered here can potentially be used zzso as zzso and zzso lead compounds, and zzso as diagnostic and affinity zzso
