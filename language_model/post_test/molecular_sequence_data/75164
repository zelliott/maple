Five zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a patient with zzso zzso were examined with regard to several zzso and zzso characteristics to determine whether the patient was zzso with one or several distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from a single zzso sample, and zzso and zzso were obtained 1 and 2 years later, zzso On the basis of colonial zzso zzso and zzso the five zzso appeared to be different zzso However, Southern zzso analysis with a zzso DNA probe containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene indicated that all five strains were identical at that genetic zzso The zzso genes of the five zzso were cloned and zzso at the zzso level and found to be zzso Southern zzso analysis with a probe from a separate region of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso adjacent to the zzso A zzso also revealed genetic identity among these five clinical zzso On this basis, it was concluded that this patient was zzso with a single strain of zzso zzso and that the strain had remained genetically stable over a period of 2 zzso The predicted zzso sequence of the CD zzso was almost identical to that of strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to zzso zzso with which it shared zzso zzso No zzso zzso was detected between the CD and zzso zzso which shared the least zzso zzso among the four zzso considered in this zzso Although all five CD zzso contained identical zzso zzso three had acquired zzso which prevented normal expression of the zzso zzso zzso was a putative regulatory zzso which was unable to produce normal amounts of zzso and zzso and zzso were putative assembly zzso which produced normal amounts of zzso but were unable to assemble the zzso zzso into intact zzso
