zzso coli zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso regulating the expression of four zzso genes in the alpha zzso In zzso studies have shown that the protein specifically recognizes an unusual zzso zzso secondary structure which links sequences upstream and downstream of the zzso binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) Cell 57, zzso We have prepared zzso of the zzso zzso initiation site and zzso that allows us to detect repression in cells in which overproduction of zzso zzso can be zzso Twenty-five zzso sequence zzso have been introduced into the zzso zzso and the levels of zzso repression zzso zzso of zzso base changes confirm the importance of the zzso secondary structure for zzso zzso An A zzso in a zzso zzso sequence is also required for zzso recognition and may contact zzso zzso zzso of zzso repression levels and zzso binding zzso for the set of zzso zzso show that nine zzso are zzso much more zzso than predicted from their affinity for zzso in extreme cases no repression can be detected for zzso with unchanged zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso contains functionally distinct zzso and zzso binding sites that are zzso zzso zzso can relieve zzso repression by zzso the linkage between the two sites without altering zzso zzso This proposal assigns to the zzso a more active role in zzso zzso repression than found in other zzso repression zzso
