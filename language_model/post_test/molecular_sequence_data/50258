zzso expression of major zzso complex class II zzso zzso zzso normally occurs in zzso and zzso presenting cells of the zzso zzso However, many zzso zzso and transformed cells express these proteins zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso II DR alpha promoter is zzso active both in the zzso large T zzso transformed cell line, zzso and in zzso cells from which they are zzso As an approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso DR alpha expression we have examined the zzso and zzso requirements for DR alpha zzso in these cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the region immediately 3' to the zzso was bound by a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Using deletions and point zzso in the DR alpha promoter we demonstrate that, in contrast to zzso the zzso motif and zzso zzso and zzso make only a minor contribution to promoter function while single point zzso in the zzso motif reduced zzso up to zzso In addition, we show that the DR alpha promoter is activated by zzso large zzso and that zzso requires an intact zzso zzso Similar data were obtained using zzso melanoma zzso These results suggest that the zzso motif may be a target for zzso deregulation in several transformed cell zzso
