To gain insight into the natural history of zzso C virus zzso 13 human zzso virus zzso injecting drug users were studied who zzso for zzso as determined by third-generation zzso zzso zzso showed an ensuing zzso response to zzso and were not treated with any zzso drugs during zzso zzso included 13 zzso zzso individuals, of whom 5 zzso apparently cleared zzso and were zzso chain reaction zzso in at least 3 consecutive samples, 3 zzso showed transient zzso and were zzso in 1 sample during the study period, and the other 5 zzso showed persistent zzso zzso was determined zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso were determined on serial samples during zzso zzso zzso levels to core, zzso zzso and zzso were determined using the zzso zzso zzso Strip zzso zzso which is based on zzso zzso zzso The zzso responses to core, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In individuals infected with zzso zzso 1, significantly higher median zzso responses to core zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso were found as compared with those infected with other zzso showing a significant impact of zzso zzso specificity of the zzso In groups infected with zzso zzso 1, significantly higher median zzso zzso zzso zzso relative intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were found in the individuals with persistent zzso than in those with apparent resolution of zzso zzso in zzso In groups infected with zzso other than zzso 1, significantly higher median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso were found in the individuals with persistent zzso than in those with apparent resolution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with viral persistence had higher zzso loads with higher zzso responses as compared with individuals with apparent viral clearance from zzso zzso viral clearance from blood was observed in an unexpectedly high percentage zzso associated with a significant decrease of zzso to zzso independent of zzso zzso as compared with individuals with persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso viral clearance from blood with gradual loss of zzso to various zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso was observed in 4 of the 5 individuals within approximately 1 year after zzso zzso whereas 1 of these individuals apparently cleared the virus from blood, with complete zzso
