A new method to detect zzso based on the serial analysis of gene expression zzso technique, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I named zzso zzso is reported in the present zzso zzso DNA zzso formed from zzso and zzso DNA are fragmented with zzso I zzso at the zzso site to produce a zzso zzso with an overhanging base at the zzso The zzso is zzso to a zzso and zzso with zzso and then zzso to another zzso zzso is performed to amplify the zzso products, and zzso is used to release zzso tags containing zzso sites followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The locations of zzso can be identified from the zzso analysis of zzso This new zzso zzso can detect both known and unknown zzso with a sensitivity of zzso zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso copies starting DNA zzso Our results show that this method could be used as a potentially zzso zzso for zzso zzso particularly for the discovery of unknown zzso in zzso zzso
