The zzso associated with protein zzso has been a challenge to zzso chemists and the subject of zzso studies for zzso since their presence in biological systems had been confirmed some three decades zzso zzso investigations led to discoveries of synthetic and zzso zzso and brief forays into functional determination of the zzso portion on the protein activity in zzso Only recently has it come to our understanding that variations from the zzso zzso patterns might be indicative of pathological zzso The presence of certain zzso zzso zzso in human serum has been shown to correlate with certain clinical zzso zzso the ability to separate and zzso measure the various forms of human zzso has become increasingly zzso It this study, we demonstrate that a simple method utilizing a zzso zzso to slow zzso flow and a zzso buffer containing zzso cellulose allows for the resolution of zzso of zzso An analysis time of less than eight minutes allows for baseline resolution of the lower zzso of zzso presenting a simple, rapid test for zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the utility of this methodology for the facile diagnosis of zzso zzso syndrome, and zzso that it may allow for the detection of other zzso zzso disease zzso
