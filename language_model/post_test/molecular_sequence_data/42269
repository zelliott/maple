zzso culture dishes and polystyrene zzso were coated with zzso and zzso zzso either alone or in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing repeats of the zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso supported attachment of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells at zzso as low as zzso zzso of surface zzso The cells rapidly spread after zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso also supported cell attachment but cells did not rapidly spread after attachment to this zzso Higher zzso of zzso could not be used because of zzso When the two peptides were used in zzso zzso cells attached and spread at lower zzso zzso than they did when either zzso was used zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso alone or in conjunction with a zzso zzso could be a useful replacement for materials such as gelatin or collagen which are currently used as zzso zzso
