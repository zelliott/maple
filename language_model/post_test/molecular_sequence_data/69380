The ability to measure the total concentration of low density zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso is of crucial importance to understanding changes in zzso cholesterol zzso Such zzso can be made in conjunction with estimates of LDL zzso zzso activity, cell surface LDL zzso number, and rates of zzso LDL zzso to evaluate the mechanisms controlling cellular LDL zzso zzso Current methods for assessing zzso LDL zzso levels use zzso as a source of LDL zzso and thus rely on consistent contamination of the zzso preparation with LDL zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Because this contamination is zzso and may vary with zzso in either the distribution of LDL receptors among the various cellular membrane zzso or in the composition of the zzso zzso measurement of LDL zzso concentration in zzso zzso may not accurately reflect the total compliment of LDL receptors within the zzso We have developed the methodology for zzso the full complement of zzso LDL zzso containing zzso by zzso zzso density zzso zzso and for zzso LDL zzso concentration using a Western zzso procedure that uses an zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the intensity of color formation by zzso zzso Using this methodology, we observed a 126 zzso zzso band for the bovine adrenal zzso LDL zzso that also exhibited LDL binding activity as zzso by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of 140 zzso for the zzso liver LDL zzso These bands were not observed when zzso zzso was conducted in the presence of either 10 zzso zzso or a zzso excess of zzso LDL, or when zzso was conducted using either zzso serum or zzso that had been zzso with LDL zzso zzso The intensity of color formation was a linear function of the amount of membrane extract separated by zzso zzso variation averaged zzso and zzso variation averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso and the combination of zzso plus zzso pharmacological interventions known to increase LDL zzso activity in experimental animals, produced the predicted increases in zzso total zzso LDL zzso concentration that were highly correlated with zzso increases in zzso zzso activity and reductions in serum zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
