An unusually large number of regulatory or targeting proteins that bind to the zzso zzso of protein zzso have been recently zzso This can be explained by their possession of a common protein motif that interacts with a binding site on protein zzso The existence of such a motif was established by the panning of a random zzso library in which zzso sequences are displayed on the zzso coli bacterial zzso protein for bacteria that bound to protein zzso There were 79 zzso containing 46 unique sequences with the zzso motif zzso or zzso where X was most frequently His or zzso In addition, this sequence was commonly preceded by zzso basic zzso and followed by 1 zzso zzso This study demonstrates that binding to protein zzso can be zzso to a protein by the presentation of a zzso motif on a surface zzso This binding motif is found in a number of protein zzso zzso
