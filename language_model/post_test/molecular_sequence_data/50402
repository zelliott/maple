zzso regulatory mechanisms participate in diverse zzso zzso and environmentally regulated zzso with the precise control of zzso zzso concentration being critical to such zzso In plant cells, zzso zzso localized in the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso are thought to play a central role in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has been identified in isolated plant cell zzso but the protein has not been characterized at the molecular zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso and a complete zzso clone zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso in zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence specifies a protein zzso zzso of 1048 zzso acids with a molecular mass of 116 zzso eight probable zzso zzso and all of the highly zzso functional zzso common to zzso zzso zzso In addition, the protein shares approximately 50% zzso acid sequence identify with animal zzso zzso zzso but less than zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso is zzso by a single zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates the presence of three transcript sizes in root tissue and a single, much less abundant, transcript in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels increase dramatically upon a zzso exposure to 50 zzso zzso Thus this report describes the primary structure of a zzso zzso and the regulation of its zzso abundance by salt zzso
