zzso zzso avian influenza A virus zzso H5N1 can potentially generate novel zzso during replication of infected zzso To determine which H5N1 zzso predominate in wild birds, we determined the sequences of zzso amplified viral genes from several zzso of infected chickens and ducks from Egypt, where H5N1 outbreaks in birds are zzso zzso of the sequences in viruses from zzso zzso brain and liver revealed diversification with different zzso acid zzso in different zzso but no diversification in zzso These specific zzso acid zzso were rare among viruses currently circulating in zzso In addition, the H5N1 zzso showed distinct growth zzso in zzso canine and human zzso Our findings suggested that ducks can generate H5N1 zzso with novel zzso acid zzso that might serve as zzso agents for new influenza virus outbreaks and zzso
