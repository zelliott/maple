The zzso genes of zzso zzso are expressed in zzso zzso of zzso cells within the insect visual zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso are known to display complementary expression patterns in the zzso zzso zzso cell population of the compound zzso In addition, we find that zzso is expressed in a small group of paired zzso and zzso zzso cells at the zzso eye margin that are apparently specialized for the detection of polarized zzso In this paper we present a detailed characterization of the zzso requirements of both zzso and zzso zzso deletion series demonstrate that small regulatory regions (less than 300 zzso of both zzso zzso genes contain DNA sequences sufficient to generate their respective expression zzso Individual zzso elements were further identified by zzso zzso guided by zzso sequence zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso genes share a simple zzso promoter structure, zzso the zzso region constitutes a functionally equivalent promoter zzso and the zzso region determines zzso zzso The expression patterns of several hybrid zzso zzso in which all or part of the putative core regions have been replaced with the analogous regions of different zzso zzso provide additional evidence in support of this zzso
