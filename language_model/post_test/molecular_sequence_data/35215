To assess the association between a zzso zzso of zzso gene and zzso syndrome zzso plasma zzso and plasma zzso zzso in Chinese Korean and Han populations from zzso zzso 

zzso chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to determine the zzso of zzso in 310 Chinese Korean zzso in case group and 120 in control zzso and 344 Chinese Han zzso in case group and 89 in control zzso zzso was used to test serum insulin zzso and zzso 

The frequency of T zzso was higher in ethnic Han compared with ethnic Koreans zzso zzso zzso lower than that of Europeans zzso and Africans zzso but similar to those of Beijing Chinese and zzso For ethnic Korean Chinese, the zzso of zzso and CT zzso as well as the T zzso in patients with zzso were significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso which also showed an increasing trend for both zzso and zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, for Chinese zzso the zzso of zzso and particular zzso in patients with zzso zzso and zzso showed no significant difference from those of the control zzso For zzso zzso and control groups, PA level of individuals with CT or zzso zzso was significantly higher compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso zzso and zzso groups compared with those of the control zzso The PA level was lower in zzso group compared with the control zzso 

The T zzso of zzso zzso of zzso gene may be a risk factor for zzso in Chinese Korean population from zzso zzso The T zzso also affects the PA zzso lower PA is a risk factor for zzso The zzso zzso showed a racial and ethnic zzso
