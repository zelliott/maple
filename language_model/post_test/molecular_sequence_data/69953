A functionally critical position zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled by zzso editing that operates in the nucleus, since in brain and zzso cell lines of neural origin, zzso zzso transcripts occur edited in the zzso site zzso zzso and, zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso into zzso cells revealed that the zzso part of the zzso downstream of the zzso zzso site is required for zzso site zzso This zzso portion contains an imperfect zzso repeat preceding a 10 zzso sequence with exact zzso to the zzso centered on the zzso zzso Single zzso zzso in this short zzso sequence or its zzso complement curtailed zzso site editing, which was recovered by restoring zzso in the respective partner zzso Base conversion in the zzso region of zzso directed by base paired sequences may be executed by a ubiquitous nuclear zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso
