The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso that zzso zzso zzso or zzso We have identified three functional zzso of the mouse zzso protein that are responsible for DNA zzso zzso zzso and negative regulation, zzso In addition to the zzso domain, which is located near the N zzso an adjacent region (the zzso zzso zzso containing about 80 zzso acids was found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso of a region spanning about 175 zzso acids of the zzso portion increased zzso zzso zzso revealing that this domain normally zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and repression functions of zzso and zzso are discussed in the light of these functional zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in transformation by zzso gene zzso
