zzso zzso is the first and a zzso step of zzso which is often a critical process in nitrogen removal from zzso and coastal zzso To clarify the correlation of environmental conditions with the distribution of zzso zzso in organic zzso coastal zzso zzso zzso zzso and bacteria zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso gene zzso abundance was determined in sediments of zzso Bay located in northeast zzso The zzso and zzso zzso copy numbers ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso copies zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abundance was zzso correlated with dissolved oxygen levels in the bottom zzso zzso zzso abundance was also correlated with total zzso levels in the zzso On the other hand, no significant relationship was observed between the zzso abundance and zzso organic matter zzso zzso or acid volatile zzso levels in the zzso These results show the zzso distribution of zzso zzso by the difference in environmental conditions within the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso diversity was relatively low in the area of high zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso community zzso
