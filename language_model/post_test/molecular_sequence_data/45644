zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso a rate limiting step in DNA zzso Class I zzso is a zzso that consists of two zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity requires association of zzso with zzso The zzso zzso is of special interest because it dictates the interaction with zzso that is required for zzso activity zzso and it is expressed only during the S phase of the cell zzso We previously zzso an zzso zzso clone from the yellow fever zzso Aedes zzso We found the message was zzso by blood zzso We now report the sequence of an zzso zzso zzso The gene consists of 4 zzso and 5 zzso Both major and minor zzso start sites have been identified, and their use differs in zzso versus zzso zzso The gene contains putative zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene contains zzso regulatory elements immediately upstream of the minimal promoter zzso zzso of a factor to the zzso putative zzso site in the zzso region is altered by iron treatment of zzso Further, following blood zzso zzso message is significantly induced in zzso zzso zzso that are involved in zzso process requiring DNA zzso
