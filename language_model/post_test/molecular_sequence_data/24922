The studies described here sought to identify and characterize genes involved in the zzso and zzso movements that occur during sea zzso zzso An zzso of the zzso family zzso factor, zzso was cloned through a candidate gene zzso zzso zzso is the founding member of this zzso zzso factor family and has been implicated in zzso movements in zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso serum was generated to zzso in order to characterize protein zzso zzso initially appears at zzso zzso stage in two distinct regions with embryonic expression zzso until zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is in zzso and lies zzso around the zzso This zzso area of zzso expression remains constant in size as zzso cells express zzso upon moving into that circumference and cease zzso expression as they leave the zzso zzso expression remains around the zzso through zzso zzso The second domain of zzso expression first appears broadly in the oral zzso at zzso zzso stage and at later embryonic stages is refined to just the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression depends on autonomous zzso signaling in zzso and does not require zzso or zzso zzso It was then determined that zzso is necessary for the zzso movements occurring in both expression zzso A zzso construct was generated by fusing the DNA binding domain of zzso to the zzso repression module of the zzso zzso gene in order to zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso this zzso construct resulted in a block in zzso movements but not expression of zzso and zzso marker zzso Furthermore, injection of zzso into one of two zzso resulted in normal zzso movements of zzso derived from the injected zzso indicating that zzso downstream function may be zzso during sea zzso zzso
