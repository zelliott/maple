zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso and zzso zzso is able to catalyze the zzso of a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso the first structure of an zzso representative of the zzso family, is zzso The structure was solved using the zzso anomalous zzso zzso zzso structures of the zzso zzso and a complex of zzso an zzso analogue and zzso were determined to zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso Each zzso comprises an zzso and a smaller lid domain and has an overall fold characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso shares highest structural similarity to the zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso Similar to zzso and other zzso members, the lid domain of zzso zzso a significant zzso change upon zzso zzso In the crystal structure of the zzso complex, zzso A adopts a closed zzso and zzso B an open zzso In zzso A all zzso and zzso were observed, whereas in zzso B only the zzso analogue could be clearly identified in the electron zzso The structures of zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso were compared with respect to putative zzso of zzso zzso Relative to zzso zzso shows an increased charged and a decreased zzso accessible surface area, as well as a higher fraction of charged zzso zzso networks and large aromatic zzso characteristics that are frequently observed in zzso from zzso
