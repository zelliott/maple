In the zzso era, zzso has emerged as a valid molecular target involved in many zzso pathways such as cellular protein zzso This includes zzso and translation, zzso and zzso proteins binding to zzso zzso that zzso zzso genetic zzso The binding of natural and synthetic zzso to zzso or zzso complexes has been a central focus of small zzso recognition events, since they bind selectively to a variety of zzso zzso The understanding of the contribution of zzso and charge motifs involved in zzso complexes gives remarkable information of the zzso zzso process, thereby opening new insights for drug zzso This review comprises relevant information about zzso zzso including chemical structure, molecular zzso zzso zzso recent advances in zzso zzso over the last four years, resistance mechanisms and zzso zzso
