The zzso extra sex combs zzso zzso a member of the zzso group zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso protein is required in early zzso at about the time that other zzso proteins become engaged in zzso gene zzso The zzso protein consists primarily of multiple copies of the zzso zzso a motif that has been implicated in zzso zzso To further investigate the domain organization of zzso zzso we have isolated and characterized zzso zzso from divergent insect zzso We report that zzso protein is highly zzso in housefly zzso identical to zzso zzso butterfly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that the butterfly zzso provides zzso function in zzso indicating that the sequence similarities reflect functional zzso zzso modeling using the crystal structure of another zzso repeat zzso the zzso zzso predicts that zzso protein adopts a zzso zzso The sequence comparisons and modeling suggest that there are seven zzso repeats in zzso protein which together form a zzso zzso We locate the zzso regions in zzso protein with respect to this predicted zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso predicted to extend from the zzso surface, identifies zzso parts of zzso protein required for function in zzso We suggest that these regions might mediate physical interaction with zzso partner zzso
