zzso virus zzso zzso was cloned and expressed to high levels in a bacterial zzso zzso The protein was zzso from inclusion bodies then zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso exchange zzso The zzso zzso was zzso active in zzso processing zzso with a zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso correctly and zzso zzso it into zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2A protein zzso Further analyses with synthetic zzso zzso encompassing the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso could recognize and process specific zzso sites within these zzso The zzso with the zzso zzso was unexpected, because zzso between a zzso zzso zzso and a protein zzso from different zzso of this family has otherwise never been zzso In zzso zzso a zzso zzso preparation was unable to cleave the zzso synthetic zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso reactions were also characterized with regard to zzso zzso optimum pH and zzso The protein was additionally used to raise zzso zzso zzso in mice, which in turn localized natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso with zzso and zzso precursors from zzso virus zzso but did not react with zzso proteins from zzso or zzso
