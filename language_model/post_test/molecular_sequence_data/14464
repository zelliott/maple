zzso zzso was isolated from marine zzso of the west Pacific zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the isolate belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that strain zzso was distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso values, zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from all known members of the zzso zzso by a number of zzso zzso However, the dominant fatty acids of strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso the major zzso zzso and the zzso content of the zzso DNA zzso zzso were consistent with those of members of the zzso zzso Based on zzso and zzso features and zzso zzso gene zzso strain zzso can be assigned to the zzso zzso as a representative of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso
