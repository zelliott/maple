zzso synthesis is controlled by the zzso of proteins zzso the zzso zzso At least 12 initiation factor zzso 3 zzso factors and a zzso protein are zzso zzso of translation zzso with enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso Strong evidence for regulatory roles exists for zzso zzso and zzso whereas changes in other factor activities due to zzso remain to be zzso zzso of the specific activity of the zzso apparatus by zzso appears to be a general mechanism for the control of rates of global protein zzso and may also play a role in modulating the translation of specific zzso
