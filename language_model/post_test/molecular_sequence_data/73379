In order to characterize the gene zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso chain of the human zzso zzso two overlapping zzso clones were zzso The gene spans over 25 zzso zzso of the zzso DNA and has seven zzso The zzso domain is zzso by zzso 1 to 5 and by part of zzso zzso The zzso region is also zzso by zzso zzso zzso 7 encodes the zzso domain and the 3' untranslated zzso The gene was located on zzso zzso as determined by in zzso zzso The 4 zzso region upstream zzso of the gene was zzso and analyzed for promoter zzso No zzso zzso or zzso boxes in the zzso region were zzso Potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear factors were zzso zzso with the presence of the zzso sites and the lack of zzso box, zzso mapping experiments showed multiple zzso initiation zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso region was analyzed with two different reporter zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso and human growth zzso The smallest zzso region of the gene that still had full promoter activity was zzso base pairs in zzso In addition, we found sequences belonging to the oldest family of zzso repeats, 2 - 3 zzso upstream of the zzso which could be useful for genetic zzso
