We analyzed the T cell zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso zzso zzso negative zzso T cell clones from normal zzso We found that in four out of six donors this subset contains expanded clones that often account for zzso and, in one individual, even zzso of all peripheral blood zzso By combining limiting dilution analysis and N region zzso of zzso chain reaction amplified zzso zzso we could measure the zzso size and show that two of these expanded clones remain stable in size for up to 4 zzso in peripheral zzso The expanded clones analyzed ex zzso are not cycling and zzso zzso zzso but express high levels of alpha zzso 1 zzso suggesting that they may have reverted to resting cells after zzso One of these expanded zzso clones zzso in zzso in response to zzso coli presented by zzso cultured in zzso plus zzso and kills zzso zzso zzso In contrast to what was found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell clones specific for a zzso toxin zzso showed a very small zzso size zzso 1 in zzso and could not be zzso after 2 zzso Taken together, these results indicate that large zzso size and persistence are distinctive features of zzso zzso cells specific for bacterial zzso These cells may use zzso cells, restriction zzso and selection routes different from those used by zzso zzso T zzso
