The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso of the gamma zzso of zzso into zzso and was previously shown to play a negative role in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, some regulatory features of the expression of zzso were established and the zzso content of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso the expression of zzso was shown to be low but zzso DNA gel shift experiments suggested that zzso expression might be controlled by a zzso using zzso as a zzso Under these conditions, short zzso zzso accumulated upon entry into the stationary phase in the zzso strain but not in the zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso under zzso conditions was shown to be much higher than that under zzso conditions and was under positive control of the zzso system zzso Under these conditions, the zzso content of the cell was low and zzso were zzso found to be longer and more abundant in the zzso zzso strain than in the zzso strain, suggesting that zzso might act as a zzso zzso zzso In light of our results, a novel view of the role of this zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso
