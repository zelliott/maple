A full-length zzso clone of a rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso gene was obtained using zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso extracted from zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso cells zzso zzso was previously identified in rainbow trout by zzso et zzso by zzso with a partial perch zzso zzso probe to induced rainbow trout zzso The zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso clone contains an open reading frame of 1863 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced rainbow trout zzso protein is zzso zzso and contains the characteristic zzso zzso binding motif common to all zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis with the rainbow trout zzso probe demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso genes in four other zzso fish species, including zzso zzso and zzso salmon and brook zzso Poly zzso treatment of both zzso and zzso salmon cells zzso induced two transcripts whose appearance was observed first at 24 h and as long as 72 h after zzso zzso of rainbow trout with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso also induced the synthesis of zzso zzso A comparison of the rainbow trout zzso protein with other reported zzso proteins indicates that the zzso zzso is highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
