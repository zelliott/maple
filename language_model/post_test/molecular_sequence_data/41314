zzso plant infecting zzso zzso zzso have been found in the Old zzso The greatest diversity of these viruses has been found in Africa but this may simply reflect the more extensive sampling that has been done zzso To provide a better understanding of zzso diversity in Australia, we have zzso the zzso of 41 virus zzso found in zzso and native grasses and identified four new species in addition to the four previously zzso zzso Two of these species, which were recovered from a single zzso plant, are highly divergent and are most closely related to the African streak zzso This, coupled with the discovery of divergent zzso plant infecting zzso in Australia brings into question the hypothesis that zzso may have originated in zzso We found that the patterns of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso hotspots mirror those found in both their African zzso counterparts and zzso zzso
