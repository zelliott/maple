Women are at significant risk of zzso transmitted human zzso virus zzso infection, with the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso serving as a major portal of zzso The zzso zzso naturally harbors dynamic zzso composed predominantly of zzso which may be genetically modified to serve as a more efficient protective barrier against the zzso transmission of zzso We selected a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso for genetic modification to display zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso encodes several unique zzso cell zzso proteins with a zzso cell wall sorting zzso zzso In this report, we employed these proteins to express a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our studies indicated that the zzso cell wall sorting signal zzso motif alone is insufficient to drive the surface expression of zzso zzso and the display of zzso zzso zzso molecules required native sequences of a defined length upstream of the unique zzso zzso cell wall sorting signal and the positively charged C zzso in a zzso expression zzso The modified zzso zzso strain displayed zzso zzso molecules that were zzso distributed on bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was recognized by a zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the expressed proteins adopted a native zzso The establishment of this zzso surface expression system, with potential broad zzso represents a major step toward developing an inexpensive yet durable approach to topical zzso for the zzso of zzso transmission of zzso and other zzso transmitted viral zzso
