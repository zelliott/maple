zzso virus is one of the most widely applied expression systems for use in zzso in molecular zzso zzso of zzso genes in the zzso virus system, however, requires integration of the foreign DNA into the zzso virus zzso by means of zzso zzso or by direct molecular zzso In both cases, zzso zzso zzso are required that contain the gene of interest and, usually, a marker zzso both of which are controlled by suitable promoter zzso In order to simplify the construction of zzso and to eliminate the need for a marker gene we have developed a modified zzso virus zzso that allows the direct targeted zzso of DNA fragments downstream of a strong zzso virus promoter without any further cloning zzso The gene of interest is amplified by zzso using zzso zzso that provide an zzso site at the zzso end and an zzso site at the 3' end of the zzso zzso Following zzso with these restriction zzso the zzso product is zzso linked to a synthetic zzso promoter within the viral zzso DNA via the unique zzso sites of the modified zzso virus zzso Using this approach, intermediate zzso zzso and bacterial hosts are not required and time consuming screening steps can be zzso because of zzso of the virus progeny carry the foreign zzso
