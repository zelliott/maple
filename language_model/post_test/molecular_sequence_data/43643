zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso is a distinct zzso within this group of zzso zzso blistering skin zzso In this study we zzso for the first time, a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso in a family with three affected zzso For this purpose, we first determined the zzso organization of zzso and placed the gene on zzso zzso by high resolution radiation hybrid zzso zzso analysis of zzso products containing the individual zzso of zzso followed by direct zzso sequencing, revealed that the zzso was zzso for a zzso zzso in the zzso position of zzso zzso This zzso zzso affects an zzso base of the zzso donor zzso site predicting zzso zzso involving zzso zzso The zzso was verified in the zzso DNA by restriction zzso zzso which also confirmed that the parents were zzso carriers of this zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso which forms a zzso with the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso would explain fragility and blistering as a result of minor trauma to the zzso
