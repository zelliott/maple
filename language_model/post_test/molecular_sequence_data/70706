The data we report in this study concern the types, location, numbers, forms, and composition of microscopic zzso zzso in brain zzso from humans with different grades of zzso disease zzso We have developed a fusion protein zzso against the first 256 zzso acids that zzso recognizes zzso zzso and labels many more zzso in zzso zzso zzso and processes in human brain than have been described zzso Using this zzso and human brain tissue ranging from zzso to grade 4, we have compared the numbers and locations of nuclear and zzso zzso with the known patterns of zzso death in zzso We show that zzso zzso are much more common than nuclear zzso and can be present in large numbers before the onset of clinical zzso There are also many more zzso in zzso than in zzso where they are actually zzso Although the zzso is the most affected region in zzso only zzso of zzso zzso in all grades of HD have nuclear zzso zzso zzso which we have identified by electron zzso to occur in zzso and zzso zzso could play a role in the known zzso pathology that occurs in zzso zzso increase in size in advanced grades, suggesting that they may persist in zzso that are more likely to zzso zzso is apparent in only a subset of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso may be late or zzso
