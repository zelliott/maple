The majority of zzso directed against zzso zzso protein zzso zzso during secondary immune responses of zzso mice bear a zzso zzso Id zzso or zzso which zzso to the zzso of a unique combination of variable region gene segments that can differ by zzso zzso One such zzso zzso zzso zzso bears zzso as defined by rabbit zzso but does not react with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which react with all primary zzso zzso zzso and some secondary response zzso zzso We therefore determined the complete sequence of zzso zzso which differs from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at four positions in the H chain V region zzso position 55 in the second zzso determining region, 100 and 107 zzso zzso and 110 (in zzso The zzso L chain is zzso zzso analyses of five other secondary immune response zzso zzso zzso chosen on the basis of sharing one or more of the zzso acid zzso found in zzso were correlated with zzso expression of this set of zzso The results suggest that the zzso at zzso position 55 zzso is responsible for loss of the zzso zzso To substantiate this hypothesis, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to produce two zzso one with zzso zzso 55 and the other containing zzso at positions 100, 107 and 110 identical to those found in zzso Id binding studies on these zzso confirm that zzso zzso loss is due to zzso changes resulting from a zzso at zzso position zzso This zzso also results in loss of the zzso zzso in the structural context of zzso zzso
