zzso based on a highly zzso cell surface exposed zzso region of the group A zzso M protein zzso have been found to induce protection against zzso challenge by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced to four partially overlapping peptides of the zzso region of zzso zzso These were examined by both direct and competitive zzso and by Western zzso for their zzso against zzso coiled zzso proteins such as zzso myosin, light zzso heavy zzso and cardiac zzso and to the zzso forms of some of these zzso All zzso reacted strongly with the zzso zzso protein zzso In addition, zzso to three of the peptides displayed generally low levels of zzso with at least one of the zzso zzso whereas zzso to one zzso did not zzso with any of the proteins zzso The observed zzso was found to be directed predominantly against zzso forms of the zzso zzso For instance, the zzso forms of zzso bound better to the zzso zzso than the intact zzso Furthermore, zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso better in competitive zzso than the zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that M protein peptides corresponding to zzso shared among rheumatic zzso strains of zzso can lead to the production of low levels of zzso zzso with zzso coiled zzso zzso These zzso are directed against the zzso forms of these zzso
