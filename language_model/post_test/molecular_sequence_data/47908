Five rough colony zzso of zzso zzso zzso were produced by zzso zzso The zzso were unable to zzso zzso that are normally abundant in the cell wall of zzso zzso zzso The zzso have a zzso core zzso a fatty acid zzso linked to a zzso that is modified with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of lipids extracted from the zzso indicated that the zzso in zzso synthesis occurred in the assembly of the zzso zzso No other defects or zzso changes in cell wall structure were detected in the zzso All five zzso had zzso insertions in a gene zzso an zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of the gene in the zzso strain gave a zzso identical to that of the five zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is predicted to zzso four zzso that each contain zzso for zzso binding and for zzso acid recognition and zzso Three zzso also have zzso acid zzso zzso These data suggest that the common zzso core of these important cell wall zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso
