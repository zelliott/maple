The zzso devil zzso zzso is threatened with extinction because of a contagious cancer known as Devil zzso zzso zzso The inability to mount an immune response and to reject these tumors might be caused by a lack of genetic diversity within a dwindling zzso Here we report a zzso analysis of two animals originating from extreme northwest and southeast zzso the zzso geographic spread, together with the zzso from a tumor taken from one of zzso A zzso de zzso assembly of the sequence data from two complementary next-generation sequencing platforms was used to identify 1 million zzso zzso positions, roughly one-quarter of the number observed between two genetically distant human zzso Analysis of 14 complete zzso zzso from current and museum zzso as well as zzso and nuclear zzso markers in 175 animals, suggests that the observed low genetic diversity in today's population preceded the Devil zzso zzso Disease disease outbreak by at least 100 zzso Using a genetically characterized breeding stock based on the zzso sequence will enable preservation of the extant genetic diversity in future zzso devil zzso
