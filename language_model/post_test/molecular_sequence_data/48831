Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso from an Arctic zzso The zzso fatty acids of both strains were zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso feature zzso zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso feature 8) and both strains contained zzso as the respiratory zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso two unidentified zzso and one unidentified zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strains zzso and zzso were members of the zzso zzso and closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence similarity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso between strains zzso and zzso was zzso zzso while strains zzso and zzso had zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso patterns of strains zzso and zzso were similar but differed from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on data from the current zzso study, strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
