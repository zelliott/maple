zzso zzso against eye muscle zzso are closely linked with zzso zzso zzso although their significance is zzso The two zzso that are most often recognized are eye muscle membrane proteins with molecular masses of 55 and 64 zzso as determined from zzso with crude human or zzso eye muscle zzso We cloned a zzso of the zzso protein by screening an eye muscle expression library with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso prepared from a zzso patient's zzso A complementary DNA zzso zzso a novel zzso which we have called zzso was zzso on both zzso and its size was 411 zzso The open reading frame of zzso corresponded to a zzso acid zzso with a size of zzso zzso Using the rapid amplification of zzso ends technique we were able to clone an additional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not share significant zzso with any other entered protein in computer databases and had one putative zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as probe in Northern zzso of a panel of zzso zzso acids prepared from human zzso the parent protein was shown to zzso to a large zzso of about zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 220 zzso consistent with earlier zzso studies performed in the absence of reducing zzso zzso was strongly expressed in eye muscle, zzso and other skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in zzso liver, zzso and heart muscle, but not in kidney or zzso zzso We tested zzso from patients with zzso zzso with and without zzso and from control patients and subjects for zzso against a zzso fusion protein by zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with zzso were identified in zzso of patients with zzso of less than 3 zzso zzso zzso with zzso of more than 3 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso without evident zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with type 1 diabetes, zzso with zzso zzso disorders, and zzso of normal zzso The zzso compared to normal values, were significant for the two groups of patients with zzso but not for the other zzso Tests were positive in zzso of patients with active zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with type 1 diabetes, and in zzso of normal subjects using zzso zzso zzso The zzso predicted the development of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in six of seven patients and the zzso zzso zzso in seven of eight patients, respectively, with zzso zzso studied zzso during and after zzso drug zzso zzso zzso with zzso may be early markers of zzso in patients with zzso zzso Because zzso is expressed in both zzso and eye muscle, zzso against a shared zzso in the two zzso may explain the well known link between zzso zzso and zzso
