zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso in the zzso zzso zzso thereby initiating a process by which the zzso active zzso fragments of zzso are released from zzso In the current experiments, we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells or zzso zzso cells that lack zzso zzso protection zzso showed that the bulk of zzso is in the zzso zzso zzso anchored by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal sequence of zzso generates zzso zzso acids zzso which is zzso The protein is zzso by an zzso zzso at zzso generating zzso zzso acids zzso and liberating a zzso acid zzso that is zzso intact into the zzso The sequence at zzso is zzso which differs from the zzso sequence at the zzso site in zzso zzso is further zzso at an internal zzso sequence to yield zzso zzso acids zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso and zzso are both active in zzso zzso in a fashion that requires zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso may be short-lived because it appears to be transported to the zzso a site at which zzso zzso may not normally zzso These data provide the initial description of the processing of a zzso zzso that controls the level of cholesterol in blood and zzso In an accompanying paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso and Goldstein, zzso zzso (1999), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we develop an in zzso zzso to characterize the activity of zzso zzso zzso
