African zzso show zzso expression of one of about 20 zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso sites zzso while zzso in the zzso zzso We screened for genes involved in zzso zzso using flow zzso and zzso interference zzso We show that a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso has an zzso protein architecture for an zzso as it lacks characteristic zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in insect form zzso zzso We show that although blocking synthesis of zzso leads to zzso of silent zzso zzso zzso this does not lead to fully zzso zzso of silent zzso or an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in African zzso therefore appears to be a zzso process, zzso an increase in zzso from a silent zzso promoter is necessary but not sufficient for full zzso zzso
