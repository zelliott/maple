The role of zzso interactions established by the zzso that belong to the main zzso core of zzso A in its zzso transition state was investigated using the zzso zzso The folding zzso was studied using zzso techniques both in the zzso and zzso zzso The ratio between the folding zzso volume and the reaction volume zzso zzso which is an index of the zzso or degree of zzso of the transition state, was zzso All the positions analyzed presented fractional zzso zzso and the lowest were those corresponding to the most critical positions for the zzso A zzso The structure of the transition state of the zzso core of zzso A, from the point of view of formed zzso is a zzso zzso expanded form of the folded structure with a mean zzso zzso of zzso This places it halfway between the folded and unfolded zzso On the other hand, for the zzso the average of beta zzso is zzso suggesting a transition state that is zzso zzso zzso the results suggest that the zzso transition state of zzso A looks like a collapsed zzso with some secondary structure and a weakened zzso zzso A good correlation was found between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Although the nature of the transition state zzso from zzso folding studies and the results of the protein engineering method have been reported to be consistent for other zzso to the best of our knowledge this is the first direct comparison using a set of zzso
