zzso fusion in cells involves the interaction of zzso proteins on zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes is preceded by zzso events, and a number of protein complexes that are thought to mediate this have been zzso The zzso or zzso complex is required for zzso traffic in zzso It consists of four zzso one of which, zzso has been shown to bind specifically to the zzso zzso which zzso in the same fusion zzso We have determined the structure of the zzso domain of zzso bound to a zzso from the N zzso of zzso zzso depends mainly on zzso zzso of zzso These form a short zzso which lies in a zzso groove in the zzso bundle formed by zzso Surprisingly, although both zzso and zzso are required for transport to the late zzso from zzso removal of the zzso sequences from zzso does not block such traffic in zzso Thus, this particular interaction cannot be crucial to the process of zzso zzso or zzso
