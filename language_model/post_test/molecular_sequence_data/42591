zzso zzso is a zzso calcium binding protein mainly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso The gene zzso the rat zzso is subject to tissue specific induction by zzso zzso D3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Control of zzso expression remains zzso The expression of zzso zzso during the zzso period was studied zzso day 21 zzso day 4 zzso In zzso zzso expression levels were found at zzso and maintained until zzso With the transition to zzso the zzso zzso concentration dropped drastically below the detection limit as zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso levels showed a gradual decrease at late pregnancy zzso zzso Post zzso zzso levels continued to decline and P zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels determined by zzso analysis revealed close correlation between expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso at zzso and declined at zzso and with onset of zzso At zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were minimal and had decreased zzso compared to late zzso zzso protein zzso zzso only slightly dependent on the stage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the zzso period zzso concentration was overall lower than in zzso zzso and revealed only a moderate increase at birth and decrease in early zzso Similar to the zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso was highest at zzso and remained high until zzso Fetal zzso zzso rose sharply just prior to birth and zzso in the early zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
