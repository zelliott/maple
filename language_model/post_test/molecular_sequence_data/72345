To investigate the molecular basis of zzso mimicry by zzso we studied a panel of closely related zzso directed against the zzso zzso of group A zzso These zzso have restricted zzso zzso indicating a shared mechanism of binding to a single zzso zzso mapping studies using synthetic fragments of the zzso zzso supported this zzso All of the zzso isolated zzso peptides from a panel of zzso libraries, and competition studies indicated that many of the peptides bind at or near the zzso binding zzso Surprisingly, the peptides isolated by each zzso fell into distinct zzso groups that zzso between the zzso and in general, the peptides bound only to the zzso used for their zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso directed against synthetic zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the peptides appear to be specific for their zzso zzso and are not recognized by the same mechanism as their zzso zzso
