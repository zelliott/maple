A novel protein expressed by zzso cells of the mouse stomach was named zzso Related zzso zzso since it shares sequence similarities with the zzso zzso et zzso The mouse zzso was found identical to the rat precursor of zzso zzso an zzso zzso specific for the Growth zzso zzso zzso identified from rat stomach zzso et zzso In the present study the zzso zzso the dog counterpart of zzso has been isolated and zzso The dog zzso zzso showed scores of respectively zzso and zzso zzso with its human and mouse zzso By translation of the dog zzso zzso zzso two zzso could be deduced zzso either a 117 zzso acid zzso or the deleted zzso zzso as it was also known in zzso rat and zzso The dog zzso shared zzso similarity and zzso identity, and zzso similarity and zzso identity with the human and mouse zzso proteins zzso The best score of zzso was found in the zzso sequence zzso zzso the dog zzso zzso shared zzso similarity and zzso identity, and zzso identity and zzso with the human and mouse zzso Using Northern zzso analysis to study dog zzso gene expression on dog adult gut zzso zzso expression level was found in the stomach zzso and zzso and no expression could be detected in the stomach zzso nor in the zzso zzso zzso colon or zzso In conclusion, we have identified zzso from dog, and found that it is highly zzso with man, mouse or zzso The expression pattern along the zzso tract is similar to the expression pattern previously described in zzso
