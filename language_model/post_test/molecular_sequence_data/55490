After the 2004 discovery of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Q zzso in the United States, there was a vital need to determine the geographical and host distribution as well as its interaction with the resident B zzso because of its innate ability to rapidly develop high-level zzso resistance that persists in the absence of zzso As part of a coordinated zzso effort, an extensive survey of zzso zzso zzso was conducted in North America, with the cooperation of growers, industry, local, state, and federal agencies, to monitor the introduction and distribution of the Q zzso The zzso status of submitted zzso zzso samples was determined either by zzso chain reaction amplification and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso I small zzso gene zzso and characterization of two zzso discriminating nuclear zzso markers or zzso zzso zzso Two hundred and zzso collections were sampled from the United States, Bermuda, Canada, and Mexico during January 2005 through December zzso Host plants were split between ornamental plant and culinary herb zzso and vegetable and field crop zzso zzso The New World zzso was detected on zzso tomatoes zzso zzso zzso in Mexico zzso and in commercial zzso in Texas zzso and represented zzso of these five zzso To our knowledge, the latter identification represents the first report of the New World zzso in the United States since its rapid displacement in the late 1980s after the introduction of zzso zzso Seventy-one percent of all collections contained at least one zzso B individual, and zzso of all collections contained only zzso B zzso zzso Q was detected in 23 states in the United States, Canada zzso Columbia and Ontario zzso Bermuda, and zzso zzso percent of all collections were found to contain zzso Q in samples from zzso herbs and a single collection from tomato transplants located in protected commercial zzso zzso but there were no Q zzso in outdoor agriculture zzso or field zzso Ten of the 15 collections zzso from Canada and a single collection from Bermuda contained zzso zzso representing the first reports of zzso Q for both zzso Three distinct zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Q zzso were detected in North America Our data are consistent with the zzso of independent zzso from at least three different zzso Of the zzso individuals analyzed from 517 collections that include data from our previous work, only 16 individuals contained genetic or zzso evidence of possible zzso of the Q and B zzso and there was no evidence that rare hybrid zzso marker zzso persisted in any zzso
