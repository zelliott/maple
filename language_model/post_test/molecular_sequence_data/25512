The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a region that includes 55 zzso at the 3' end of the zzso gene and 22 zzso in the zzso region between the zzso and O zzso zzso zzso produced from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression by approximately zzso through an zzso zzso zzso Using primer extension analysis of cellular zzso isolated from an induced zzso zzso that contains an zzso DNA zzso we have identified a zzso site in zzso zzso within the region of zzso with zzso zzso at 13 zzso from the 3' end of that zzso zzso protection experiments demonstrate that almost all zzso zzso in this overlap region is zzso when zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments are detected that extend into the O gene from the zzso sites, while the sister fragments that extend into the zzso gene cannot be detected and must be eliminated by additional zzso zzso zzso in levels of zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells are much less at several hundred zzso to either side of the target zzso An alternate zzso zzso zzso process occurs in zzso zzso cells that results in zzso in one of two regions, one close to the zzso site observed in zzso zzso cells, and the second several zzso beyond the end of the complementary region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this latter case, the fragments that extend into the zzso gene are stable, while the sister O gene fragments are zzso in direct contrast to the zzso zzso zzso
