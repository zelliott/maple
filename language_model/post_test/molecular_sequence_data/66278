A polarity complex of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso C zzso functions in various cell polarization zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factors, and forms a complex with zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in certain types of zzso However, the relationship between zzso and the zzso complex remains zzso We found here that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and thereby disrupted its interaction with zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso was observed in the leading edge, and in central and rear portions of zzso cells having zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso impaired cell migration, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were recovered with zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso complex formation through zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso
