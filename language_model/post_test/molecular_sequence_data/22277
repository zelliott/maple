zzso forms of memory require protein zzso but how the pattern of synthesis is related to the storage of a memory has not been zzso Here we show that neural activity directs the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso to zzso sites, where it is rapidly zzso These features of zzso synthesis are zzso during the induction of a long-term memory and produce patterns of local protein synthesis specific to the zzso We show that zzso transport and synaptic protein synthesis are regulated by components of the zzso pathway, including the zzso zzso zzso which is specifically required for long-lasting zzso Armitage is localized to zzso and lost in a zzso pattern that is zzso related to the pattern of synaptic protein zzso zzso we propose that zzso control of the zzso zzso zzso the pattern of synaptic protein synthesis associated with a stable zzso
