We previously identified two zzso protein zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso that code for putative zzso cell surface zzso In this study, we report that the mouse zzso locus codes for at least two classes of zzso zzso These zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso have identical zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that they might recognize the same zzso However, only zzso contains a long zzso region, which includes a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso transcripts coding for this protein were observed in the cerebral zzso and the zzso cell layer of the zzso In contrast, transcripts coding for the zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso linings of the cerebral zzso and in the zzso zzso These results illustrate that a zzso protein zzso locus can code for two structurally and functionally distinct cellular zzso
