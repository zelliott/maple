zzso zzso (a zzso zzso is characterized by gut zzso of zzso zzso and reduced bone zzso zzso as these features zzso enhanced zzso action in gut and bone, we analyzed the vitamin D zzso zzso gene to ascertain whether an zzso of this gene marks patients with zzso zzso of zzso We have compared the frequency of a restriction zzso length zzso zzso I) associated with different zzso of the zzso gene in a group of 33 well characterized zzso zzso patients and a group of 36 normal zzso and zzso control zzso There was no difference between the distribution of the zzso zzso in the patient population when compared with the normal zzso The coding region of zzso zzso zzso was also normal, as determined by both DNA sequence analysis and chemical mismatch zzso analysis of copy DNA from 11 index zzso zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we propose that the enhanced zzso calcium zzso invariably seen in zzso zzso and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to zzso of the zzso and are not linked to a common zzso zzso
