zzso zzso zzso able to degrade aromatic compounds such as zzso were chosen to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of at least one zzso in each studied zzso The zzso proteins exhibited a great variety in the zzso sequences and different zzso activities with the standard zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were chosen to investigate the zzso activities under different growth zzso zzso cells were grown either on zzso or on different zzso carbon sources in the presence and absence of increasing zzso zzso In strain zzso a strong correlation between the activities of the zzso zzso and zzso was observed in all the tested zzso Moreover, growth on different organic acids also affected zzso activity levels, with a negative correlation with the specific growth rate determined by each zzso These results suggest a possible function of zzso as a response to specific zzso conditions determined by zzso toxicity and/or zzso and the zzso status of the zzso The same experiments performed with the zzso strain did not show induction of zzso activity in any of the tested conditions, indicating that zzso probably has a different role in cell zzso Native gel zzso gave indications that zzso zzso could be an important process in the zzso of zzso zzso
