The zzso zzso of aquatic zzso have to meet stringent zzso allowing gases to zzso freely across the zzso zzso preventing the zzso of water vapor inside the hollow cavity and resisting collapse under zzso pressures that vary with column zzso These properties are provided by the 7- to zzso gas zzso protein A zzso repeats of which form all but small, specialized portions of the zzso Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance is uniquely capable of providing high-resolution information on the fold and assembly of zzso Here we compare results for the gas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with those obtained previously for the zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that the two organisms follow similar strategies for avoiding water zzso On the other hand, in its relatively shallow habitat, zzso zzso is able to avoid collapse with a less costly zzso fold than is adopted by zzso zzso
