We simulated spontaneous fusion of small zzso zzso zzso by lung zzso protein B zzso using the zzso force zzso An zzso zzso triggers fusion events by zzso two zzso and zzso the formation of a zzso bridge between the zzso zzso Once a zzso bridge is formed, fusion proceeds via a previously described stalk - zzso zzso - zzso zzso In the absence of zzso fusion of zzso was not observed in either unbiased simulations or upon application of a restraining potential to maintain the zzso in close zzso The shape of zzso appears to enable it to bind to two zzso at once, forcing their zzso and to facilitate the initial transfer of lipids to form a zzso zzso zzso Our results may provide insight into more general mechanisms of zzso membrane fusion, and a possible role of zzso in the zzso zzso and transfer of lung zzso to the gas exchange zzso
