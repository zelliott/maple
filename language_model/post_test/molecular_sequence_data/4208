In this article we report the cloning and expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, which is of interest for use as a potential inhibitor of the common core zzso of zzso bacterial zzso First, two zzso zzso were designed based on the sequence zzso of zzso factors zzso from different species of zzso zzso The total zzso was extracted from zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was then obtained by using the zzso zzso Second, the zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso was expressed in zzso zzso larvae using zzso expression system, which showed a yield of up to 600 zzso zzso we determined the biological activity of the zzso proteins by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
