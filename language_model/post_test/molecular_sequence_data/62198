The zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains two genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that can be assigned to family 4 of the zzso zzso The two zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, reside in separate zzso that also zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grows on a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and the five zzso of zzso In the presence of the requisite zzso extracts of these cells readily zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso but whether zzso reflected expression of zzso zzso by the zzso or zzso genes was not discernible by zzso analysis or zzso gel zzso Resolution of this question required the cloning of the zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent high zzso zzso and characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit 50% zzso identity, and in solution are zzso zzso similar sized ( approximately 50 zzso zzso The two proteins zzso with zzso rabbit zzso against zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with comparable efficiency, but only zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso formed via the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso confirmed expression of zzso during growth on many zzso zzso zzso changes zzso and zzso yielded zzso but zzso inactive zzso Of the two putative zzso our findings suggest that only proteins zzso by the zzso zzso participate in the zzso of zzso and related zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
