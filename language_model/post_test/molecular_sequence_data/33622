zzso coding genes constitute only approximately zzso of the human zzso but harbor zzso of the zzso with large effects on zzso zzso zzso efficient strategies for selectively sequencing complete coding regions zzso zzso zzso have the potential to contribute to the understanding of rare and common human zzso Here we report a method for zzso sequencing zzso zzso whole zzso zzso to the zzso DNA sequencing zzso We demonstrate the ability to capture approximately zzso of the targeted coding sequences with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of zzso and zzso zzso We illustrate the utility of this approach by making an unanticipated genetic diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso in a patient referred with a suspected diagnosis of zzso syndrome, a zzso zzso zzso The molecular diagnosis was based on the finding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso at a position in zzso (the known zzso zzso zzso zzso that is virtually completely zzso in zzso and zzso from zzso to humans, and clinical follow-up confirmed the zzso To our knowledge, zzso (or zzso sequencing has not previously been used to make a genetic zzso Five additional patients suspected to have zzso syndrome but who did not have zzso in known genes for this disease had zzso deleterious zzso in zzso These results demonstrate the clinical utility of zzso sequencing and have implications for disease gene discovery and clinical zzso
