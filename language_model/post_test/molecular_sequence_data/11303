zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso of zzso in response to tissue injury and thus plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions of zzso in zzso zzso We previously zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor type 1, zzso from the zzso medium of a human stomach zzso cell line zzso and cloned its zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso a second type of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso from the zzso medium of zzso cells and zzso cloned its zzso The zzso sequence revealed that zzso is derived from a precursor protein of 252 zzso acids and contains two zzso zzso indicating that zzso is also a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The primary translation product of zzso has a zzso sequence in the zzso region, suggesting that, like zzso zzso is produced in a zzso form and zzso in a zzso truncated zzso Because zzso and zzso are potent zzso specific for zzso zzso they may be involved in regulation of zzso zzso of zzso in injured zzso
