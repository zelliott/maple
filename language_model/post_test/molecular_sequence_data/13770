The zzso family of proteins are structurally related to zzso class I zzso but are only zzso related to the class I proteins or other zzso class zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the zzso proteins have evolved into two zzso those which are similar to human zzso zzso and c and those which are similar to human zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes were deleted from zzso and the zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso and c are expressed by zzso zzso cells, activated zzso and B cells zzso a tissue distribution which strongly suggests a role in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and its zzso zzso are expressed by many cells outside of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso proteins are in most cases expressed as beta zzso membrane zzso but may associate with additional zzso zzso is expressed on the surface of zzso zzso cells in a zzso form without beta zzso Whether the zzso proteins function as zzso molecules is zzso but it is unlikely that they present conventional zzso zzso Strong evidence indicates that zzso zzso proteins are recognized by a population of zzso zzso or zzso zzso negative, zzso T cells which express an zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso is most likely recognized by the zzso T cell population in zzso zzso alpha beta T cells which recognize zzso zzso or c have been isolated, including clones which recognize a zzso zzso from zzso presented by zzso A third potential population of zzso zzso cells are zzso T cells in the zzso zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that zzso proteins interact with several specialized populations of T zzso The precise biological functions zzso through these interactions remain to be zzso
