zzso zzso are ubiquitous small proteins with a zzso zzso zzso In their reduced form, they constitute very efficient protein zzso zzso In zzso two types of zzso zzso and zzso coexist and play central roles in the regulation of the Calvin cycle and other zzso Here, we identified a class of zzso targets in the inner zzso envelope membrane of zzso that share a zzso motif approximately 73 zzso from their zzso zzso Members of this group belong to a zzso of zzso zzso proteins involved in protein zzso and zzso zzso These proteins include the protein zzso protein zzso the precursor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which operates as zzso zzso and the lethal leaf spot protein zzso which is identical with zzso a zzso The role of these proteins in zzso regulation and zzso control by the zzso system is zzso
