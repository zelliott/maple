Here we show that the expression of a zzso zzso zzso with several zzso events associated with programmed cell death zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso during leaf zzso fruit zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares high zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso of tobacco zzso and tomato zzso that have not been previously reported to be zzso In contrast, zzso shows lower zzso zzso acid identity to other zzso zzso zzso and, unlike most of them, it is not zzso expressed in certain zzso or cell zzso Northern analysis of leaves, fruits and flowers at different stages of development showed that zzso expression increased significantly at zzso in leaf and fruit, but was highly expressed throughout flower zzso In zzso zzso studies on flower sections using an zzso zzso probe localized the zzso zzso to the zzso the zzso and the zzso of the zzso and the zzso cells, suggesting its involvement in zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso development, zzso Its expression during zzso cell zzso suggests that protein reserves of the zzso are released to the developing zzso zzso in its pattern of expression in the zzso of the developing seed zzso further implies a directional flow of these zzso
