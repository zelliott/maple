The sequential zzso expression occurring during zzso bone formation was investigated using the tooth extraction zzso created in rat zzso bone in zzso The differential expression of bone zzso zzso zzso such as collagen I and zzso was confirmed by zzso transfer zzso analysis and in zzso zzso during the active healing period of the zzso zzso To clarify the possible involvement of the zzso zzso during the process of zzso bone formation, the expression of cartilage collagen II and IX was further examined in this zzso It was found that both alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso were present, but the alpha zzso zzso was a transcript from the downstream start zzso which is a different site in the alpha zzso gene from that used in zzso zzso In zzso zzso indicated that the alpha zzso message was expressed by cells associated with bone zzso in the early formation zzso This finding led to the investigation of type IX collagen expression by zzso cells isolated from newborn rat zzso in which only the truncated form of alpha zzso zzso was indicated by zzso transfer zzso The expression of collagen II and a truncated form of collagen IX may represent an early zzso feature of zzso zzso
