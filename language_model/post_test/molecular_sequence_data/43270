The zzso sequence of zzso DNA, cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso reveals a coding region of zzso zzso which matches the size of zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso protein of approximately 36 zzso Like the zzso of the hypersensitive reaction zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the deduced zzso protein does not possess a typical signal zzso but it contains a putative zzso zzso In zzso coli strains zzso zzso the zzso protein has been identified as the zzso product by Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso from zzso coli elicits the zzso in tobacco zzso Moreover, a zzso and zzso double zzso zzso zzso regulator of secondary zzso does not produce this zzso protein or elicit the HR, although this strain, like the zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and zzso celery zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso encodes the zzso of the HR, designated zzso The levels of zzso transcripts are affected in both zzso and zzso strains by media composition and carbon sources, although the zzso levels are substantially higher in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso is cell density dependent and is activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso expression in an zzso strain is independent of cell density, and substantial expression occurs in the absence of zzso The effects of cultural conditions and the occurrence of putative zzso zzso such as consensus zzso 54 promoters and an zzso promoter upstream of the zzso start site, indicate that the production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is tightly zzso These zzso taken along with the finding that the zzso is caused by zzso zzso but not by zzso strains zzso et zzso 1996, zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly support the idea that the inability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to elicit the zzso is due to the lack of a significant level of zzso zzso
