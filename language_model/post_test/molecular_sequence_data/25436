zzso zzso protein was isolated from familial zzso zzso type IV zzso zzso cardiac tissue and zzso to zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis shows that the zzso protein is a zzso of the inner region of human zzso When compared with the predicted sequence of human plasma zzso the zzso protein contains an zzso acid substitution at position 15 corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso region of zzso specifically stained the zzso deposited in zzso in familial zzso type zzso The results show that the zzso zzso protein in familial zzso zzso type IV represents a unique type of zzso derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso by limited zzso
