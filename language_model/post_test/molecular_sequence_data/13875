We report a case of a man positive for the human zzso virus who rapidly died of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso After autopsy, zzso study of the different tumor sites showed the same zzso feature of zzso lymphoma, with large areas of zzso In zzso zzso showed zzso zzso light chain zzso within lung zzso cells and zzso zzso light chain zzso within cerebral zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed two different zzso heavy chain gene zzso for lung and cerebral zzso Here the simultaneous association of two zzso zzso derived from different zzso clones indicates that molecular analysis of different tumor sites can distinguish between dissemination of the same zzso and simultaneous proliferation of different zzso zzso zzso
