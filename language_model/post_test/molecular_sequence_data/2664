We have determined the zzso sequence and the derived zzso acid sequence of the zzso region of the chicken zzso III zzso The sequence of this minor zzso could be aligned with zzso 22 up to zzso 27 of the previously zzso major zzso II gene zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso 23 and 25 sequences are rich in zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and this region encodes at least one of the small egg zzso zzso The major egg zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the analogous region in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso II and zzso III sequences shows a great reduction in the size of the putative zzso 23 of the latter zzso base pairs as opposed to zzso The number of zzso zzso is also drastically reduced from 124 in zzso 23 of the zzso II gene to 28 in zzso zzso The grouping of synonymous zzso zzso as has zzso been observed in zzso zzso zzso has been maintained in zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso site which was zzso in the chicken zzso II and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the beginning of zzso 23, is also present in zzso zzso The two chicken zzso show a low conservation in the zzso region zzso zzso at the protein zzso compared to that in the peripheral sequences zzso zzso which indicates that it is a rapidly evolving domain of the zzso zzso zzso
