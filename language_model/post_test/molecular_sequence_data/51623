zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to investigate the structure of the zzso alpha zzso of the zzso zzso a closely related zzso beta zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso spectral changes, indicative of a zzso change, were observed on formation of a complex with a 17 zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso is identical to the sequence surrounding zzso in the zzso region of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation times measured by zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso binding changed the shape of the zzso zzso zzso The CD and zzso zzso data support the secondary structure prediction based on sequence analysis and provide evidence for flexible zzso regions between the various zzso of the zzso zzso The significance of these results for zzso zzso proteins is zzso
