The mouse zzso gene encodes a small zzso zzso named zzso protein 1 zzso for its interaction with the zzso Ran zzso zzso binds the biologically active form of zzso Ran has been implicated in a variety of nuclear events including DNA zzso zzso export and protein import, and monitoring completion of DNA synthesis before the onset of zzso it biological activity is thought to be regulated in S zzso We have investigated whether expression of the zzso gene is linked to cell zzso zzso of the zzso transcript appeared to be dependent on the zzso state of the cells and peaked in S zzso We have identified a promoter region required for zzso cell zzso expression and for responsiveness to cell cycle zzso An zzso site was identified within the cell zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso in zzso zzso in addition, both zzso and its relative zzso inhibited zzso from the zzso zzso These results link the control of zzso expression to the cell cycle zzso
