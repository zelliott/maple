zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso termed core zzso with two- to zzso insertions were assessed for zzso formation, zzso zzso and the ability to support reverse zzso of the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of insect zzso zzso core proteins revealed that only two of the nine zzso zzso proteins formed zzso with the tight zzso patterns of zzso zzso The remaining zzso core proteins were spread over the zzso suggesting zzso formation, or at the top of the zzso suggesting lack of stable zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins were zzso in zzso cells with an zzso zzso lacking a functional core gene to test for trans zzso of zzso zzso Three of the zzso core proteins formed zzso containing zzso zzso but only two of these contained zzso zzso zzso While the core protein has shown resiliency in zzso formation following zzso of foreign zzso into the major zzso zzso several of the small insertions severely reduced the efficiency of zzso formation and inhibited zzso zzso
