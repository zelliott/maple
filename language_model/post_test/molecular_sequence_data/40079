zzso is a primary environmental cue for seed zzso of many weeds and zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso regulation by temperature, we selected five high temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 20,000 zzso zzso lines of zzso zzso analyses indicated that each of the five lines had single locus zzso zzso The seeds of zzso and zzso showed reduced sensitivity to zzso and also to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing analyses indicated that zzso is a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibited a maternal effect for both zzso and transparent zzso zzso and genetic analysis revealed that the zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the seeds of reduced dormancy zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso tolerant, and all the zzso seeds showed reduced zzso Like zzso zzso had shorter zzso and slightly shorter stems than the wild zzso The zzso of zzso was mapped to the bottom arm of zzso 1 where zzso has also been zzso but the two zzso are not zzso We designated zzso as zzso zzso 1 zzso We also mapped the zzso zzso of zzso to the bottom arm of zzso 5 and named it zzso These results show that both zzso and maternal factors contribute to zzso zzso at zzso temperatures in zzso In addition, we confirm the role of zzso in zzso of seed zzso and a link between seed zzso dormancy and response to high zzso
