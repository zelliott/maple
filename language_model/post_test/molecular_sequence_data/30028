Three zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso are zzso Two of them zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso library by zzso at low stringency with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The first clone contains a zzso defining a new class of zzso zzso This gene maps on the third zzso of zzso zzso at the same locus as zzso a gene already known to be essential for the determination of specific zzso In the second zzso sequence analysis revealed the existence of the third zzso of a putative zzso zzso which is interrupted by an zzso located upstream of the zzso for the zzso acid 45 of the zzso Using the zzso zzso as a probe, a third zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso As zzso belongs to the zzso class of zzso we conclude that, at the time when the zzso lineage zzso from the zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso which led to the zzso and the zzso families of zzso had already taken zzso
