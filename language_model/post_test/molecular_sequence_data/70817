The molecular epidemiology and evolution of zzso zzso virus in Australia was zzso Several zzso virus strains isolated from other countries were also included in the zzso Two regions of the virus zzso were zzso including a zzso zzso region of the zzso gene and a 484 zzso region containing part of the junction region and the zzso end of the C zzso Analysis of the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence data from 40 zzso virus zzso clearly separated the zzso and zzso genetic types of zzso zzso zzso of the Australian strains showed a zzso rather than geographic zzso This is consistent with the virus having migratory birds as the major zzso host, as it allows for movement of virus over vast areas of the continent over a relatively short period of zzso The results suggest that the virus is being periodically redistributed over the continent from an zzso focus of evolving zzso zzso However, zzso virus strains isolated from mosquitoes collected in the zzso of Australia appear to represent a new zzso virus zzso which is distinct from the zzso and zzso zzso Given the widespread geographic zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso it is surprising that the zzso genetic type is so restricted in its area of zzso zzso sequence data from the C gene of the zzso strain of the zzso zzso were also zzso This virus was found to be genetically distinct from the zzso virus zzso included in the present study; however, it is clearly zzso and appears to have evolved from a zzso ancestral zzso
