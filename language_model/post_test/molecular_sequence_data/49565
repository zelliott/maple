Even though more than 200 three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso zzso to a variety of zzso are available in the zzso Data Bank; very few structures of zzso protein have been zzso We have recently solved structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to resolutions of zzso A and zzso A, and have found that the zzso assume zzso zzso even in the absence of any bound zzso We report comparison of the zzso zzso structure with structures of zzso zzso inhibitor complexes with a view to accurately identifying structural changes that the zzso can induce on binding to zzso zzso in the zzso These studies reveal that the least flexible region present in the active site of zzso zzso need not also be the least adaptable to external stress, thus highlighting the conceptual difference between flexibility and zzso of proteins in zzso
