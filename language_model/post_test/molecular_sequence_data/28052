zzso peptides including the zzso recognition site and zzso zzso acids were compared as zzso for vitamin zzso zzso by bovine liver zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso IX zzso to zzso were zzso with a zzso of 3 zzso The zzso of zzso was 2-3 times greater than that of zzso An analog of zzso that contained the zzso zzso had a zzso zzso greater than an analog of zzso that contained the Factor IX zzso zzso based upon Factor IX Cambridge, zzso based upon Factor IX Oxford 3, and zzso had equivalent zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso or zzso were zzso at equivalent zzso A zzso containing zzso was zzso at a rate of about zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso of peptides containing zzso and zzso yielded results identical with peptides containing zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso when zzso for zzso in a zzso containing zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is more efficient in the zzso process than is the Factor IX zzso but that both zzso direct zzso the zzso recognition site does not include zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid and zzso are poor zzso for the zzso but zzso acid does not inhibit the zzso of adjacent zzso zzso
