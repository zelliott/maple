zzso genes zzso a family of basic zzso zzso zzso factors with both zzso and Orange zzso zzso proteins are direct targets of the zzso signaling zzso and play an essential role in zzso decisions, such as the developments of nervous system, zzso blood vessel and zzso Despite their important functions, the origin and evolution of this zzso gene family has yet to be zzso 

In this study, we identified genes of the zzso family in representative species and performed evolutionary analysis to zzso their origin and evolutionary zzso Our results showed that the zzso genes only existed in zzso and may originate from the common zzso of zzso We identified zzso genes in more than 10 species representing the main zzso Combining the zzso and Orange domain zzso we constructed the zzso trees by different methods zzso zzso NJ and zzso and classified the zzso gene family into four zzso Our results indicated that this gene family had undergone three expansions, which were along with the origins of zzso zzso and zzso Gene structure analysis revealed that the zzso genes were involved in zzso and/or zzso loss in different species zzso Genes of this family were duplicated in zzso zzso and doubled than other zzso Furthermore, we studied the zzso zzso in zzso and investigated the expression pattern of duplicated genes in different zzso by zzso Finally, we proposed a model to show the evolution of this gene family with processes of expansion, zzso loss, and motif zzso 

Our study revealed the evolution of zzso gene family, the expression and function divergence of duplicated zzso which also provide clues for the research of zzso function in zzso This study shows a model of gene family analysis with gene structure evolution and zzso
