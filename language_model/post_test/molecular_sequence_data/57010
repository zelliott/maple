A large block of simple sequence repeat zzso zzso for the dog zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso of primary libraries by conventional zzso methods as well as by screening of enriched zzso libraries led to the isolation of a large number of zzso clones that contained zzso zzso The sequences of 101 clones showed that the size and complexity of zzso repeats in the dog zzso were similar to those reported for these markers in the human zzso zzso analysis of a representative subset of these markers revealed that most markers were moderately to highly zzso with zzso values exceeding zzso for zzso of the markers zzso An association between higher zzso values and markers containing longer zzso repeats was observed in these studies, as previously noted for similar markers in the human zzso A list of primer sequences that tag each characterized marker is zzso and a comprehensive system of nomenclature for the dog zzso is zzso
