Bone mass and its mineral content are under genetic zzso The vitamin D zzso zzso gene has been shown to be a major locus for genetic effects on bone mineral density zzso and zzso in this gene accounted for a large proportion of genetic zzso in zzso in an Australian zzso In this study, we investigated whether similar associations are present in a North American zzso We studied 139 normal healthy women (age zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and 43 severely zzso zzso women (age zzso zzso zzso In the zzso of them with complete genetic studies, the distribution of zzso determined by zzso chain reaction on zzso DNA samples, agreed closely with that in the Australian zzso zzso was strongly related to age and weight, and, thus was adjusted for these parameters prior to genetic zzso We found that age modulated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso neck zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso such that the effect of zzso was greatest among younger zzso women and declined with age so that there was no discernible difference by age zzso Among the younger women, a high zzso was associated with the zzso (or zzso or zzso zzso while low zzso was associated with the zzso (or AA or zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
