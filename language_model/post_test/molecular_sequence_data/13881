A new method is described for identifying short regions of sequence similarity in a group of selected zzso These regions have been used for the design of both specific and zzso zzso zzso for the detection of groups of plant zzso but the method has wider zzso The method is an extension of the zzso programs zzso and zzso so the name zzso zzso is suggested as a generic term for zzso designed in this zzso The method described is more direct and more efficient than current methods that use sequence alignment zzso
