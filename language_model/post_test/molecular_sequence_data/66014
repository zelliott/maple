zzso represent localized areas of extreme organic enrichment in an otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within these zzso is typically portrayed as zzso however, we demonstrate that these systems are also favorable for diverse zzso zzso zzso representing up to zzso of total cell zzso Chemical analyses revealed elevated methane and depleted zzso zzso in sediments under the zzso as compared to surrounding zzso zzso was enriched (up to zzso in zzso zzso as well as the surrounding sea floor to at least 10 zzso forming a zzso zzso of elevated zzso The diversity of zzso zzso associated with the zzso m zzso in zzso Canyon zzso varied both zzso and zzso zzso zzso diversity, determined by both sequencing and terminal restriction zzso length zzso analysis, as well as quantitative zzso of the zzso M zzso zzso revealed that zzso including members of the zzso and zzso were the dominant zzso (up to zzso in sediments immediately beneath the zzso zzso changes in this zzso community included the early establishment of zzso zzso followed by development of zzso thought to be zzso as well as members related to the newly described zzso zzso zzso In comparison, zzso zzso in zzso sediments collected 10 m from the zzso primarily consisted of zzso affiliated with marine group I and marine zzso group zzso Overall, these results indicate that zzso can favor the establishment of metabolically and zzso diverse zzso zzso resulting in an active zzso methane cycle in the deep zzso
