Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by the deposition of zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso reduce zzso deposition and improve clinical symptoms seen in zzso However, conventional zzso therapies risk an inflammatory response that can result in zzso and cerebral zzso Here we report on the development of zzso single chain variable domain zzso fragments zzso directed against the zzso zzso region as potential zzso for zzso that do not risk an inflammatory zzso The zzso region of zzso represents a promising therapeutic target since it promotes zzso and is highly zzso Two zzso with differing affinities for zzso were zzso and both inhibited zzso of zzso as determined by zzso T binding zzso and atomic force zzso analysis and blocked zzso toxicity toward human zzso zzso cells as determined by zzso and zzso release zzso These results provide additional evidence that zzso against zzso provide an attractive alternative to more conventional zzso zzso for controlling zzso and toxicity of zzso
