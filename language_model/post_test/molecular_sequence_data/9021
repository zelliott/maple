The zzso producer zzso zzso zzso contains all the necessary genes for zzso zzso grouped in the zzso zzso This cluster includes zzso an zzso zzso like zzso 

This work shows that zzso was zzso transcribed in absence of zzso at zzso zzso showing a greater than zzso induction in zzso levels over levels occurring in presence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso start site revealed an unusually long untranslated leader region of zzso zzso which displays the typical features of the T box zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration regulation of zzso was found to be zzso by a zzso zzso system, whereas the specific induction at zzso pH was regulated at zzso initiation zzso 

The expression of the zzso gene present in the zzso cluster of zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso concentration and zzso zzso The regulation is zzso by both an zzso system and the promoter zzso
