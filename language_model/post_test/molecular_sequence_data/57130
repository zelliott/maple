The zzso for human zzso was cloned by zzso chain reaction zzso and identified based on its remarkably high zzso acid identity zzso with the bovine zzso Two alternatively spliced zzso of human zzso differing only in the presence or absence of 24 base zzso zzso acids within the zzso were identified and called zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso were found in all zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed the existence of a single gene for zzso suggesting that the two zzso are generated by alternative zzso zzso The possible presence of similar zzso was investigated for the other members of the zzso gene family by zzso Two zzso of zzso were revealed in bovine peripheral blood zzso The expression of zzso was studied in several human zzso and cell zzso High levels of zzso zzso and zzso were found in peripheral blood zzso The possible regulation of the expression of zzso was also zzso Our work documents for the first time that the expression of zzso is modulated by zzso zzso Using two cell types, human zzso cells and smooth muscle cells, we found that zzso treatments with the zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso raised zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression in smooth muscle cells, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher in smooth muscle cells exposed to zzso for 8 zzso compared with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso the finding of alternatively spliced zzso of zzso and zzso documents a novel mechanism to generate diversity within the zzso gene family; zzso the abundant expression of zzso in peripheral blood zzso further supports our previous suggestion of a major role for the beta zzso system in regulating zzso immune zzso zzso the increased expression of zzso by zzso suggests a new mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso
