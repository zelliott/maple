zzso factor H zzso is a member of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of complement zzso zzso These proteins share a common structural zzso the Short Consensus Repeat zzso which is structurally zzso among related genes and between zzso divergent zzso zzso is composed of 20 such zzso and a variety of biological functions have been zzso to specific zzso zzso The majority of individual zzso identified are zzso by single zzso and processes such as gene conversion, zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in the evolution and zzso radiation of zzso zzso We have zzso two zzso sequence entries relating to two overlapping zzso clones zzso at the zzso Centre which contain the entire human zzso gene and two adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the detailed analysis of the assembled 221 zzso of contiguous, zzso zzso sequence from human zzso zzso in part employing the zzso automated zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso zzso were identified and zzso repeat dating established that the zzso occurred after the separation of zzso and zzso zzso The analysis indicates that zzso as well as single and multiple zzso zzso events are likely to have been involved in zzso radiation and RCA gene evolution, facilitated by conservation of zzso and the zzso zzso nature of the zzso zzso
