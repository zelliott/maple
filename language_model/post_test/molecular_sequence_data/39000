Two sets of zzso zzso for the specific amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments of the zzso and zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso of members of the zzso zzso and zzso and of the zzso virus zzso zzso virus zzso were designed on the basis of available zzso These zzso were used for amplifying and subsequent cloning and sequencing part of the open reading frame 1 of the zzso of zzso zzso asteroid zzso virus zzso and of another previously zzso virus, for which the name zzso red globe virus zzso is zzso zzso analysis of the amplified zzso portions showed that the three zzso viruses are zzso related with one another and with zzso zzso and zzso The relationships with zzso was confirmed by the type of zzso modifications induced in the host zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully used for the zzso detection of the three viruses in crude zzso sap zzso zzso virus identification was obtained with zzso using zzso zzso zzso
