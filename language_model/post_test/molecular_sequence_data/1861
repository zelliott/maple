A new member of the zzso zzso zzso channel family has been isolated from mouse zzso complementary zzso The new zzso channel was named zzso as its zzso acid sequence shares zzso identity with that of zzso Mouse zzso is a zzso acid protein and possesses four putative zzso segments and two zzso zzso zzso has a long zzso domain joining the second and third zzso segments and a short zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed abundantly in the zzso and zzso and at low levels in many other zzso including heart, small zzso skeletal muscle, zzso zzso and zzso as judged by Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in mouse and human zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso DNA, a zzso and zzso zzso current was zzso zzso was insensitive to 1 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by 10 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso and acid zzso zzso at 49, 43, and zzso zzso Single channel openings of zzso showed marked open channel zzso In symmetrical 150 zzso zzso the zzso relationship of zzso was slightly inwardly zzso with the single channel zzso 13 zzso zzso at zzso zzso and 16 zzso at zzso zzso In zzso patches, zzso was unaffected by the zzso application of 10 zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso is a functional member of the zzso channel family and contributes to the background zzso zzso in many types of zzso
