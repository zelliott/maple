zzso play an important role in the transmission of zzso diseases of zzso zzso and bacterial zzso The present article describes a zzso based method, which facilitated the zzso analyses of bacterial communities in zzso ticks zzso zzso DNA was extracted both from single ticks and pooled adult zzso zzso zzso zzso gene fragments zzso zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and representing individual bacterial zzso were separated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso bands were zzso cloned and zzso In addition, we set up a zzso zzso clone library which was screened by zzso zzso were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the zzso zzso A number of bacteria were affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to be zzso and transmitted by zzso Two sequences were related to the yet to be cultivated zzso To our knowledge, zzso has never been directly detected in zzso zzso In addition, members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso which have not been identified in ticks so zzso Two bacteria were most closely related to a zzso zzso of an zzso zzso and to an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The results prove that zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso analysis is a promising approach for the detection and identification of bacteria infecting zzso regardless of whether these bacteria are zzso zzso zzso or zzso
