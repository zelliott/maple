DNA replication in zzso is a highly zzso process marked by the licensing of multiple origins, with zzso complex assembly in zzso phase, followed by the onset of replication at these origins in S zzso The two strands replicate by different mechanisms, and DNA synthesis is brought about by the activity of the zzso DNA zzso Pol delta and Pol zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso the zzso of these zzso by serving as a DNA sliding clamp zzso This study reports the cloning of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso agent of the systemic disease visceral zzso zzso was demonstrated to be robustly expressed in actively zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the protein was present primarily in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, and it was found in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, levels of expression of zzso varied through cell cycle zzso with maximum expression evident in zzso and S zzso The zzso pattern of expression of zzso differed in different stages of the cell zzso it formed distinct zzso zzso in S phase, while it was distributed in a more diffuse pattern in zzso phase and zzso phase zzso These zzso zzso are the sites of active DNA zzso suggesting that replication factories exist in zzso as they do in higher zzso thus opening avenues for investigating other zzso proteins that are involved in DNA replication as part of these replication zzso
