The zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso is a key zzso protein involved in the zzso of zzso channels and receptors to the zzso zzso through binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso domain of zzso zzso although zzso has no signature zzso sequence for zzso binding found in zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso peptides revealed a zzso binding site of the zzso domain specific for the 13 zzso motif zzso zzso which is distinct from zzso This zzso forms an zzso alpha zzso for zzso zzso to zzso C of the zzso zzso This zzso causes zzso zzso changes in zzso C and affects binding to zzso zzso zzso while the two binding sites are not zzso Our studies provide structural zzso for versatile zzso linkages between membrane proteins and the zzso
