Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso It is produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cells after induction with zzso or zzso To understand the zzso regulation of the zzso we have analyzed the structure and function of the promoter zzso The sequence of the zzso region was determined and the zzso start site was found to be located at 68 zzso upstream of the zzso translation start zzso zzso zzso were generated and zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and after stimulation with zzso zzso or a zzso The region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso initiation zzso containing putative zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso is important for zzso zzso levels in both cell zzso zzso for 18 h with zzso alone failed to affect expression of any of the zzso both in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In both cell lines zzso increased the activity of all zzso that possessed the region between zzso and zzso In zzso cells, stimulation with the combination of zzso and zzso caused an additional increase in expression of the zzso from zzso zzso Finally, the presence of zzso factors in nuclear extracts of zzso cells and their specificity to bind to various zzso zzso in this zzso zzso region were evidenced by zzso shift zzso These results show that zzso produced by zzso and zzso cells, zzso the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso and thereby can indirectly contribute to recruitment of various zzso cell types to inflammatory zzso
