An automated method of zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso was developed for the rapid zzso of microbial diversity and community composition in freshwater zzso Following isolation of total community DNA, zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso was performed with a zzso forward zzso zzso fragments ranging in size from 400 to 1,200 zzso were next zzso and measured by using an automated zzso zzso Database information on the zzso zzso zzso was also zzso to understand the potential biases in diversity estimates provided by zzso In the analysis of three natural freshwater bacterial communities, zzso was rapid and sensitive and provided highly zzso zzso profiles at all levels of replication zzso The zzso profiles of the freshwater communities were zzso compared in terms of both their relative diversity and similarity zzso The three communities had distinctly different profiles but were similar in their total number of fragments zzso 34 to zzso In addition, the pattern of major amplification products in representative profiles was not significantly altered when the zzso cycle number was reduced from 30 to 15, but the number of minor products (near the limit of zzso was sensitive to changes in cycling zzso Overall, the results suggest that zzso is a rapid and effective community analysis technique that can be used in conjunction with more accurate but zzso methods zzso zzso zzso gene cloning and zzso when zzso spatial and zzso resolution is zzso
