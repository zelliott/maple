zzso the specific genetic characteristics of successfully transmitted zzso may prove central to the development of effective vaccine and zzso zzso Although human zzso virus transmission is associated with a population zzso the extent to which different factors influence the diversity of transmitted viruses is zzso We estimate here the number of transmitted zzso in 69 zzso men and women with primary zzso C zzso From zzso zzso sequences obtained using a single zzso amplification approach we show that zzso of infections involved single zzso transmission and zzso involved multiple zzso transmissions zzso of zzso We found evidence for zzso selected for zzso or zzso escape and a high prevalence of zzso in individuals infected with multiple zzso representing another potential escape zzso in these zzso In a combined analysis of zzso zzso B and C transmission events, we found that infection with more than one zzso does not follow a zzso distribution, indicating that transmission of individual zzso cannot be seen as independent events, each occurring with low zzso While most transmissions resulted from a single infectious unit, multiple zzso transmissions represent a significant fraction of transmission events, suggesting that there may be important zzso differences between these groups that are not yet zzso
