Nerve growth factor zzso precursor cells into sympathetic zzso Does acquisition of a zzso zzso after nerve growth factor involve zzso of zzso A, the major soluble protein in zzso zzso zzso Nerve growth factor activated zzso A gene expression zzso in zzso zzso cells, and similarly activated zzso zzso rat or human zzso A zzso zzso zzso A promoter zzso narrowed the nerve growth factor response element to a region from - 77 to - 61 zzso upstream of the cap site, a region containing the zzso A zzso zzso response element zzso Three different zzso zzso of the zzso zzso response element each reduced the nerve growth factor effect by zzso Transfer of the zzso zzso response element to a zzso zzso zzso promoter activated that promoter approximately zzso after nerve growth factor, while transfer of a zzso zzso response element zzso zzso zzso to a zzso promoter abolished the nerve growth factor zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso response element in zzso is, at least in part, both necessary and sufficient to activate the zzso A zzso Chemical blockade of the nerve growth factor zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso component zzso substantially diminished nerve growth zzso expression of zzso zzso By contrast, the response of zzso A to nerve growth factor was not impaired after blockade of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Chemical blockade of zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso similarly inhibited nerve growth factor zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso A promoter zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso or zzso zzso each inhibited the nerve growth zzso increase in zzso A promoter zzso Thus, each component of the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso involved in relaying the nerve growth factor signal in trans to the zzso A zzso in the following proposed zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso
