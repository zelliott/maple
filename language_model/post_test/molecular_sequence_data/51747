During the course of large scale zzso of the D1 zzso zzso from rat brain, a protein of approximately 87,000 zzso zzso was observed to zzso with the D1 zzso through four zzso zzso To characterize the nature of this zzso bovine and rat zzso clones were isolated and zzso The bovine and rat clones were highly zzso zzso zzso Each clone possessed an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso containing three stretches of zzso sequence obtained from zzso sequence zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence of this protein with those found in available zzso revealed that it was a novel protein related to the family of zzso transport proteins from zzso and bacteria, including, the zzso facilitated zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso bacterial zzso for zzso zzso and zzso In addition zzso also shares with these zzso a similar zzso profile that suggests the presence of 12 zzso zzso The zzso for zzso appears to be localized primarily, if not exclusively, to the central nervous zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals a message of approximately zzso zzso in cortex, zzso brain zzso and zzso but no zzso signal in peripheral zzso such as zzso liver, zzso zzso heart, or skeletal zzso Evidence form Western zzso analysis and zzso suggests that this protein may be expressed in zzso zzso or the membrane of zzso rather than plasma zzso Based on its structure and properties, zzso appears to define a new class of zzso zzso
