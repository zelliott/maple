New data on the structure of zzso inhibitor have become available as the result of the completion of its zzso acid and zzso acid sequences and its zzso content, together with data from zzso zzso crystal structure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso inhibitor is a zzso zzso It is constructed as a heavily zzso zzso domain with 113 zzso acids and 3 zzso and 7 zzso zzso and a zzso domain with 365 zzso acids and 3 zzso zzso Its molecular weights is calculated as zzso rather than the apparent value of 105,000 commonly reported from zzso zzso scattering shows that zzso inhibitor possesses a distinct two domain structure in which an extended zzso domain with extended zzso structures is attached to the zzso zzso zzso The length of zzso inhibitor is 18 zzso rather than that of 33 zzso originally proposed from electron zzso zzso supports the concept of two zzso zzso in the zzso inhibitor zzso Combination of the zzso inhibitor sequence with crystal structure zzso of proteins belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso shows that the protein structure of the zzso domain is zzso in terms of this zzso zzso of the zzso structure of zzso inhibitor with its presumed protein crystal structure shows that the 7 zzso are distributed throughout the zzso fold with no obvious segregation into structural zzso Native zzso inhibitor is zzso at its zzso zzso loop to release a more stable zzso form that is no longer zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that structures involved in zzso interactions within the core of the zzso fold are preserved to within zzso zzso before and after the zzso zzso transform infrared zzso shows the presence of zzso and zzso in both zzso Large changes are zzso in both the zzso and zzso contents of the zzso fold, and these changes are matched by a greater rate of zzso exchange in zzso zzso in the native form than in the zzso zzso These data show that changes in the whole secondary structure and not just in the zzso site loop are involved in zzso zzso
