zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso families of this class of zzso are involved in protein folding in zzso whereas their significance in free living organisms is not zzso Previously, we inspected the smallest known zzso of a zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso is devoid of all known zzso except the trigger zzso Despite the extensive sequence information becoming available, most genes remain hypothetical and zzso activities in many species have not been assigned to an open reading zzso zzso we studied the zzso activity in crude extracts of zzso zzso We showed that this is solely attributed to a single zzso activity, the trigger zzso zzso of this zzso revealed that its zzso activity resides in a central zzso zzso Only the complete trigger factor is able to zzso zzso extended zzso zzso while the zzso domain alone can zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso of the trigger factor seem to function in binding of proteins as zzso as demonstrated by protein zzso experiments, in which the complete trigger factor zzso protein zzso towards a model protein zzso more efficiently than the isolated central zzso zzso zzso modeling studies suggest that the zzso domain can fold in a similar way as the zzso domain of zzso binding proteins zzso one class of zzso despite only very limited sequence zzso zzso at the active site explain why this zzso is not inhibited by zzso in contrast with zzso zzso factor expressed in zzso coli confirms its additional zzso functions, as shown by its association with zzso zzso and zzso after induction of zzso In contrast, the isolated zzso lacks any association with zzso from zzso zzso In zzso trigger factor of zzso zzso is the single folding zzso of this zzso which harbors an zzso active zzso domain with structural zzso to zzso Its additional zzso zzso its ability to be an efficient catalyst of protein zzso The protein folding machinery is zzso and shows a dual function as a zzso and a zzso zzso
