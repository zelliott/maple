zzso receptors zzso form a major group of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system that sense molecular patterns on zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling domain is instrumental in inducing a signaling cascade upon recognition of specific zzso by zzso Because nonhuman primates are used as models of infectious and immune zzso we sought to obtain an increased understanding of nonhuman zzso zzso We obtained the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined their genetic relationships to zzso from humans and zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed zzso changes mostly outside the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso Assessment of zzso biases among zzso from multiple species revealed a strong overall bias towards synonymous zzso with a few short regions showing evidence for positive selection outside the Box zzso This first presentation of the zzso domain sequences from nonhuman primates indicates that although there are zzso differences, a high level of sequence zzso exists in the critical signaling Box regions of macaque, human, and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that animal models, including nonhuman zzso will be useful in modeling human zzso zzso and zzso
