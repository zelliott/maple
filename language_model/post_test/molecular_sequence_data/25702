We describe the isolation of spinach zzso zzso protein zzso and characterization of a zzso clone zzso its zzso zzso This protein was only recently identified in zzso but the sequences of four zzso genes have now been reported and confirm its presence in zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso sequence data, zzso were designed and a zzso library was zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso clones shows that the spinach zzso protein is zzso as a precursor of 159 zzso zzso a mature protein of 73 zzso and a transit zzso of 86 zzso The zzso site for forming the mature protein is deduced to be zzso decreases zzso The zzso protein in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso DNA zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding gene has not been found in the zzso DNA of a lower plant zzso and two higher zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso protein in a higher plant zzso is zzso in the zzso This finding, in light of the zzso hypothesis, suggests an zzso to nucleus transfer of the zzso gene at the evolutionary beginnings of land zzso
