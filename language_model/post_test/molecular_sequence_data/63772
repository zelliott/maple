Two novel elements zzso and zzso of zzso lineage of zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and Japanese zzso zzso zzso The total length of the zzso element is zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso of both zzso and zzso elements are composed of zzso zzso and do not have any zzso Their closest relative is zzso element from the zzso fish zzso zzso On average, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains approximately 84 copies of zzso zzso We zzso the major features of zzso zzso and other elements of zzso lineage of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso element in larvae increases gradually before the zzso stage and decreases gradually afterward, whereas in zzso such expression in zzso muscle and zzso zzso are lower than those in other zzso Overall, zzso expression of zzso element in the early larvae is significantly higher than that in adult zzso In muscle zzso while the promoter and partial zzso domain of zzso element are zzso the partial zzso domain is highly zzso These results suggest that zzso expression may be controlled by a zzso gene zzso mechanism that is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso
