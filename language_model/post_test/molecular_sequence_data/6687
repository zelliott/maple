A G zzso zzso for the zzso hormone zzso was recently cloned from zzso and designated the zzso zzso zzso We now report the cloning of a second G zzso zzso zzso from humans and designate it the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 362 zzso acids that is zzso identical at the zzso acid level to the human zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso cells results in zzso zzso binding zzso zzso 160 zzso 30 zzso In addition, the rank order of zzso of specific zzso binding by eight zzso is similar to that exhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso indicate that it is coupled to zzso of zzso zzso Comparative reverse zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso cell hybrids maps the zzso zzso gene zzso to human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso may mediate the reported actions of zzso in zzso and participate in some of the zzso effects of zzso in zzso
