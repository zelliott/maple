To identify new zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso we screened a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso lines for zzso zzso in seed zzso zzso One of the identified zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso a concentration that completely zzso zzso seed zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that the zzso exhibits a dominant zzso and that the zzso zzso was linked to a single zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso The inserted zzso zzso to a full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso type zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso transcript is indeed zzso in the zzso (named zzso Two independent zzso zzso zzso lines, zzso and zzso were recovered from the zzso Biological Resource Center and shown to lack full-length zzso zzso A detailed characterization of zzso and the zzso disruption zzso demonstrated that, whereas zzso expression of a zzso fusion caused zzso zzso in seed zzso and zzso zzso closure responses, disruption zzso displayed the opposite zzso zzso strong zzso zzso Thus our data demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso is a strong negative regulator of zzso signal zzso Furthermore, it has been previously shown that the zzso transcript is zzso in the zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We show here that zzso of zzso in zzso is not due to impaired zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, expression of a zzso zzso fusion in zzso partially suppresses zzso zzso and the data further suggest that additional mechanisms contribute to zzso hypersensitivity of zzso
