zzso about the expression sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial for a better understanding of the zzso function of zzso We investigated the cellular zzso of zzso zzso in chemically zzso fish by use of an in zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso Sections (5 zzso were treated with zzso Following reverse zzso of zzso zzso the zzso was amplified in zzso by zzso with specific zzso zzso of the zzso was accomplished by a second zzso performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso of zzso cells surrounding zzso cartilage in zzso zzso This result was consistent with that of zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also was found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso but no zzso was detected in those cells by zzso zzso The results indicate that IS zzso is an zzso technique for zzso low level zzso zzso In addition, the sites where we identified expression of zzso are targets of zzso acid, sonic zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that functional zzso in zzso could participate in zzso skeletal development through involvement in the zzso acid signaling zzso
