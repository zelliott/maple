zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with tobacco mosaic virus zzso results in a hypersensitive plant response and leads to systemic acquired resistance zzso The induction of zzso is zzso by the plant hormone salicylic acid zzso and is accompanied by the induced expression of a number of genes including the zzso zzso gene zzso Previously, it has been found that zzso infection and zzso treatment resulted in a reduction of binding of nuclear protein zzso to zzso regions zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso To test if zzso is a negative regulator of zzso gene zzso the effects of zzso in the seven putative zzso binding sites in this region were studied in zzso using zzso zzso interference zzso and band shift zzso This showed that at least one of the seven sites is indeed a zzso binding zzso However, when tested in transgenic plants, the zzso did not result in zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso while zzso expression after zzso treatment was zzso The results suggest that binding of zzso proteins to zzso zzso promoter regions indeed influences gene zzso A possible model for zzso mode of action in zzso gene expression is zzso
