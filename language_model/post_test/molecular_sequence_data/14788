The study of three island groups of the palm tribe zzso zzso permits both the analysis of each independent radiation and comparisons across the tribe to address general processes that drive island zzso zzso relationships of zzso were zzso from three zzso and three zzso nuclear zzso The zzso zzso position of zzso in zzso was hypothesized to be caused by a gene zzso event and was addressed using zzso zzso The resulting zzso trees were zzso and the zzso were all highly supported except for zzso and zzso zzso time analysis estimated the stem of the tribe to be approximately 86 Ma and the crown to be 38 zzso indicating that significant extinction may have occurred along this zzso Historical zzso analysis suggested that zzso are of southern North American, Central American, or Caribbean origin and supports previous hypotheses of a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso within the tribe were interpreted with respect to divergence times, the fossil record, and geological factors such as the formation of the Greater zzso Ridge, the zzso and the North Atlantic land bridges, zzso movement in Southeast Asia, zzso shifts between the zzso and zzso and zzso in the Pacific zzso In considering the three major island zzso within zzso zzso zzso appears to have been the driving force in zzso zzso and is highlighted here as an emerging pattern across the tree of zzso
