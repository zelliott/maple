We have used a zzso zzso interaction zzso to identify zzso a novel zzso containing protein that interacts directly with the putative zzso zzso protein zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso show extensive zzso throughout the cell zzso During zzso zzso is localized on zzso to zzso zzso regions in a pattern that zzso that of zzso However, during zzso both zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso and align together in a zzso zzso zzso construct analysis in zzso cells showed that the zzso half of zzso without the zzso was sufficient for both nuclear as well as zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in the zzso locus shows that zzso is an essential zzso Furthermore, zzso depletion of zzso in zzso cells leads to abnormal zzso zzso zzso and to zzso segregation zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a nuclear protein that plays a role in proper zzso dynamics during zzso
