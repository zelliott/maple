zzso light chains of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso When analyzed by zzso focusing analysis, light chains of the tiger shark zzso zzso the zzso shark zzso zzso and the zzso shark zzso zzso showed a zzso but zzso spectrum of bands ranging from zzso zzso to zzso in which discrete families were zzso zzso light chains of the zzso shark zzso with rabbit zzso against mouse zzso and a synthetic zzso corresponding to the J segment of T cell zzso beta zzso The latter zzso is shared among light chains and T cell zzso Although there was considerable zzso in zzso focusing analysis, the light chains were homogeneous on the basis of apparent mass zzso zzso and those of tiger shark and zzso shark had relatively homogeneous dominant zzso sequences representing the first zzso The zzso sequences of these two shark light zzso were strongly zzso to one another and showed zzso identity to certain V zzso sequences of man and zzso zzso was also shown to V zzso zzso but the degree of identity was approximately zzso Following zzso of the tiger shark light chain with zzso acid which zzso at zzso zzso a constant region zzso was isolated by gel zzso It was possible to identify the zzso of this zzso within the constant regions of zzso zzso and zzso chain, but the relationship to C zzso chain was zzso The degree of identity among the corresponding C region peptides of zzso avian and zzso species was much less than that observed for the framework 1 sequence of the light chain variable zzso These data support the concept that variable and J region sequence have been zzso in the evolution of zzso zzso but that constant regions show much greater zzso zzso
