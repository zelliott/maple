The molecular nature of zzso zzso was examined in this study to more thoroughly understand lead zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso lead zzso for 24 zzso The median lethal dose zzso value was zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frequency increased zzso as lead zzso were raised from zzso to zzso zzso We also amplified the zzso zzso of 56 independent zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully zzso 36 zzso had transcripts of normal or slightly smaller than normal size, and six zzso had large zzso The other 14 zzso whose zzso zzso could not be amplified were subjected to zzso zzso zzso All of those zzso had one or more zzso missing from their zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso zzso showed that 22 had zzso zzso four had small zzso 10 had zzso zzso and six were missing two or three zzso Furthermore, DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso boundaries in eight zzso zzso revealed that all of them had zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso base zzso occurred zzso more frequently than zzso base zzso Similar zzso were observed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso base pairs may be the primary target sites for lead zzso
