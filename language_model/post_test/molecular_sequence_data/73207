zzso zzso zzso isolated in zzso Turkey, was highly resistant to zzso zzso 128 zzso and produced a zzso that gave a zzso of bands at zzso zzso and zzso zzso production was zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso and was determined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso coli transformed with the cloned gene showed increased resistance to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso Resistance was not reversed by zzso acid or zzso zzso revealed that the zzso responsible for this resistance was identical to zzso except that zzso replaced zzso at position zzso Compared to zzso the new zzso named zzso had greater zzso activity, with increased relative zzso rates for zzso and zzso and, most dramatically, for zzso zzso and zzso remained stable to zzso Thus, as in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso families, a minor sequence change in zzso gave a major extension of zzso activity and contingent zzso The gene zzso the new zzso zzso lay close to the highly zzso 3' end of an zzso and had zzso sequences typical of an zzso gene zzso zzso mapping and partial sequence data indicated that zzso carries an zzso with three putative gene zzso zzso itself, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso
