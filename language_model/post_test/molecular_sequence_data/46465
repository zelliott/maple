Of the 20 zzso coded zzso acid zzso zzso is the most frequently zzso zzso which has important functional and regulatory zzso Here we report the identification and zzso of a previously zzso form of protein zzso modification zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was initially identified by mass zzso and protein sequence zzso The identified zzso peptides derived from in zzso proteins were verified by western zzso analysis, in zzso labeling with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of their synthetic zzso We further show that zzso zzso is zzso zzso and that this zzso responds to different zzso zzso Our study also implies that zzso might be a zzso for zzso zzso Given the apparent high abundance of zzso zzso and the significant structural changes induced by this zzso it is expected that zzso zzso has important cellular zzso
