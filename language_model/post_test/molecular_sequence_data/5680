The establishment and operation of the nervous system requires genetic regulation by a network of zzso zzso among which is the zinc finger zzso of zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized a member of the unusual zzso (also referred to as zzso zzso or zzso class of zinc finger proteins in the developing nervous zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to the original representative of this class, zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso and Hudson, zzso The zzso gene maps to human zzso 20, while zzso maps to a region of human zzso zzso Both zinc finger proteins are found in zzso at early stages of zzso with zzso zone cells displaying intense zzso for zzso Unlike zzso zzso has not been detected in the zzso zzso zzso that express zzso also express zzso which marks zzso around the period of terminal zzso The zzso protein resides in distinct zzso within the zzso nucleus, analogous to the discrete pattern previously noted for zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression and zzso of these two zzso zzso proteins suggests that each may play a role in the development of zzso and zzso in the zzso central nervous zzso
