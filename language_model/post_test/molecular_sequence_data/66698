The zzso zzso hypothesis proposes that the existence of a fusion protein in some organisms predicts that the separate zzso function in the same zzso zzso in other organisms and may physically zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein is composed of two zzso a fragile zzso zzso zzso and a bacterial and plant zzso zzso We assessed the biological effects of zzso zzso expression in comparison with zzso and observed that: 1) zzso expression was observed in most normal zzso and overlapped partially with zzso zzso 2) zzso mouse kidney cells exhibited accelerated zzso resistance to DNA damage stress, and increased zzso D1 zzso 3) zzso D1 was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4) zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso and 5) zzso zzso zzso led to increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the biological effects of zzso expression are similar to zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso in zzso and zzso cells, respectively, suggesting that zzso interaction is not essential for function of either zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso share tumor zzso signaling zzso while zzso of the zzso gene at a stable, rather than zzso zzso site explains the paucity of gene zzso and in frequent loss of expression of the zzso gene in human zzso
