With zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso genes of different sources, a part of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified and used as zzso probe for the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso it contains the open reading frame of the zzso The zzso zzso (named zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with a zzso of zzso it has ten putative zzso zzso and contains the zzso regions a to zzso common to all zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence shows less than zzso identity to zzso zzso but about zzso identity to zzso zzso An alignment to rat kidney and zzso zzso protein sequences shows zzso in stalk regions and zzso zzso zzso which are thought to be involved in calcium binding and zzso these three zzso reveal very similar zzso plots and form a separate group in the zzso tree of zzso zzso The results strongly support the assumption that zzso of zzso is a calcium zzso zzso possibly involved in regulatory processes with calcium as second zzso
