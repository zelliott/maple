A number of methods can be used to improve the stability of the protein zzso environment, including growth in zzso without an zzso phase boundary, growth in gels and growth under oil zzso In this study, X-ray data has been collected from and structures refined for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso grown using four different methods, zzso dialysis on Earth and in zzso using the European Space Agency's zzso Advanced zzso zzso Facility zzso on board the NASA Space zzso Life and zzso zzso zzso mission zzso zzso in zzso gel using a tube zzso diffusion method and zzso in zzso under zzso A comparison of the overall quality of the X-ray data, the protein structures and especially the zzso structures has been carried out at zzso zzso The zzso protein structures corresponding to these four different zzso methods remain zzso A small improvement in the zzso structure is seen in zzso zzso grown in zzso by zzso dialysis, which has a more stable fluid physics state in zzso and is consistent with a better formed protein crystal in zzso
