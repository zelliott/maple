zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the former, but not the latter, zzso to mesh zzso zzso made from salt zzso zzso solutions showed enhanced zzso Computer zzso using molecular mechanics and zzso was applied to secondary structures zzso zzso derived from zzso studies, to determine geometric and energetic constraints on duplex and zzso zzso The calculations suggested that zzso zzso and zzso zzso could form duplexes, while zzso could not, thus bridging the gap between atomic dimensions zzso and high zzso scale zzso zzso zzso suggested that water structure helped to zzso the twofold zzso It is proposed that the twofold zzso flat, zzso molecules zzso via zzso bonding between the very extensive zzso patches (9 zzso zzso repeated on alternating sides of the zzso The negative charge of the zzso opposes zzso zzso zzso showed that duplexes were formed with decreasing stability as the charge density increased, and as the charge was concentrated towards the zzso line of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso could form duplexes and higher zzso as readily as zzso zzso was calculated to form stable zzso with zzso and zzso The frequency and positioning of the zzso group within the zzso thus determines whether the zzso zzso in duplex zzso
