Although zzso have been generally grouped with the most primitive zzso species, the origin and zzso relationships of zzso have remained unresolved to zzso To confirm the zzso position of zzso in zzso we have cloned and determined the zzso sequences zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso snake zzso and African clawed zzso zzso four zzso zzso sequences from turtle, zzso zzso and snake were also cloned and zzso All of these eight zzso zzso as well as the previously published zzso zzso and zzso of zzso birds, zzso and African clawed frog, were analyzed by the zzso tree reconstruction methods of zzso maximum zzso and maximum zzso In the zzso zzso the turtle was found to be closely related to the zzso Also, we found that the turtle had zzso after the divergence of zzso and zzso This departs from previous hypotheses of turtle evolution and further suggests that zzso are the latest of divergent zzso having been derived from an zzso of zzso lineage within the last 200 million zzso
