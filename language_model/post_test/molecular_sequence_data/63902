The zzso zzso zzso mediates active zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells and is important for the diagnosis and zzso treatment of zzso zzso In order to better investigate the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we cloned the zzso zzso zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso gene in this zzso The cloned zzso region of zzso shares zzso identity with that of rat zzso zzso yet has little similarity to that of human zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso to zzso the putative zzso zzso start site is mapped to zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso The minimal promoter of zzso is located within 650 zzso of the zzso region as determined by the transient expression analysis of zzso zzso The zzso upstream zzso zzso was identified based on sequence zzso to zzso The zzso is localized to the region between zzso and zzso zzso relative to the zzso site and shares zzso identity with rat zzso zzso while only zzso identity with human zzso zzso It contains two zzso binding sites and a zzso binding zzso The zzso is also demonstrated to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The high degree of zzso in the zzso region between zzso and zzso suggests that zzso and zzso share similar mechanisms for zzso zzso
