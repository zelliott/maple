The present investigation examined the zzso and zzso expression and activity of zzso zzso in anterior and zzso zzso of a South American, true freshwater zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso the anterior zzso of this zzso zzso exhibit a highly attenuated zzso zzso symmetrical zzso on both zzso zzso In sharp contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso are markedly zzso Their zzso side consists of thick zzso zzso cells, displaying features typical of a transporting zzso while the zzso zzso is thin zzso zzso and formed entirely by zzso pillar cell zzso Both anterior and zzso zzso express zzso and zzso zzso analysis of partial zzso sequences for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso among various crab species confirmed the previous zzso and grouping of zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly showed that zzso for both zzso pump zzso is more intensely expressed in zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso was nearly fourfold that of anterior zzso while zzso and zzso activities did not zzso A negative zzso current zzso was measured using the zzso side of split, zzso zzso zzso mounted in a modified zzso chamber and zzso zzso with identical zzso zzso Although zzso zzso did not affect this zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso without altering preparation zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso as known to occur in zzso zzso adapted to zzso These findings suggest that active zzso zzso zzso across the thick zzso zzso and zzso zzso across the thin, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
