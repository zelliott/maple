zzso membrane zzso is a member of the family receptors named zzso that recognize zzso sequences in their zzso zzso interacts with at least three different adhesive zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso These interactions are inhibited by zzso peptides and by peptides corresponding to a sequence unique to zzso in the zzso domain of its gamma chain zzso Two zzso sequences are present in zzso A alpha zzso an zzso sequence at A alpha zzso and an zzso sequence at A alpha zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso sequence and the gamma zzso domain both reacted specifically with zzso in solid phase zzso zzso zzso and zzso the protein in zzso The zzso fragments prepared from these zzso inhibited zzso interaction and zzso These results demonstrate that these two sequences are both accessible within the zzso zzso and are both implicated in zzso binding and zzso zzso In addition, by further examining the interaction of the gamma chain zzso with zzso it was found that zzso and the gamma zzso produced a similar zzso zzso of the binding of the labeled gamma zzso to zzso zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso sequence present at the A alpha zzso constitutes with the gamma zzso sequence two recognition sites interacting with the same site or with mutually exclusive sites on zzso
