The zzso zzso open reading frame zzso has been zzso in the course of the zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso of zzso causes a respiratory deficient zzso accompanied by a loss of zzso zzso This zzso is usually found in zzso defective in zzso replication or gene zzso zzso has the potential to zzso a soluble protein of zzso zzso zzso It shows significant similarities to the zzso protein zzso from various bacteria and to a previously determined zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The predicted zzso sequence of zzso starts with a stretch which has neither any correspondence in the bacterial sequences nor in the protein isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, this stretch matches the requirements for a signal sequence for zzso protein zzso A zzso location of the zzso gene product was proven by use of a zzso terminally zzso zzso These findings clearly indicate that zzso encodes this zzso zzso protein zzso
