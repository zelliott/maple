In order to zzso the zzso relationships of zzso containing zzso in the rat zzso we have used a combined method with in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso complementary for rat zzso zzso and zzso using zzso for zzso zzso We found double labeled zzso cells in the zzso and zzso zzso of the inner nuclear layer as well as the displaced zzso cells in the zzso cell layer in the zzso Some cells in the inner nuclear layer had high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fibers were observed adjacent to the zzso cells with high level of zzso zzso These data suggest the site of synthesis of zzso and zzso migration of this zzso within the rat retinal zzso
