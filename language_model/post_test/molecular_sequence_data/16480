Using zzso polarization zzso zzso we measured the zzso constant of various DNA zzso in different sequences and calculated the value for each of the 136 unique zzso From these values, we obtained a zzso zzso for every zzso DNA zzso We tested the code in the analysis of DNA sequences able to form zzso More than 50% of the sequences studied showed a common 20 and/or 30 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Many other profiles of rigidity were observed in the remaining sequences and this variety in zzso constant zzso may be related to functional differences between zzso
