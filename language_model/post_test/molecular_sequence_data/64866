To compare the expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso genes in matched human gastric zzso and adjacent zzso zzso of patients with gastric cancer, inflammatory gastric zzso from patients with zzso normal zzso from 2 zzso patients and a gastric zzso cell line zzso and to explore their relationship with progression to zzso of human gastric zzso 

zzso and sequencing were employed to detect the zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso gene in specimens from 30 patients with gastric zzso and healthy bordering zzso zzso 10 zzso patients and normal zzso from 2 zzso patients as well as zzso The results were zzso by zzso it to the zzso level of zzso gene using Lab Image zzso The sequences were analyzed by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all of human gastric zzso in this study, including normal, inflammatory and zzso zzso and zzso However, the expression levels of zzso zzso in normal gastric zzso were higher than those in other groups zzso and its expressions did not correlate with the differentiation and zzso of gastric cancer zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was detected in zzso and in specimens obtained from gastric cancer patients zzso but not in other gastric zzso and its expression was highly correlated with the zzso of gastric cancer zzso 

Human gastric zzso and gastric cancer cell line zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso may possibly play an important role in the progression of gastric zzso
