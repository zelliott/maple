zzso are zzso peptides distinguished by the presence of the rare zzso zzso acids zzso and/or zzso They are produced by zzso bacteria as zzso precursor peptides and undergo zzso modification to generate the mature zzso The structural gene for the zzso and the genes involved in zzso processing, export as well as regulation and producer strain zzso are organized in zzso Based on their structural and functional features zzso are currently divided into two major zzso The flexible zzso zzso zzso act primarily by pore formation in the bacterial zzso a mechanism which was recently zzso zzso for zzso and zzso to involve the interaction with specific zzso molecules such as the membrane precursor zzso zzso The rather rigid and zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso functions through interaction with the respective zzso zzso and zzso inhibit the cell wall zzso by zzso zzso II, whereas the zzso peptides inhibit zzso by binding zzso zzso have attracted much attention in recent years and undergone extensive zzso New insights into the mode of action and zzso relationships as well as the zzso and the zzso will be outlined in this zzso
