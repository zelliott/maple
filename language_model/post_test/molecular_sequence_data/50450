We have zzso and zzso two zzso fragments of zzso that contain the three zzso zzso necessary for specific zzso DNA zzso These peptides assume a stable, folded zzso in solution in the presence of zzso as shown by DNA binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso peptides recognize a number of different zzso DNA binding sites zzso boxes, with the core sequence zzso The zzso constant for a zzso acid zzso binding to the zzso sequence zzso approximately 10 zzso and the relative affinities for several other DNA sequences definitively demonstrate zzso binding zzso The zzso binding site for zzso has been mapped using the zzso zzso revealing that the zzso portion of the zzso box DNA sequence zzso zzso contributes more strongly to the total binding energy than the 3' portion zzso These findings are interpreted in the context of the zzso zzso acid sequence in comparison with the structurally characterized zzso zzso A model is proposed that offers a structural explanation for the ability of zzso to recognize a diverse array of DNA sequences in terms of the individual (and zzso DNA binding properties of each of the three zzso zzso
