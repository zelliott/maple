We have previously reported on a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which expresses enhanced zzso zzso activity and does not zzso zzso or zzso for growth zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the process of characterizing the genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence element zzso is capable of zzso within zzso zzso We have also determined that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso K zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso had inserted 60 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso IS element zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso exhibited two additional copies of zzso compared to the parental strain zzso zzso of the first additional zzso element, zzso indicated that it has inserted into the putative promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of total zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated no zzso zzso zzso likewise, zzso zzso zzso was devoid of zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso activity exhibited by zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to correlate with an increase in the zzso and zzso zzso The second additional zzso element, zzso was found to have inserted upstream of a newly identified zzso zzso which exhibits zzso to a number of zzso genes involved in zzso and iron zzso Analysis of total zzso from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso had not produced a polar effect on zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is proposed to result from the zzso of zzso which has recently been demonstrated to function in zzso zzso Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that the introduction of zzso into the zzso zzso zzso has resulted in two previously zzso phenomena in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso sequence element zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and translation as a result of zzso zzso
