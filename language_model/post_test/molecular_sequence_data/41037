zzso tools have revolutionized the exploration of zzso especially in organisms for which traditional zzso is difficult, such as for microscopic animals zzso Environmental zzso zzso surveys of DNA extracted from zzso samples are increasingly popular for surveying zzso Most zzso surveys use the nuclear zzso zzso zzso gene zzso as a zzso however, different markers and metrics used for zzso species have not yet been evaluated against each other or against zzso defined species zzso We assessed more than 12,000 zzso sequences of zzso and of the main alternatively used marker zzso c zzso zzso I zzso zzso belonging to 55 zzso covering three zzso zzso Our results show that zzso reduced diversity estimates by a factor of zzso relative to zzso whereas zzso increased diversity estimates by a factor of zzso Moreover, estimates of species richness using zzso were robust among three of four commonly used zzso zzso whereas estimates using zzso varied widely with the different zzso We show that zzso diversity has been greatly underestimated by zzso zzso surveys and that the use of zzso provides a better estimate of zzso The suitability of zzso is supported by zzso experiments in the literature and evolutionary analyses of zzso in patterns of genetic zzso zzso its splitting of zzso is expected from documented levels of cryptic zzso in zzso zzso We recommend against using zzso as a marker for zzso surveys and suggest that use of zzso for zzso surveys could provide more accurate estimates of species richness in the zzso
