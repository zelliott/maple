zzso zzso strains can be divided into at least three zzso zzso B, zzso based on sequence divergence at the left end of viral unique sequence zzso zzso of zzso A and C are highly zzso and readily transform zzso zzso in zzso to zzso independent growth, while zzso B strains do zzso A left terminal reading frame of a zzso zzso zzso A strain was shown previously to correlate with the zzso zzso and in zzso transforming zzso the deduced zzso was termed zzso Furthermore, this same region contains an open reading frame zzso for zzso zzso zzso and genes for five zzso U zzso zzso We now show by sequence analysis of the corresponding region in a zzso C strain that zzso and zzso genes are present in both virus zzso however, no sequence zzso to the zzso reading frame was found in this zzso C zzso At a position and orientation similar to zzso two zzso were found for peptides sharing a putative zzso zzso One of them encodes a zzso with zzso zzso In addition to the lack of similarity to zzso these two reading frames also did not show any similarity to known zzso The organization of sequences at the left junction of unique zzso and repetitive zzso of zzso zzso suggests frequent zzso events, possibly accelerating the zzso of foreign genes by the zzso
