We have identified a novel 280 zzso acid protein which contains a putative zzso site at its zzso followed by an zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso domain at its zzso It has been termed dual zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed and exhibits zzso interactions with zzso and zzso but not with other zzso zzso These observations predict that zzso will interact with both zzso zzso proteins and zzso and may therefore play a role in regulating the location and/or activity of such zzso in response to zzso that elevate zzso and zzso
