The sequences of the zzso zzso gene of 40 strains of bacterial zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and seven bacterial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which were isolated from different geographical areas, as well as the type strain of zzso zzso were determined and compared to each other and to the sequences of several reference strains of members of the zzso The data confirmed the separate status of the two zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso clustered with the type strain of zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso grouped with zzso zzso zzso zzso clustered with the other zzso zzso zzso analysis of 15 almost complete zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences of the zzso zzso indicated that there were several zzso The properties correlated with these zzso are not yet apparent, although there may be some geographical and ecological zzso For example, among the zzso bacteria, the members of zzso I and III are from zzso and zzso North America, respectively, while the members of zzso II and IV are primarily from Europe and Australia, zzso The zzso strains of zzso zzso form a highly zzso zzso by zzso The results of zzso zzso studies performed with a few selected strains of five of the zzso zzso zzso support the existence of several zzso within zzso zzso
