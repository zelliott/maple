zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is implicated in signaling downstream of the T cell zzso Its zzso zzso half contains several zzso zzso which have been shown to interact with different zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso One of these, zzso was also shown to bind zzso in mouse T cells in zzso The region of zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso domain has been mapped and shows only very limited similarity to a recently identified high affinity binding motif in zzso another zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the binding of the zzso motif to zzso zzso has now been characterized in molecular zzso The results indicate that although charge interactions through an zzso motif are essential for complex formation, a zzso motif in zzso strongly zzso zzso This unexpected binding mode therefore differs considerably from the previously described interaction of zzso zzso with zzso The crystal structure of the complex highlights the great versatility of zzso zzso which allows interactions with very different zzso This currently limits our ability to categorize zzso binding properties by simple zzso
