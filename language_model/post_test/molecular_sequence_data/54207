Members of the zzso have zzso DNA zzso that replicate in zzso of infected plant zzso All zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso that zzso initiation of zzso zzso Earlier studies showed that three zzso zzso I, II, and zzso the N zzso of zzso zzso proteins are essential for zzso In this study, we identified a fourth zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso N zzso that displays high zzso acid sequence conservation across all zzso zzso Using the zzso protein of Tomato golden mosaic virus zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso are not infectious in plants and do not support viral zzso replication in tobacco zzso zzso zzso are competent for zzso interactions and for both double- and zzso DNA zzso indicating that the zzso did not impair its global zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are unable to specifically cleave zzso DNA, which is required to initiate zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso proteins of zzso and zzso plasmids also contain zzso zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso N zzso suggested that zzso zzso alter the relative positioning of motif II, which coordinates metal zzso and motif III, which contains the zzso involved in DNA zzso Together, these results established that the zzso is a zzso essential motif characteristic of an ancient lineage of zzso initiators and support the idea that zzso may have evolved from plasmids associated with zzso or zzso
