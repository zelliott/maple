zzso inclusion body zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso formation and zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso are cleared by zzso When zzso is blocked zzso zzso resulting in abnormal zzso zzso zzso This study investigated the zzso zzso contribution to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was studied in muscle biopsy specimens obtained from zzso patients, one suspected zzso zzso patient, nine patients with other inflammatory zzso and nine zzso patients as zzso The analysis employed zzso methods applied to zzso using the zzso marker zzso essential proteins of the zzso cascade such as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein light chain zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso 1, the major zzso regulator of both the initiation phase and late zzso fusion of the zzso zzso 

In muscle zzso of zzso patients, an increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 was zzso Moreover, the inflammatory components of the disease, essentially zzso were zzso distributed around the zzso zzso zzso These affected zzso also showed a moderate zzso zzso of zzso zzso paired zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso markers linked to the decreased clearance of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso may exhaust cellular resources and lead to cell zzso
