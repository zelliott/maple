zzso zzso cleave zzso zzso molecules in a zzso zzso zzso zzso can be developed and introduced into tissue culture cells to regulate gene expression and to inhibit viral zzso We have previously reported on the construction of cell lines that zzso express a single zzso zzso embedded in a lengthy zzso zzso These cells exhibited a marked reduction in their ability to support viral zzso Here we report the construction of zzso molecules that contain one or two zzso zzso each specific for a different zzso site on the zzso of the target virus, zzso zzso virus zzso and each contained in a zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso designed to release the zzso molecules from the zzso In zzso studies showed that both zzso zzso were released properly from the zzso following zzso by the zzso zzso and that these released zzso functioned as expected in zzso the target virus zzso These zzso zzso have been clones into a zzso zzso downstream of, but in the same transcript as, the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, we hoped to employ zzso as a surrogate marker of zzso zzso zzso transformed cell lines were zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was incomplete, as assessed by Northern zzso analysis and by the ability of transformed cells to produce infectious zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso sequences exerted effects in tissue zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells were zzso and infectious virus yields were decreased by up to zzso compared with normal cells and with cells expressing zzso zzso The zzso effects correlated with zzso levels, but there was no significant difference between cell lines expressing a single zzso and those expressing zzso
