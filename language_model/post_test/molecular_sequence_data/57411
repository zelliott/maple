Nuclear zzso must be precisely processed to give rise to mature zzso zzso This maturation process, known as zzso involves zzso of zzso sequences and zzso of the zzso zzso One of the major problems in understanding this process is how zzso sites, the sequences which form the boundaries between zzso and zzso can be accurately zzso A number of studies have defined zzso sequences within zzso which were later shown to interact with small nuclear zzso zzso However, due to the simplicity of these zzso sequences it has become clear that other elements must be involved and a number of studies have indicated the importance of secondary structures within zzso Using various examples, we shall show that such structures can help to specify zzso sites by zzso physical distances within zzso or by being involved in the definition of zzso and zzso that they can be part of the regulation of alternative zzso
