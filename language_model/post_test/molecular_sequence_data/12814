zzso processing zzso zzso consists of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso has a putative zzso sequence zzso To determine whether the sequence of zzso is essential for the zzso activity, we individually zzso the zzso and zzso acid to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso in zzso zzso All three zzso had completely lost the activity, whereas the lost activity was recovered on the addition of zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was reduced by the zzso zzso We conclude from these observations that the zzso region is involved in the formation of the active site and that zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso
