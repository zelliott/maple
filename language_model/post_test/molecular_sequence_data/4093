zzso zzso is present in many cardiac disease states, including heart failure and zzso heart zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso that mediate the zzso of vital and structural zzso However, the functional contribution of zzso to these conditions is not zzso Furthermore, in cardiac zzso zzso may not be complete, allowing the cells to persist for a prolonged period within the zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso cardiac zzso proteins and, if so, whether it affects zzso zzso The effects of zzso were studied in zzso on individual components of the cardiac zzso including zzso zzso zzso heavy chain, zzso light chain 1/2, zzso cardiac zzso zzso I, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso protein zzso above) to zzso for 4 h resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso heavy chain, zzso light chain 1/2, and zzso into three fragments zzso 20, and 15 zzso and one major zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso and zzso were incubated individually with zzso there was no zzso zzso However, when the zzso zzso complex was exposed to zzso zzso was zzso resulting in fragments of 25 zzso Furthermore, rat cardiac zzso exposed to zzso exhibited similar patterns of zzso protein zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso abolished the zzso zzso isolated from adult rat zzso zzso after induction of zzso zzso by using zzso zzso displayed a similar pattern of zzso and zzso zzso Exposure of zzso fiber to zzso decreased zzso zzso force and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in an impaired zzso relationship and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cardiac cells was associated with similar zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathways may lead to zzso dysfunction before cell zzso
