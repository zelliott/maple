zzso zzso C zzso is a ubiquitous and highly zzso protein that is found associated to the zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso zzso The zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso by defining zzso and zzso and by binding to consensus sequences within the zzso In the present study we zzso a mouse zzso zzso zzso library with an zzso serum from patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso analysis of a positive clone containing a zzso zzso zzso insert revealed that it encodes the entire zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso C zzso Northern blots of total zzso isolated from zzso and various adult mouse zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso transcript is highly expressed in the zzso and that it begins zzso at day 18 zzso corresponding to the appearance of zzso zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the zzso and zzso expression of this zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso serum localized zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling confirmed the zzso observations but additionally showed that zzso content peaked in the zzso of zzso zzso and that 2 zzso components found exclusively in zzso and zzso germ cells were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso serum revealed several zzso zzso of which one, a 21 zzso zzso could be the zzso zzso C based on its predicted molecular zzso In summary we report an zzso of zzso zzso C which is zzso specific and which may play a role in zzso zzso exclusively in zzso and zzso germ cells during zzso
