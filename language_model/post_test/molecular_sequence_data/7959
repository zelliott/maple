This review attempts a critical zzso of the current state of the science aimed at predicting structural features of proteins from their zzso acid zzso At the primary structure level, methods are considered for detection of remotely related sequences and for recognizing zzso acid patterns to predict zzso modifications and binding zzso The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, zzso regions, and secondary structural zzso At the zzso structural level, methods for zzso a sequence into a zzso fold, zzso modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are zzso A literature analysis suggests that, to date, zzso techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition zzso Recent progress in the state of zzso zzso structure calculation is reviewed in zzso The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the zzso acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental zzso Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein zzso For single sequences without zzso the folding problem has not yet been zzso
