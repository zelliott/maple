Gains of zzso have been associated with zzso and chemotherapy response, particularly in zzso cancer, zzso zzso and zzso By zzso cloning of amplified genes by zzso artificial zzso zzso capture using magnetic zzso we have identified three candidate genes zzso zzso and zzso in the amplified region in zzso zzso and zzso showed higher amplification levels than zzso Most notably, amplification was very common in zzso where in particular zzso was highly zzso zzso has multiple repeats and shows no zzso to previously described zzso whereas zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso family, very similar to zzso zzso zzso was zzso almost exclusively in aggressive zzso or chemotherapy resistant zzso Although zzso was generally more amplified than zzso it was not expressed in zzso zzso where amplification of this region is very zzso All three genes were found to be amplified and zzso also in breast zzso The complex nature of the zzso zzso and close proximity of the genes make unequivocal determination of the gene responsible zzso Quite zzso the different genes may give selective advantages to different zzso of zzso
