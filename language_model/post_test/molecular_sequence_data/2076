A new zzso unit of a protein different from the zzso the zzso and the zzso is proposed based on the analysis of the structure of the zzso of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arms of the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are composed of repeats of zzso zzso zzso A zzso repeat of zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso and the competition of zzso for DNA binding with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso is shown to be a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso and it is concluded that the zzso repeat binds to DNA in its minor groove with a binding constant, zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso The circular zzso zzso spectrum of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso is quite different from those of both the zzso and the zzso and resembles that of a random zzso From statistical consideration of protein structures it is proposed that zzso forms a compact zzso stabilized by an additional hydrogen zzso Since a repeated chain of such turn of zzso offers a repeat of zzso of zzso zzso at a distance similar to that of zzso zzso of the drugs, zzso zzso and zzso and since the zzso of these drugs bind to DNA replacing the spine of zzso in a minor groove, it is proposed that a repeat of zzso binds to DNA in the minor groove using similar hydrogen zzso
