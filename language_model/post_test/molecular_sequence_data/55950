zzso and procedures are described that greatly alleviate the sequential assignment process of zzso zzso proteins by determining the type of zzso acid from experiments that correlate side chain with backbone zzso zzso A recently proposed zzso zzso experiment, zzso zzso C alpha and C beta zzso to the backbone zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the next zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An extension of this experiment is described which zzso the zzso H beta and H alpha zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the next zzso acid, and a detailed product operator description is zzso A simple zzso zzso zzso experiment is described which rapidly identifies H beta and C beta zzso of aromatic or zzso zzso The extent to which combined knowledge of the C alpha and C beta chemical shift values determines the zzso acid type is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the combined C alpha and C beta chemical shifts of three or four adjacent zzso usually are sufficient for defining a unique position in the protein zzso
