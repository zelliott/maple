The zzso are zzso zzso essential cellular proteins that help folding newly zzso or zzso zzso spending zzso We present here the molecular analysis of the zzso gene promoter region and of two zzso zzso zzso methane zzso embryonic lethal zzso that have an identical zzso No heat shock element sequences were found in the zzso region, supporting previous data zzso zzso et zzso 1997) which suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso is not heat zzso By sequencing the lethal zzso entire open reading frame zzso we found a zzso transition in the zzso zzso that produces a zzso to zzso change, apparently zzso the protein equatorial domain zzso No changes were found in the zzso zzso However, an analysis of the zzso nuclear zzso levels showed a reduction of the zzso transcript in zzso flies as compared to the zzso These data suggest that although the defects in the zzso gene produced by these zzso are at different levels, both behave as zzso zzso
