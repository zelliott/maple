zzso amplification zzso was used to specifically identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agent of bacterial zzso of zzso zzso zzso were developed to detect zzso a zzso stable gene that encodes a type II zzso zzso A, which zzso growth of other zzso zzso zzso In all, 409 bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 58 zzso zzso zzso zzso from a worldwide collection were tested with zzso to determine its zzso zzso results were compared with genetic profiles established using zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains produced eight distinct zzso The zzso reaction identified all zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and zzso them from other zzso zzso subspecies and zzso zzso zzso has advantages over zzso and other molecular detection methods because of its specificity and zzso nature, which allows for easy field zzso The zzso reaction is also not affected by as many zzso as zzso This diagnostic tool has potential to provide an easy, zzso test for rapid identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso
