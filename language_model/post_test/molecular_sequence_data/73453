zzso gene expression involves zzso processing of the gene zzso zzso and a key zzso in this process is the viral zzso zzso In this report, we describe the zzso of the human coronavirus zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and the zzso properties, inhibitor profile, and zzso specificity of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we have introduced single zzso acid zzso and zzso deletions into the zzso protein and determined the ability of these zzso zzso zzso to catalyze the zzso of a zzso zzso Using this approach, we have identified the zzso zzso and zzso as being indispensable for zzso zzso Our results also support the involvement of zzso in zzso recognition, and they confirm the requirement of the zzso extension found in coronavirus zzso zzso for zzso zzso These data provide experimental evidence for the relationship of coronavirus zzso zzso to other viral zzso zzso but they also show that the coronavirus zzso has zzso unique zzso
