The activity of the zzso zzso A1 zzso alpha gene promoter was analyzed in transgenic zzso zzso The zzso upstream sequence of the A1 gene and several promoter deletions were fused to the zzso zzso coding zzso zzso activity was monitored by quantitative and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results show that the A1 promoter exhibits a modular zzso zzso both upstream and downstream relative to the zzso initiation site are involved in quantitative and zzso expression during zzso zzso One upstream element may be involved in the zzso of expression in zzso zzso the downstream region, corresponding to an zzso within the zzso zzso region zzso is important for expression in zzso both upstream and downstream sequences are required for expression in leaves, suggesting zzso properties of zzso alpha zzso zzso This notion of specific zzso regulation is reinforced by the results of transient expression experiments in zzso zzso zzso The deletion of the zzso has much more effect on expression when the promoter activity is under the control of A1 zzso alpha upstream sequences than when these upstream sequences were replaced by the zzso zzso Similarly, a synthetic zzso corresponding to an A1 zzso alpha upstream zzso element (the zzso zzso is able to restore partially the original activity when fused to a zzso zzso promoter but has no significant effect when fused to an zzso zzso zzso
