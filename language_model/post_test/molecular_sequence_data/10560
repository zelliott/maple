Human zzso growth factor zzso 4 zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that is activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso of full-length human zzso zzso revealed the existence of two zzso zzso that differed by zzso of either 23 or 13 alternative zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid form zzso zzso and the zzso acid form zzso zzso were expressed in a zzso manner, as demonstrated by reverse zzso chain reaction analysis of mouse and human zzso Both zzso were expressed in neural zzso such as zzso whereas kidney expressed zzso zzso only and heart zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso using specific zzso demonstrated zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that both zzso zzso were activated to the same extent by zzso and zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso A functional difference was found, however, in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso binding and in a reduction of total zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that novel alternatively spliced zzso of zzso exist, that they are distributed zzso in zzso in mouse and human zzso that they are both activated by zzso zzso and that they may represent zzso and zzso forms of zzso
