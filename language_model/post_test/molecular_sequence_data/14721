zzso organisms achieve final body shape and size by zzso cell zzso expansion, and zzso Loss of function in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso characteristic compact zzso architecture, but its underlying signaling pathways remain zzso Here we report that the expression of zzso in the zzso is sufficient to rescue compact zzso zzso We further identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso upstream components of zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso or zzso in the zzso a layer adjacent to zzso is sufficient to rescue the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso physically associate with zzso in zzso Finally, zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso revealed a potential downstream component as well as a role for plant hormones in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso layer communication between the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso coordinates proper zzso architecture in zzso
