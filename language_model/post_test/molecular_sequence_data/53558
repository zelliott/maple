Fifteen zzso genes in six loop zzso and eight zzso genes in five zzso zzso active site zzso of zzso zzso zzso were constructed, cloned and expressed in zzso coli or zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso for zzso activity on zzso cellulose zzso swollen cellulose zzso filter paper zzso and bacterial zzso cellulose zzso as well as zzso zzso and 2, zzso They were also zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso feedback zzso Two double zzso zzso that formed zzso bonds across two tunnel forming zzso were found to significantly weaken binding to zzso lower all activities, and zzso demonstrating that the movement of these zzso is important but not essential for zzso zzso Two single zzso zzso zzso and zzso had higher activity on SC and zzso and the double zzso zzso had zzso and twofold higher activity on these zzso zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was not increased with these zzso zzso All zzso zzso with lower activity on filter paper, zzso and SC had lower zzso This trend was not true for zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso is a key factor in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso located near putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to significantly increase resistance to zzso feedback zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso specifically decreased activity on zzso suggesting that zzso zzso has a different rate limiting step than the other zzso Most of the zzso zzso had reduced zzso although zzso zzso maintained zzso zzso The properties of the different zzso zzso provide insight into the zzso mechanism of zzso
