The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli has been zzso The zzso zzso structural zzso was shown to consist of three open reading zzso namely zzso zzso zzso with predicted molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso A zzso displayed a high degree of zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the active site and zzso zzso binding site that is common to these zzso is located in the zzso A zzso A comparison of the predicted zzso zzso acids of the zzso gene product to those of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso processing of a 16 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso A had zzso The zzso B zzso contains 16 zzso zzso organized in four zzso two of which are typical of zzso binding zzso The zzso C zzso is composed of eight segments of zzso zzso acids of appropriate length to cross the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso functions to anchor the zzso to the zzso
