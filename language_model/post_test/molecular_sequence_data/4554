One of the most common zzso abnormalities in acute leukemia is a zzso zzso involving the zzso gene at zzso locus zzso resulting in zzso fusion zzso Using the zzso zzso system, in zzso binding studies, and human cell culture zzso experiments, we show here that a region of the zzso protein that is consistently retained in zzso zzso fusion proteins interacts directly with zzso another protein implicated in zzso We have identified the binding sites on zzso for zzso and show that these sequences are clustered near the zzso hooks that have been shown to bind zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso possibly the zzso tail of zzso bind to zzso We have also found zzso protein zzso activity in zzso zzso Using the zzso inhibitor zzso acid and Western zzso the zzso was identified as protein zzso 2A zzso zzso of a single zzso acid in one of the zzso binding sites of zzso resulted in lower amounts of both zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso effects of zzso fusion proteins may be related to interactions with zzso and zzso
