zzso zzso methods zzso the same zzso procedures as natural genetic evolution, in which a population is gradually improved by zzso We have developed a genetic zzso search procedure suitable for use in protein folding zzso A population of zzso of the zzso chain is zzso and zzso are changed by zzso in the form of conventional zzso Carlo steps, and crossovers in which parts of the zzso chain are zzso between zzso For folding on a simple two-dimensional lattice it is found that the genetic zzso is dramatically superior to conventional zzso Carlo zzso
