Coral zzso has been identified as one of the major contributors to coral reef decline, and the occurrence of different zzso determined by broad genetic groupings zzso zzso is commonly used to explain zzso responses of zzso zzso By using zzso zzso as a model, we monitored individual zzso colonies in zzso over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic zzso within zzso C is correlated to differences in zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gel zzso of the internal transcribed zzso region 2, visual zzso zzso zzso zzso host zzso and pulse zzso modulated zzso we show that zzso types zzso and zzso are more zzso tolerant than zzso and zzso which suffered significant zzso and zzso zzso Although additional zzso types were detected during zzso in colonies harboring types zzso and zzso all colonies reverted back to their original zzso zzso Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring zzso sensitive versus resistant zzso rather than zzso zzso within a single host is responsible for the observed zzso composition changes of coral communities after zzso This study therefore highlights that the use of broad zzso zzso may not be suitable to describe differences in zzso zzso and that differential mortality results in a loss of both zzso and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing zzso
