zzso is a member of the zzso family which plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso during many normal and disease zzso We show here that in zzso rat zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso from the zzso gene is zzso by the vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso Furthermore, expression zzso zzso the human zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso repress zzso zzso zzso expression from zzso zzso gene expression zzso in zzso zzso and human zzso cells, as determined by transient zzso zzso Through zzso and deletion analysis, we show that the zzso dependent repression is zzso by a 25 zzso region from zzso positions zzso to zzso of the rat zzso zzso DNA zzso Further zzso analysis of this region indicates that the DNA sequence required for zzso dependent repression zzso with an zzso binding site which is essential for promoter zzso We show also that zzso zzso the zzso activity of a reporter gene containing a zzso responding zzso binding site driving the zzso zzso zzso Thus the zzso complex appears to repress zzso of the zzso gene by blocking zzso by positive regulatory zzso However, we found no evidence supporting the possibility that the zzso dependent repression could be due to zzso binding to the zzso binding site or to the zzso components zzso and zzso
