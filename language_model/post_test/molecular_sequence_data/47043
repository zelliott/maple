zzso a zzso of the first component zzso of the classical complement pathway, binds to zzso via its zzso region zzso stimulating zzso zzso We previously identified a region of zzso defined by fragments generated by zzso and zzso zzso that was required for triggering this respiratory zzso To further zzso that critical site, zzso human zzso was zzso with zzso to generate zzso and subsequently zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with any of these zzso did not alter the circular zzso zzso demonstrating that the fragments generated had maintained the secondary structure observed in the native zzso All fragments retained the ability to trigger zzso production by zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso products zzso of which are identical to the published zzso site zzso for these zzso demonstrated that it is the zzso but not the zzso of zzso that is critical for stimulating this activity, and thus may be a target for future therapeutic zzso
