The zzso effect of zzso antagonists, synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso domain of smooth muscle zzso zzso and an inhibitor based on the sequence of zzso were examined using bovine zzso zzso and isolated chicken gizzard zzso Much lower zzso of the peptides were necessary to inhibit zzso zzso activity than to inhibit zzso In contrast, zzso zzso inhibited both zzso activity and zzso at similar zzso The zzso zzso were competitive with isolated zzso but not zzso for zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that in addition to the zzso dependence of zzso zzso a second zzso protein may be important in zzso zzso The data also suggest that the zzso hypothesis may not completely account for regulation of zzso zzso zzso
