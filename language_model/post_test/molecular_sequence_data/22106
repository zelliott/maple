The zzso zzso from human zzso zzso mediates cell transformation in part by binding to the human zzso tumor zzso protein and zzso zzso factors, resulting in the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso factors and the premature cell progression into the zzso of the cell zzso This activity is zzso by the zzso motif and the zzso zinc binding domain of the zzso zzso In this study we report the zzso crystal structure of the zzso region of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso analysis to investigate its mode of zzso and zzso binding and zzso displacement from zzso The structure reveals a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains two surface patches of sequence zzso zzso of zzso within these patches reveals that one patch is required for zzso zzso whereas the other is required for zzso zzso We also show that both zzso interactions are required to disrupt zzso zzso Based on these studies we present a zzso model for how zzso zzso zzso from zzso Because the zzso region of zzso zzso has no zzso zzso to other human zzso the zzso studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small zzso compounds that inhibit zzso cell zzso
