A differential zzso technique detected the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso following zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was also noted after entry of virulent strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two other zzso zzso bacterial zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso an invasion zzso zzso B zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso or latex beads produced zzso expression levels similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also shown to occur in zzso zzso human zzso cells, albeit to an extent less than that in zzso zzso zzso In addition to a lower abundance of zzso zzso we also demonstrate for the first time that less zzso protein was detected in zzso cells zzso about 1 h after entry of the zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Some strains with specific zzso in characterized zzso such as an zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso did not elicit this lower level of expression of zzso zzso The decrease in zzso within infected zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso Since zzso comprises the zzso part of the zzso zzso that degrades zzso zzso we zzso that zzso of the zzso gene by zzso bacterial entry may help zzso the host cell's normal defensive response to zzso bacteria, allowing the zzso bacteria to zzso
