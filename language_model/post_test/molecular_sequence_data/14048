The exact identity of zzso that have been cultured from symbiotic associations with the water zzso zzso zzso whether they are required in the symbiotic process, and their relationship to the symbiotic species, is a matter of some zzso We have characterized a 6 zzso region containing the zzso zzso and the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso Five complete open reading frames have been zzso All are very highly zzso when compared with the corresponding regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso identity at the zzso level and zzso to almost zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso regions, however, are not highly zzso zzso zzso when compared to the corresponding regions of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains both more copies and more types of short zzso repeated repetitive sequences than zzso zzso The start points of zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso were mapped and found to be the same as those in zzso zzso It was not possible to discern an improved consensus zzso promoter zzso but it was possible to define the likely extent of the promoter to within 40 bases upstream of the zzso zzso
