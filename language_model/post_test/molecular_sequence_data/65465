The zzso is the zzso structure that zzso the zzso and zzso filaments in the middle of the zzso Apart from the zzso tails and the zzso of zzso only two closely related structural proteins had been detected at the zzso so far, zzso and zzso However, electron zzso studies revealed structural features that do not correlate with the expression of these two zzso indicating the presence of unknown constituents in the zzso Using comparative sequence analysis, we have identified a third member of this gene family, zzso 3, and zzso its biological zzso zzso 3 is predicted to consist of a unique head domain followed by a zzso sequence of either zzso or zzso zzso similarly to zzso 3 and zzso While all three members of the zzso family are zzso to the zzso of the zzso each member shows its specific expression zzso In contrast to zzso which is zzso expressed in all zzso muscles, and zzso whose expression is restricted to adult heart and zzso skeletal muscle, zzso 3 can be detected mainly in intermediate speed fibers of skeletal zzso In zzso to zzso zzso 3 targets to the zzso region of the zzso via its zzso part and forms zzso via its zzso zzso However, despite the high degree of zzso no zzso between distinct members of the zzso gene family can be zzso We propose that each member of the zzso family is a component of one of the distinct zzso the zzso which zzso the mechanical properties of the zzso in different muscle zzso
