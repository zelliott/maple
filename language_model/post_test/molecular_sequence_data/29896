The zzso basic proteins zzso mediate the zzso zzso of the zzso plasma membrane to form the major dense line of central nervous system zzso Four major zzso of zzso zzso obtained by alternative zzso of seven zzso from a single primary transcript, display distinct zzso zzso We expressed these major zzso individually in zzso cells and mapped their zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso that are the zzso forms in compact zzso distributed primarily in the zzso regions of the cell in zzso highly suggestive of close association with zzso We zzso that these zzso zzso possess strong, zzso zzso properties that have been adapted by the zzso to mediate zzso of the zzso of plasma membrane that form zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso distributed zzso in both the zzso and the zzso and often accumulated within the zzso This distribution can be correlated with the presence of the zzso segment zzso by zzso II, which is unique to these zzso The zzso significance of the nuclear targeting displayed by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells remains to be zzso
