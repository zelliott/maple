zzso conditions for the zzso production of a hybrid zzso from zzso were established by using zzso coli zzso 109 carrying the zzso zzso This zzso contained a novel zzso system consisting of the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso under the zzso promoter of either the zzso or the zzso zzso an omega zzso zzso and zzso zzso located upstream of the promoters and a hybrid zzso gene of zzso When controlled by the zzso promoter, the zzso gene led to a higher total production of zzso and a higher protein zzso than when it was under control of the zzso zzso When the effect of different distances between the zzso promoters and the zzso gene was investigated, a shorter distance was generally found to result in a higher zzso With a complex growth zzso the zzso of zzso production of the zzso depended on several operating zzso such as the salt concentration zzso and the oxygen supply, which were varied by changing the culture volume and the shaking zzso In defined media the zzso of zzso into the medium was increased significantly by the addition of zzso as a carbon source and by prolonged zzso The strain with the highest production and zzso yield of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso was tested on the zzso zzso
