Here, we provide an analysis of molecular evolution of five of the most populated protein zzso zzso fold, zzso fold, zzso fold, zzso zzso and TIM zzso In order to distinguish between zzso functional and structural reasons for zzso acid zzso we consider proteins that acquire the same fold and have no evident sequence zzso For each fold we identify positions that are zzso within each individual family and coincide when zzso proteins are structurally zzso As a baseline for statistical assessment we use the conservatism expected based on the zzso zzso The analysis is based on a new concept of zzso This approach allows us to identify the structural features that are stabilized in all proteins having a given fold, despite the fact that actual interactions that provide such stabilization may vary from protein to zzso zzso with experimental data on zzso folding zzso and function of the proteins reveals that such universally zzso clusters zzso to either: zzso zzso zzso location of active site in proteins having common zzso structures but not zzso or zzso folding zzso whose stability is an important zzso of folding rate, or both (in the case of zzso zzso The analysis also helps to clarify the relation between folding and function that is apparent for some zzso
