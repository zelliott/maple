The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a DNA binding zzso zzso required for growth on zzso as a sole carbon zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso cluster DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso repeat motifs and central and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of function zzso are deficient in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso has localized important functional regions of the zzso zzso Two extreme zzso are shown to lack the zzso region of the zzso Two temperature sensitive zzso contain zzso acid zzso in the DNA binding domain and are shown to affect zzso induction of zzso expression and zzso temperature sensitive in zzso DNA zzso Two temperature sensitive zzso zzso result in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso in crude zzso This suggests that zzso may have a structural role in zzso metabolism in addition to its regulatory zzso
