The relationship between human zzso virus zzso type 1 reverse zzso zzso zzso formation and base pair stability was investigated using DNA and zzso templates with 15 zzso matched or mismatched DNA zzso zzso zzso formation during primer zzso was zzso on zzso duplexes but occurred with a frequency of zzso on matched zzso zzso The frequency increased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso duplexes with zzso zzso located 6 and 9 zzso beyond the zzso zzso From zzso values at 37 degrees C, the free energy change upon zzso zzso G degrees zzso of the zzso zzso increased from matched to mismatched zzso duplexes by zzso zzso delta G degrees 37 for a correct zzso pair decreased by zzso zzso In comparison with zzso duplexes, zzso melting zzso on zzso duplexes demonstrated smaller zzso zzso delta H degrees zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso delta S degrees zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso A strong zzso compensation resulted in small free energy differences zzso delta G degrees 37 zzso zzso to zzso zzso Thus, although zzso and zzso duplexes are of comparable stability in solution, the zzso duplex presents more facile base pair opening and higher zzso zzso The release of zzso strain at constant zzso stability in zzso duplexes may facilitate base zzso during reverse transcription, particularly in the context of zzso zzso zzso
