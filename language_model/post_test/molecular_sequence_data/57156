A previously zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso was identified by its zzso binding to zzso and by its molecular mass of 43 zzso under reducing conditions on zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso on zzso rabbit zzso zzso (to remove zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso were zzso to zzso Bound zzso was zzso with zzso and then the zzso zzso together with zzso protein zzso was zzso with zzso The zzso zzso was separated from zzso by zzso exchange zzso on zzso On zzso under zzso conditions the zzso showed a molecular mass of 120 zzso On gel zzso under zzso conditions the protein was zzso at a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 750 zzso zzso acid analysis showed the presence of zzso and zzso and a high content of zzso zzso indicating the presence of a zzso zzso This was supported by the zzso of the protein to zzso zzso The designation zzso was chosen since this zzso appears to belong to the zzso zzso proteins with collagen structure and zzso zzso The zzso sequence (27 zzso zzso showed zzso identity with bovine zzso and zzso identity to bovine zzso An zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso as zzso revealed the following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a circulating zzso with structural similarities to bovine zzso and zzso and a zzso binding profile resembling that of zzso
