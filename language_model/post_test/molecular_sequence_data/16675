zzso protein zzso also called zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that promotes zzso zzso turnover in zzso and in zzso However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso binds with strong preference to zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and competes directly with zzso for binding zzso Further, zzso blocks zzso zzso addition specifically to barbed ends of zzso in contrast to zzso which blocks zzso addition to pointed ends of zzso The zzso domain of zzso is more extensive than previously suggested and includes a recently solved zzso structure in the zzso of zzso and adjacent zzso Using zzso zzso we define zzso zzso zzso that mediate binding to zzso and demonstrate that these activities are required for zzso function in zzso in directing zzso organization and polarized cell zzso Together, our data suggest that in zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding zzso zzso allows rapid zzso exchange to occur on zzso and then because of its zzso weaker binding affinity for zzso compared with zzso allows other cellular factors such as zzso to take the handoff of zzso and facilitate barbed end zzso
