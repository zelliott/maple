The genes zzso A1 and zzso protein zzso were successfully zzso and characterized in the tropical zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso long, with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso but not in the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was not expressed in zzso zzso juveniles zzso 3, and 5 months zzso A tissue expression analysis showed zzso to be expressed specifically in the zzso whereas zzso was expressed abundantly in the zzso but zzso in the foot, zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso and zzso The relative expression levels of zzso and zzso were significantly lower in undeveloped zzso zzso I) than in developed zzso zzso II, III, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
