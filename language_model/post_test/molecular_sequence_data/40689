zzso zzso is an zzso fungus well characterized for the zzso of a wide range of zzso Its zzso depends on the zzso of zzso zzso that degrade the host zzso To identify proteins involved in the infection process and in host specify, zzso analysis was performed using zzso produced against crude extract of zzso zzso cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso detected using zzso produced against zzso zzso cultured in zzso and spore surface zzso but not with zzso against zzso zzso cultured in zzso were identified so as to give insights about the infection zzso An zzso allowed the identification of zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso as host specific, being recognized in zzso zzso infection zzso This research represents an important contribution to the understanding the adaptation mechanisms of zzso zzso to different zzso
