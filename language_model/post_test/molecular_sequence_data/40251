G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively recognize and are zzso regulated by activated zzso but the molecular basis for this interaction is not zzso zzso we report crystal structures of zzso in which regions known to be critical for zzso zzso have coalesced to stabilize the zzso domain in a closed state and to form a likely zzso zzso zzso The crux of this zzso site is an extended zzso zzso that bridges the large and small zzso of the zzso domain and lies adjacent to a basic surface of the protein proposed to bind zzso zzso zzso of exposed, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso interact directly with zzso Our structural and zzso results thus provide an explanation for how zzso recognition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are intimately coupled in zzso
