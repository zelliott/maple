zzso virus gene expression is highly restricted in zzso but is induced by zzso differentiation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel shift zzso and zzso I zzso were used to identify sequences in the zzso virus long terminal repeat involved in the zzso regulation of gene expression in the zzso zzso cell zzso We found that an zzso and an zzso binding site were critical for zzso activity and that the zzso site was required for zzso zzso gene zzso These results suggest that cellular factors that interact with zzso sites are involved in the zzso regulation of zzso virus gene expression in zzso
