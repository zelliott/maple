zzso interactions involving specific zzso zzso play a central role in gene zzso and its zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso (A and zzso that mediate direct interactions with the zzso factor zzso complex associated with zzso zzso II and synergistic effects involving multiple zzso zzso In the present study, we report the complementary DNA sequence for an alternatively spliced form of mouse zzso zzso that lacks one of the two zzso zzso regions present in the full-length zzso zzso transcripts were identified in mouse zzso and cell lines, and an zzso protein identical in size to that predicted for zzso was detected in mouse nuclear zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso lacks appreciable activity at promoters containing a single zzso response element but is active when multiple zzso sites are present, suggesting synergistic interactions between multiple zzso zzso The absence of a single zzso domain does not fully explain the properties of the smaller protein and indicates that additional structural features account for its unique zzso zzso The functional implications of this alternatively spliced form of zzso are zzso
