A new zzso stalked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described from zzso vents at depths of zzso zzso along segments of the East Scotia Ridge and from zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Both locations are areas of volcanic activity that lie on the zzso American Ocean Ridge complex near the South zzso zzso This discovery confirms a wide distribution in southern seas for zzso zzso the previous records from zzso vents in the zzso zzso and zzso Ridge in the southwest Pacific, and the Pacific Antarctic Ridge in the southeast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the third described species of zzso shows an extraordinary range in zzso requiring a reassessment of the original diagnosis for zzso Although the zzso envelope of zzso zzso zzso zzso includes representatives with a zzso to zzso ratio similar to that observed in most zzso the zzso generally shows greater zzso length than in species in any zzso zzso except zzso it is distinguished from other species of zzso by a broader zzso much smaller zzso scales on the zzso and more zzso zzso zzso The zzso diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso is interpreted as having arisen due to abrupt changes in water zzso zzso
