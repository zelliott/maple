zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso make up a significant portion of zzso zzso Given their ability to mutate genes these mobile elements always present a threat to the integrity of the host zzso Recent studies have revealed complex molecular mechanisms that silence the zzso ability of these zzso as well zzso express the pieces of the incorporated zzso that are zzso to silence human zzso zzso zzso or invading zzso zzso zzso We have hypothesized that small zzso zzso originally evolved to quell zzso zzso and subsequently emerged into elaborate zzso systems that include zzso zzso zzso gene regulation and other gene zzso zzso Here, we present evidence that the replication of complex zzso are most likely silenced or regulated by zzso zzso that are found as a part of the cellular zzso We analyzed Homo sapiens zzso for possible target genetic sequences in selected zzso and zzso found in humans and other large zzso We identified several zzso that have zzso sequence zzso with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso like zzso zzso and zzso We found an inverse correlation between the numbers and relative degree of zzso of zzso to the relative replication capacity of a specific zzso zzso larger numbers of zzso with greater degree of zzso are found against the least active zzso and the least numbers of zzso with smaller degree of zzso are found against the most active zzso zzso zzso zzso of these observations in zzso disease and therapy are zzso
