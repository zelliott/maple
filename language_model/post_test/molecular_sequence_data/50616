The role of the coat protein of potato virus X zzso was investigated by zzso zzso of the coat protein zzso zzso viruses with zzso deletions in the zzso end of the coat protein gene were capable of zzso infecting plants, but produced zzso with zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso near the zzso end or with deletions in the central part of the coat protein gene failed to accumulate at zzso levels, even in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso that infected zzso either had a zzso zzso or showed a small reduction in zzso of zzso zzso The other zzso which did not accumulate in the zzso zzso were unaffected in zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso but at 16 zzso and later they accumulated less zzso zzso than zzso zzso None of the zzso had an effect on zzso of zzso zzso The data indicate that efficient zzso and spread of zzso even in the zzso zzso requires coat protein production and zzso of the viral zzso
