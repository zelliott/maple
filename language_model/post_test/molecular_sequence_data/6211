A rapid and sensitive technique is described that measures the length of the zzso tail on a specific zzso within zzso quantities of total cellular zzso zzso zzso test zzso In a zzso reaction, a zzso primer is zzso in zzso on the zzso tail of zzso using zzso and DNA zzso By modulating the zzso temperature and primer zzso a zzso adapter sequence is targeted to the zzso end of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso is then used to prime reverse zzso of the zzso yielding a library of zzso zzso The length of a zzso tail is determined by zzso amplification using the zzso primer and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso products from different samples allows quantitative determination of changes in zzso of a given zzso This technique overcomes many of the pitfalls associated with conventional zzso tail length assessments and should prove useful in studying a variety of processes relating to zzso
