A zzso zzso egg cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in forming the zzso layer of the egg envelope and functions in establishing a block to zzso We report the zzso cloning of the zzso expression of the cortical zzso zzso gene during zzso and early development, and identification of a new family of zzso The translated zzso for the cortical zzso zzso had a signal zzso a structural sequence of zzso zzso zzso a molecular weight of zzso K, contained consensus sequence sites for zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed during early stages of zzso zzso zzso levels were constant during development with 2/3 of the zzso associated with the zzso zzso space and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were from zzso to zzso greater in zzso than in other adult zzso The zzso had no sequence zzso to the previously identified zzso zzso The zzso had zzso zzso acid identity with nine translated zzso sequences from an zzso zzso frog, zzso and zzso Based on the zzso zzso binding and structural properties of these zzso we propose a new family of zzso the zzso zzso
