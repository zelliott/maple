Animal zzso contain approximately 20,000 zzso zzso millions of genes for zzso receptors are generated in cells of the immune system from the sets of separate gene segments by a mechanism known as the zzso zzso zzso The components of the zzso zzso system, zzso Gene proteins zzso and zzso and zzso signal sequence zzso are thought to have zzso the zzso zzso as a hypothetical zzso zzso Recently discovered mobile elements have terminal zzso repeats zzso similar to zzso and may zzso proteins with a different degree of similarity to zzso We describe a novel zzso zzso identified from the sea zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein similar to the zzso part of zzso in zzso This zzso the zzso zzso hypothesis and allows us to propose a scenario for zzso zzso machinery evolution from a relic zzso related to the existing mobile elements zzso zzso and zzso
