High plasma zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, are associated with coronary heart disease and zzso zzso of zzso levels is high and the major locus determining zzso zzso is the zzso zzso We here demonstrate that a zzso substitution at the zzso donor zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso IV type 8 zzso occurs with a high frequency ( approximately zzso in Caucasians but not in Africans and is associated with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso This zzso alone accounts for a quarter of all zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis based on zzso illegitimate zzso in zzso zzso cells demonstrated that the donor zzso site zzso results in an alternative zzso of the K IV type 8 zzso and encodes a truncated form of zzso zzso of the alternatively spliced zzso analogue in zzso cells showed that the truncated zzso form is zzso but is unable to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso from zzso for the zzso was almost completely zzso Taken together, our data indicate that a failure in complex formation followed by fast degradation in plasma of the truncated free zzso is one mechanism which zzso the zzso zzso type associated with the donor zzso site zzso
