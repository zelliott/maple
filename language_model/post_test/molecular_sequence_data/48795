zzso zzso is an interesting building block for zzso and zzso organic zzso zzso acting on this compound are potential targets for zzso zzso design to extend the repertoire of zzso modifications of this and related building zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli, zzso using a fused zzso affinity tag and zzso in complex with the zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Its structure was determined to zzso zzso resolution using molecular zzso The structure displays an empty zzso site and can be interpreted as an open zzso reflecting the zzso state shortly after the release of product, presumably with bound oxidized zzso zzso zzso simulations indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso or product zzso The side chain of zzso seems to have the ability to function as a molecular zzso The crystal structure helps to characterize the interface relevant for zzso formation as observed in zzso The crystal structure is compared with the structure of the zzso from zzso zzso which was solved in a closed zzso and for which zzso formation in solution could not be verified but seems to be likely based on the presented studies of zzso zzso zzso
