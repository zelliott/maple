The zzso zzso zzso of transfer zzso zzso drives decoding by interacting directly with the zzso through zzso zzso zzso complex zzso modifications found in the zzso at positions 34 or 37 are known to be required for accurate zzso Although over 100 distinct modifications have been structurally characterized in zzso only a few are universally zzso among them zzso zzso zzso found at position 37 in the zzso loop of a subset of zzso zzso studies predict an important role for zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso work supports this zzso Although pioneering work in the 1970s identified the fundamental zzso for zzso zzso the zzso responsible for its zzso have remained an zzso We report here the discovery that in bacteria four proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of universally zzso families that were ranked among the top 10 proteins of unknown function in need of functional zzso while zzso and zzso are specific to zzso This latter zzso coupled with the zzso of all four proteins in bacteria, establishes this zzso as a compelling new target for zzso zzso
