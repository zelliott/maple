By successive screenings of zzso libraries prepared from human zzso and from human zzso zzso we have isolated overlapping zzso coding for a novel protein which we call zzso with sequence characteristics of a zzso protein zzso zzso Ron is a zzso zzso acid protein structurally similar to the zzso zzso acid product of the zzso zzso the zzso for zzso growth factor and scatter zzso The two proteins have zzso overall sequence identity in their zzso zzso We have zzso the RON gene to human zzso region zzso a region frequently deleted in small cell zzso of the lung and in zzso cell zzso and which is believed to zzso unidentified zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, normal lung tissue contains transcripts of the RON zzso
