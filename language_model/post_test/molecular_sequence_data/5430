The zzso gene encodes an zzso protein of unknown function that was originally identified as a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso This paper describes the isolation of a zzso clone containing the human zzso gene from a zzso 1 zzso library and the characterization of its zzso zzso The protein coding region comprises 10 zzso The zzso gene maps at zzso zzso outside the zzso differentiation complex zzso The zzso gene appears to be expressed as a zzso transcript predominantly in zzso and heart, while an additional zzso alternatively spliced message was detected in zzso The full-length human zzso transcript contains zzso zzso and has an overall zzso of zzso with the mouse zzso zzso This transcript codes for a protein of 540 zzso acids that is zzso identical and zzso similar to the corresponding mouse zzso The alternatively spliced zzso 1450 zzso long, encodes a protein of 415 zzso zzso
