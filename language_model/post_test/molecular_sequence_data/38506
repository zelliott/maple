We have identified a sine zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sine zzso gene zzso encodes a protein with a sine zzso zzso domain and a zzso that shares significant sequence similarity with so proteins assigned to the zzso gene zzso zzso is expressed as a single transcript in both zzso and fully developed zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies show exclusive expression in zzso zzso Loss of function of zzso by zzso interference during zzso zzso zzso eye zzso zzso zzso is also essential for maintenance of the differentiated state of zzso zzso These results, combined with the previously demonstrated expression of zzso in zzso eyes, suggest that the same basic gene regulatory circuit required for eye development in zzso and mouse is used in the zzso eye spots of zzso and, therefore, is truly zzso during zzso
