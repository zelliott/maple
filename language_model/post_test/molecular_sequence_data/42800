An zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by fusing zzso zzso cells isolated from a surgical zzso of zzso melanoma with the zzso cell line zzso The zzso designated zzso reacted with surface zzso on human melanoma cells as shown by live cell zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and did not react with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of neutral zzso The main binding zzso for the zzso was, therefore, the terminal zzso acid 2-3 Gal linked by a beta 1-1 bond to the zzso or a beta zzso bond to zzso or zzso As shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed on all melanoma zzso zzso and on a few samples of colon zzso normal zzso skin, spinal cord, kidney and zzso However, other normal zzso such as breast, zzso small zzso stomach and zzso zzso did not react with the zzso In the presence of human serum the zzso initiated a strong zzso of melanoma zzso cells in zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that it is possible to isolate human zzso zzso directed to cell surface zzso using viable cell zzso in the screening zzso The preferential binding of zzso to melanoma zzso and the zzso with two of the major melanoma zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso may provide a useful zzso for diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso
