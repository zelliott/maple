The rat alpha zzso zzso gene family is composed of about 25 members with closely related zzso Several of these genes are zzso active in the liver of adult zzso We isolated about 50 independent zzso clones from the library and determined complete zzso sequences of zzso Although they were alike and revealed structural features prerequisite for active zzso one cloned gene was interrupted in the 6th zzso with about 900 zzso zzso truncated and zzso zzso form of LINE 1 sequence flanked by 16 zzso complete direct repeat originating from the 6th zzso Within the inserted LINE 1 an excellent zzso zzso zzso with a precedent zzso junction motif and multiple zzso signals was zzso Thus, the possible production of a zzso zzso the last zzso of which would be replaced by a part of LINE 1, has to be zzso
