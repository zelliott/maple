zzso centers zzso have been identified as site at which the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso have also been observed in animals that normally do not harbor zzso zzso This clearly indicates that zzso zzso can occur in the absence of zzso zzso We therefore attempted to determine whether or not zzso exist in zzso mice, and are essential for the zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso mice were zzso with zzso and then examined with regard to the existence of zzso No typical zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso Cell proliferation was detected throughout all zzso tissue types, and no in zzso zzso retention was observed in the zzso zzso All of these data strongly suggest that no zzso were formed in the zzso zzso Although zzso mice are unable to form zzso zzso analyses indicated that affinity maturation had been achieved in both the zzso and zzso zzso We therefore isolated and zzso several DNA clones from zzso and the zzso zzso Eight out of 12 zzso zzso and 11 out of 14 clones of the zzso mice contained zzso at the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso mice were not extremely different with regard to types and rates of zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso were detected in both types of zzso zzso our data appear to show that affinity maturation may occur in zzso mice, which completely lack zzso
