During assembly and zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso processing of the structural precursor zzso protein generates three zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso The proteins share identical zzso zzso zzso but are truncated at zzso corresponding to gag zzso zzso zzso and zzso in their CA zzso zzso zzso To characterize zzso forms of the zzso CA zzso we examined zzso zzso of the zzso zzso assembled on zzso zzso Using electron zzso and image analysis approaches, the CA proteins were observed to organize in zzso zzso arrangements, where rings of zzso zzso zzso were spaced at 95 A zzso zzso between the zzso structures of the CA zzso were most evident in zzso regions, where apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso In this region, zzso connections were observed zzso while zzso and zzso contacts were resolved poorly, suggesting that in zzso processing of zzso to the shorter forms may permit zzso to adopt a zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso and zzso proteins formed small zzso particles with diameters of zzso zzso The spheres appear to be arranged from zzso or zzso plus zzso ring zzso that are related to the zzso crystal zzso Our results zzso zzso CA zzso rings as basic elements in the assembly of zzso virus zzso
