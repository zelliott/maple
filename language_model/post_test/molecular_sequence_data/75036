The zzso gene encodes the iron protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have previously shown the presence in zzso zzso of two zzso sequences in addition to the zzso gene which codes for a protein identical to the isolated iron zzso In the present study, we report that there are at least five zzso sequences in zzso zzso DNA sequencing data indicate that the six zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences are not identical and vary from each other to different zzso with sequence identity ranging between 68 to zzso within the zzso coding zzso Under normal zzso growth conditions zzso zzso transcripts of zzso and most of the zzso sequences zzso The above results suggest the functioning of more than one zzso gene under zzso growth conditions for zzso zzso A common sequence was found around the zzso regions of all zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to or very similar to the consensus zzso coli promoter were found in the zzso and zzso zzso
