We cloned the era gene of zzso zzso from a zzso library by zzso genetic zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso defective for the production of zzso an essential protein for cell zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that, in zzso zzso era constitutes a single gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, flank era in zzso zzso Although classified as zzso the zzso regions and the relative location of era in zzso zzso are distinctly different from those of typical zzso and zzso zzso Computer analysis of bacterial Era protein sequences identified zzso zzso in addition to the common G zzso of most zzso zzso
