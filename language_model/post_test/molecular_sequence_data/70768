zzso plasmids zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso family, are zzso identical in zzso zzso These small zzso and zzso zzso high copy number, nuclear plasmids carry both a gene zzso to the zzso rep gene and a long zzso to zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso Their zzso proteins are zzso identical in zzso acid sequence and carry all 10 of the zzso zzso sequence motifs found in the zzso family zzso zzso Unlike other members of this family, zzso carries two copies and zzso carries four copies of a zzso to zzso direct repeat zzso Both the direct and zzso repeat zzso as well as the promoter of the rep zzso are highly zzso zzso to zzso zzso between zzso and zzso In contrast, these regions are not highly zzso and the zzso proteins are only about zzso identical among the other known members of the zzso zzso
