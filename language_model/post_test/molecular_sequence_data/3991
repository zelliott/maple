Human zzso arrest zzso protein 1, zzso is a component of the zzso zzso assembly checkpoint zzso that monitors zzso of zzso segregation and guards against emergence of cellular zzso Because zzso is a pervasive characteristic of human zzso understanding how zzso genes are regulated is zzso Here, we have analyzed human zzso sequences upstream of the zzso most zzso coding zzso and have identified a zzso zzso with promoter zzso The zzso promoter, consistent with characteristics of zzso zzso is highly zzso rich and is devoid of a zzso zzso analyses revealed a core region spanning zzso to zzso as being essential for zzso zzso Surprisingly, although zzso function, zzso induced by zzso zzso is active selectively during zzso we found the zzso promoter to be expressed predominantly in zzso and to respond not to zzso inhibitor but to zzso zzso In primary, as well as transformed cells, zzso levels of zzso correlated with the zzso status of zzso The zzso promoter was also activated zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso might link zzso function to the generation of cellular zzso and that heightened zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso could contribute to the worse prognosis of certain zzso
