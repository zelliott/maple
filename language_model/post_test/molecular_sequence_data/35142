zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins that provide structural integrity within the skin and heart by resisting zzso zzso Here we reveal the nature of unique hinges within their zzso zzso that provides divergent degrees of flexibility between rigid long and short arms composed of zzso zzso The range of mobility of the two arms about the hinge is revealed by applying the ensemble zzso method to zzso X-ray scattering zzso zzso and zzso adopt zzso shaped zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso mobility about the zzso By contrast zzso exhibits essentially unrestricted mobility by zzso about the zzso Thus the diversity of molecular zzso that can occur about zzso hinges includes zzso shaped zzso zzso turns and fully extended zzso zzso between rigid blocks of zzso zzso This establishes zzso hinges in zzso zzso as a key source of flexibility that may allow sweeping of cellular spaces during assembly of cellular structures and could impart zzso so preventing irreversible damage to zzso and the cell zzso upon exposure to mechanical zzso
