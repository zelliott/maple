It has been shown in a variety of species that genes expressed in zzso zzso evolve zzso which often appears to be the result of positive zzso zzso We investigated the evolution of a family of seven zzso zzso proteins (or zzso in zzso zzso and two closely related zzso More than 30 zzso of a zzso region that harbors the complete, zzso repeated zzso cluster were zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the complete gene cluster from these three species and from zzso zzso confirmed its rapid evolution resulting from gene zzso and gene loss events, numerous zzso acid zzso and zzso in the coding zzso Independent zzso were zzso in the lineages leading to zzso and to zzso and gene loss was zzso in the lineage leading to zzso zzso Comparisons of the ratio of zzso zzso and synonymous zzso divergence revealed that the zzso are among the most rapidly evolving proteins currently known from zzso and that they may evolve under positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated the expression of zzso in flowers of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso play an important role in species with different breeding zzso These results are consistent with a putative function in species recognition, but further analyses of protein function and sequence variation in species with different breeding systems are necessary to reveal the underlying causes for the rapid evolution of zzso
