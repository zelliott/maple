We previously observed that zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene is enhanced in cells zzso by zzso through a serum response element zzso in its zzso zzso We now show that the region of the zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso We also identify a zzso zzso protein in zzso cell nuclear extracts that binds to the zzso strand of the zzso zzso zzso but not to its zzso counterpart or to the zzso coding zzso Competition zzso using zzso with zzso zzso that diminished or eliminated zzso complex formation were used to establish the specificity of this zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso binding protein binds to this region only when it is highly zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso protein specifically interacts with a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso promoter and that this interaction may have a role in the zzso regulation of this zzso
