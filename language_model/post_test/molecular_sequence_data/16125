We have isolated and characterized two kinds of zzso for the chicken cardiac zzso zzso light zzso The sequences of the two zzso are zzso except for a notable divergence in part of the 3' untranslated zzso By analysis of isolated zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso sequences corresponding to the different sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of the two zzso were arranged within a limited part of a single stretch of zzso also the two distinct 3' untranslated regions of the two zzso shared part of the last zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There are two zzso zzso sites available for zzso zzso in the last zzso the first being located at the zzso end of the zzso and the second at 370 zzso downstream from this zzso Together with analysis by zzso zzso zzso the zzso results lead us to conclude that, by the differential use of these two zzso sites, a single gene generates two distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without the zzso half of the last zzso The two zzso appear to zzso the same modified zzso zzso zzso rather than the authentic zzso sequence present about 30 zzso downstream from the zzso attachment zzso This is probably because another consensus G + zzso sequence is present at an appropriate distance from the zzso zzso but not from the zzso zzso The gene for the cardiac zzso zzso light chain has proved to be expressed in zzso muscle and in zzso and anterior zzso zzso muscles, the last of these being characteristic of slow skeletal zzso In these muscles, two kinds of zzso for the cardiac zzso zzso light chain, identical with those in zzso muscle, were expressed and their relative amount in each tissue was almost the same as that in zzso zzso
