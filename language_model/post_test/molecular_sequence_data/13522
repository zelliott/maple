The zzso zzso in zzso zzso candidate tumor zzso gene spans greater than zzso zzso at zzso zzso and encodes a zzso protein of unknown zzso Although zzso is expressed in a number of adult zzso its expression is highest in the brain and we have, therefore, undertaken studies to determine if zzso zzso might contribute to tumors arising zzso zzso or absent zzso protein expression was noted in more than 50% of the thirty brain tumors zzso Although specific zzso in the zzso gene were not identified, a variety of mechanisms appeared to contribute to the altered zzso zzso including zzso loss, zzso zzso of transcripts and zzso loss of zzso In total, the data suggest that zzso zzso may be important in brain tumor zzso
