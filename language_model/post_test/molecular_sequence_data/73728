The gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in the zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso were identified as the structural genes of a novel zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These genes were localized on an zzso zzso zzso which was cloned from a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso library in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was identified on a zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso and zzso genes were localized on a different zzso zzso of zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso and part of zzso zzso were determined, revealing open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso representing zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was organized in one zzso together with a fourth open reading frame zzso of 735 zzso which was located upstream of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso exhibited zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, respectively, to the corresponding gene products from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene exhibited up to zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso from different zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibited up to zzso zzso acid identity to those of zzso zzso A zzso zzso coli strains harboring zzso zzso cloned in zzso zzso converted zzso to zzso via zzso indicating the functional expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso High expression of zzso in zzso coli was achieved with zzso cloned in zzso zzso The resulting zzso strains converted zzso to zzso at a rate of up to zzso zzso per zzso per zzso of zzso Transfer of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and to different zzso zzso which were unable to zzso zzso or zzso as carbon sources, respectively, zzso the ability to grow on these zzso to these zzso
