The properties of a new zzso complex containing two zzso coordination zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso is made with respect to chemical zzso in zzso biological activity in zzso and tumor cells, DNA zzso changes, zzso efficiency, and sequence specificity between this complex and the previously reported complex containing two zzso platinum zzso zzso zzso as well as with their respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso While both zzso complexes are active against zzso cells, the zzso zzso complex zzso has a lower resistance factor than the complex with zzso coordination spheres zzso More importantly, this property is repeated in a human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso studies show that DNA zzso zzso is more efficient for the zzso zzso DNA sequencing studies employing the zzso activity of zzso demonstrate that there are a variety of binding zzso some are common to all complexes and some common to both zzso complexes, while the zzso zzso species also zzso at unique sites, not attacked by any of the other complexes zzso The circular zzso of CT DNA modified by the zzso complex is also unique and is not seen for any of the other zzso
