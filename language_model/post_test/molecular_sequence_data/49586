A DNA zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso to zzso 29 from zzso zzso is zzso together with a real-time zzso zzso for detecting zzso 

zzso and sequencing were used to identify the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence divergence between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be zzso 

The characterization of a novel locus in zzso zzso has allowed a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be zzso 

These findings increase the number of zzso zzso zzso available as alternatives to classical zzso of zzso zzso
