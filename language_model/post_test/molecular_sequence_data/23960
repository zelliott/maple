zzso transport of zzso regulates distribution of sulfur in vascular zzso Here, we describe zzso as an essential component of the zzso transport system that zzso the zzso transport of zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso In a zzso zzso zzso expression system, zzso zzso was hardly zzso with zzso expression alone; however, cells zzso both zzso and zzso showed substantial zzso activity that was considerably higher than with zzso expression zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso was approximately 3 times higher than with zzso zzso In zzso the zzso transport of zzso was restricted in the zzso zzso under conditions of high zzso expression in the roots after sulfur zzso These results suggested that zzso is zzso expressed in the root zzso but its function to reinforce the capacity of the zzso zzso zzso is only essential when zzso zzso is induced by sulfur zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso provides maximum capacity of zzso transport activity, which zzso retrieval of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso cells in the zzso of zzso roots and may contribute to the zzso transport of zzso
