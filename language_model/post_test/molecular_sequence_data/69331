zzso factor Va zzso by activated protein C zzso was evaluated in the presence and absence of zzso zzso and protein zzso Following a zzso incubation with zzso (10 zzso zzso factor Va zzso zzso is completely zzso whereas in the absence of zzso zzso after a zzso zzso the zzso retains zzso of its initial zzso zzso The complete loss of activity of zzso factor Va is associated with the appearance of zzso zzso zzso and 20,000 fragments derived from the heavy chain of the zzso which zzso to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso In the absence of a zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso results in a zzso with reduced zzso No difference is observed in the zzso of the light chain of the zzso by zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso The rate of the zzso of factor Va heavy chain at zzso zzso and zzso as well as the rate of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso were enhanced in the presence of protein zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso of factor Va by zzso at zzso is required for the complete zzso of the zzso
