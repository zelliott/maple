The zzso response element zzso found in the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso gene has been further characterized by zzso and deletion zzso The results indicate that the zzso pair zzso which contains a zzso pair zzso zzso can be further separated into three regions, all three of which are required for elevated zzso level gene zzso These three regions include the zzso and zzso zzso as well as a zzso region consisting of 4 zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso alone mediates zzso zzso by zzso However, when placed together the two zzso restore responsiveness to the zzso Interestingly, the presence of only 1 of the 4 zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso is required for responsiveness to the zzso Point zzso within the ARE indicate that several zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso are required for zzso level gene zzso zzso mobility shift analysis using the ARE as the probe indicates that enhancers found in the zzso zzso Ya and P genes recognize a similar zzso zzso found in crude nuclear extracts from human zzso zzso zzso Further, this complex can be detected in nuclear extracts from rat liver and rat zzso cells but not in mouse zzso zzso cells or in human zzso zzso The zzso complex can also be detected in zzso cells which lack significant levels of zzso zzso Although the rat ARE resembles the human zzso zzso ARE which contains a consensus zzso the zzso change in the core sequence zzso versus zzso eliminates the high affinity zzso motif in the rat zzso The rat ARE forms a zzso complex in zzso zzso and other cells with different properties than zzso
