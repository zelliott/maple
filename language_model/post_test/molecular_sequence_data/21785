The molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced by single zzso acid zzso within the cardiac zzso zzso zzso remains zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso zzso defects of zzso using a zzso mouse model expressing the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 

All zzso mice we examined produced zzso zzso after exercise on a zzso zzso increase in the frequency of zzso zzso was more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso fluorescent labeling and zzso zzso zzso of the specific binding of zzso (a zzso corresponding to the zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed that zzso binds with the zzso sequence of zzso zzso to zzso Introduction of zzso zzso into the zzso increased the affinity of zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso of zzso interactions within zzso showed that tight interaction of the zzso zzso domain is coupled with domain unzipping of the zzso (1 to zzso (2000 to zzso domain pair in an zzso zzso zzso corrected the zzso domain unzipping of the domain switch and stopped the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso causes an zzso tight local zzso interaction within the central domain involving the zzso site, which zzso defective interaction between the zzso and central zzso This results in an erroneous zzso of zzso channel in a zzso state reflecting on the increased zzso spark frequency, which then leads to lethal zzso
