zzso zzso zzso is a protein zzso complex that specifically and efficiently zzso the zzso repeat domain zzso of zzso zzso II and is composed of three zzso of 58, 38, and 32 zzso The zzso is essential in zzso for normal zzso of the zzso and for normal growth and zzso We have now cloned the genes for the two smaller zzso zzso zzso and zzso and found that they form a unique, divergent zzso zzso complex with the previously characterized largest zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein with limited zzso to zzso C, while zzso shows no similarity to other known zzso zzso of the three gene products with each other and zzso activity by means of conventional zzso and zzso affinity columns has verified their participation in the complex in zzso In addition, zzso zzso of each of the genes and all combinations zzso zzso very similar zzso zzso zzso consistent with their involvement in the same function in zzso These zzso and the availability of all of the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso from them will facilitate investigations into zzso zzso and its functional consequences both in zzso and in zzso
