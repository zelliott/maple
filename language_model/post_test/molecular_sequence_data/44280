During the zzso stage of infection, the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso most of the host cell zzso zzso degradation occurs in the zzso zzso zzso and is essential for the survival of the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso I and II, have been isolated from the zzso and shown to make the initial zzso in the zzso zzso We have studied the zzso of these two zzso zzso I is zzso and processed to the mature form soon after the zzso invades the red blood cell, while zzso II synthesis is delayed until later in zzso Otherwise, zzso of the zzso is zzso The zzso are type II integral membrane proteins that are transported through the zzso zzso before zzso to the soluble zzso They are not zzso in zzso despite the presence of several potential zzso zzso zzso maturation appears to require zzso conditions and is zzso inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These compounds are known to inhibit zzso zzso and the zzso activity of zzso but not zzso zzso However, zzso processing is not blocked by other zzso zzso zzso nor by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is also not blocked by zzso zzso zzso This inhibitor profile suggests that unlike most other zzso zzso zzso maturation may not be zzso in zzso but instead could require the action of an unusual processing zzso zzso that block processing are expected to be potent zzso
