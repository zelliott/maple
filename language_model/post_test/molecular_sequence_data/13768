To assess the role of zzso genes other than those zzso zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso we analyzed the distribution of zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso techniques in 63 zzso and 44 zzso patients (all zzso zzso The zzso (N zzso zzso provided a source of controls matched with the patients for zzso (or other markers when zzso We found an increase of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso (the latter was most pronounced among patients with acute zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso The increase of zzso and zzso was due to an increase of zzso and zzso in zzso whereas the association with zzso could be due to linkage zzso with zzso None of these associations were detected in zzso We conclude that in zzso in addition to the association to zzso there are also weaker but distinct associations to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso
