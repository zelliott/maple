The complete zzso sequence of an isolate of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso 3 has been zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the proteins zzso by the two large open reading frames zzso allowed us to carry out comparative and zzso studies on the movement zzso and coat zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison of the zzso revealed a highly zzso basic sequence motif with an zzso zzso structure preceding the zzso motif of the zzso zzso proposed by zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Within this zzso motif a strictly zzso zzso domain is present in all zzso zzso so zzso At the zzso end, prune dwarf virus zzso has an extension not present in other zzso but which is observed in all zzso and zzso suggesting a common zzso or a zzso event in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso of all zzso revealed a highly basic region, part of which resembles the zzso motif that has been characterized in the zzso protein zzso This motif has also been found in the other members of the zzso family, suggesting its involvement in a structural zzso zzso this region is required for zzso in zzso The similarities found in this zzso motif are discussed in terms of this process known as zzso zzso Finally, zzso analysis of both the zzso and zzso proteins revealed a higher relationship of zzso to zzso apple mosaic virus zzso and zzso than any other member of the zzso zzso In that sense, zzso should be considered as a true zzso instead of forming a distinct group of zzso
