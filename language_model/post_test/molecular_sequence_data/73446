A panel of zzso zzso zzso which neutralize human zzso type 11 zzso in the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso and bind zzso zzso particles zzso has been zzso We recently presented evidence that the zzso zzso of the major zzso protein zzso zzso type zzso zzso However, zzso zzso located on the primary zzso sequence also were shown to affect zzso This poses the question whether the zzso is principally centered in the region of zzso or, zzso is comprised of zzso located zzso which come into proximity only upon proper zzso We analyzed the result of numerous zzso located between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso at five positions result in loss of binding for one or more of these zzso by an zzso zzso zzso which measures zzso binding to zzso We demonstrate that binding of these zzso is redirected to zzso zzso which harbor eight type zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Three of these zzso did not affect binding when individually zzso in zzso but yet were still required to transfer binding to zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso for this class of zzso zzso although zzso and requiring zzso assembly for zzso principally lies along a zzso stretch of the zzso major zzso zzso This targets the region for evaluation of the possibility of zzso binding and suggests possibilities for the design of zzso zzso of virus zzso
