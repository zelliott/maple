zzso zzso regulation of pancreatic development is required to advance current efforts in developing beta cell replacement therapies for patients with zzso Current knowledge of key zzso regulators has predominantly come from mouse studies, with rare, naturally occurring zzso establishing their relevance in zzso This study used a combination of zzso analysis and zzso sequencing in 37 zzso patients with permanent zzso diabetes to search for zzso zzso in 29 zzso factor genes important for zzso pancreatic zzso We identified zzso zzso in 7 different genes in 11 unrelated patients and show that zzso and zzso are zzso genes for zzso diabetes, thus confirming their key role in development of the human zzso The similar zzso of the patients with zzso zzso and mice with zzso of a zzso factor gene support there being common steps critical for pancreatic development and validate the use of zzso models for beta cell zzso
