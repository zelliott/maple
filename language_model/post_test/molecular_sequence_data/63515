In the liver, induction of genes zzso zzso involved in de zzso zzso occurs in response to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso factor that regulates expression of these zzso To evaluate the potential role of zzso zzso in its regulation, we used zzso to identify modified zzso In the present paper, we report the detection of multiple zzso sites of zzso expressed in zzso several of which are only observed under zzso zzso zzso of each of these zzso zzso of zzso did not alter its ability to respond to zzso However, zzso of five zzso zzso sites resulted in a major decrease in activity under zzso zzso These zzso zzso are located within a region of zzso zzso acids zzso that is critical for zzso zzso zzso of zzso within this region to an zzso zzso resulted in increased nuclear zzso and activity under zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso activity is regulated by complex zzso zzso patterns involving its zzso regulatory zzso
