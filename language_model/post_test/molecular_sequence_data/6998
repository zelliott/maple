Potential DNA contacts involved in the specific interaction between the zzso coli zzso protein and a zzso zzso containing an zzso mismatch have been examined by zzso interference zzso zzso interference patterns suggest that more than five zzso are involved in zzso interactions between zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso has more contacts on the zzso than on the zzso zzso at both the zzso position of the mismatched G and the zzso position of the zzso A interfere with zzso zzso In addition to these mismatched zzso zzso also contacts zzso on both sides of the zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso were zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso group of GO in zzso contributes to a much tighter binding but weaker zzso activity than is seen with zzso Because zzso is not specifically well recognized by zzso the zzso group of G in zzso is essential for zzso The zzso zzso group present in zzso but absent in zzso is also important for zzso The zzso group of zzso appears not to be required for either binding or zzso activity because zzso is as good a zzso as zzso The zzso zzso is bound and zzso weaker than is the zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities are abolished when the zzso group of A is replaced by zzso as in the zzso zzso When a zzso zzso group is present as in the zzso pair, its binding by zzso is as good as for zzso but no zzso activity is zzso Taken together, our data suggest that DNA sequences zzso to and specific functional groups of mismatched bases are necessary for recognition and zzso by zzso zzso
