T cell receptors zzso exhibit genetic and structural diversity similar to zzso but they have binding affinities that are several orders of magnitude zzso It has been suggested that zzso undergo selection in zzso to maintain lower zzso Here, we show that there is not an inherent genetic or structural limitation on higher zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated in the absence of in zzso selective pressures by using zzso display and selection from a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had greater than zzso higher affinity zzso approximately 9 zzso for the zzso zzso while retaining a high degree of zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso a strong preference was found for zzso that contained Pro or zzso zzso Finally, unlike the zzso zzso a soluble zzso form of a zzso zzso was capable of directly detecting zzso complexes on zzso zzso These findings prove that affinity maturation of zzso is possible and suggest a strategy for engineering zzso that can be used in targeting specific zzso complexes for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
