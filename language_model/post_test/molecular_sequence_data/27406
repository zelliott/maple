A number of studies have shown that genetic variation at zzso alters vulnerability to alcohol zzso The exact identity of the zzso zzso and the relationship of these zzso to other forms of substance use and behavioral illness is, however, zzso 

zzso we zzso 516 individuals from the Iowa zzso Studies, a large zzso case and control adoption study of substance use, at 39 single zzso zzso encompassing the zzso locus and analyzed them with respect to their lifetime history of three common forms of substance use dependence zzso dependence zzso nicotine dependence zzso and zzso dependence zzso in the Iowa zzso Studies and relevant exposure zzso 

Using zzso analysis, we found substantial evidence that both zzso zzso and zzso are significantly related to vulnerability to zzso zzso and CD, with the strongest relationships noted with respect to zzso zzso with earlier studies suggesting exposure is an important step in the development of substance use, we found the inclusion of substance exposure data in our zzso models markedly increased the strength of the genetic associations of zzso zzso with substance zzso Finally, we report that the genetic effects were markedly more pronounced in females than in zzso 

We conclude that genetic variation at or near the zzso locus significantly affects vulnerability not only to zzso but to other forms of substance use including zzso and CD, and that the effects may be sex zzso
