The zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso complex zzso which have several zzso in common, are crucial for zzso zzso Here, we describe an in-depth profiling of zzso modifications zzso on both zzso and zzso from zzso We took a multipronged approach using high-resolution mass zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cumulative zzso identification data, at a false discovery rate zzso allowed us to cover most zzso and zzso zzso sequences to near zzso Additionally, for zzso zzso we identified zzso unique zzso and zzso unique zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso Using a spectral counting approach, we found that the shared zzso zzso is zzso to a significant greater extent in zzso than in zzso Finally, we were able to map for the first time the zzso site in zzso that is related to formation of the zzso complex zzso In general, our combination of tandem affinity enrichment, zzso with different zzso extensive zzso and high-resolution zzso identifies a large number of zzso of zzso and zzso that might aid in future functional studies on these zzso zzso
