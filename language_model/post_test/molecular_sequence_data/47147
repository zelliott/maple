zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso originally isolated from bovine zzso by utilizing an orphan zzso zzso expressed in the human zzso zzso In this paper, we analyzed the tissue distribution of rat and human zzso and their zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Northern zzso In zzso analysis, rat zzso zzso zzso was detected in the central nervous system, and the highest expression was detected in the zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso revealed that rat zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in the anterior lobe of the zzso On the other hand, rat zzso zzso was most abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso while significant levels of expression were widely detected in other zzso In Northern zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso zzso among zzso zzso Human zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso and in the zzso In contrast to the pattern of zzso zzso the highest content of zzso zzso was found in the zzso rather than the zzso zzso in the rat brain, indicating that zzso zzso does not always parallel with mature zzso in tissue zzso The wide distribution of zzso and its zzso suggests that they have various functions not only in the zzso zzso but also in the other zzso
