zzso is a cell surface protein involved in the neural zzso and zzso of the central nervous system of zzso Its theoretical molecular mass, based on the zzso acid sequence translated from the zzso is 58 zzso but in zzso it shows an apparent zzso of 86 zzso zzso is stated to be a zzso and it contains five potential zzso and 96 potential zzso zzso The complete characterization of the primary structure and initial investigations on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from goldfish zzso are zzso The protein was either zzso in zzso in the sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso or zzso after zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso was applied for direct zzso mapping analysis of the zzso zzso Various sample preparation techniques were performed and the mass zzso were recorded in both zzso and zzso zzso
