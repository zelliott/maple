In the zzso there is a large family of zzso genes closely related to zzso The objective of this report was to investigate the organization of the mouse zzso gene family zzso zzso family genes reside on zzso 13 of the mouse zzso The zzso gene family members were localized to a series of overlapping bacterial artificial zzso clones and arranged based on structural zzso Additionally, several new members of the zzso gene family were zzso zzso zzso I zzso was found to be zzso by three closely related zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two previously unidentified mouse zzso for members of the rat zzso family, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were discovered, as were two new members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two new entirely unique members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences predicted from the latter two genes most closely resembled zzso zzso Each of the nine newly discovered genes is expressed in zzso cells of the mouse zzso in a zzso specific zzso In zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene family locus provides new insights into the expansion of the mouse zzso family and new tools for studying the zzso and biology of its zzso
