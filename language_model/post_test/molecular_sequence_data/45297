The tomato zzso gene zzso resistance to races of the leaf zzso fungus zzso zzso that carry the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso tagging using a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso This generated an zzso series of zzso zzso of zzso of which two were found to zzso novel zzso in a screen for zzso affecting zzso zzso function in zzso zzso and molecular analysis of these zzso suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso involving Ds insertions in a defined zzso of zzso zzso was associated with expression of the zzso of zzso upstream of the Ds insertions in these zzso suggesting that truncated zzso proteins were the likely cause of zzso zzso tomato lines zzso zzso zzso with premature stop zzso in positions similar to the Ds insertions also showed zzso indicating that the presence of Ds was not required for interference to zzso Interestingly, interference in these transgenic lines was completely dominant and was associated with a pronounced zzso zzso that was dependent on zzso of zzso zzso and a truncated zzso zzso However, interference with a zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso and did not cause a zzso zzso suggesting that localized restoration of zzso cell death was responsible for the zzso zzso The restricted region in which zzso of zzso results in zzso interference suggests that zzso repeats zzso zzso of zzso may mediate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso may mediate interactions with downstream partner proteins required for zzso zzso or vice zzso
