zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso zzso necessary for the induction of the zzso gene zzso It belongs to the zzso zinc cluster protein family, but contains some striking differences compared with other proteins of this zzso In this report, we show that no zzso element is present in the entire zzso protein which occurs in solution as a zzso and binds also to its zzso sites as a zzso Another important feature of zzso is its unique specificity for single sites occurring naturally as zzso or direct repeats and sharing a common zzso zzso Like most other zzso zzso zzso contacts directly with the zzso zzso and, in addition, the upstream adjacent zzso is required for high affinity zzso We also establish that the zzso regions outside the core play an essential role in tight zzso From our in zzso analysis, we propose an optimal zzso site which is zzso rich zzso
