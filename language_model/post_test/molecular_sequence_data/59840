The zzso disease zzso gene zzso zzso zzso consists of one untranslated zzso and two zzso partially translated as the zzso disease protein zzso zzso has sequence zzso and zzso zzso structure of a growth factor containing a zzso knot zzso which affects zzso cell migration and zzso zzso disease zzso retinal zzso zzso primary retinal zzso zzso retinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso 

Blood was drawn for genetic studies from members of two families to test for zzso gene zzso Sixteen unaffected family members were examined zzso If any retinal zzso were identified, zzso photography and zzso zzso was zzso 

Family A had zzso zzso and family B had zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of 11 offspring of carrier females were zzso three of seven carrier zzso three of three otherwise healthy zzso and one of one otherwise healthy male had peripheral inner retinal vascular zzso The zzso of five offspring of affected males were zzso none of three carrier females and none of two otherwise healthy males had this peripheral retinal zzso 

zzso inner retinal vascular abnormalities similar to zzso zzso of zzso were identified in seven offspring of carriers of zzso gene zzso in two zzso These zzso findings, especially in four genetically healthy zzso strongly support the hypothesis that abnormal zzso may have an adverse zzso zzso effect on normal inner retinal zzso
