The human zzso zzso family consists of several zzso with many associated zzso Here we report the identification of yet another zzso sequence designated zzso This zzso maps 80 zzso zzso to the zzso muscular zzso zzso associated zzso repeats on zzso zzso The zzso structure contains four zzso zzso a putative protein of 434 zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein sequence show zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although the zzso structure shows all functional aspects of a genuine zzso no transcript could be zzso zzso sequences were identified on multiple zzso Since these sequences mutually exhibit a high zzso sequence zzso they presumably belong to a novel zzso of zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso probably represents a zzso zzso expression due to a zzso position effect zzso zzso makes zzso an ideal zzso candidate gene for zzso
