The first step in reverse cholesterol transport is a process by which zzso or zzso zzso removes cholesterol from cells through the action of zzso binding cassette zzso A1 at the plasma zzso However the structure and composition of zzso or zzso zzso in plasma remains zzso We previously obtained a zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognizes zzso in zzso the smallest zzso particle in zzso which we used to establish a zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso from fresh normal plasma using said zzso and analyzed the composition and zzso zzso was zzso but neither zzso nor cholesterol were detected in the zzso zzso Only zzso not zzso particles were observed by electron zzso In zzso zzso no difference in the mobility was observed between the zzso zzso and original plasma zzso or between the zzso and zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso In sandwich zzso using two zzso zzso zzso with intact plasma zzso was observed in zzso using two zzso with distinct zzso but no zzso was observed in zzso using a single zzso and the same phenomenon was observed with zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that plasma zzso is zzso zzso zzso
