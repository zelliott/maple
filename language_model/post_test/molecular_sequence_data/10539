zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the influenza virus zzso zzso introduces both a zzso sorting signal and an zzso signal into the zzso zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso contains eight additional zzso acids at the end of the zzso domain that include a powerful zzso zzso zzso was also sorted efficiently to the zzso surface of zzso canine kidney zzso The simplest explanation for the observation that multiple sorting zzso depend upon the same small zzso acid sequence is that certain zzso zzso signals might also function as zzso sorting zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso or zzso to determine if the zzso and zzso sorting functions can be zzso For zzso zzso the same sequence positions were important for both zzso sorting and zzso but the two functions responded differently to individual zzso acid zzso indicating that they were zzso For zzso the zzso sorting signal required the same zzso as the zzso zzso but did not share any other zzso Thus, even when zzso sorting signals that depend on zzso overlap or are zzso with zzso signals, the two sorting processes are sensitive to different characteristics of the zzso
