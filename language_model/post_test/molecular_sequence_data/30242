An zzso segment of DNA from the zzso zzso region of the zzso coli zzso which zzso the zzso of a zzso devoid of zzso 3 activity, has been zzso Eight open reading frames were identified which are arranged in a zzso unit; all open reading frames were transcribed and translated in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso acid sequences revealed that one of them, open reading frame 5 zzso exhibits significant sequence similarity to zzso regions of the large zzso from zzso zzso Two of the open reading frames zzso zzso code for proteins apparently carrying zzso clusters of the zzso zzso zzso The product of one of the open reading zzso zzso displays extensive sequence similarity with protein G from the zzso electron transport zzso zzso and zzso on the other hand, are extremely zzso proteins with nine and six putative zzso zzso zzso Over a limited zzso sequence stretch, bordered by putative zzso areas, zzso and zzso exhibit zzso with zzso 4 and 1 of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso therefore, appears to comprise genes for zzso carriers linking zzso zzso to zzso reduction and for a zzso of zzso unique zzso
