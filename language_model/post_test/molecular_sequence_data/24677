zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso metabolism are zzso In organisms that zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso catalyze the attachment of zzso zzso to the folate zzso In this study we isolated zzso coding a zzso and three zzso of zzso from zzso zzso The function of each zzso was demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso deficient in zzso or zzso activity, and by measuring in zzso zzso incorporation into zzso or zzso zzso is present exclusively in the zzso making this compartment the sole site of synthesis of zzso in the plant zzso In contrast, zzso is present as distinct zzso in the zzso the zzso and the zzso Each zzso is zzso by a separate zzso a situation that is unique among zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is in agreement with the predominance of zzso zzso derivatives and the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso the zzso and the zzso Thus, the combination of zzso with these zzso reactions can supply each compartment with the zzso folate zzso required for the reactions of C1 zzso Also, the zzso of zzso in the plant cell suggests that the transported forms of folate are zzso
