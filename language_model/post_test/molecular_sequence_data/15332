Nearly all zzso zzso dissolved organic nitrogen and part of the particulate organic nitrogen in the deep sea are present in zzso zzso and so far the mechanisms of zzso of these types of nitrogen have not been zzso The zzso family is the second largest family in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and includes most zzso from animals and only one zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we characterized the novel zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity and zzso ability from the newly described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with 205 zzso acid zzso and a molecular mass of zzso zzso It has the same zzso zzso at the four zinc zzso as zzso and very low levels of identity zzso to other zzso indicating that it is a novel zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso had broad specificity and much higher zzso activity than the bacterial zzso zzso To our knowledge, it is the first reported zzso in the zzso zzso Although it displayed very low activity with zzso zzso had strong zzso ability and played a synergistic role with zzso in collagen zzso It can be speculated that zzso zzso interacts with other zzso in its in zzso zzso zzso and that it may play an important role in the degradation of zzso zzso organic zzso
