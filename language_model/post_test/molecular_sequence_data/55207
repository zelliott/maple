Various organisms produce zzso in response to high temperature and other zzso The function of heat shock zzso including small heat shock protein zzso in stress tolerance is not fully zzso To improve our understanding of zzso we isolated zzso from zzso zzso alignments and zzso analysis reveal this to be a zzso class I zzso zzso expressed in zzso leaf and stem zzso under 40 zzso treatment, and was zzso by heat stress and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso tolerance to heat and zzso stresses by increased seed zzso rate, root zzso and zzso zzso activities compared with zzso zzso These results support the positive role of zzso in response to heat stress in zzso 

The zzso of zzso enhanced tolerance to heat and zzso stress in transgenic zzso
