zzso zzso mediates the addition of a zzso zzso tag zzso to bacterial proteins translated from zzso without zzso stop zzso This process involves both zzso and zzso functions of zzso and targets the zzso proteins for zzso By designing an zzso zzso that adds a zzso tag zzso that does not result in rapid degradation, we show that tagging of a model protein zzso from an zzso without stop zzso can be detected both in zzso and in zzso We also use this zzso to demonstrate that zzso zzso at clusters of rare zzso zzso in zzso is sufficient to recruit and activate the zzso zzso tagging zzso An essential requirement for tagging at rare zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso supplemental zzso suppresses zzso and depleting the available pool of zzso enhances tagging and reveals tagging caused by single rare zzso zzso zzso tagging at sites corresponding to rare zzso appears to involve zzso action at an internal zzso site rather than at the 3' end of a zzso zzso
