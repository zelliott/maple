zzso zzso zzso injections protect zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso rats against experimental zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso with the retinal S zzso zzso in contrast zzso F1 rats develop zzso following transfer of zzso zzso zzso cells from rats zzso with zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate that the ability of zzso cells from rats protected against zzso to transfer the disease into zzso F1 rats was considerably zzso These zzso cells neither produced zzso zzso nor zzso zzso but exhibited zzso for zzso In contrast, zzso cells from diseased rats easily transferred zzso into zzso F1 rats, produced significant zzso and zzso levels but barely exhibited zzso for zzso zzso protected rats predominantly produced zzso zzso zzso while diseased rats produced zzso zzso zzso and the increase in expression of zzso class II molecules on B cells was higher in protected rats than in diseased zzso These data suggest that zzso to exert a protective effect, zzso must act at an early stage of differentiation of precursors of zzso specific T cells, and zzso this effect is related to the preferential zzso of zzso cells to the detriment of zzso zzso zzso Finally, these results indicate that zzso of zzso cells protect from a zzso zzso zzso
