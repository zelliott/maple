zzso release is triggered by zzso zzso binding to an unknown zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of synaptic and other zzso zzso has been proposed to mediate zzso membrane interactions during neurotransmitter zzso Here we test this hypothesis using the giant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which because of its unusually large size and well established physiology is uniquely suited for zzso zzso zzso We find that injection of peptides from the C2 zzso of zzso into zzso giant zzso terminals rapidly and zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso Our data are consistent with these peptides competitively blocking release after synaptic zzso zzso and indicate that zzso probably zzso neurotransmitter release by regulating the interaction of zzso with an zzso zzso
