Using an extraction procedure that minimized zzso followed by gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the present study zzso showed the presence of multiple zzso of zzso in the zzso of pregnant zzso Four zzso zzso were isolated zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso They had a similar migration pattern on zzso zzso and showed no significant difference in biological zzso zzso separation of the reduced and zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso each contained multiple zzso molecules which showed zzso of the zzso whereas zzso contained mostly a single zzso zzso with only slight zzso zzso zzso was thus considered likely to be the major form of zzso stored in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso contained 22 zzso zzso in the zzso and 29 zzso in the zzso with a total molecular mass of zzso zzso It was thus equivalent to zzso zzso designated by Sherwood and zzso zzso
