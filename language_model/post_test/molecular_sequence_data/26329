zzso proteins zzso are a diverse family of zzso proteins that zzso with zzso in zzso Recently a number of novel approaches have been used to learn more about the functions of zzso during brain development, zzso zzso of zzso and their zzso in the developing brain, comparisons of zzso between species to learn potential fundamental zzso zzso analysis of changes in zzso in zzso cell lines, and sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data allow us to assign roles to zzso which are abundant in the developing brain, and to develop models for future zzso Four zzso are particularly abundant in the developing brain: zzso the high and zzso weight forms of zzso and juvenile zzso zzso is the only zzso to be found consistently in extending processes in both the developing and adult brain, making it a likely regulator of zzso zzso zzso weight zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso weight zzso may be able to regulate zzso zzso to make processes more zzso during development and in adult brain regions where zzso is zzso zzso zzso may be regulated by zzso regulation of the expression of zzso forms with different binding affinities to zzso zzso weight zzso is zzso into zzso by the selective transport of its zzso This allows rapid and local regulation of zzso zzso
