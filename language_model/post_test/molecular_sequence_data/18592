zzso zzso are defined as proteins that assist the zzso assembly of other zzso structures in zzso but which are not components of these structures when they are carrying out their normal biological zzso There are numerous families of protein that fit this definition of molecular zzso the most ubiquitous of which are the zzso and the zzso families, both of which are required for the correct folding of nascent zzso chains and thus essential genes for cell zzso The zzso genes of zzso coli were the first zzso genes to be discovered, within an zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso that function together in the correct folding of nascent zzso zzso The identification of multiple zzso genes in zzso only one of which is zzso with a zzso zzso has led to debate about the functions of their zzso zzso especially as the essential copies are surprisingly often not the zzso zzso Comparisons of these protein sequences reveals a consistent functional zzso and identifies an zzso zzso family, which may zzso the folding of zzso involved in zzso acid synthesis and thus provide a unique target for the development of a new class of zzso zzso zzso
