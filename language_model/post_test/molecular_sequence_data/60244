The zzso factor zzso is a circulating hormone that binds to specific zzso zzso receptors in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced and characterized specifically to study the properties of the zzso zzso The zzso bound to the zzso zzso in zzso crude membrane preparations with high affinity zzso zzso for zzso zzso and 90 zzso for zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso The specificity of binding was confirmed by chemical zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the putative zzso was inhibited in the presence of a zzso excess of zzso human zzso but not by the same excess of human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex revealed a molecular mass of zzso zzso which remained unchanged upon zzso The size and the lack of zzso structure of the zzso is similar to the features reported for the zzso zzso In this regard both, the zzso and the zzso zzso are different from the zzso and the zzso growth zzso 1 zzso This observation supports the zzso of this new factor not only toward potential target zzso but also as regards zzso zzso
