The zzso zzso zzso a zzso fever agent, zzso the zzso immune response through zzso zzso zzso zzso switching results from sequential expression of genes for zzso outer membrane proteins known as variable major proteins zzso of the 25 zzso that have been identified for the zzso strain, zzso 7 and 21 have been studied in greatest zzso In the present study, an zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso from a zzso 21 infection in zzso zzso cells were bound by zzso zzso specific for zzso as well as zzso specific for zzso In Western blots zzso the zzso had a single zzso that was zzso with zzso zzso representing both zzso The gene zzso this zzso zzso was cloned and characterized by restriction mapping and sequence analysis to determine the likely zzso zzso Whereas the zzso end of zzso was identical to that of zzso its 3' end and zzso sequences were identical to the 3' end of zzso Unlike other zzso genes examined thus far, the zzso gene existed only in an expressed zzso a silent, storage form of the gene was not zzso We conclude that the zzso gene was created by an zzso zzso between the formerly expressed zzso gene and a silent zzso zzso This finding suggests that the lack of zzso between zzso which is usually observed, results from zzso against zzso possessing zzso zzso rather than from a switching mechanism that excludes partial gene zzso
