The binding of the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso proteins C, A, and zzso to zzso small nuclear zzso zzso was zzso Assembly of zzso zzso from bean and soybean and a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso in zzso egg extracts was zzso The ability to bind proteins was analyzed by zzso with zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso The only sequence essential for binding of the zzso proteins was the zzso loop sequence in the zzso hairpin of zzso Further analysis suggested that protein C binds directly to the loop and that the assembly of proteins A and zzso into the zzso requires mainly zzso zzso zzso C apparently recognizes a specific zzso sequence rather than a secondary structural element in the zzso
