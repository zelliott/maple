zzso plant pathogens zzso zzso molecules to establish disease on their zzso and plants in turn use immune receptors to try to intercept these zzso The tomato immune zzso zzso zzso resistance to race 1 strains of the zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the corresponding zzso zzso remained unknown thus zzso By zzso population zzso sequencing, a single zzso sequence stretch was identified that only occurs in race 1 zzso and subsequent zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso plants revealed only a single highly expressed zzso in this region, designated zzso (for zzso on zzso zzso zzso analyses confirmed that zzso activates zzso resistance and demonstrated that zzso markedly contributes to zzso zzso not only on tomato but also on zzso Interestingly, zzso is zzso to a widespread family of plant zzso zzso Besides plants, zzso proteins were only found in the bacterial plant pathogen zzso zzso and the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso with the presence of zzso within a flexible zzso region, strongly suggests that zzso acquired zzso from plants through horizontal gene zzso zzso by transient expression we show that also the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso In line with this zzso zzso was found to mediate resistance toward zzso zzso in tomato, showing that this immune zzso is involved in resistance against multiple zzso zzso
