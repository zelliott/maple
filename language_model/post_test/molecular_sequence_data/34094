For the rapid detection of zzso zzso which is associated with human zzso zzso and zzso zzso we developed a duplex zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso sequences of 52 zzso zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso Two zzso primer pairs targeting zzso zzso gene and zzso were designed for duplex zzso detection of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso duplex zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and the minimum zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA which zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

The high specificity and sensitivity of the zzso make it suitable for rapid detection of zzso zzso 

This zzso duplex zzso method provides a zzso simple, and reliable alternative to conventional methods to identify zzso zzso and may have applications in both clinical and environmental zzso
