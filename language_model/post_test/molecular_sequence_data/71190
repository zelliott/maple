The activity of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso marine snail zzso zzso has been studied on zzso zzso receptors on bovine zzso cells and at the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso response in bovine adrenal zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso log zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showing competitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso by 56 zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso had no effect at the zzso junction over the concentration range zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are known to contain the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso response of bovine zzso cells is not inhibited by zzso indicating that zzso zzso receptors are not zzso We propose that zzso zzso interacts selectively with the functional zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso response in bovine zzso zzso
