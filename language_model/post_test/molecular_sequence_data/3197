zzso deletion of zzso may impair its zzso zzso capability and alter its zzso Here, we compare our newly generated zzso gene zzso zzso mice to our previously reported zzso mice to understand further the relationship between the size of a truncated zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso The zzso zzso produces a premature stop zzso six zzso acids zzso downstream of the last zzso of mouse zzso zzso 24 zzso to zzso zzso of human zzso zzso transcripts were 3- and zzso more abundant than zzso wild type and zzso transcripts in the zzso Likewise, zzso zzso rates of zzso were zzso higher than those of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso rates and higher liver zzso contents than both zzso zzso zzso and zzso wild type mice zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso as dense high density zzso zzso Moreover, despite its high zzso rates, zzso was barely zzso in zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso and zzso dramatically increased plasma levels of zzso as well as zzso but caused no change in plasma zzso zzso Finally, the birth rate of zzso zzso zzso from zzso of zzso was zzso lower than that of zzso from zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso of zzso and zzso produced viable zzso zzso but zzso zzso produced no zzso Together, these results demonstrate in zzso that the zzso zzso segment zzso zzso plays a critical role, not only in supporting zzso zzso and in modulating zzso of zzso zzso but also in normal mouse embryonic zzso
