A simple and versatile system has been developed using a new cloning zzso which can serve as a vehicle for zzso DNA fragments, which direct the expression of zzso zzso into the zzso gene on the zzso zzso The system is based on zzso coli zzso zzso which contain the DNA fragment, cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso The zzso gene was modified using synthetic zzso so that it contained several unique restriction sites into which DNA, directing the expression of zzso zzso could be zzso DNA was integrated into the zzso zzso zzso at zzso by transferring the zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso and allowing zzso zzso to occur between the cloned and zzso zzso zzso The zzso were used to integrate zzso sequences into the zzso zzso zzso which directed the expression of zzso toxin zzso C and the zzso zzso zzso The expression of both zzso was detected by Western zzso
