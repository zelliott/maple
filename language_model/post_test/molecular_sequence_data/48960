Small zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso of certain zzso such as the third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can cross the cell membrane through a zzso zzso These zzso molecules have been used as zzso zzso to introduce biologically active cargo molecules such as DNA, peptides or proteins into zzso Using these zzso zzso we have developed an efficient and simple method to increase zzso zzso gene delivery and protein expression in zzso and in zzso Here, we show that zzso peptides increase viral cell entry, improve gene expression at reduced zzso of virus and improve efficacy of zzso relevant genes in zzso
