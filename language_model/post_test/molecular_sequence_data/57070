New trap zzso zzso and zzso have been developed to trap genes in zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso The zzso addition signal of the zzso zzso II zzso gene was removed from these zzso so that they needed to trap an zzso zzso signal for expression of the zzso zzso The frequency of zzso events of these zzso was about five times higher than with the zzso containing the zzso zzso and only one copy of the trap zzso was integrated in most zzso Four out of five zzso regions of the integrated zzso in zzso cell lines were found to be novel zzso zzso suggesting that this method is efficient for zzso genes in zzso zzso In two cases zzso large deletions or zzso spanning more than 10 zzso were found in the zzso region of the trap zzso introduced by zzso This result suggests that zzso observed in zzso with a zzso zzso could be due to the disruption of a gene adjacent to the trapped zzso but not of the trapped zzso
