The zzso domain is described as a highly zzso zzso motif of approximately 60 zzso acids found at the zzso end of zinc finger zzso zzso Although no specific biological function has been attributed to the zzso domain, its predicted zzso secondary structure led to the suggestion that this domain may mediate zzso zzso A zzso zzso screen identified members of two zzso domain protein families that interact with the zzso domain of the zinc finger protein zzso The interacting zzso protein represents the family of zzso zzso zinc finger zzso whereas the novel zzso protein establishes a new family of genes that zzso an isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso domain proteins may form zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding studies confirmed the associations of zzso and zzso with zzso and established the zzso domain as a selective zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein associations might therefore represent a new regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso
