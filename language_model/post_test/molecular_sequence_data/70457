The signal recognition particle zzso is a zzso required for targeting a subset of nascent zzso proteins to the zzso zzso zzso Of the six zzso zzso the most highly zzso is zzso a modular protein consisting of an zzso zzso domain of unknown function, a central zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso domain implicated in the recognition of both signal sequences and zzso zzso To identify regions of zzso that interact with other zzso zzso or regulatory zzso we carried out systematic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso principally using a zzso zzso zzso Of the 35 zzso zzso 13 are unable to support growth, two zzso zzso five zzso zzso and 15 produce no discernible zzso The lethal and conditional zzso map throughout the protein to several zzso regions, confirming that these motifs play critical roles in zzso zzso The effects of the zzso zzso are analyzed with reference to the recently determined zzso structures of the zzso domain and the intact protein from a zzso zzso
