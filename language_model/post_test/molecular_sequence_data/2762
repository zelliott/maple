The zzso transcripts of zzso zzso gene zzso coding for the H zzso of the zzso center, and of genes zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso Open reading frame zzso upstream of structural gene zzso is transcribed as a zzso zzso Gene zzso itself is transcribed as two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso bean zzso protection analysis shows that the zzso transcripts have different zzso zzso within open reading frame zzso and a unique zzso termination signal within open reading frame zzso The lifetimes of the zzso messages, as determined by an oxygen blockade of transcription, were 10 and 12 zzso for the large and small zzso zzso zzso An expression zzso carrying a zzso zzso gene was used to select promoters in DNA stretches upstream of the zzso of each of these zzso zzso resistance was expressed in zzso coli, using as a promoter a zzso stretch upstream of the small zzso zzso but not from a zzso stretch upstream of the large zzso zzso The promoter for the small zzso designated zzso is thought to zzso in its zzso and zzso regions a zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso The region upstream of the large message zzso contains a sequence similar in its zzso and zzso regions to promoter sequences recognized by the zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso This is designated as promoter zzso is proposed to be strictly regulated by light intensity and by oxygen tension while zzso would be less sensitive to these zzso
