zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in a variety of biological processes during zzso Its biological functions are closely associated with characteristic zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of a zzso counterpart of zzso zzso zzso and its functional importance in zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso preference for zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso a highly frequent modification of zzso in the zzso of zzso as well as other zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that zzso showed a distinct zzso expression pattern in the developing zzso zzso During the zzso zzso strong expression was observed along the body axis including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso with specific zzso zzso led to a marked decrease in the zzso and amount of zzso in the zzso zzso with the preferential expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso defects exemplified by a zzso bent trunk and a curled and/or zzso tail, largely due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso muscle differentiation in zzso Furthermore, the zzso projection of spinal motor zzso which extended zzso at the interface between the zzso and individual zzso was also observed in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso formed by zzso is essential for zzso muscle differentiation and motor zzso guidance in zzso zzso
