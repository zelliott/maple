zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are two important zzso derived from the precursor protein zzso zzso involved in several central nervous system zzso functions including pain zzso Since the actual form of human zzso in zzso is not fully zzso we studied the structure of zzso from human brain tissue and zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from human brain and zzso samples by affinity zzso combined with zzso Mass zzso was used for the identification and characterization of the zzso The total zzso zzso was detected as zzso zzso tissue for the brain and zzso zzso for the pooled zzso sample after the zzso zzso by zzso The presence of two different forms of mature zzso zzso and zzso and a possible zzso zzso zzso zzso were confirmed by both zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso methods used in this study were highly sensitive and suitable for identification of actual chemical structures and zzso of very small amounts of peptides in biological zzso The present findings may help further for search for new treatment of zzso pain, which is often poorly managed by current zzso
