We examined life history traits and zzso zzso of both sexual and zzso zzso zzso species to determine ecological and zzso attributes during the evolution of zzso in this zzso We reconstructed a molecular zzso of eight Japanese species using the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso of the zzso DNA zzso and compared the sex ratio, zzso period, and egg number zzso of each species within a species group by rearing them in the zzso Habitat preference was also analyzed from both collection and literature zzso The reconstructed molecular zzso suggested that zzso evolved independently multiple times in this zzso There were three clusters in the tree, in each of which the zzso leg, zzso and zzso zzso of females was similar or zzso this suggested that zzso in the same cluster were sister zzso There was no relationship between sexual mode and life history traits or habitat zzso These results suggest that sexual and asexual species use different zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were in the same cluster and zzso of the first two were similar while that of the last was zzso reduced, we hypothesized that zzso occurred in this order and that zzso are reduced and eventually lost during the course of zzso zzso
