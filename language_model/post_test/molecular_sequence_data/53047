Several approaches are presently being developed for global zzso characterization that are based upon the analysis of zzso zzso resulting from zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso methods for zzso analysis are needed that provide for sample zzso higher resolution zzso and direct zzso with mass zzso In this work, methods for the zzso zzso zzso focusing zzso separation of peptides have been developed that provide for simultaneous sample concentration and separation according to zzso zzso zzso Under typical zzso zzso conditions, peptides are concentrated approximately zzso and peptides present at zzso 1 zzso zzso were zzso using conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso of peptides provided much faster zzso of zzso points compared with conventional zzso focusing in zzso Very small differences in zzso zzso points zzso approximately zzso could be zzso zzso zzso zzso for complex zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were obtained and showed significant improvement over those obtained using zzso zone zzso and packed zzso zzso liquid zzso
