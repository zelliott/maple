The relationship between zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso gene and resistance and zzso to persistent zzso zzso caused by bovine leukemia virus zzso was zzso zzso 2 of the zzso gene was cloned from animals with zzso zzso previously found to be associated with resistance and zzso to zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of the zzso acids zzso zzso at putative zzso binding zzso 70 and 71 only in zzso zzso associated with resistance to zzso This correlation was confirmed in a case control study zzso zzso 26) using an zzso zzso chain reaction for the detection of zzso at zzso zzso These results provide a molecular basis for zzso gene control of resistance and zzso to zzso and suggest that the cellular immune response is important in preventing the in zzso spread of zzso zzso
