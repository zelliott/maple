Little is yet known about the biological and zzso properties of the zzso zzso of zzso (a zzso and zzso zzso Mouse zzso 2 zzso 2; zzso zzso is a zzso surface protein involved in zzso zzso We produced zzso proteins containing the zzso domain of zzso 2 in both insect cells and in zzso The protein produced in insect cells zzso zzso contained a signal sequence followed by the zzso and zzso zzso it was zzso from the medium of zzso zzso zzso A bacterial construct containing the zzso domain was produced in zzso coli as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the D domain of the bacterial construct zzso with zzso bound to the zzso surface of zzso zzso Using zzso in the range of 1 to 5 zzso both zzso proteins strongly inhibited zzso binding and zzso the zzso protein exhibited a somewhat greater extent of zzso zzso 75 versus approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for each of the five charged zzso within the zzso loop of zzso 2 revealed a critical importance for the zzso acid at position zzso zzso of both zzso proteins to the egg was inhibited by the function blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited by a zzso analogue of, and with an zzso zzso the zzso loop of zzso zzso
