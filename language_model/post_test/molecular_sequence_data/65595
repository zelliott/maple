Human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso are genetically distinct viruses that each can cause zzso zzso 1 million people are infected with both zzso and zzso Additionally, these two viruses use the same zzso and zzso and can therefore zzso the same target cell zzso To explore potential genetic zzso we first examined whether zzso from zzso and zzso can be zzso into the same zzso We used modified zzso viruses that each contained a green fluorescent protein gene zzso with a different zzso zzso Thus, a functional zzso could be zzso via zzso which was used to detect the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was detected in approximately zzso of the infection events, which was zzso lower than the zzso zzso zzso We isolated and characterized 54 zzso zzso clones and determined that all of them contained zzso with zzso zzso We then mapped the general structures of the zzso viruses and characterized the zzso junctions by DNA zzso We observed several different zzso patterns, including those that had crossovers only in zzso The most common hybrid zzso had zzso long terminal zzso Although zzso crossovers in the viral sequences were also zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates that zzso and zzso can zzso albeit at low zzso These observations indicate that multiple factors are likely to restrict the generation of viable hybrid zzso and zzso zzso However, considering the large zzso human population and the high viral load in patients, these rare events could provide the basis for the generation of novel human zzso zzso
