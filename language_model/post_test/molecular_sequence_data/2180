The linked fetal zzso genes (the G zzso and A zzso zzso were cloned from Japanese individuals with three different zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences of the segment spanning from zzso to the 3' zzso region of each zzso gene revealed that zzso differences are located at 43 positions and a stretch of simple zzso or zzso zzso Almost half of the zzso changes could be accounted for by gene conversion between the G zzso and A zzso zzso We found that gene conversion had created the zzso zzso site just downstream of the A zzso coding zzso Association of the zzso zzso site with the zzso zzso site suggests that the region containing these two sites was derived from that of the linked G zzso gene through a gene conversion zzso The zzso sequences obtained here are identical to those of the zzso fetal zzso genes of the same zzso with the exception of some sequence changes in the hot spots of zzso These results indicate that the sequence zzso of the zzso genes can be classified into three major categories according to zzso zzso The possible mechanisms of generation of the zzso of the zzso gene sequences are zzso
