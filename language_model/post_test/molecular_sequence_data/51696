Recent reports on the possible contribution of the zzso zzso domain zzso of type III intermediate filament zzso proteins to IF assembly have been zzso To examine the importance and role of this domain, we have therefore engineered a zzso zzso zzso zzso to code for a zzso zzso and have used it in combination with zzso and zzso expression zzso Here we show that zzso zzso isolated from zzso bacteria zzso zzso when used for assembly in zzso forms zzso loosely packed zzso By zzso we demonstrate that this zzso zzso assembles at an even higher rate and into longer zzso than zzso zzso In zzso zzso by forced expression in zzso type III zzso cultured zzso cells, zzso zzso was also recovered in short zzso structures, in zzso and in small as well as large zzso zzso zzso that did not reveal any IF zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso zzso structures formed from the zzso zzso were seen not only in the zzso but also in the nucleus, indicating a role of the tail in higher order organization and zzso of the zzso IF zzso
