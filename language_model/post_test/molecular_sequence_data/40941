Four different bacterial strains were isolated from pulp and paper mill sludge in which one zzso isolate zzso having higher capability to remove color and zzso was identified as zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of process parameters for zzso was initially performed to select growth factors which were further substantiated by zzso approach in which seven factors, % zzso % black zzso zzso zzso temperature, stirring and zzso size, at two levels, applying zzso zzso array were zzso zzso color was removed at pH 8, temperature zzso stirring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size and zzso black zzso After zzso zzso increase in color and zzso removal from zzso and zzso respectively, indicated significance of zzso approach in zzso and zzso of zzso in pulp and paper mill zzso zzso involved in the process of zzso of zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also evaluated for toxicity by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso 36 as model zzso which indicated zzso reduction after treatment by zzso
