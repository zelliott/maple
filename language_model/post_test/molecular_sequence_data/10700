zzso degradation in human zzso disc and zzso cartilage has been studied by using zzso zzso specific for the zzso degradation products generated by zzso within the zzso domain at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of extracts of zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso cartilage demonstrated age-related patterns in the abundance of both degradation zzso In all three zzso the zzso zzso was present at very low levels in young individuals but increased in abundance with zzso In the disc zzso the abundance of this degradation product zzso off in the zzso for cartilage this occurred in early zzso Despite these zzso differences, the levels attained in adults were comparable for the three zzso In contrast, the zzso degradation product exhibited zzso differences in the variation of its abundance with zzso Whereas this degradation product increased with age in zzso zzso and zzso cartilage and had zzso off by adulthood, in nucleus zzso it was present in greatest abundance in young individuals and decreased to very low levels with zzso zzso of discs exhibiting various degrees of zzso did not reveal any differences in the levels of the zzso and zzso zzso products that could not be accounted for by differences in zzso In adults the product of zzso action was much more abundant in zzso cartilage than in either of the disc zzso despite the age-related increase also observed for zzso zzso Analysis of tissue extracts with an zzso recognizing the zzso domain of zzso identified two major degradation products whose abundance and size were correlated with the fragments detected by the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso at the zzso and zzso sites are zzso important events in zzso zzso in both zzso cartilage and zzso disc in zzso zzso the two zzso systems act independently and exhibit differences in the degree to which they contribute to zzso degradation in these zzso
