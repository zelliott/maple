The zzso region zzso was prepared from pig zzso cartilage zzso and the zzso acid sequence was zzso The zzso had two zzso one zzso sequence was zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso and a second zzso sequence zzso 370 zzso acids in total) was found to arise due to alternate zzso by the signal zzso The zzso zzso were zzso by examining their zzso with a series of zzso It was found that the zzso zzso on loop A was of the zzso type, while that on loop B was of the complex zzso No zzso was detected between the zzso zzso on loop zzso and any of the zzso The location of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was determined by zzso degradation of the immobilized zzso zzso The released zzso acid derivatives were collected and tested for the presence of zzso to zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and sequencing yields, the zzso chains are attached to zzso zzso 352 and zzso There is no zzso at zzso This site is not in fact in zzso but about 16 zzso acid zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of the structure of the zzso chain from the zzso and from the zzso domain of pig zzso cartilage zzso was made by separation on zzso gels of the zzso arising from zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso maps suggests that the zzso chains from both parts of the zzso zzso have the same zzso
