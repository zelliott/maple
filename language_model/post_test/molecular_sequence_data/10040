The promoter region of the human zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso The cloned segment contains two first zzso that were earlier identified and named zzso zzso and zzso These were found to be separated by approximately 800 zzso The minimal promoter region was identified upstream to the zzso zzso zzso by transient zzso and no promoter activity was found in the region in between zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso starts at a single site which is then processed to generate zzso of the zzso The promoter sequence is G and C rich and contains neither zzso box, nor apparent zzso zzso although a partially matched zzso sequence was identified just downstream to the minimal zzso
