Recent reports that zzso basic protein zzso can be zzso and contains specific sites that bind zzso and zzso zzso have suggested an zzso to the properties of zzso zzso Comparisons of pairs of sequences between these two proteins yielded two regions of zzso between zzso and the zzso toxin B zzso zzso zzso and one region of zzso with the zzso toxin A zzso zzso zzso The matching sites within zzso B consisted of a 17 zzso acid zzso sequence zzso zzso in zzso B and zzso zzso in zzso zzso p less than zzso and an 11 zzso span zzso zzso in zzso B and sequence zzso in zzso p less than zzso The zzso site within zzso A corresponded to an 11 zzso span zzso zzso in zzso A and zzso in zzso zzso p less than zzso Since portions of the zzso toxin sequence are virtually identical to sections of the sequence in zzso coli zzso the zzso is also valid for the same sequences in this zzso The highly zzso behavior of zzso that is related to the induction of experimental allergic zzso may be paralleled by comparable neural pathology from the zzso regions of zzso zzso
