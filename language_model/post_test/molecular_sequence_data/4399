To decipher how the synthesis of zzso zzso responds to environmental cues, the response of three zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoters was zzso under different zzso Two of these promoters are upstream of structural genes zzso and zzso for individual zzso of the zzso zzso respiratory zzso The third promoter is that for the zzso zzso which encodes two zzso zzso of unknown function, zzso zzso and zzso zzso extension analysis identified a single zzso zzso start site for each zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso as a measure of promoter activity, zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso promoters was approximately twofold higher when cells were grown at high zzso oxygen tensions than under low zzso oxygen or zzso zzso zzso Analysis of promoter function using specific host zzso indicated that loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a small, but zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso when cells are grown at zzso zzso However, neither the delta zzso zzso nor zzso in sequences related to a consensus target site for the zzso coli zzso protein increased function of any of these three promoters to that seen under zzso conditions in zzso zzso From this we conclude that zzso is not solely responsible for reduced zzso of these three zzso zzso genes under low oxygen or zzso zzso When activity of these three promoters was monitored after cells were shifted from zzso zzso conditions to a zzso oxygen atmosphere, it took several cell zzso for zzso levels to increase to those found in zzso zzso oxygen zzso From these results, it appears that activity of these promoters is also regulated by a stable zzso whose synthesis or function responds slowly to the presence of high oxygen zzso
