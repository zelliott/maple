The zzso gene of the zzso a zzso has been cloned and zzso The coding region contains a segment of repeats zzso to the segment of repeats in the gene of another zzso the zzso and different from the segments of repeats in the genes of higher zzso The repeats lengths in the two zzso are zzso and except for a single zzso of a block of repeats in the zzso alone, the number of repeats is the zzso However, the zzso consensus sequences of the repeats differ between the two species at 3 out of 39 zzso zzso The repeats therefore appear to have been modified by a correction process that led toward zzso in the repeats of each species while permitting divergence between the two zzso The correction process, an example of concerted evolution, has taken place zzso between adjacent zzso The numerous differences between the segments of repeats of higher primates and the segments of repeats of lower animals reveal a zzso in the evolutionary processes acting on the zzso
