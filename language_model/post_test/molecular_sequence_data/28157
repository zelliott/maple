Seven genes coding for two different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been cloned from zzso and bacterial zzso Using zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to zzso to their zzso genes in a zzso zzso The high degree of similarity zzso between zzso of bacterial and zzso origin suggests a horizontal transfer of a primordial zzso pathway, probably from a bacterial cell to a zzso zzso zzso of the proteins in zzso coli has allowed further study of the mechanism of action of these important zzso
