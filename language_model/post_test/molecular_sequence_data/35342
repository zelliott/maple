zzso B virus zzso places a substantial health burden on zzso Here, we investigated genetic diversity of zzso zzso circulating in 4 countries of sub-Saharan Africa using zzso zzso In total, 1492 plasma samples were tested from zzso individuals and pregnant women, among which 143 zzso were zzso for zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso Ghana, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Uganda, zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso sequences identified zzso zzso E zzso zzso and A zzso zzso distributed as zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso The average and zzso zzso distances among zzso sequences were zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting a greater genetic diversity for this zzso than previously reported zzso zzso strains were classified into zzso zzso zzso and zzso In Uganda, zzso of zzso strains belonged to zzso whereas zzso was the only zzso of zzso found in zzso In zzso zzso zzso strains were classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sequences available from Africa supported earlier suggestions on the origin of zzso zzso and zzso in East, South and zzso Africa, zzso Using predicted zzso acid zzso zzso B surface zzso zzso was classified into zzso zzso in zzso of zzso strains and zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Also, zzso of the sequences carried zzso in zzso associated with immune zzso 

The observations of zzso and global dissemination of zzso and zzso and the circulation of zzso and zzso almost exclusively in West and Central Africa suggest a more recent increase in prevalence in Africa of zzso and zzso compared to zzso and zzso The broad genetic zzso of zzso detected here may impact the efficacy of prevention and control efforts in sub-Saharan zzso
