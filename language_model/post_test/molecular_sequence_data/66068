zzso is a zzso protein complex with important roles in zzso membrane trafficking, most notably in the retrograde transport of zzso zzso receptors from zzso to the zzso The core of zzso is composed of three zzso zzso protein sorting zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso there are two zzso of the medium zzso zzso and zzso We find that both zzso and zzso bind to zzso with zzso affinity and compete for a zzso site to define distinct zzso complexes in zzso and in zzso We have determined the crystal structure of mouse zzso and compare this structure with that of zzso zzso proteins have a striking similarity to the zzso family of proteins that regulate the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso although we observe that surface zzso involved in zzso function are not zzso in zzso Using zzso zzso we show that both zzso and zzso are incorporated into zzso complexes through binding of zzso to a highly zzso surface patch within the zzso zzso and that this interaction is required for zzso recruitment of the zzso
