In human zzso cells in culture, three zzso distinct types of cells are zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and intermediate zzso zzso To investigate the differences in gene expression between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of the human zzso cell line zzso we constructed a zzso zzso library from zzso zzso One of the genes that are expressed more in zzso cells than in zzso cells was identified as previously zzso and is the focus of this zzso We cloned a full-length zzso of this zzso zzso and determined its zzso A zzso search against the zzso database showed that this was from a novel gene zzso a putative 37 zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso and zzso showed that the zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso compared to zzso cells of a few zzso cell zzso
