The ability of some typical zzso zzso coli zzso strains to adhere to, zzso and increase zzso zzso production in zzso zzso cells in zzso has been zzso However, few studies regarding these aspects have been performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso which are emerging zzso in zzso In this study, we evaluated a selected zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso the most prevalent zzso zzso in Brazil, in regard to its ability to adhere to and invade zzso and zzso cells and to elicit zzso production in zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso invasion, and zzso production was investigated by performing the same experiments with an zzso zzso zzso unable to produce zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso We demonstrated that this zzso zzso zzso had a marked decrease in the ability to adhere to zzso cells and invade both zzso and zzso cells in zzso protection zzso and by transmission electron zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso had a reduced ability to stimulate zzso production by zzso cells in early zzso but not in late zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso are required for efficient zzso invasion, and early but not late zzso production in zzso zzso cells in zzso
