There have been few insights into the zzso origins of natural product zzso from primary zzso Of particular interest are zzso zzso which often mediate the committed step in particular zzso pathways so that zzso of their product outcome is a key step in the derivation of novel natural zzso These zzso also catalyze complex reactions of significant zzso zzso Following an evolutionary lead from two recently diverged, functionally distinct zzso zzso zzso from different subspecies of rice, we have identified a single zzso that can switch product zzso Specifically, the zzso of a zzso zzso to zzso that acts to convert not only the originally targeted zzso zzso into a specific zzso zzso but also has a much broader effect, which includes conversion of the zzso zzso found in all higher plants for zzso zzso zzso to the production of zzso This surprisingly facile switch for zzso zzso zzso specificity indicates the ease with which primary zzso metabolism can be zzso to secondary zzso and may zzso the widespread occurrence of zzso natural zzso In addition, because this zzso is required for the mechanistically more complex zzso to zzso zzso whereas substitution with zzso zzso this mechanism to produce the zzso zzso zzso our results have some implications regarding the means by which zzso zzso specify product zzso
