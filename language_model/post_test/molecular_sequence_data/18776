A zzso study was performed on zzso zzso and regular zzso bacterial strains zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the zzso position of the novel strains was within the zzso zzso the highest sequence similarity to zzso was shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower sequence similarities were found to other zzso zzso zzso A zzso method could detect the sequence of the zzso zzso gene of strain zzso at different zzso stages of zzso occurring in two different locations in the Czech zzso The distinctiveness of the strains from other zzso was also confirmed by analysis of sequences of other zzso markers zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso summed zzso zzso zzso zzso summed zzso and summed zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso lipids and zzso zzso and zzso characteristics also confirmed the independent status of the strains at the species zzso Interestingly, strain zzso was able to inhibit growth in zzso of zzso larvae zzso larvae zzso agent of American zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso agent of European zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this novel zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
