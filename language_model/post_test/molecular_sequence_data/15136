The zzso are zzso that convert zzso to the corresponding acid and zzso They are members of a zzso which includes zzso and occur in both zzso and zzso The zzso is characterized by having a zzso building block with a alpha beta beta zzso beta beta alpha sandwich fold and an active site containing four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their high chemical specificity and frequent zzso makes them attractive zzso for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical zzso zzso are also used in the treatment of toxic industrial zzso and cyanide zzso The zzso zzso have been zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and variable length zzso but all zzso zzso have the same basic zzso zzso Moreover, in the case of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso common principles of zzso association zzso While the range of industrially interesting reactions zzso by this zzso class continues to increase, research efforts are still hampered by the lack of a high resolution microbial zzso structure which can provide insights into their zzso zzso and the mechanism of zzso This review provides an overview of the current progress in zzso of structure and function in this zzso class and emphasizes insights that may lead to further zzso zzso
