The larvae of zzso zzso known as zzso zzso and belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are regarded as zzso zzso in zzso During a survey conducted to find zzso bacteria with the potential to control zzso larvae, a native zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a dead zzso zzso zzso zzso collected from a zzso in Tres zzso Morelos, zzso zzso zzso using healthy zzso zzso larvae fed with the zzso isolate showed that this strain was able to cause an zzso effect and a significant loss of zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso isolate also caused zzso mortality 24 h after zzso zzso of the larvae of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso insect zzso zzso zzso and injection zzso were performed with concentrated culture zzso of the zzso isolate to search for disease symptoms and mortality caused by zzso zzso The results have shown that zzso zzso produce significant zzso effects and zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso K lost the ability to cause disease symptoms and zzso in both the oral and the injection zzso suggesting the involvement of toxic proteins in the zzso The zzso isolate was identified as a putative zzso zzso zzso strain based on zzso zzso and zzso analyses done with the zzso zzso gene zzso The potential of zzso zzso zzso and its toxins to be used in an integrated zzso management program is zzso
