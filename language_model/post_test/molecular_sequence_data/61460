The zzso zzso zzso is the major site for folding and sorting of newly zzso zzso cargo zzso One central regulator of this process is the quality control machinery, which retains and ultimately disposes of zzso zzso proteins before they can exit the zzso The zzso quality control process is highly effective and zzso in cargo molecules are linked to a variety of zzso In zzso cells, a large number of zzso zzso whether membrane bound or zzso are zzso zzso Recent attention has focused on a sugar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is now recognized as a constituent of the zzso quality control zzso zzso is capable of sensing the folding state of zzso and zzso a single zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of incompletely folded or zzso zzso This enables zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso productive folding zzso zzso the time of zzso addition on zzso zzso ultimately results in either the proper folding of the zzso or its presentation to an zzso associated degradation zzso
