The human zzso zzso virus zzso was analyzed for the presence of unusual DNA zzso zzso plasmids containing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain DNA were constructed and analyzed with both zzso and chemical zzso zzso studies revealed that the most prominent zzso zzso and zzso sites were located within the zzso boxes of each zzso tandem zzso Further studies revealed that the zzso zzso site in the first zzso box zzso to the zzso was approximately zzso stronger than the site in the second zzso box zzso from the zzso zzso of the first zzso box drastically reduced the extent of zzso modification in the second zzso box, whereas deletion of the second zzso box had little or no effect on the zzso at the first zzso zzso zzso the biological and zzso role of the second zzso box remains zzso No zzso relaxation was found, and reactions with the zzso were not pH zzso Also, fragments containing this regulatory region did not appear to be bent, although the zzso segment contained a tract of eight consecutive zzso We conclude that the regulatory region of zzso contains zzso but zzso DNA zzso which account for this zzso
