In contrast to zzso zzso light zzso mice zzso zzso zzso mice fail to respond to zzso light chains zzso zzso This suggests that C zzso T cells are tolerant to this zzso in zzso zzso To get insights into the cellular and molecular basis of this zzso we first characterized the presented L zzso C zzso zzso Among a library of overlapping peptides spanning the whole C zzso zzso only three consecutive peptides are recognized by zzso T cell zzso obtained in L zzso zzso zzso This C zzso region, which is also the only one containing the zzso consensus zzso is zzso since it is able to prime zzso zzso cells of zzso mice to subsequent in zzso zzso response to either L zzso or zzso zzso zzso no zzso T cell proliferation is observed under the same zzso zzso of our zzso by cells from central and peripheral zzso zzso reveals that this C zzso region is naturally expressed on zzso zzso zzso In addition to B cells, zzso and zzso cells are able to present this zzso Taken together our data suggest that the described zzso zzso region is implicated in the C zzso zzso T cell zzso in zzso zzso
