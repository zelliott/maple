The human gastric zzso + zzso gene (15 zzso was zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso The gene has 22 zzso and codes a protein of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso (Mr zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence with inserted zzso zzso was found near the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso site and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso found in the rat and pig zzso are also zzso in the human zzso The positions of zzso in the human zzso + zzso gene are essentially the same as those in the human zzso + zzso alpha and alpha III zzso but the first zzso of the two zzso are difficult to zzso and unlike in the zzso + zzso zzso the sixth zzso in the zzso + zzso gene is not separated by an zzso Furthermore, the ninth zzso is located two bases upstream of the position for the corresponding zzso of the zzso + zzso alpha III zzso The similarity in organization of these two zzso genes and the zzso in the primary structures of their proteins zzso zzso suggest that these two genes were derived from a common ancestral zzso However, the zzso regions of the genes for zzso + zzso and the zzso + zzso alpha zzso zzso show no apparent sequence zzso indicating that their transcriptions are regulated zzso The control region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene also showed no sequence zzso to that of zzso + zzso The zzso region of the zzso + zzso gene contains potential binding sites for zzso zzso II and various zzso regulation factors and several direct and zzso repeat sequences which may be important for specific and controlled expression of the gene in gastric zzso zzso There are two zzso signals in the zzso region of the zzso + zzso zzso but the sequence of this region shows no zzso to those of the corresponding regions of the genes for the zzso + zzso alpha and alpha III zzso
