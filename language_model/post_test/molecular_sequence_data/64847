The zzso segment zzso the zzso zzso from 12 group A zzso zzso has been zzso following zzso and molecular cloning of the full-length zzso zzso zzso of the derived zzso acid sequences including those of the four zzso sequences available from zzso revealed two levels of sequence zzso zzso zzso from humans showed greater than zzso sequence identity, whereas those isolated from different zzso species showed as low as zzso sequence zzso The exceptions were avian virus zzso which zzso approximately zzso from those of zzso origin, and the human virus zzso zzso and zzso which showed much closer (over zzso identity to viruses of bovine origin, suggesting that these human zzso may have undergone recent zzso events with a bovine zzso Analysis of the sequences for a putative zzso active site has revealed that the zzso and zzso motifs around zzso acids 385 and zzso respectively, are zzso across both group A and C zzso
