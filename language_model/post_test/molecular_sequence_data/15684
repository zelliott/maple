A new zzso species, zzso zzso is proposed in this paper based on six strains isolated from soil in zzso The species may produce one to four zzso zzso in each zzso directly transformed from zzso zzso zzso assignment and distinction of the species from other recognized species of zzso is based on zzso and zzso zzso and on zzso analysis of zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene reveals that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso complex, and its zzso closest relatives are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The species can be further differentiated from the other zzso related species based on internal transcribed zzso sequence and zzso zzso zzso the new species zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of this new species, which was isolated from forest soil in zzso zzso Taiwan, is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
