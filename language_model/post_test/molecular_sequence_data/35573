zzso proteins are acknowledged as key regulators of programmed cell zzso However, increasing data suggest additional roles, including regulation of the cell cycle, metabolism and zzso zzso Here we report the discovery and characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in fish and zzso zzso and molecular studies in zzso indicate that zzso and the recently identified zzso calcium zzso zzso contribute to the formation of the zzso axis by controlling zzso convergence and extension movements during zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso controls zzso zzso trafficking by acting on the zzso zzso zzso channel, and possibly on zzso with direct consequences on zzso zzso dynamics and zzso migration zzso Thus, from an evolutionary point of view, the original function of zzso proteins might have been to contribute in controlling the global positioning system of zzso during zzso a critical step in zzso zzso
