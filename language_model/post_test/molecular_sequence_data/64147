The small zzso protein zzso is an essential regulator of the dynamics of recycling zzso Here we report the zzso analysis of the zzso cycle of human zzso and a zzso zzso study that identifies a novel zzso zzso The crystal structures show that the zzso switch 1 and 2 regions differ from those of other zzso zzso In zzso they contribute to a close packed symmetrical zzso which may associate to zzso in the cell and allow zzso to undergo zzso cycles without recycling to the zzso The structure of active zzso zzso a three-dimensional site that includes switch 1 and is separate from the site defined by the zzso zzso It is proposed to form a novel interface for a zzso partner compatible with the simultaneous binding of another partner at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in this zzso resulted in zzso modifications of the recycling compartment that are distinct from those induced by the classical zzso and zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso condensed in the zzso region where they retained recycling zzso and they clustered zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our study suggests that this zzso zzso a specific subset of zzso zzso possibly those involved in zzso movements driving the slow recycling zzso
