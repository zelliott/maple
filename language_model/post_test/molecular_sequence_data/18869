The zzso and zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso factor for some zzso zzso types and group B zzso Its role in zzso zzso is unclear as studies suggest that its zzso domain is zzso for some zzso zzso We previously showed that in motor zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso was linked to zzso and long-range transport zzso Here, we characterized the mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently followed by zzso degradation in zzso Moreover, zzso that disrupted the zzso zzso interactions in its D1 zzso triggered an zzso cascade involving sequences in its zzso zzso
