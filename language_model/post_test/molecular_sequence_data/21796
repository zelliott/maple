The distribution of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso communities in three Atlantic zzso zzso systems zzso zzso Lost City) was compared using zzso zzso gene and functional gene zzso zzso and zzso clone zzso The overall zzso community was diverse and zzso distributed between the zzso sites and the types of samples analyzed zzso zzso fluid, chimney and zzso The Lost City zzso field, characterized by high alkaline warm zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a singular zzso diversity mostly composed of zzso zzso The zzso communities associated with the recently discovered zzso 1 site, one of the deepest active zzso fields known zzso m zzso showed significant differences between the two different vents analyzed and were characterized by putative extreme zzso zzso related to the rarely detected zzso zzso and zzso order were also retrieved from the Rainbow and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso was the most widely distributed zzso zzso group among the hot and zzso zzso zzso system zzso Most of the lineages detected are linked to methane and hydrogen zzso suggesting that in zzso zzso systems, large zzso and zzso communities could be zzso by zzso zzso highly enriched in methane and zzso
