The human zzso zzso zzso complex and the relationship between its structure and function in zzso of zzso in zzso were zzso Two molecules of zzso protein were shown to bind to a zzso region in the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso The secondary structure of this region was determined by a combination of theoretical zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso structure probing and molecular zzso The zzso binding sites form zzso zzso a complex secondary structure which is significantly different from the binding site of zzso protein on zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso showed that the integrity of much of this structure is required for both high affinity binding to zzso protein and specific zzso of zzso in zzso In particular, binding of a single zzso of zzso protein to zzso zzso is not sufficient to produce efficient zzso of zzso
