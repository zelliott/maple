In zzso cells a specialized zzso called the zzso organizing center zzso is responsible for disposition of zzso in a zzso polarized array in zzso cells and in the zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells across different species, and different cell types within single species, have zzso diverse zzso but these share a common function of organizing zzso zzso zzso effect zzso organization by initiating zzso assembly and zzso zzso by their slowly growing minus ends, thus ensuring that the rapidly growing plus ends extend zzso in each zzso zzso The goal is to define molecular components of the zzso responsible for regulating zzso zzso One approach to defining the molecules responsible for zzso function is to look for molecules common to all zzso A newly discovered zzso zzso zzso is found in zzso in cells from many different organisms, and has several properties which make it a candidate for both initiation of zzso assembly and zzso The hypothesis that zzso plays a role in zzso in zzso initiation and zzso is currently being tested by a variety of experimental zzso
