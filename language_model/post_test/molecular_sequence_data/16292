We have used zzso zzso to clone genes zzso the zzso zzso and type I regulatory zzso components of the zzso protein zzso in zzso Both zzso gene products are very similar in zzso acid sequence zzso zzso C, zzso to their respective zzso counterparts, zzso zzso zzso A single zzso type I regulatory zzso gene is the source of at least three distinct transcripts originating from different promoters and spliced to a common body that would zzso a full-length analog and two zzso truncated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus also includes two zzso genes of unknown zzso A single highly zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was found that codes for a single zzso It was used to isolate 11 further more zzso related apparent protein zzso zzso Two of these genes zzso and zzso are sufficiently similar to zzso in sequence zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, zzso that they could conceivably zzso products of overlapping zzso Two further genes are very similar in sequence to bovine zzso protein zzso The remaining putative gene products include zzso acid sequence motifs characteristic of zzso protein zzso but zzso from the available data, be defined as zzso to specific protein zzso of other zzso
