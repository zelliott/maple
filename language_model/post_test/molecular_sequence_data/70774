Multiple alignments of zzso C virus zzso zzso from six different zzso identified a total of 22 zzso zzso in a clone derived from the Hutchinson zzso zzso These zzso zzso may have contributed to the failure in generating a zzso zzso or zzso clone in earlier zzso A consensus clone was constructed after systematic repair of these zzso which yielded infectious zzso in a zzso after direct zzso zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso This zzso zzso has developed zzso and remained zzso positive for more than 11 zzso To further verify this zzso zzso a second zzso zzso was injected zzso with serum collected from the first zzso zzso analysis of the second zzso demonstrated that the zzso infection was successfully zzso which validated unequivocally the zzso of our repaired molecular zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed that our repaired infectious clone had 4 zzso with the zzso clone reported by zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso and 8 zzso with that reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 94, zzso At the zzso level, more zzso zzso and 67, zzso were zzso most of them were synonymous zzso Further comparisons with 16 zzso from different zzso demonstrated that our repaired clone shares greater consensus than the reported zzso zzso This approach of generating infectious zzso zzso zzso the importance of zzso acid sequence consensus in relation to the biology of zzso
