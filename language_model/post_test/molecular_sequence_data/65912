We have used zzso zzso to investigate the structure of zzso zzso bound with zzso sequences of either the plasma membrane zzso or the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso calcium release zzso Following zzso with zzso at engineered sites zzso and zzso within the zzso and zzso of zzso contact interactions between these opposing zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso that permits us to monitor zzso states of bound zzso zzso zzso take advantage of the unique zzso zzso within zzso sequences that functions as a zzso anchor in zzso binding and permits zzso of both a local and global zzso zzso We find that zzso binds with high affinity in a collapsed structure to the zzso sequences of both the zzso and zzso resulting in zzso formation that is indicative of contact interactions between the zzso and the zzso of zzso in complex with these zzso zzso There is a zzso larger amount of zzso formation for zzso bound to the zzso sequence of the zzso in comparison to zzso indicating a closer structural zzso between zzso zzso in this zzso Prior to zzso association, the zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso are zzso zzso Upon zzso association, the zzso sequence of the zzso assumes a highly ordered zzso In comparison, the zzso sequence of zzso remains zzso zzso irrespective of zzso zzso These results suggest an important role for zzso contact interactions between the opposing zzso of zzso in stabilizing the structure of the zzso zzso The substantially different structural responses associated with zzso binding to zzso and zzso indicates a plasticity in their respective binding mechanisms that accomplishes different physical mechanisms of zzso regulation, involving either the zzso of a zzso regulatory domain necessary for pump zzso or the zzso of zzso interactions to diminish zzso channel zzso
