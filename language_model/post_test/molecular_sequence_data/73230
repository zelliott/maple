zzso of genes zzso various zzso proteins are known to cause a wide spectrum of inherited retinal zzso in different zzso In the zzso several types of genetic retinal zzso have been described affecting primarily the zzso and/or the retinal zzso zzso We are performing a systematic analysis of canine candidate genes for such diseases to identify the one zzso in the retinal zzso in Swedish zzso zzso 

We isolated and zzso the full length zzso of canine retinal zzso by the method of rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso 

The full length zzso isolated by us is zzso base pairs zzso long and contains a zzso zzso open reading zzso 

The zzso of the canine zzso protein is highest with the human analogue zzso and lowest with mouse zzso zzso The most obvious sequence differences among the different zzso are in the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso strand zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing of retinal zzso didn't provide any evidence that zzso in the canine zzso gene are responsible for the retinal zzso seen in the Swedish strain of zzso zzso Similar data were obtained for the genes zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso by segregation zzso
