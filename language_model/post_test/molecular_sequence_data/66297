The avian zzso and zzso virus zzso family of zzso contains five highly related envelope zzso (A to zzso thought to have evolved from a common viral zzso in the chicken zzso Three genetic zzso in chickens determine the zzso or resistance of cells to infection by the zzso A to E zzso Some zzso lines of chickens display zzso that are somewhere in between either efficiently susceptible or resistant to infection by specific zzso of zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso for zzso B, D, and E zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso B, D, and E zzso In this study, the genetic zzso that accounts for the altered zzso of an zzso chicken line, line M, to infection by zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso gene in line M, zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein with a substitution of a zzso for a zzso at position 125 zzso Here, we show that the zzso substitution in zzso significantly reduces the zzso of line M cells to infection by zzso and zzso and virtually eliminates zzso to zzso infection both in cultured cells and in the zzso and growth of avian zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso substitution significantly reduces the binding affinity of the zzso zzso for the zzso B, D, and E zzso envelope zzso These are the first results that demonstrate a possible role of the zzso domain 3 in the function of the zzso zzso
