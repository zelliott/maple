The zzso zzso zzso structural gene zzso was isolated from both the zzso DNA and zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso by inverse zzso and zzso An open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a 334 zzso acid protein (a calculated zzso point: zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso was zzso The corresponding gene had one single zzso of 51 zzso and in its promoter two putative zzso sequences could be zzso The deduced protein from the cloned gene contained two zzso zzso zzso zzso nine sequences of zzso which was characteristics of the regulator, and one zzso central domain which was located between the two zinc zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso was disrupted by zzso the zzso B zzso gene into the zzso of the zzso gene using zzso zzso Two hundreds of the zzso zzso (one of them was named zzso obtained still zzso both zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of added zzso and the expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was also partially zzso in the presence of added zzso The colonies of the zzso zzso grown on the zzso medium with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and also with zzso zzso zzso became zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso could not grow in the zzso medium with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso colonies of the zzso zzso also had high level of zzso and zzso
