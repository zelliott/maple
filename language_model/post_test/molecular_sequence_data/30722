zzso sequences containing redundant segments of secondary structure at both zzso have the choice a zzso of folding into several possible zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis the gene of zzso zzso zzso from zzso which is a zzso zzso beta alpha barrel zzso was modified to produce a zzso beta alpha zzso in zzso zzso It contained a duplicate of the two zzso beta alpha units of zzso structure fused to its zzso Most of the protein was recovered from the zzso fraction of disrupted cells by dissolution in zzso zzso solutions and zzso zzso protein was zzso from the soluble zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso almost fully zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso as well as the zzso unfolding zzso of both proteins were also very similar to the properties of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso converted both the pristine and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the same large zzso that had the zzso sequence and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that the folding of the zzso zzso zzso is controlled zzso both in zzso and in zzso
