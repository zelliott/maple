zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and numerous other zzso proteins results from a specific zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso that are commonly activated by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso require a stalk of minimum length and zzso zzso However, we recently found that substitution of the zzso stalk with an zzso growth factor zzso domain from the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not abolish zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurred at a zzso bond in the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso We have now constructed two additional stalk zzso in which the native stalk in zzso was replaced with the zzso domain from factor IX zzso and with a zzso knot motif zzso Like the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were also shed, but mass spectral analysis revealed that the zzso sites were adjacent to, rather than zzso the zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso domain revealed that the third zzso loop is larger and more flexible than the equivalent loop in the factor IX zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso structure of the zzso motif is highly zzso zzso zzso within a zzso domain appears to require an zzso zzso Interestingly, unlike zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso shedding of the zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso or inhibited by zzso but instead was inhibited by zzso indicating the activity of an alternative zzso In zzso the zzso shedding machinery is highly zzso but an accessible zzso zzso in the form of a flexible stalk or an exposed loop within or adjacent to a folded domain, appears to be zzso Moreover, alternative zzso are zzso depending on the nature of the zzso zzso
