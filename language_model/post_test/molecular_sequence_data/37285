The molecular mechanism of how the zzso status of the DNA is recognized during DNA mismatch repair by the strand discrimination zzso zzso is not zzso A comparison of the crystal structure of zzso with those of zzso structures of several restriction zzso together with a multiple sequence alignment of zzso and related proteins suggested that zzso zzso and zzso could be involved in discrimination between a zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were substantially reduced in their ability to complement a mismatch repair zzso in a zzso zzso coli zzso In zzso zzso displayed a strongly reduced zzso activity, whereas the zzso zzso has almost completely lost its preference for zzso the zzso strand at zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso can cleave fully zzso zzso sites at a comparable rate to zzso zzso zzso This demonstrates that zzso is an important, if not the only zzso acid zzso in zzso for sensing the zzso status of the zzso
