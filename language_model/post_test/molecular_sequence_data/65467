In this study, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated in two zzso rocky zzso and two zzso zzso sites of the zzso River zzso zzso The results were compared to rates of key zzso processes and environmental variables to examine possible links between zzso community dynamics and N zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was evaluated by terminal restriction zzso length zzso analysis zzso and by sequencing cloned zzso gene zzso zzso analysis showed that the majority of the zzso genes detected were most similar to zzso genes from zzso affiliated with zzso of the class zzso zzso revealed low zzso zzso zzso and zzso cluster analysis showed significant differences in the composition of zzso communities that inhabit different zzso environments of the zzso River zzso Monthly surveys of zzso zzso from sandy sediments showed that, while the same zzso zzso were present in all samples, shifts in the relative peak areas of the different zzso zzso zzso zzso correspondence analysis, based on data from the monthly survey, revealed a strong relationship between the relative peak areas of some zzso operational zzso units zzso with zzso rate and zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso with specific zzso zzso zzso have competitive advantage over others when zzso fluctuates in the system; these fluctuations zzso in turn, zzso in zzso zzso
