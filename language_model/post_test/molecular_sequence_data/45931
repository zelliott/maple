zzso zzso resulting in the combination of zzso sequences from distinct genes is a newly identified mechanism likely to contribute to protein zzso Few cases have been zzso most of them involving neighboring genes and thus suggesting a zzso event presumably due to zzso termination zzso 

We identified bovine zzso transcripts resulting from zzso and zzso zzso of two neighboring zzso zzso and zzso These two genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and are situated in the same orientation about 50 zzso apart on bovine zzso zzso Their relative position is zzso in human and zzso We identified two types of zzso transcripts containing all but the last zzso of the zzso gene followed by all but the first zzso of the zzso zzso The two zzso differ by the zzso of an intermediate zzso resulting from zzso of a LINE zzso sequence situated between the two zzso Both transcripts use zzso zzso sites for all zzso coming from both zzso as well as for the LINE zzso zzso One of these transcripts harbors a premature STOP zzso and the other encodes a putative zzso protein combining most of the zzso protein and the entire zzso zzso but we could not establish the existence of this zzso 

By showing that both individual and zzso transcripts are transcribed from zzso and zzso we demonstrated regulation of zzso zzso Further, the existence and functionality of a zzso protein harboring active motifs that are a zzso unrelated is zzso
