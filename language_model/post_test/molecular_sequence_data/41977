A sequence of about 100 zzso of the zzso alpha zzso zzso was investigated for sensitive detection of zzso zzso It was shown that the target sequence is specific for this zzso and no zzso was observed with different species of zzso zzso two strains of zzso zzso or human zzso zzso of the sequence was obtained by reverse zzso coupled to zzso chain zzso Following this procedure the equivalent to zzso of the zzso acid content of a single zzso cell could be detected either by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The distribution of the target sequence in zzso strains of zzso zzso was zzso Positive amplification was obtained for all samples employing the same zzso as zzso However, amplified fragments of 125 zzso were obtained in eight zzso while fragments of 110 zzso were detected in the remaining eight zzso No amplification of both classes of fragments has been detected in any of the strains zzso zzso in the target region was confirmed by zzso to specific internal zzso and sequencing, allowing the division of zzso zzso strains in two zzso It is proposed that sensitive zzso detection could be achieved by zzso amplification followed by zzso to two zzso derived from the target sequences of both groups of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the sequence zzso found in this sequence opens the perspective of strain typing simultaneous with zzso zzso
