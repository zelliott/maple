We report the use of zzso difference analysis to identify genes that have zzso expression in the zzso zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso This simultaneous process of selection and amplification allowed the cloning of several specific DNA zzso One of them shows a high percentage of similarity with zzso zzso genes from other zzso and, as expected, is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The gene is present in two copies that are expressed at different levels in zzso and also in zzso which seems to be a consequence of their different 3' untranslated zzso
