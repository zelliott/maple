zzso zzso zzso zzso enable bacteria to generate zzso zzso zzso the roles of which in microbial zzso including the zzso of zzso structure and the dissolution of zzso are just beginning to be zzso Here, extensive zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies were used to define the molecular features of the zzso zzso that enable this zzso to accommodate more diverse zzso than the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified that distinguish zzso and a newly defined family of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and these zzso were found to be key zzso of the zzso of zzso Finally, the structural analysis of an additional zzso that was identified in the zzso analysis confirmed that the distinguishing features of zzso are zzso among zzso family zzso
