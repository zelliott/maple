zzso is a member of the zzso family of structurally related proteins that are important regulators of the zzso zzso factor zzso In the present study, the mouse zzso gene was cloned and zzso and its structure zzso The mouse zzso gene contains six zzso and five zzso that span zzso zzso A single major zzso initiation site is located 59 zzso upstream of the initiating zzso A translation termination zzso and a single zzso signal are found within zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso and zzso genes were compared and found to be very similar, with individual zzso repeats being maintained on corresponding zzso This suggests a close evolutionary relationship between these two zzso zzso The significance of this evolutionary relationship is zzso
