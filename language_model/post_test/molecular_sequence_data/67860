The capability or zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso that contains the consensus zzso sequence of zzso Although the zzso precursor zzso in zzso zzso yields the zzso hormone, zzso no function has yet been zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso the possible zzso roles of the zzso peptides in zzso zzso we have isolated and functionally characterized the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we have determined a set of three optimal reference genes to zzso for zzso of data obtained when carrying out spatial expression analyses via quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso in various zzso of fifth zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression profile differs zzso from the zzso for the zzso hormone zzso which is localized mainly to gut zzso zzso Instead, zzso expression in fifth zzso stage insects was identified in zzso that are not involved in zzso and zzso balance, including the zzso zzso male zzso zzso and a pooled sample composed of fat body, zzso vessel, abdominal nerves and female zzso zzso Thus, this research establishes novel possibilities for the zzso roles of the zzso peptides in this medically relevant disease zzso
