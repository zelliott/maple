Here we report the entire zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso comparison, nine zzso were found in zzso zzso and five in zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso 5 was missing, which resulted in the total of 18 zzso instead of 19 theoretically possible zzso in zzso zzso zzso of DNA sequences representing zzso 5 in other species with corresponding zzso zzso region confirmed the presence of cryptic zzso in horse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in three forms in the zzso zzso zzso and we showed that the two shorter forms were produced by skipping either the zzso 8 or zzso zzso In zzso as in some other zzso zzso and zzso are considerably more zzso zzso identity zzso to 59% and 57% to zzso zzso than zzso which appears as the most variable zzso among species zzso identity zzso to zzso Interestingly, horse zzso resemble human much more than bovine zzso which may also explain the high zzso value of zzso zzso
