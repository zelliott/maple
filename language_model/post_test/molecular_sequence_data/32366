The ever evolving resistance of the most virulent malaria zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the continuous development of new zzso Our previous analysis of the zzso activities of the zzso zzso peptides zzso and their zzso derivatives implicated the importance of zzso and charge for drug zzso Following these findings, an zzso zzso zzso designed to mimic the characteristics of zzso was zzso and assessed for its zzso activity in cultures of zzso zzso The zzso inhibited the growth of different zzso strains at low zzso zzso zzso 50% zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso A zzso relationship study involving eight derivatives unraveled smaller, more potent OAK zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The most potent zzso were the most selective, with selectivity ratios of 3 orders of zzso zzso was strongly influenced by the zzso properties resulting from interactions between zzso zzso as has been observed with conventional zzso zzso Further investigations performed with a representative OAK revealed that the ring and zzso stages of the zzso zzso cycle were equally sensitive to the zzso A shortcoming of the tested compound was the need for long incubation times in order for it to exert its full zzso Nevertheless, the encouraging results obtained in this study regarding the efficiency and selectivity of some compounds establish them as leads for further zzso
