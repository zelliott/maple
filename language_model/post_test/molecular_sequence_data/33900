zzso disorders offer unique opportunities for researchers to shed light upon fundamental zzso processes in zzso We investigated a large family affected with zzso zzso zzso of zzso also known as the zzso delay zzso Using linkage and zzso zzso we mapped the disease zzso to zzso One of the genes located in this zzso is zzso a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso We demonstrated the existence of a short zzso of zzso exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso of all zzso coding and zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso predicted to disrupt a zzso donor zzso site adjacent to the 3' end of a zzso zzso uniquely present in the zzso short zzso of the zzso This zzso zzso with the disease zzso throughout the entire zzso Using a zzso system, we found that this zzso causes zzso zzso resulting in decreased stability of the short zzso zzso as predicted by zzso analysis and shown by zzso Taken together, the present findings zzso a zzso zzso of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
