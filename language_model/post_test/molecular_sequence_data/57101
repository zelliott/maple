The zzso sequence of a zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso containing the entire coding regions for the zzso catalyzing the first three steps of zzso synthesis as well as zzso zzso has been zzso This group of functionally related zzso termed the zzso zzso were arranged in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were bracketed by potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus could complement the growth zzso of zzso coli strains with an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus led to the loss of zzso I, with a zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso described earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the deduced products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso had high degrees of similarity with those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on growth but caused a zzso zzso characterized by low zzso zzso and zzso spores, which could be cured by supplementation with zzso similar to the zzso of zzso defective in zzso the putative structural gene for zzso zzso Two other open reading zzso upstream of zzso zzso the 380 zzso zzso of a protein zzso to zzso processing zzso and an zzso zzso of unknown zzso zzso initiation sites associated with the zzso gene cluster were mapped by primer zzso The results indicate that during zzso growth, the three zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed as a unit and zzso and zzso are not zzso whereas at stage 5 of zzso two separate transcripts are produced, one zzso all five zzso the other just the three zzso genes of the zzso
