zzso zzso for DNA zzso IV and the alpha and beta zzso of DNA zzso III were cloned from zzso zzso to permit study of the genes zzso zzso DNA zzso DNA zzso III alpha and III beta share a common zzso zzso that encodes a zzso zzso signal capable of targeting green fluorescent protein to zzso while the zzso zzso of DNA zzso IV does zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analyses with adult zzso zzso demonstrate that while DNA zzso III alpha and DNA zzso IV are zzso zzso DNA zzso III beta expression is restricted to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contain both DNA zzso III alpha and III beta but no zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso native gel zzso and in zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso III alpha exists as a high molecular weight zzso We discuss the possibility that DNA zzso III alpha exists in zzso in association with novel zzso protein partners or as a zzso
