zzso motifs found in zzso (more generally, zzso proteins differ fundamentally from those found in zzso zzso The latter are primarily zzso in which the two strands form an zzso zzso In the former, the two strands are relatively rotated by approximately 90 degrees around the strand axes so that they interact via the zzso not via the zzso zzso We call the latter structures, zzso and their turns, zzso In zzso zzso zzso stack zzso to form zzso in which parallel zzso are assembled from corresponding strands in successive zzso The number of zzso whose three-dimensional structures have been determined is now large enough to support a detailed analysis and zzso of zzso zzso Here, we present a systematic account of zzso distinguished by the number of zzso their zzso and their propensity to stack into zzso with other like or unlike zzso The trends to emerge from this analysis have implications for zzso detection and structural prediction of other zzso proteins as well as for identification of zzso sequences and zzso of zzso zzso zzso
