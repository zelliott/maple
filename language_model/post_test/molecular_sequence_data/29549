It has been suggested that a family of tissue zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso play a zzso role in the process of tail zzso during zzso zzso metamorphosis of the zzso zzso however, this hypothesis has never been directly zzso We cloned two new zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso These clones were used along with several others to perform a comprehensive expression zzso We show that all zzso and zzso are dramatically induced in the zzso tail during spontaneous metamorphosis and are zzso zzso primarily in the zzso zzso zzso By Northern zzso we show that all the examined zzso are also induced by treatment of zzso tails with zzso hormone zzso Using the organ culture model, we provide the first direct evidence that zzso are required for zzso tail zzso by showing that a synthetic inhibitor of zzso zzso can specifically zzso the zzso zzso By gelatin zzso we also show zzso induction of a fifth zzso preliminarily identified as zzso B zzso zzso Moreover, zzso not only zzso zzso expression but also zzso zzso and we provide evidence that zzso zzso in the latter zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso act in concert to effect the dismantling of zzso structures during zzso zzso zzso tail zzso
