Using degenerative zzso designed on the basis of known sequences of zzso genes from different sources a zzso of zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained a zzso sequence was isolated, cloned and zzso The presence of an open reading frame of 268 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and the computer analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence showed 37% of identity and zzso of zzso over region of 25 zzso acids with the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The further analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence showed the presence of another two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consisting of the characteristic zzso sequence motifs for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the affinity to zzso was determined in a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also found in a crude zzso of the zzso clones carrying the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso and zzso was determined using the standard procedure of zzso zzso test with native rabbit red blood cells zzso
