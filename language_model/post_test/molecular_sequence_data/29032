zzso growth zzso zzso is the zzso of a large family of structurally related zzso that play key roles in maintaining cellular zzso by signaling through two classes of functionally distinct zzso zzso zzso designated as type I and type zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II zzso Here, we present the zzso A crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of the human zzso type II zzso zzso in complex with human zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth zzso Relative to the zzso zzso zzso previously observed in zzso structures across the zzso zzso zzso shows an altered arrangement of its zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso The mode of zzso binding shown by zzso is compatible with both zzso zzso This, in addition to the predicted mode for zzso binding to the type I zzso zzso zzso suggests an assembly mechanism in which zzso and zzso bind at adjacent positions on the zzso surface and directly contact each other via zzso zzso
