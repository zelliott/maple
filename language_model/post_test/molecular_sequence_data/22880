zzso zzso contains four genes that zzso proteins that have high sequence identity with zzso zzso (Old Yellow zzso an zzso zzso the well-studied archetype of the zzso protein zzso The present paper describes the first comparative study of zzso that are present in a single bacterial species, performed to gain insight into their zzso properties and zzso zzso The four proteins zzso zzso zzso Yellow zzso zzso were expressed as zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso The yield of zzso however, was too low for further zzso even after expression attempts in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins were found to have characteristics similar to those of other zzso family zzso They were identified as zzso that zzso the reduction of different zzso zzso compounds and form charge transfer complexes with a range of zzso zzso Whereas the properties of zzso and zzso were very similar, those of zzso were clearly different in terms of zzso zzso zzso efficiency and zzso zzso Also, the activity of zzso was found to be zzso whereas zzso and zzso had a preference for zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso protects the zzso zzso from zzso zzso There are indications that bacterial zzso are also involved in the zzso stress response, but their exact role is zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso revealed that zzso and bacterial zzso may share a common zzso role, zzso the protection of cellular components against zzso zzso As only zzso was induced under zzso stress conditions, however, a functional divergence between bacterial zzso is likely to zzso
