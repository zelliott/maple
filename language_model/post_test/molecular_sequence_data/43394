We have zzso a protein that binds zzso zzso zzso using beads bearing a zzso zzso This zzso with a molecular mass of 43 zzso was termed zzso zzso The partial zzso acid sequences were determined and a full-length zzso zzso the protein was isolated from bovine brain zzso zzso The clone zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids which contained one zinc finger motif similar to that of zzso zzso protein and two zzso zzso zzso The entire sequence was zzso similar to zzso zzso another zzso zzso The protein bound zzso with a higher affinity than it did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the binding to zzso was zzso The binding activity was weaker in the zzso with a point zzso in the zzso sequences in each zzso zzso zzso Introduction of both zzso abolished the zzso These results suggest that this new binding protein binds zzso through two zzso zzso present in the zzso
