A Chinese zzso zzso zzso engineered to express a 9 zzso acid zzso from the influenza zzso zzso zzso was zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso beta zzso appeared to behave normally by the following criteria: zzso indicated that zzso beta zzso incorporated into all classes of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso organizing zzso The sensitivity of the cells expressing zzso beta zzso to zzso and zzso was zzso A 210 zzso zzso associated protein zzso remained associated with zzso that incorporate zzso beta zzso The synthesis of both zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso was zzso by zzso The zzso beta zzso incorporated into zzso to the same extent as the zzso zzso and the overall extent of zzso assembly in zzso cells was zzso Finally, zzso cells had normal growth rates and zzso When effects on zzso zzso production were measured, it was found that expression of the zzso beta zzso reduced the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso but increased the synthesis of zzso At steady state, a small increase in total zzso consistent with the increased synthesis of zzso was zzso The results indicate that expression of excess zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso in a manner that is not easily explained by current models of zzso zzso The changes in zzso synthesis along with degradation of excess zzso zzso may reflect mechanisms that exist to ensure coordinate levels of zzso and zzso for zzso
