zzso are synaptic proteins that are essential for normal neurotransmitter zzso We now show that while zzso contain only a single zzso zzso zzso contain zzso two large genes zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two smaller genes zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (55 zzso zzso and zzso consist of an zzso zzso domain, central zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a short zzso sequence followed by central zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso consist of only a zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed from internal zzso zzso and zzso are extensively alternatively spliced at three zzso positions, resulting in zzso zzso that differ by up to 400 zzso Thus gene duplication, alternative zzso and multiple promoters diversify a single zzso zzso into a large zzso protein zzso The zzso of zzso zzso may serve to fine-tune neurotransmitter release beyond a zzso zzso zzso and common function for zzso
