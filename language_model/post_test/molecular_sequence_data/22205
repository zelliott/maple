zzso zzso zzso comprise a zzso of zzso catalyzing the transfer of zzso acid zzso from a common donor zzso to various zzso zzso in different zzso These zzso have been classified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso families based on zzso and zzso zzso and sequence zzso It was recognized early on that zzso contain certain zzso zzso and these were zzso as L zzso S zzso and VS zzso zzso recently, a fourth zzso zzso as motif III, was zzso These four motifs are common to all the zzso irrespective of the zzso and zzso zzso In this study, the sequences of the various families have been zzso and sequence motifs that are unique to the various families have been zzso These unique motifs are expected to contribute to the characteristic zzso and zzso zzso of the family zzso One of the linkage specific motifs is zzso to zzso Members of zzso and zzso families share significant sequence zzso in contrast, the zzso family is distinct from the zzso zzso The latter consists of two zzso one zzso zzso I and zzso II, and the other zzso zzso III, zzso IV, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of these zzso has characteristic sequence motifs not present in the other zzso
