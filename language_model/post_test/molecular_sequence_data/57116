The mouse zzso heat shock protein zzso and zzso were zzso at an zzso ratio using a zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso were mixed with zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence determination revealed that an zzso zzso zzso starting at the zzso zzso acid zzso was contained in the zzso products, which contains a zzso motif (from zzso to zzso A similar motif is present also in zzso beta (from zzso to zzso The synthetic peptides corresponding to these putative zzso sequences were found to be zzso with zzso and to prevent the zzso of zzso and zzso Both zzso alpha and zzso beta bind zzso The zzso peptides bind zzso and thereby inhibit the binding of zzso In addition, the zzso peptides augment the zzso of zzso induced at elevated zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain of zzso might interact with another part of the same zzso and that zzso might zzso the structure and function of zzso through abolishing the zzso zzso
