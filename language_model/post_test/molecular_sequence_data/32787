zzso is a newly developed zzso stem cell marker but little is known about its zzso Whether zzso cell selection provides any advantage over zzso selection for zzso stem cell isolation and transplantation is zzso The present study compared colony formation and zzso cell differentiation of these two cell types from zzso zzso blood zzso 

zzso cells from the same zzso samples were used for both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso purity were incubated in zzso culture medium containing stem cell growth factor zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells were also cultured in zzso containing vascular zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells produced similar numbers of zzso colonies zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, a greater than zzso difference in zzso colony formation was observed from zzso cells compared with zzso cells zzso 35 and 8, zzso zzso zzso cells gave rise to zzso cells when zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were unable produce this cell type under the same zzso 

zzso cells produced smaller zzso colonies and were unable to differentiate into mature zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso zzso that could differentiate into mature cells of this zzso Based on these data, it appears that zzso offers no distinct advantage over zzso as a selective marker for zzso isolation of zzso stem cells and zzso zzso zzso
