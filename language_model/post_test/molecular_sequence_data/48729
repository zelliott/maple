zzso in the zzso zzso zzso family G member 5 zzso gene has been reported in a family harboring an zzso zzso lower motor zzso disease zzso However, the zzso zzso has not been described to cause zzso disease zzso 

To identify the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso intermediate CMT zzso family with childhood zzso whole zzso sequencing zzso zzso and lower leg zzso were zzso zzso and activity of each zzso protein were zzso 

We identified novel compound zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene in the present zzso The patient revealed clinical manifestations of sensory zzso zzso replacements in the zzso lower leg muscles were more severe than in the thigh zzso Although the symptoms and signs of this patient harboring slow nerve zzso zzso suggested the possibility of zzso zzso a zzso zzso nerve biopsy was compatible with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the patient has a low level of zzso in the zzso zzso nerve and an in zzso zzso suggested that the zzso proteins have a zzso in zzso the zzso signaling zzso 

This study identifies compound zzso zzso zzso as the cause of zzso We suggest that zzso might play a role in the peripheral motor and sensory nervous zzso This study expands the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso
