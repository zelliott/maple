zzso zzso zzso is normally absent from adult rat zzso but is induced by a range of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso As many as six zzso species for this zzso have been described in both rat and zzso with various degrees of tissue zzso These originate from one gene and have separate promoters within alternative zzso untranslated zzso By using a zzso sequence specific for zzso zzso III to screen a rat zzso library, a clone that contains the promoter region for this zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso start site lay some zzso zzso upstream from that already characterized for zzso II in rat zzso zzso activity was obtained after zzso of rat zzso cell lines with zzso containing the putative promoter III fused to a zzso zzso Although this promoter lacks a zzso box, a sequence close to the start site that binds the zzso factor zzso in zzso was zzso By using zzso techniques, zzso III zzso to both mouse III and zzso and an zzso zzso with zzso to VI in mouse were found in zzso and zzso zzso rat liver and kidney as well as in a zzso cell zzso No evidence was found for a product zzso to zzso from promoter V described in the zzso
