The zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the zzso replication of zzso C virus zzso a zzso zzso virus that represents a major worldwide health zzso zzso is, therefore, an important drug target in the effort to combat zzso Most work has focused on the zzso rather than the zzso activities of the zzso In order to further characterize zzso zzso activity, we evaluated individual stages of duplex unwinding by zzso alone and in complex with zzso zzso Despite a putative zzso role in zzso zzso we found that zzso alone is a surprisingly poor zzso on zzso but that zzso activity is promoted by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso alone is a highly zzso zzso on zzso zzso analysis suggests that this robust DNA zzso activity is not vestigial and may have specifically evolved in zzso Given that zzso has no zzso DNA zzso these findings suggest that zzso may have the capacity to affect host zzso
