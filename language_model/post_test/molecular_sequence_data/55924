The cloning and expression of the full-length tissue inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso delta zzso and delta zzso and the zzso of these zzso and a zzso version of zzso lacking nine zzso zzso acids zzso zzso are zzso The mechanism of zzso of zzso A by the zzso was investigated by comparing the zzso of association of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso of both zzso which consisted of the zzso domain zzso The full-length zzso inhibited zzso A rapidly with association zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso at I zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is proposed to exist as an exposed zzso responsible for binding to zzso A and for increasing the rate of zzso of active zzso A through zzso interactions with the zzso domain of the zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso participate in zzso interactions with the zzso domain of zzso A which increase the rate of association by a factor of about 100 in both zzso
