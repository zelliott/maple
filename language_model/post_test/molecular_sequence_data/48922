zzso zzso an essential zzso active zzso zzso in fundamental biological zzso but it becomes highly zzso when present in zzso zzso living organisms have established suitable mechanisms to balance cellular and systemic zzso zzso An important strategy to maintain zzso zzso consists of regulating zzso and zzso via the zzso family of zzso zzso transport zzso In the model plant zzso zzso zzso protein mediates root zzso zzso whereas zzso protein functions in zzso zzso from zzso storage zzso The function of these zzso becomes critical when environmental zzso zzso zzso However, little is know about the mechanisms that mediate plant zzso zzso In this report, we present evidence supporting an important role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso fully zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso is only zzso upon severe zzso zzso zzso transcript is expressed under zzso excess conditions and displays a more gradual increase in response to decreases in environmental zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression in aerial vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plants exhibit altered zzso distribution under zzso conditions, including increased zzso in zzso leaves but reduced zzso levels in zzso This altered zzso distribution is fully rescued when the zzso zzso gene is reintroduced into the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings highlight the relevance of zzso in shoot zzso zzso when environmental zzso is zzso
