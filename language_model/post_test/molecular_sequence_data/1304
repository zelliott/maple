The internal transcribed zzso zzso of nuclear zzso DNA has been widely used by zzso for reconstructing zzso of closely related zzso Although the occurrence of ITS putative zzso is well documented for many groups of animals and plants, the potential utility of these zzso in zzso analyses has often been underestimated or even ignored in part because of deletions that make zzso alignment zzso In addition, long branches often can lead to zzso zzso particularly in zzso zzso We have discovered unusually high levels of ITS zzso (up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in three tropical tree species of the coffee family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both secondary structure stability and patterns of zzso zzso in a highly zzso region zzso zzso were used for distinguishing presumed functional sequences from putative zzso The combination of both criteria was the most powerful zzso The sequences from zzso zzso appear to be a mix of functional genes and highly distinct putative zzso whereas those from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified as putative zzso We explored the potential utility of the identified putative zzso in the zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso trees identified the same zzso groups and indicated that the zzso do not transcend species zzso zzso that they do not zzso the divergence of these three zzso The resulting trees are similar to those produced by previous analyses of zzso zzso In contrast to results of previous studies therefore, divergent putative zzso can be useful for zzso zzso especially when no sequences of their functional counterparts are zzso Our studies clearly show that ITS zzso may not necessarily mislead zzso zzso Despite using many different zzso conditions zzso zzso higher zzso temperatures, and absence or presence of zzso and zzso we recovered only a few functional ITS copies from zzso zzso and none from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which suggests that zzso selection is occurring and/or the presumed functional zzso are located at minor zzso (with few zzso DNA zzso
