We have used the zzso label zzso zzso zzso a biologically active analog of zzso acid, to identify zzso proteins zzso in the soluble fraction of zzso zzso A zzso zzso previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso Jones, zzso zzso King zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso has now been zzso to zzso by conventional zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso protein was reduced by active zzso but not by inactive zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso protein showed high zzso to zzso zzso zzso from tobacco zzso and from zzso zzso The conclusion that the zzso zzso is a zzso is further supported by high zzso activity in zzso highly enriched in the zzso zzso and recognition of the zzso by zzso against zzso from wheat and zzso Furthermore, zzso of a protein from a soluble protein extract from zzso zzso by affinity zzso on zzso also yielded a zzso zzso that was indistinguishable in its zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso characteristics from the protein zzso by conventional zzso zzso functions of zzso in zzso action are zzso
