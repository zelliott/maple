Analysis of the stress response of closely related rat zzso clones revealed that the major zzso zzso protein 68 zzso was only slightly zzso upon stress in the zzso zzso zzso cells, but strongly activated in the zzso zzso zzso 967 cells from which clone 2 was zzso The decreased zzso of zzso in zzso cells was not the consequence of altered zzso of protein synthesis recovery, was not correlated with the deficient zzso of other major zzso proteins and had no effect on the heat sensitivity of the zzso This zzso was observed after treatment with mild and strong heat and various zzso The results of nuclear zzso experiments suggested that the impairment of zzso zzso induction most likely occurs at the zzso level and is probably specific for the corresponding zzso In zzso 967 and zzso cells, stress activated comparable levels of zzso binding to the zzso element, and the expression of a reporter gene under the control of zzso zzso promoter was strongly zzso in both zzso zzso our results raise the possibility that the deficient stress zzso of zzso is due to some specific regulation of the zzso zzso zzso rather than to a zzso of the zzso factor or zzso of the corresponding zzso
