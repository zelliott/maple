The mechanisms that control zzso zzso in the zzso zzso life cycle have counterparts in the regulatory systems of other zzso Here we examine zzso zzso at the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso to zzso the regulatory principles zzso The zzso zzso consists of a sequence of six zzso along the template at which the zzso complex is sufficiently zzso to make zzso release zzso Within this zzso of zzso for termination the termination efficiency zzso at each template position is determined by a kinetic competition between alternative reaction pathways that lead either to zzso or to zzso TE values at each position within zzso have been mapped as a function of zzso zzso and it is shown that N protein (in the presence of zzso and a nut zzso the minimal system for zzso zzso can offset increases in TE that are induced by limiting the zzso of each of the next required zzso By limiting zzso zzso or working at low temperature we show that a significant effect of N within the minimal system is to increase the rate of transcript zzso three- to fivefold at most positions along the zzso Assuming that a comparable increase in zzso rate applies at template positions within the zzso we show that an increase of this magnitude is not sufficient to account for the zzso efficiency observed and that an approximately zzso stabilization of the zzso complex at intrinsic termination sites as a consequence of binding the zzso zzso zzso must be invoked as zzso A general method for zzso TE effects in zzso between changes in zzso rate and termination complex stability is demonstrated, based on competing free energy of zzso barriers for the zzso and termination zzso The analysis and utility of such mixed modes of zzso regulation are considered in general zzso
