To verify whether zzso gene zzso among Chinese patients feature different types and zzso from other zzso 

zzso zzso probe amplification zzso in combination with multiplex zzso zzso and/or short tandem repeat zzso linkage analysis were applied in a large series of Chinese families affected with zzso muscular zzso zzso or Becker muscular zzso zzso There were a total of 19 cases seeking prenatal diagnosis during their second zzso 

Of the 59 family trios zzso with zzso and 8 with zzso 40 were found to have carried various zzso of the zzso zzso In addition to deletions and zzso within the zzso hotspots identified by both methods, 10 zzso missed by zzso were detected by zzso among which at least 3 were of rare zzso Combined zzso and linkage analysis also achieved prenatal diagnoses in all of the 19 zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso gene among Chinese patients showed a diverse spectrum, with similarity to as well as discrepancies from other zzso For the comprehensive coverage of all zzso of the zzso zzso zzso should be the method of choice for initial screening of zzso zzso When combined with zzso analysis, it can achieve diagnosis in as much as zzso of all referred zzso
