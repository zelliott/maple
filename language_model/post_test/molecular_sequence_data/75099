Three group I zzso of zzso T4 have been compared with respect to their sequence and structural zzso The zzso include the zzso intervening zzso as well as the two newly described zzso in the zzso and zzso genes of zzso The T4 zzso are very closely zzso containing zzso zzso sequence elements that allow them to be folded into a core structure that is characteristic of zzso group zzso zzso zzso extend outward to the zzso sequences surrounding the three zzso All three zzso contain open reading frames zzso Although the zzso zzso are not zzso and occur at different positions, all three zzso are zzso of the structure models, with only the 3' ends of each of the zzso extending into the secondary zzso This arrangement invites interesting speculations on the regulation of zzso by zzso The high degree of similarity between the T4 zzso and the zzso group I zzso must reflect a common zzso resulting either from vertical acquisition of a primordial zzso element or from horizontal zzso
