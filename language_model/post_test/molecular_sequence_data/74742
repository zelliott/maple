A zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly curved zzso bacterial strain was isolated from black sand collected from zzso zzso island, zzso The strain, designated zzso was able to grow in the presence of zzso % zzso at temperatures of zzso degrees C and at pH zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso and sensitive to the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso was characterized based on zzso zzso zzso features and zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The isolate required sodium zzso for growth and zzso a wide range of compounds as sole sources of carbon and zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belongs to the class zzso It was found to be associated with the zzso zzso and was zzso related most closely to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso However, zzso zzso experiments between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a level of zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso data suggested that zzso should be placed in the zzso zzso as representing a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
