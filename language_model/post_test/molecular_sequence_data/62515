According to the current zzso model of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso it contains a zzso zzso charged zzso zzso which was shown to play an important role in zzso zzso To further zzso the role of this zzso recognition zzso various zzso replacements were zzso Surprisingly, studies with neutral zzso zzso showed that, unlike many zzso systems where the size and chemical properties of binding site zzso are relatively zzso zzso zzso a variety of changes at position 26, including size, zzso and zzso Moreover, although efficient transport of positively charged zzso requires a negative charge at position 26 zzso or zzso zzso of this charge does not always abrogate the interaction of zzso with zzso drugs, thus demonstrating that the negative charge does not play an essential role in the zzso transport zzso zzso these results suggest a link between the broad zzso specificity profile of zzso zzso and the structural and chemical zzso at their zzso recognition zzso
