Two novel protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso by zzso Both contain common zzso of zzso zzso but lack a putative zzso domain so that they may belong to the zzso zzso Gene disruption of zzso and zzso establishes that they share an overlapping essential function for cell zzso zzso of a single zzso deletion display severe defects in cell zzso they are irregular and sometimes zzso instead of zzso In contrast, the induced zzso of zzso is zzso producing zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso genes are involved in the polarity of cell growth zzso We show that zzso is zzso to zzso a locus we have previously identified by its zzso to zzso a potent protein zzso inhibitor zzso et zzso (1991) Genes zzso 5, zzso In addition, the lethal zzso of zzso can be suppressed by zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are molecular targets of this zzso
