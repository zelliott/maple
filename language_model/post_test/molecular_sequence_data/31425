zzso P zzso P) is a zzso complex essential for the processing of zzso leader sequences of precursor zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of human zzso P protein zzso involved in the zzso of zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso probably by promoting zzso zzso zzso and zzso strand displacement zzso Although zzso folds into the zzso recognition motif zzso it is distinct from the typical zzso in that it has an zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and structural data have shown that the zzso of zzso through the loop between zzso and zzso is required for the zzso of zzso In addition, zzso has additional zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso which pack against one face of the zzso In this study, we examined the contribution of the zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso indicated that deletion of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly influenced on the zzso zzso activity and abolished AN and zzso activities, while that of zzso had little effect on these zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso showed that deletion of the loop between zzso and zzso had no influence on the AN and zzso zzso Further zzso analyses suggested that basic zzso at zzso are involved in interaction with zzso while zzso zzso at zzso participate in interaction with zzso zzso at the zzso thereby stabilizing an appropriate orientation of the zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso elements in the zzso in zzso play a crucial role in the zzso of zzso
