zzso in higher zzso is often studied by the use of transient zzso zzso These experiments are performed by cloning putative zzso zzso elements zzso a promoter or zzso with a reporter gene that codes for a protein not expressed by the target zzso Although this approach is useful in many cases, the limited sensitivity of reporter zzso can prevent studies in cases where few cells are zzso or efficiency of zzso is zzso We present an alternative zzso zzso are zzso with a zzso containing a promoter with a human growth hormone zzso reporter zzso After an incubation period, zzso is isolated, and DNA complementary to the growth hormone zzso is zzso The reporter zzso concentration is measured by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso We have designed zzso zzso that span the zzso zzso sites of the human growth hormone zzso these ensure exclusive amplification of the zzso zzso and not the reporter zzso The zzso is sensitive and simple to perform, requires no special equipment, and can zzso reporter zzso concentration over a broad zzso
