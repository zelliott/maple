zzso delivered to B cells via zzso can zzso with those provided by other B cell surface receptors to induce B cell proliferation and zzso class switching as well as zzso zzso production and cell zzso Recently, it has been shown that the zzso for zzso is a cell surface protein of approximately 39 zzso expressed by activated T cells, zzso Here we report on the isolation and characterization of a zzso clone zzso human zzso a type II membrane protein with zzso to zzso and the construction and characterization of a soluble zzso form of zzso zzso cell zzso expressing zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso to drive strong B cell proliferation and alone were able to drive B cells to zzso zzso In all cases the B cell proliferation induced by zzso zzso cells was reduced to background levels by the addition of soluble zzso Unlike zzso zzso cells, zzso soluble zzso was not zzso alone and required zzso to drive B cell zzso These results suggest that B cells require a second signal besides zzso to drive proliferation and that soluble zzso alone in a zzso bound form is able to provide zzso signals to B zzso
