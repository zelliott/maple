The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso presents the sequence zzso a known zzso zzso zzso domain zzso 735 to zzso of zzso zzso in an zzso site of the zzso type 1 strain of zzso Of 10 zzso zzso raised against the sequence as presented in zzso eight were shown to neutralize zzso zzso in zzso whereas all 10 neutralized zzso suggesting that the presentation of the sequence is comparable between zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were characterized by the selection of escape zzso from zzso and by zzso zzso The two methods gave similar results, identifying two zzso involving zzso acids corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso and to zzso zzso to 750 of zzso zzso selected in the zzso with zzso zzso are identical or similar to changes occurring in zzso in natural zzso of zzso This finding suggests that the zzso may be significant in the zzso of zzso in zzso
