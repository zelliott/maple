A tobacco zzso zzso of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The coding region of zzso is similar in sequence zzso for DNA and zzso for the deduced zzso acid zzso to zzso genes of the zzso zzso and zzso strains of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern analyses showed that zzso is zzso by a small gene family derived from the zzso zzso of zzso This suggests that zzso resulted from an ancient transfer of DNA between zzso zzso and a zzso of modern zzso zzso of zzso were detected in three zzso distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso accumulated in young leaves and shoot tips, but not in lower leaves and roots of mature zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cultured leaf zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and induced by zzso These results are of particular interest because they suggest that a gene of bacterial origin introduced during evolution can have a function in a modern zzso
