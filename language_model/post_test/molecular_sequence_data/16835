In order to investigate the factors that determine the correct folding of zzso growth zzso zzso repeats within a zzso zzso we prepared a series of six peptides that, taken together, span the sequence of two zzso repeats of human zzso a large protein from the zzso zzso The peptides were selected by sliding a window of the average length of zzso zzso repeats over the sequence of zzso repeats 13 and zzso We thus obtained six zzso zzso to zzso that are 33 zzso long, contain six zzso each, and bear a partial overlap in the zzso While zzso zzso to the native zzso zzso the others are zzso zzso zzso We carried out the zzso folding of these peptides in zzso analyzed the reaction zzso by acid zzso followed by zzso and isolated some of the resulting zzso The zzso folding of the native zzso zzso is fast, produces a single zzso species with an zzso zzso zzso and a marked difference in the zzso retention time compared with the starting zzso On the contrary, zzso peptides fold more slowly and give zzso of zzso species displaying zzso retention times that are closer to those of the reduced zzso In contrast to the native zzso the zzso products that could be isolated are mainly zzso as determined by CD and zzso zzso We conclude that both zzso and thermodynamics drive the correct pairing of zzso and speculate about how zzso zzso could trigger zzso zzso in zzso
