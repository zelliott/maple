The first generation of candidate vaccines to prevent zzso infection consisted of zzso envelope proteins zzso zzso and zzso derived from a single laboratory strain of zzso designated zzso but produced with different expression zzso In this study we examined the fine specificity of the human zzso response to each vaccine and compared them to the responses of laboratory workers infected with the same strain of zzso The best zzso from each vaccine protocol were studied and zzso zzso comparisons of the fine specificity of the zzso response were possible because all zzso zzso were performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and virus zzso Although the total amounts of zzso zzso were comparable, the groups exhibited significant differences in zzso zzso zzso and functional capacity of the zzso zzso The data demonstrate that the form of the zzso zzso live virus or zzso zzso is important in determining the quality of the zzso zzso zzso are also drawn regarding characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso These studies represent one of the most detailed analyses of the human zzso response to any zzso and have implications for the development of vaccines for zzso as well as for other microbial zzso
