zzso satellite zzso are generally located in zzso zzso yet little is known about how they are maintained and zzso In an effort to address this question, we have searched for specific satellite zzso proteins in zzso extracts (both total cellular and zzso prepared from zzso cells, using southwestern zzso Four zzso were detected that specifically bound to a human zzso zzso zzso satellite II DNA, which consists in large part of zzso repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso units, but not to a control probe from zzso zzso These proteins have apparent molecular weights of 100, 93, 77 and 34 zzso and were termed satellite binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
