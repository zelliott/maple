The zzso zzso V zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso factor as well as a protective zzso Recently, two main types of zzso represented by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso have been identified and it has been suggested, that zzso generated against one type are unable to protect against zzso zzso carrying the other zzso By using a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso type we show here, that actively zzso mice were completely protected against challenge with both, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, passive protection was possible with zzso rabbit zzso However, while a single zzso dose zzso zzso was sufficient to protect against challenge with zzso zzso zzso repetitive injections at intervals of 2 to 3 days were needed to protect against challenge with zzso zzso zzso The apparent difference in protection correlated with a rapid disappearance of zzso from the circulation by days 3 to zzso The data therefore zzso that expression of distinct types of zzso by zzso zzso does not necessarily exclude zzso in mice zzso with the other type of zzso It rather appears, that differences in zzso between zzso species relate to the amount of zzso zzso Finally, as revealed by the lack of zzso killing and the lack of zzso of zzso with zzso evidence is provided to indicate that zzso does not occur via zzso or complement zzso
