The zzso of the gamma chain of zzso contains a sequence which is believed to be one of the zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso to support zzso zzso A normal zzso of zzso exists in which the four zzso zzso acids are replaced by 20 zzso zzso This zzso known as zzso has been reported to bind less effectively to zzso The purpose of the present study was to engineer novel proteins to determine what differences in zzso acid sequence between the gamma and zzso chains influence the interaction of the zzso with zzso In this regard, the gamma chain zzso in a bacterial zzso expression zzso was modified by zzso zzso to produce zzso gamma chains with zzso acid changes in the zzso which reflect the differences between gamma and zzso The zzso gamma chain with an unmodified zzso supported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the same extent as intact zzso In contrast, the ability of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso (where the 16 zzso acid zzso extension zzso was added to the zzso of zzso to support zzso zzso was markedly zzso In addition, the extent of zzso zzso zzso was decreased in the presence of zzso 411 (where zzso acids zzso in gamma were replaced with zzso acids zzso in zzso while gamma 407 (where the four zzso zzso acids were zzso was not capable of supporting zzso These findings demonstrate that the four zzso zzso are not only required but must be zzso to support zzso zzso
