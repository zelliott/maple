The possibility of using the zzso raised in rabbits against the zzso 25 zzso zzso 32 and 89 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso for the differentiation and identification of the protein components in bovine immature zzso was zzso Although the zzso of these zzso against bovine zzso proteins were weaker than those against the zzso zzso it was found that these zzso could differentiate and demonstrate zzso a characteristic distribution of three different kinds of zzso protein components in the bovine zzso stage zzso similar to those observed in the zzso immature zzso Of the several high molecular weight proteins being zzso to the zzso 32 and 89 zzso zzso zzso the 130 zzso zzso having the highest molecular weight, was extracted and zzso from the bovine zzso sample which was obtained by peeling approximately zzso thickness of the zzso layer of the zzso stage zzso The zzso acid composition of the 130 zzso protein was similar to the known bovine zzso and was rich in zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso The results could suggest that the zzso of lower molecular weight than this zzso which are found in the bovine zzso stage zzso are derived from this precursor zzso
