zzso zzso products of zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso are considered to be important for the development and survival of the zzso within the zzso To gain insight in the composition of these zzso products of both zzso zzso zzso and adult life stages of zzso zzso libraries of the zzso were zzso with zzso rabbit serum raised against these zzso zzso This approach led to the identification of 41 zzso amongst which are structural proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins such as those involved in protein zzso different zzso pathways or zzso functioning and proteins associated with stress zzso shock zzso or zzso zzso zzso A large number of the isolated proteins were similar to hypothetical proteins of the model zzso zzso zzso Because zzso proteins can be zzso released during in zzso zzso as zzso zzso it was checked if the isolated proteins are genuinely zzso The zzso acid sequences of the translated zzso were investigated for signal peptides and zzso zzso against the isolated proteins were zzso and used to develop Western blots of zzso and zzso zzso In this manner it could be proven that 15 zzso code for genuine zzso zzso The identification of these zzso zzso allows to select proteins with potential protective zzso which are targets for vaccine zzso
