We present a zzso zzso model for DNA zzso zzso which is based on the finite stacking zzso used in zzso zzso zzso Within this model, the zzso of stacking zzso is shown to be responsible for the sharpness of calculated melting zzso zzso and molecular dynamics calculations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed model leads to a good agreement with known experimental results for both homogeneous and zzso zzso
