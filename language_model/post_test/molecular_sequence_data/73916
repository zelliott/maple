To enhance and steer immune responses to synthetic zzso vaccines toward selected functional types and to understand the cooperative action of zzso in zzso the immune response, we attempted to influence the in zzso zzso environment by delivering zzso directly to the zzso in which the immune response is zzso Here we study the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso incorporated with zzso in zzso on a variety of responses zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso production and message, and zzso zzso We show zzso to be the single most effective zzso for enhancing both cellular and zzso immunity to two previously characterized zzso MN vaccine zzso Novel synergies were also zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso induction in zzso mice zzso with suppression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso with zzso but by a different zzso inducing zzso production in zzso mice and thus shifting the response to a zzso zzso The results presented here suggest that in addition to zzso optimum induction of zzso zzso in zzso requires a combination of zzso including zzso (probably acting to enhance zzso presentation and zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso the zzso response toward zzso zzso
