In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates expression of genes involved in zzso metabolism in response to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates expression by binding to specific zzso sequences and either promoting zzso termination or blocking translation zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso synthesis of an zzso protein zzso which forms a complex with zzso and zzso its zzso In this report, we investigate the structural features of zzso required for AT zzso A collection of zzso zzso proteins was examined that were known to be partially or completely defective in zzso binding and/or zzso zzso zzso of AT interactions with these proteins were performed using in zzso zzso termination zzso and zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso proteins that had lost the ability to bind zzso were no longer recognized by zzso Our findings suggest that AT acts by competing with zzso zzso for the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso AT was also shown to interact with zzso proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that the structural elements required for AT recognition are zzso in the zzso proteins of these zzso zzso of AT interaction with zzso zzso zzso at 60 degrees C demonstrated that AT is active at this elevated zzso
