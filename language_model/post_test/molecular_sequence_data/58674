Previously, two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso namely the C zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and the A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the spike S protein zzso have been separately expressed on the zzso zzso at the surface of zzso coli following zzso into a same region of zzso However, the resulting zzso induced a marginal zzso zzso zzso response in zzso Here, with the view to improving this response, we introduced zzso alone or in different tandem association with zzso zzso or zzso in twelve zzso exposed regions of zzso Among the 28 resulting engineered proteins only 15, carrying up to 51 extra zzso had not essentially disturbed the correct zzso zzso formation zzso Six partially zzso sites accepting only zzso and three highly zzso sites tolerating zzso or zzso tandem zzso were identified throughout zzso zzso bacteria or extracted zzso hybrid zzso expressing zzso zzso at any of the zzso sites, were recognized by zzso directed against the foreign parent zzso providing a direct argument for exposure of the corresponding zzso region at the cell surface and for zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The potential of zzso zzso as carriers of the zzso peptides indicates that there may be three positions (N zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso which may turn out to be important fusion sites and therefore be relevant for the eventual design of zzso zzso zzso zzso whatever its position in zzso zzso the partial zzso degradation of the hybrid zzso suggesting that it functions as a zzso for a cellular zzso and thereby that its suitability as a vaccine zzso candidate is zzso
