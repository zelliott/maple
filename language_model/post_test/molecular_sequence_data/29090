A novel zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a sample of zzso The results of zzso zzso sequence analysis placed this zzso in a cluster with zzso zzso However, the level of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso was less than zzso Moreover, the G + C contents of the zzso DNA were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso Because there were also differences in zzso properties and cellular fatty acid composition between the two organisms, we propose zzso as a novel species of zzso zzso This novel strain produces a new class of zzso an zzso stable zzso zzso that is suitable for use in zzso zzso The zzso contained 640 zzso acid zzso including a possible approximately zzso zzso in the zzso and a unique stretch of approximately 160 zzso acids in the zzso regions zzso mature zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso half after the putative zzso zzso and the zzso zzso extension shared local similarity to internal segments of a zzso zzso zzso of a marine microbial zzso and the zzso zzso zzso precursors of the slime mold zzso zzso and to the zzso half of a zzso alkaline zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso
