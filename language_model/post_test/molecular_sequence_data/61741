The zzso Genome Database zzso zzso a scientific database of the molecular biology and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has recently developed several new resources that allow the comparison and integration of information on a zzso scale, enabling the user not only to find detailed information about individual zzso but also to make connections across groups of genes with common features and across different zzso The zzso zzso zzso displays alignments of sequences from multiple zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso tool displays zzso alignments of each zzso protein with similar proteins from any species whose sequences are contained in the zzso zzso protein data set at zzso The zzso zzso Pathways tool zzso groups of genes by their common roles in metabolism and displays the zzso pathways in a zzso zzso Finally, the Find zzso Features search interface provides a versatile tool for zzso multiple types of information in zzso
