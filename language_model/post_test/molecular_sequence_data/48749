The zzso zzso proteins are likely to play an important role in inflammation and immune zzso Like the B7 protein family, many human and zzso zzso members have been shown to control T zzso response, and zzso in human zzso have been linked to several inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary zzso inflammatory zzso disease and zzso zzso 

In this study we provide a comprehensive population, zzso and zzso analysis of a zzso deletion copy number zzso zzso located within two zzso zzso of two genes belonging to the zzso family, namely zzso and zzso We confirm the presence of a novel zzso zzso product, and show an influence of the deletion zzso on the expression level of several genes involved in immune function, including zzso another member of the same zzso Moreover, by zzso zzso and human diversity panel zzso samples, we demonstrate a clear difference in the zzso of the zzso zzso frequency between major zzso human zzso 

Despite tremendous progress in the field of structural variation, rather few zzso have been functionally characterized so zzso Here, we show clear functional consequences of a new deletion zzso zzso with potentially important implication in the human immune system and in inflammatory and zzso zzso In addition, the marked population differences found of zzso zzso suggest that this deletion zzso might have evolved under positive selection due to environmental conditions in some zzso with potential zzso zzso
