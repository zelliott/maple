zzso proteins have been established as important zzso of signal zzso zzso The insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins represent a critical group of scaffold proteins that are required for signal zzso by the insulin zzso including the zzso of zzso 3 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso represent a different group of scaffold molecules that are implicated in the regulation of the zzso These two signaling pathways are functionally linked because zzso can zzso zzso on the negative regulatory site zzso Here we demonstrate the physical association of these signaling pathways using a zzso approach that identified zzso complexes of zzso together with zzso scaffold zzso Studies using mice with zzso scaffold protein defects confirm that the zzso and zzso proteins are required for normal zzso zzso Together, these observations demonstrate that zzso proteins can influence zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso zzso
