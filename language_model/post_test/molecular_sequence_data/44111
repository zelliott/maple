zzso is a zzso zzso gene with specific expression in zzso cells during embryonic chick zzso It encodes a zzso motor protein localized along the zzso arm during zzso suggesting that the protein may be a component of the zzso yet poorly understood zzso zzso hypothesized to be involved in controlling the direction and speed of zzso zzso We have isolated human zzso with zzso zzso we demonstrated zzso that zzso was present at a much higher level in cultured zzso cells than in primary cultures of human zzso zzso The increase in zzso was particularly prominent in zzso cells, whereas in primary cultures of zzso zzso cells were predominantly zzso zzso These observations imply a deregulation of zzso in zzso zzso Data presented here may be useful in designing strategies to zzso zzso movement and cell proliferation with either zzso zzso or specific zzso and hence may set the stage for further investigations of the involvement of zzso motor molecules in zzso under normal and pathological zzso
