zzso zzso sites act to zzso signals into changes in zzso activity, representing a point of interaction within a regulatory zzso The zzso acid sequence surrounding a zzso site may well have several functions, including recognition by an appropriate zzso By generating random zzso in its immediate vicinity, we have examined the sequence requirements of a regulatory zzso zzso site, zzso in the zzso product, zzso The transforming and zzso activities of zzso are zzso by zzso of zzso zzso were made around zzso without changing zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and classified as transforming or zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a surprising variety of zzso zzso although zzso zzso were present at positions 518 and zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained zzso changes at zzso and zzso demonstrated the importance of these zzso Other transforming zzso contained two or more zzso but the results are most simply explained if zzso zzso and zzso are also important for normal zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso We conclude that only a few of the zzso in the zzso zzso other than zzso are required to ensure normal zzso and repression of activity in zzso Other zzso may have been zzso during evolution to permit normal function and regulation in other cell zzso
