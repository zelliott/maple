The zzso zzso must zzso with Max to bind DNA and perform its zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds DNA through a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso motif and it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso could, in concert with the zzso regions, provide the specificity and stability of the zzso zzso In this context, we have zzso the peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of Max and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and studied their zzso behavior using zzso zzso and CD zzso The preferential formation of a fully zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso was observed under zzso and zzso conditions at neutral zzso We show that the stability and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is modulated by zzso with a maximum around pH zzso supporting the existence of stabilizing and specific zzso zzso zzso We present a molecular model of the zzso zzso zzso describing potential zzso interactions responsible for the specificity of the interaction, the main feature being putative buried zzso interactions between a zzso zzso (in the Max zzso zzso and two zzso acid zzso (in the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This model is supported by the fact that the apparent zzso (as determined by zzso zzso of this zzso zzso at 25 degrees C is zzso zzso zzso zzso units higher in the folded form than in the unfolded zzso This indicates that the charged zzso zzso contributes approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of stabilization free energy to the zzso zzso zzso through favorable zzso zzso
