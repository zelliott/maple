In zzso in rats infected zzso with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso product zzso was previously shown by us to be a zzso and preventive zzso In order to explore the part played by zzso in tumor suppression, DNA was extracted from zzso zzso and from slow or rapid growing zzso induced by zzso injection of the zzso The zzso signal from extracted DNA was analyzed by zzso The zzso zzso gene signal was detected in most zzso and found to be generally amplified in rapid growing zzso and in some zzso Several zzso zzso showing varying zzso in gel were seen in most zzso and some zzso with or without the zzso zzso zzso In slow growing zzso and zzso induced in hosts that were zzso with zzso induced zzso zzso and proved to carry zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso gene was found to be zzso and zzso zzso were found to be reduced in number or zzso These results suggest that the development of zzso zzso is associated with the growth potential of cells carrying the zzso zzso and that host immunity to zzso product influences the development of zzso zzso and results in slow and suppressed growth of tumors caused by zzso infection with zzso
