A gene cluster zzso containing three duplicated zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso was characterized in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso have a limited zzso to those of zzso zzso but do not have zzso among currently characterized insect zzso The zzso genes belong to a new family, named zzso that also includes genes from zzso zzso frog, and a zzso related zzso zzso zzso All members of the zzso family are expressed in specific regions of the embryonic gut, where they seem to affect zzso and cell zzso The three zzso of zzso described here are contained within nearly identical direct tandem zzso The zzso region produces at least two zzso one present in both zzso and adults and the other only in early zzso Early zzso expression is restricted to specific regions of the zzso zzso in 12 zzso zzso zzso stripes of zzso cells found at the positions where the zzso will zzso to form the 11 zzso of the zzso A role in the development of zzso zzso structures in an initially homogeneous zzso is proposed for zzso
