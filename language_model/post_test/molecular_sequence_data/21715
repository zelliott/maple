zzso zzso are the major protein components of zzso circulating in the red blood, but can serve additional functions besides the transport of zzso Here, the zzso of the bloody clam zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and was found to be zzso in zzso consisting of an open reading frame of zzso zzso a zzso of 147 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared zzso similarity with zzso from two species of the zzso zzso and zzso similarity with the zzso proteins from other zzso The zzso structure of bloody clam zzso was predicted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared with that of zzso zzso The zzso transcript of zzso was detected in all of the clam zzso zzso including zzso the zzso muscle, foot, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso expression of zzso was significantly zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso challenge, indicating that zzso was involved in the immune zzso responses against bacterial infection and exposure to bacterial zzso zzso As the first functional research on the zzso protein in bloody zzso our findings provide new insight into the innate immune zzso mechanisms of zzso and other zzso
