The zzso characteristics of five bacterial strains which were isolated from Antarctic coastal marine environments were zzso These bacteria were zzso zzso and gram negative with polar zzso The G + C contents of the zzso of these strains were 41 to 42 zzso The Antarctic strains were zzso distinct from the previously described zzso type zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the new strains were closely related to each other but clearly different from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were the most zzso similar zzso None of the bacterial zzso was capable of using zzso zzso or zzso and all were capable of gelatin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso had an zzso requirement but required only 17 zzso zzso zzso DNA G + C content, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, fatty acid zzso and protein profile data confirmed the identification of the Antarctic strains as members of a zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for these zzso
