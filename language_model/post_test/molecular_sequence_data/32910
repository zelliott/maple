zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 5 zzso is expressed zzso in various zzso and is considered to participate in many cellular zzso zzso has a zzso domain in the zzso region and three zzso repeat zzso motifs in the zzso region, which are suspected to function as a zzso interaction zzso zzso roles of zzso are still largely unknown, although several zzso proteins were reported and a few in zzso functions of zzso were zzso In the present study, the effects of expression of the full-length zzso zzso fused with zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso cells induced zzso zzso with a zzso frequency compared to that of zzso zzso zzso were also substantially increased by induced moderate expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Many zzso cells expressing zzso possessed zzso separated from each other by nuclear zzso while expression of zzso induced zzso zzso which were zzso in shape, but not separated completely and were surrounded by one nuclear zzso These results suggest that zzso plays important roles at the zzso of the cell cycle, especially in separation of zzso and formation of nuclear zzso
