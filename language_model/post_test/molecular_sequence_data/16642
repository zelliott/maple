Plant zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso are small basic proteins that transport zzso between zzso On the basis of molecular mass, zzso are subdivided into zzso and zzso zzso are all zzso proteins stabilized by four zzso zzso zzso The existence of an internal zzso zzso running through the zzso is a typical characteristic of zzso that serves as the binding site for zzso zzso zzso are known to participate in plant defense, but the exact mechanism of their zzso action against zzso or bacteria is still zzso To trigger plant defense responses, a zzso at the plant surface needs to recognize the complex of a zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso share high structural similarities with zzso and need to be associated with a zzso zzso to stimulate a defense zzso In this study, binding of zzso molecules with rice zzso is analyzed using various zzso zzso zzso can accommodate a zzso zzso zzso but zzso binds only linear zzso zzso Although the zzso cavity of rice zzso is smaller than that of rice zzso it is flexible enough to accommodate the zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant for the zzso complex is approximately zzso zzso as measured by zzso exchange and mass zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso complex structure give interesting clues about the reason for differential binding zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex and free zzso revealed the zzso involved in zzso
