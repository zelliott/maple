The aim of protein design is to predict zzso sequences compatible with a given target zzso zzso envisioned as a purely zzso question, this problem can also be understood in a wider context, where additional constraints are captured by learning the sequence patterns displayed by natural proteins of known zzso In this latter perspective, however, we still need a theoretical zzso of the question, leading to general and efficient learning methods, and allowing for the selection of fast and accurate objective functions zzso zzso zzso 

We propose a zzso of the protein design problem in terms of zzso statistical zzso Our framework uses the maximum likelihood principle to zzso the unknown parameters of a statistical potential, which we call an inverse potential to contrast with classical zzso used for structure zzso We propose an zzso based on zzso chain zzso zzso in which the likelihood is zzso by zzso descent and is zzso estimated by zzso zzso The fit of the models is evaluated by zzso We apply this to a simple zzso contact potential, supplemented with a zzso term, and show that the resulting models have a better zzso power than currently available zzso zzso Furthermore, the model comparison method presented here allows one to measure the relative contribution of each component of the potential, and to choose the optimal number of accessibility classes, which turns out to be much higher than classically zzso 

Altogether, this zzso makes it possible to test a wide diversity of models, using different forms of zzso or accounting for other factors than just the constraint of zzso zzso Ultimately, such zzso statistical analyses may help to understand the forces shaping protein zzso and driving their zzso
