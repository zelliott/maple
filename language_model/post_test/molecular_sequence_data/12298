The zzso zzso promoter zzso is positively regulated by two zzso signal zzso zzso zzso which signals anabolic N status, and zzso which signals prevailing zzso zzso Yet, zzso response zzso product per unit zzso to these two zzso signals together is more than twice that of the zzso individual zzso In the absence of zzso a negative zzso zzso the fully induced zzso response is more than zzso greater than that of zzso individual zzso Given this zzso these two signal zzso pathways must zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso carries three zzso zzso an zzso which presumably binds zzso a zzso which presumably binds zzso itself, and a zzso 54 box, which presumably binds zzso 54 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso For zzso analysis, single, zzso and triple promoter zzso were constructed in these zzso zzso and zzso activities were measured in six different zzso background, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wild zzso Under all zzso conditions zzso high-level zzso activity required both zzso in trans and the zzso element in zzso Surprisingly, because zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso this zzso element mediates both negative and positive zzso Because zzso zzso also required a zzso upstream zzso element, even in the absence of zzso a second upstream zzso zzso start superimposed on the zzso element was zzso When zzso zzso zzso start points were mapped by primer extension, both a minor upstream zzso starting 45 zzso zzso to the zzso and a major downstream transcript starting 10 zzso zzso to the zzso 54 box were zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso are zzso by a zzso family, which includes zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso show an zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso are zzso multiple zzso 54 initiators are functionally zzso Two independent zzso zzso both show a tight zzso zzso Moreover, zzso product zzso zzso is absolutely required for high-level zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso gene carries overlapping zzso and zzso zzso promoters which zzso respond to different zzso zzso the upstream, zzso promoter responds to zzso and positively regulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter responds to zzso and zzso regulates the upstream, zzso zzso In terms of transcript yield, the upstream, zzso promoter is therefore weak, and the zzso zzso zzso promoter is zzso
