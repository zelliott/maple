In order to characterize the mouse zzso of the zzso zzso which has not yet been identified by zzso means, zzso clones zzso zzso mouse zzso have been isolated by zzso with a zzso probe for rat zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the putative mouse zzso protein is consistent with that of a zzso zzso zzso it consists of an zzso region of 186 zzso acids bearing six potential zzso sites, a zzso zzso segment of 25 zzso and a large zzso region of 116 zzso acids rich in zzso and basic zzso zzso with the human and rat zzso sequences clearly indicated the predicted mouse protein to be the mouse zzso zzso evolutionary zzso between zzso zzso and human zzso were found in their zzso region, suggesting a functional consequence of that segment for the zzso role of zzso such as signal zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the expression of zzso in T zzso and in the zzso cell lineage in zzso These data strongly suggest that the putative mouse zzso zzso may perform some zzso functions in mouse T zzso and zzso cells as documented in zzso
