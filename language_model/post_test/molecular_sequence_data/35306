Key cellular processes are frequently accompanied by zzso shape changes in the plasma zzso zzso protein zzso generate zzso by means of complex interactions with the membrane zzso The way they assemble and the mechanism by which they operate are largely dependent on their binding zzso Although the mechanism at lower zzso has recently begun to emerge, how membrane scaffolds form at high zzso remains zzso By combining electron zzso and zzso simulations, we show that zzso proteins at high zzso can transform a zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso We show that this process is a consequence of excess adhesive energy combined with the local stiffening of the zzso which occurs in a narrow range of mechanical properties of both the membrane and the zzso We show that zzso diffusion is significantly reduced by protein binding at this density regime and even more in areas of high zzso zzso indicating a potential effect on molecular transport in zzso Finally, we reveal that the breaking of the zzso zzso is accompanied by the zzso arrangement of the protein on the surface, a structural motif that likely drives the formation of zzso structures in living zzso
