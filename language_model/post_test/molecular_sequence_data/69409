The zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are organized in zzso repeated gene groups, each containing the four core zzso genes plus an zzso zzso These repetitive gene groups are found at five different zzso linked on one zzso zzso In addition to the clustered gene groups an isolated zzso gene group exists which is found zzso separated on a different zzso zzso gene zzso These zzso genes have been cloned and zzso in zzso zzso sequence and in zzso zzso data suggest that the zzso gene group was established early during zzso zzso possibly by a zzso zzso This allowed the genes to be moved as an zzso zzso The comparison of zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso indicates that the early spatial separation of the zzso genes from their zzso organized relatives may have zzso divergent sequence zzso This is particularly true for the zzso zzso zzso which has zzso considerably by unusual zzso zzso The zzso of normally clustered genes to new zzso sites may zzso the generation of sequence zzso which could fulfill specialized functional zzso
