The zzso zzso factor zzso family of proteins interact with zzso zzso and filaments in a zzso zzso When zzso binds zzso it zzso a change in the zzso twist and zzso it also zzso the zzso of zzso from the pointed ends of zzso thereby increasing zzso or zzso Using zzso zzso we characterized the two zzso sites on human zzso One target site was chosen because we previously showed that the zzso head piece competes with zzso for binding to zzso Limited sequence zzso between zzso and the part of the zzso zzso essential for zzso binding suggested an zzso site on zzso involving a structural loop at the opposite end of the zzso to the zzso already implicated in zzso zzso zzso through the zzso is primarily to zzso zzso whereas the loop region is specifically involved in filament zzso We have characterized the zzso binding properties of each site independently of the zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso in the loop region zzso binding to zzso but not to zzso Using the zzso analogous to the zzso form of zzso zzso we show that filament binding is inhibited at zzso zzso strength but not under low salt zzso At low zzso strength, this zzso zzso both the twist change and fragmentation characteristic of zzso zzso but does not activate zzso zzso The results suggest a zzso binding to zzso initiated by association through the loop site, followed by interaction with the adjacent zzso through the zzso site at the opposite end of the zzso Together, these interactions induce twist and fragmentation of zzso but the twist change itself is not responsible for the enhanced rate of zzso zzso release from zzso
