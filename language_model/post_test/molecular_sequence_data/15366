zzso zzso II zzso and III zzso are zzso zzso diseases caused by a zzso of alpha and/or beta zzso of the zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso gene in 25 zzso II and 15 zzso III Japanese zzso In most zzso II patients, the clinical conditions zzso zzso zzso without zzso and zzso single zzso were zzso however, the frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and/or zzso did not differ between zzso II and III zzso We detected zzso in zzso in 73 of 80 zzso Fourteen new zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Previously reported zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso causing skipping of zzso zzso zzso or compound zzso of nonsense and zzso zzso contributed to the severe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributed to the attenuated zzso although coupled with nonsense zzso These results show the effective molecular diagnosis of zzso II and III and also provide zzso zzso This is the first and comprehensive report of molecular analysis for zzso patients of Japanese zzso
