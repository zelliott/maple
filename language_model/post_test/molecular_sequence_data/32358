Although human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is low, it may influence levels of protein expression and, in some cases, has been associated with pregnancy zzso Apart from the 23 zzso zzso including a zzso zzso known as zzso a zzso deletion or zzso in the zzso region also contributes to the zzso gene zzso In order to discover any correlation between the zzso deletion zzso and pregnancy diseases, we isolated the zzso DNA from 24 zzso spontaneous abortions zzso patients and 88 normal fertile control individuals using the salted out zzso zzso of zzso gene of the two groups was amplified by zzso chain reaction, respectively, and analyzed by zzso on zzso zzso zzso gel and stained with zzso zzso zzso between the two groups were compared using the zzso zzso The results were there was no significant difference in zzso zzso of zzso deletion zzso between normal control and zzso zzso frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso patients as compared with normal fertile zzso Our results are similar to a study of Indian women but contradictory to a study of Danish zzso This zzso may be due to ethnic zzso
