Success with zzso targeted drugs in the treatment of cancer has ignited extensive research efforts within the field of personalized zzso However, successful application of such therapies is dependent on the presence or absence of zzso within the patient's tumor that can zzso clinical efficacy or drug zzso Building on these findings, we developed a zzso zzso panel for the identification of frequently occurring and clinically relevant zzso in zzso An extensive literature search and interrogation of the zzso of zzso zzso in Cancer database identified more than 1,000 melanoma zzso zzso a filtering strategy to focus on zzso amenable to the development of targeted drugs, we initially screened 120 known zzso in zzso samples using the zzso zzso zzso A total of 252 zzso were detected in 17 zzso the highest frequency occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55, zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso Based on this initial discovery screen, a total of 46 zzso interrogating 39 zzso in 20 genes were designed to develop a zzso zzso These zzso were distributed in multiplexes over 8 zzso using strict zzso design parameters zzso for sensitive zzso zzso The final zzso zzso panel is a cost effective, sensitive, zzso approach for identifying zzso of clinical relevance to zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso When used in a clinical research setting, the panel may rapidly and accurately identify potentially effective treatment strategies using novel or existing zzso targeted zzso
