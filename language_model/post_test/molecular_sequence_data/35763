The zzso region of the human zzso gene was isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso This zzso clone contains a zzso pair zzso insert and produces seven fragments when zzso with the zzso restriction zzso We zzso one of the fragments that comprises zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 79 zzso of the first zzso and zzso zzso of the first zzso A major zzso start site was mapped by primer zzso The region immediately upstream from the zzso initiation site following the first zzso is abundant in G and C zzso In the promoter and zzso region within a zzso stretch zzso to zzso of the DNA, we found a zzso zzso box zzso zzso sequence zzso and sequences zzso to the consensus zzso binding site, zzso binding element zzso zzso two zzso zzso response elements zzso zzso an imperfect zzso zzso and a sequence resembling the chicken zzso upstream promoter zzso factor zzso binding site zzso The zzso binding site and the imperfect zzso shared five zzso zzso With the exception of the two zzso zzso the elements with very well matched sequences were also found in the corresponding positions in the mouse zzso zzso The synthetic zzso including the 26 zzso of zzso zzso was cloned before the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso reporter zzso These zzso plasmids were zzso zzso into human zzso zzso zzso cells to assess hormone zzso We found that the zzso element acted as an zzso in response to zzso zzso In zzso zzso I zzso analysis showed binding of the zzso zzso on the imperfect zzso In contrast to the mouse zzso zzso element, zzso does not interact with this element, as demonstrated by band shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms of the zzso action that govern the zzso gene expression differ between mouse and zzso
