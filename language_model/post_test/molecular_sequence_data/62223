zzso growth factors zzso signal through zzso zzso zzso receptors to regulate a diverse range of cellular zzso including cell growth, differentiation and migration, as well as cell zzso Here we identify zzso a member of a zzso zzso protein family, as a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and its expression is both induced after zzso and zzso after zzso of zzso zzso In zzso and zzso function experiments, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso and is blocked by zzso zzso 1, but not by expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso receptors zzso in zzso experiments in zzso and in zzso resonance energy transfer zzso in zzso The results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
