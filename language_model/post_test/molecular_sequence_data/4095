zzso is a cell division protein in zzso coli and zzso zzso In zzso coli the zzso gene was discovered as a result of a computer search of the zzso coli zzso designed to find potential interacting partners for cell division protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso was identified as an essential gene by using a zzso that zzso genes to an zzso zzso The role of zzso in cell division is supported by the zzso zzso depleted of zzso in both organisms form long zzso but DNA segregation is not zzso zzso zzso to the zzso site in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso to the zzso site depends on cell division proteins zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso placing zzso in the sequential dependency order of proteins zzso to the division zzso zzso of green fluorescent zzso also depends on zzso indicating that zzso and zzso zzso to the division site in zzso zzso Our results show zzso of proteins to the bacterial zzso in zzso coli and raise the possibility that these proteins interact in a zzso zzso
