zzso signaling zzso is implicated in zzso and zzso zzso signal is zzso to the zzso - zzso pathway, the zzso pathway, or the zzso zzso through zzso zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein interacting with zzso and is a negative regulator of the zzso - zzso - zzso signaling zzso zzso is a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, zzso gene fragments were identified in human zzso draft sequences by using zzso and zzso zzso were isolated by using zzso zzso gene consisted of at lest 7 zzso and zzso a zzso protein with 4 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Human zzso was zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was clustered with zzso 2 zzso gene in zzso manner zzso less than zzso zzso and zzso gene is mapped to human zzso zzso or linked to human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in size were expressed almost zzso in various normal zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was significantly zzso in a pancreatic cancer cell line zzso This is the first report on molecular cloning and characterization of zzso
