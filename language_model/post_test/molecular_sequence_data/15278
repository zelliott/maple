The zzso copper zzso of zzso zzso belongs to the family of heavy metal pumping zzso zzso and shares zzso sequence similarity with the human zzso and Wilson copper zzso Due to a lack of suitable protein zzso only partial three-dimensional structures have so far been obtained for this family of zzso zzso We present a structural model of zzso derived by combining zzso information obtained by zzso zzso with molecular zzso zzso zzso was zzso with different zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and identification of zzso peptides by mass zzso The structural proximity of zzso fragments provided information about the structural arrangement of the zzso protein zzso which was integrated into a three-dimensional model of zzso Comparative modeling of zzso was guided by the sequence similarity to the calcium zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for which detailed structures are zzso In addition, known partial structures of zzso zzso to zzso were used as modeling zzso A zzso approach was used to predict the orientation of the heavy metal binding domain of zzso relative to the core structure, which was verified by distance constraints derived from zzso The overall structural model of zzso resembles the zzso structure, but reveals distinctive features of zzso zzso A prominent feature is the positioning of the heavy metal binding zzso It features an orientation of the zzso binding zzso which is appropriate for the interaction with zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, a novel model of the architecture of the zzso zzso binding sites could be zzso
