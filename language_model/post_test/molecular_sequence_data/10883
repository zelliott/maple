The protein zzso derived from earthworm shock zzso is a zzso zzso zzso for zzso snakes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on its zzso zzso zzso acid zzso degenerative zzso zzso were zzso and used to screen a zzso library that was constructed in sense orientation using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A gene was cloned from a zzso chain reaction as well as from the zzso zzso A combination of the forward degenerative primer and zzso primer was used to obtain zzso DNA fragments, from which zzso were zzso and successfully used in screening the zzso zzso The zzso gene is about 700 base pairs long and encodes 208 zzso zzso The zzso gene was excised from a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso expression zzso and transformed into zzso coli strain zzso The selected zzso plasmids were transformed into expression host cell, zzso coli zzso Three zzso were selected, induced with zzso for fusion gene expression and an expressed zzso fusion protein zzso under zzso zzso This protein was zzso and gave a positive reaction against zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein that had not been zzso remained as an zzso and was an active zzso for zzso zzso
