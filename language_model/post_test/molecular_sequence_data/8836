A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso arrests in the zzso phase of the cell cycle at the restrictive temperature as a result of DNA damage that activates the zzso zzso The DNA zzso present after a failure of zzso function appear to be located almost exclusively in zzso regions, on the basis of the profile of induced zzso zzso zzso zzso cells dividing at the restrictive temperature contain zzso DNA corresponding to zzso and zzso DNA sequences and eventually lose zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso product functions in zzso zzso either in the replication of zzso DNA or in protecting zzso from the zzso break repair zzso Moreover, since zzso zzso cells divide at a zzso rate for several divisions at the restrictive temperature while zzso zzso cells arrest in zzso these results also suggest that zzso DNA may be a specific signal for the zzso zzso
