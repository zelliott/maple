zzso zzso catalyze the zzso attachment of zzso lipids zzso or zzso to a zzso near the C zzso of their zzso This study explored the specificity zzso for interactions between the zzso of zzso zzso and its protein zzso A series of zzso at zzso acid 149 of the zzso zzso were tested in combination with a series of zzso at the zzso zzso acid of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed when zzso charged zzso acids were present at zzso acid 149 of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid of the zzso protein zzso but not when like charges were present at these zzso This evidence for zzso interaction between zzso acid 149 and the zzso zzso acid of zzso protein zzso leads to the prediction that the zzso zzso acid of the protein zzso binds near zzso acid 149 of the zzso zzso zzso
