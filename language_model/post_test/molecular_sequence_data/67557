zzso zzso is an emerging zzso pathogen causing severe infections in pigs and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been identified using serum zzso The zzso zzso synthesis zzso locus is usually zzso among different strains of the same zzso The zzso zzso of 15 zzso have been zzso while the zzso of the other zzso remain zzso In the present study, two to six zzso genes of each of eight zzso zzso zzso 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 23, and 25, were identified using zzso with 93 zzso acid zzso specific to genes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for rapid and sensitive detection of the eight zzso were then zzso The zzso typing results of the 148 zzso zzso zzso were completely consistent with zzso zzso Furthermore, some zzso zzso and zzso strains which could not be differentiated by traditional serum zzso zzso were positive in the zzso zzso Use of the zzso zzso with clinical zzso specimens showed that the zzso are sensitive and able to identify samples with zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the zzso genes of the eight zzso zzso zzso and develop rapid and sensitive zzso zzso for the eight zzso which can be identified only by serum zzso
