Complete envelope genes were amplified from autopsy brain tissue of five individuals who had died of AIDS and had neurological zzso zzso zzso samples were included for two of the zzso zzso different envelope clones from the five patients had distinct zzso zzso Thirteen of the envelopes were functional and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso showed that most envelopes used both zzso and zzso One zzso envelope used a broad range of zzso while three other brain envelopes from one individual were restricted to zzso However, there was no correlation between tissue of origin and zzso zzso zzso showed two very distinct zzso depending on their capacity to zzso zzso and to exploit low levels of zzso and/or zzso for zzso zzso that were highly zzso and zzso for zzso were identified in brain tissue from four of the five zzso The enhanced zzso zzso correlated with reduced sensitivity to zzso by zzso a zzso zzso but not with sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso envelopes were able to zzso cells expressing low levels of zzso and/or zzso zzso with several zzso zzso envelopes showed that the four identified patient envelopes were at the top limit of zzso zzso In contrast, all four zzso zzso envelopes exhibited a zzso zzso and required high levels of zzso for zzso Our data support the presence of envelopes that are highly zzso and zzso for zzso in the brains of patients with neurological zzso These envelopes are able to zzso cells that express low levels of zzso and/or zzso and may have adapted for replication in brain zzso and zzso which are known to express limited amounts of zzso
