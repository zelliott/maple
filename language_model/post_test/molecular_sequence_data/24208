Thirteen zzso genes were isolated from zzso zzso , adding to the six already documented for this zzso Five zzso genes were selected for expression studies in various zzso of zzso zzso , with a focus on roots exposed to zzso or zzso conditions, using real-time zzso Several cases of differential expression of zzso genes in the various root types of zzso zzso were zzso and the identity of the dominant transcript differed between root types zzso tap root zzso lateral roots zzso zzso zzso Several genes were expressed zzso in response to low zzso In zzso zzso showed zzso zzso expression in the oldest region of the tap root was localized to cells near the vascular zzso this being the first report of zzso expression associated with secondary growth in zzso In zzso zzso also showed abundant expression of zzso zzso in the most zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso Such early expression of zzso zzso in cells soon after being produced by the root zzso presumably enables cell wall loosening in the zzso zone of zzso In addition, expression of some zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso of zzso these zzso might be involved in root hair formation or in formation of lateral root zzso The present findings support the notion that large gene families of zzso enable flexibility in expression for various zzso and zzso as a normal part of plant development, as well as in response to zzso zzso
