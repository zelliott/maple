The pancreatic zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso releases zzso zzso into the zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is released from the membrane and zzso into the pancreatic zzso 

To characterize changes in the structure of zzso as it zzso through the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells that express the rat zzso gene were used to examine the sequential processing of the zzso zzso 

Within the cell, zzso is initially zzso processed from a zzso to a zzso form at or before the zzso zzso The protein is then processed to a zzso form, which is found on the zzso plasma membrane and in zzso Similar processing was also observed in primary rat pancreatic cultures and in zzso cells that express human zzso The zzso sequence of human zzso derived from pancreatic zzso was determined for two human patients and began at zzso revealing a potential processing zzso 

In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso by the zzso that are activated by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequential zzso zzso zzso in zzso structure by zzso may regulate zzso function at specific sites within the pancreatic zzso
