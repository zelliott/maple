A zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso library was constructed using the zzso zzso It comprised zzso clones with an average insert size of 135 zzso representing an almost fivefold coverage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the library allowed recovery of one to eight clones for 142 unique markers located all over the zzso while it failed for only one zzso About zzso zzso clones were zzso The library was also screened for the zzso gene of type C zzso zzso sequences zzso and 62 clones were recovered, all but two of which contained one zzso zzso We found 20 zzso sequences zzso to zzso which, despite differing by point zzso were all coding zzso The most frequent zzso zzso was zzso similar to a zzso sequence expressed in the zzso zzso cell zzso Most of the clones zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso clones were mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to 22 distinct locations on 14 zzso including the X and Y zzso These overall results indicate that there is generally one zzso copy per integration zzso Although zzso sequences were not zzso zzso clusters of integration sites were observed at positions zzso and zzso Southern zzso experiments revealed zzso zzso copies in the Large White pig zzso studied here, and variations in zzso content among pigs of different breeds were zzso In conclusion, this zzso collection represents a significant contribution to the zzso large zzso DNA cloned insert resources and provides the first detailed map of zzso sequences in the zzso zzso This work is the first step toward identification of potential active sites of zzso zzso
