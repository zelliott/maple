The detailed zzso organization of a zzso region at human zzso zzso spanning 223 zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This region is composed of 20 genes and several other expressed zzso Experimental tools including zzso and zzso sequencing, combined with gene prediction programs, were zzso in the analysis of the zzso Various computer software programs were employed for sequence similarity searches and functional zzso The high number of genes with diverse functions and complex zzso patterns make this region ideal for addressing challenges of gene discovery and zzso characterization amenable to large-scale sequence zzso
