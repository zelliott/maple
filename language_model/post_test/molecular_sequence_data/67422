The origins of hybrid zones between zzso zzso have been of particular interest for understanding the evolution of zzso isolation and the geographic context of species zzso One challenge has been to distinguish between zzso divergence zzso by secondary zzso versus primary zzso zzso zzso as alternative divergence zzso Here, we use complementary zzso and population genetic analyses to investigate the recent divergence of two subspecies of zzso zzso and the formation of a hybrid zone within the narrow region of zzso We tested alternative zzso models of divergence using approximate zzso zzso (ABC) and found strong support for a secondary contact model and little support for a model allowing for gene flow throughout the divergence process zzso primary zzso Two independent methods for zzso the ancestral geography of each subspecies, one based on zzso character state reconstructions and the other on zzso zzso also support a model of divergence in zzso and range expansion leading to secondary zzso The membership of individuals to genetic clusters suggests geographic zzso within each zzso where zzso and zzso samples are primarily found in separate zzso We also observed coincidence and zzso of genetic zzso across three types of molecular zzso which suggests that there is a strong barrier to gene zzso Taken together, our results provide evidence for zzso divergence followed by range expansion leading to secondary zzso The location of zzso populations and the zzso of range expansion are consistent with expectations based on climate change since the last glacial zzso Our approach also illustrates the utility of combining zzso hypothesis testing with species distribution zzso and zzso population genetic analyses for zzso the geography of the divergence zzso
