zzso v 1, the major zzso zzso from white birch, displays a considerable degree of zzso Until now, all molecular and zzso characterization studies of zzso v 1 zzso have been performed with commercially available zzso of Swedish zzso In regard to clinical studies with Austrian birch zzso allergic individuals, knowledge about the zzso repertoire in Austrian birch zzso was zzso zzso coding for zzso v 1 zzso from Austrian birch zzso were cloned by zzso amplification and zzso Besides the Austrian zzso of the Swedish zzso zzso v zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso v zzso zzso v zzso and zzso v 11 zzso three sequences with a significantly lower zzso to known zzso and two zzso v zzso sequences with a 7 zzso zzso coding for a truncated protein were zzso No Austrian zzso of the majority of the Swedish zzso were zzso The zzso coding for truncated proteins were expressed in zzso coli and tested by zzso They bound a zzso zzso v 1 zzso but did not recognize birch zzso allergic patients' serum zzso and two zzso v zzso zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso v 1 zzso patterns of Swedish and Austrian birch zzso justifies the use of zzso v 1 derived from Swedish zzso for clinical studies with birch zzso allergic individuals from outside Northern zzso
