Since zzso domain zzso containing zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have zzso activities and are thought to play critical roles in zzso defenses, we are interested in these zzso zzso By zzso the Novartis mouse expression database, we found that the four zzso family members, zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in the oral zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since their zzso zzso play pivotal roles in the zzso and/or zzso activities and their application in zzso are expected to have practical value, we collected 98 zzso zzso and tried to predict their zzso functions by analyzing their zzso acid sequence zzso From the multiple alignments of zzso acid zzso we predicted that most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and the zzso zzso derived from zzso have zzso activities, whereas most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso and the zzso zzso derived from zzso have zzso zzso From the zzso tree, it was revealed that an ancestral zzso protein initially zzso into the zzso zzso domain and the ancestral protein for the other zzso zzso zzso the ancestral protein for the other zzso zzso zzso into two ancestral zzso one for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the other, for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the tree indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso share a common ancestral zzso
