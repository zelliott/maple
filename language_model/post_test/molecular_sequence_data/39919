The pigmented zzso zzso zzso is able to grow at a pH as low as zzso and produces zzso that are involved in zzso zzso We now present data on an zzso and an zzso zzso which exhibit a high stability at low zzso Furthermore, the optimum for zzso zzso is extraordinarily low with pH zzso for the zzso zzso with zzso zzso as zzso Two complete zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso were amplified by inverse zzso chain reaction zzso Whereas the deduced protein zzso I contains an predicted zzso signal sequence for protein export, zzso II does not and thus may represent the zzso zzso The zzso character of both zzso seems to be reflected in their primary zzso
