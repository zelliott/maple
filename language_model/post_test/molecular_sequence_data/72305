In a search for new protein zzso zzso zzso in early zzso cells, we have identified a sequence closely related to the zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso A zzso isolated from a mouse zzso library was zzso identical to zzso in both its coding and 3' untranslated zzso However, the region zzso to zzso 5 to 9 of zzso was zzso In addition, the zzso was interrupted by several stop zzso and frame shifts, indicating that this sequence is not zzso These transcripts were therefore copied from a novel zzso zzso that we called zzso zzso analysis of this gene showed the absence of zzso which is a characteristic feature of a processed zzso zzso gene was localized on zzso zzso Its zzso was shown to be zzso and its expression was restricted to fetal zzso These results indicate that zzso has been inserted in zzso 1 in zzso orientation close to a zzso zzso
