The lack of zzso zzso is not lethal in zzso zzso but it zzso some respiratory functions and, therefore, growth on zzso carbon sources such as zzso However, after a lag phase zzso zzso cells adapt to growth on zzso accumulating large amounts of an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) and of a zzso zzso zzso labeling localized the 86 zzso exclusively to the zzso zzso although most of it zzso with the zzso fraction in earlier cell zzso This zzso was resolved when the zzso protein was identified as the major coat protein in zzso particles zzso which is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the original zzso strain by introduction of the zzso or the zzso zzso increased the respiratory zzso and prolonged its lag phase on zzso carbon zzso The fact that the simultaneous loss of zzso and respiratory functions are the introduction of zzso or zzso occurred even in some zzso zzso strains suggests that there is a link between zzso and zzso zzso
