We have used restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for rapid typing of common zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso used zzso to amplify zzso E gene sequences containing zzso acid positions 112 and zzso The amplification products were zzso with zzso and subjected to zzso on zzso zzso Each of the zzso was distinguished by a unique combination of zzso zzso sizes that enabled zzso typing of all zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but does not cut at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
