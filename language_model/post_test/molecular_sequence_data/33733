zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso activity mainly on zzso and plays a key role in promoting zzso In zzso several zzso have been cloned and characterized as being zzso zzso data however indicate that the reported zzso zzso zzso are substantially remote from zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso of zzso zzso distinct from that of zzso zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso designated zzso has been found in the expressed sequence tags of carp zzso and identified as an zzso of zzso zzso The zzso transcript encodes 99 zzso acids containing a typical zzso motif but lacks an zzso zzso as in most zzso zzso zzso zzso tree constructed by the maximum likelihood method suggests a closer relationship of zzso with zzso zzso than with other zzso zzso reported to be zzso In a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso only in zzso zzso zzso heart and peripheral blood zzso in contrast to a previously reported carp zzso zzso zzso which shows ubiquitous zzso zzso The results, taken together, are strongly indicative of the presence of two major zzso lineages of zzso in zzso
