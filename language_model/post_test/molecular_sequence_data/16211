The zzso sequence of the chicken zzso zzso putative promoter region was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence of the mouse zzso gene zzso 118 zzso upstream from the initiation zzso suggested by zzso and Bishop zzso for the chicken zzso zzso a zzso zzso element was found zzso identity in chicken and mouse zzso zzso zzso to this element were detected on Southern blots of restricted zzso zzso from zzso man, zzso frog, and zzso No zzso was observed with zzso zzso or zzso coli zzso In human DNA, sequences zzso to this element were located at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso in the same position as in the chicken and mouse zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that the element is not a coding zzso of a gene overlapping the zzso zzso It may be of importance that one of the zzso zzso sites and several zzso zzso cap sites localized recently in the mouse zzso gene zzso lie within this zzso It is suggested that this zzso zzso element is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso expression in zzso
