The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is predicted to have 12 zzso zzso Between membrane spans 6 and 7 there is a large zzso loop, which, along with the zzso tail, makes up the zzso site of the zzso Crystal structures of these soluble zzso zzso have identified the regions that are involved in interactions with each zzso The functional consequences of these interactions in the full-length zzso zzso have not been zzso In this study, we analyzed the role of various interaction regions within the central zzso loop zzso and the zzso tail zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso 2 and 6 zzso and zzso We tested synthetic peptides zzso the different interface surfaces of both the C1 and C2 domain on different activities of zzso zzso and zzso expressed in insect zzso We found the zzso and zzso regions to be involved in stimulation by zzso and zzso but not in the zzso or zzso zzso Both the zzso region and the zzso region play a role in the zzso and zzso activities as well as in zzso activity, because the peptides zzso these regions inhibit zzso activity by zzso In contrast, the zzso region zzso zzso both zzso and zzso activity by zzso These results suggest that the different zzso activities may involve distinct interface interactions in the intact zzso and, consequently, the distinct mechanisms by which zzso activates the zzso as compared with zzso and zzso leading to the possibility that the full-length zzso zzso may have multiple zzso competent zzso
