On the basis of the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso domain of both soluble and plasma membrane forms of zzso zzso we have used the zzso chain reaction to identify a new form of zzso zzso that is expressed principally in zzso The zzso for this new form zzso beta 2) codes for a zzso zzso which most closely resembles a zzso zzso zzso beta 1) of the lung soluble zzso zzso The zzso for zzso beta 1 is zzso expressed in lung and brain, whereas zzso beta 2 zzso is more abundant in kidney and zzso An 86 zzso acid zzso region extends beyond the zzso of zzso beta 1 and contains a consensus sequence zzso for zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso among the zzso forms of zzso zzso and suggests differential zzso
