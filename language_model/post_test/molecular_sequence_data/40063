The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a large arsenal of toxins that are responsible for zzso and enteric infections, including zzso in humans and domestic zzso zzso zzso type C zzso which cause rapidly fatal diseases in domestic animals and zzso zzso in humans, contain the genes for alpha toxin zzso zzso O zzso beta toxin zzso and sometimes zzso toxin zzso and/or zzso zzso Due to the economic impact of type zzso diseases, domestic animals are commonly vaccinated with crude type C zzso zzso from zzso culture zzso or zzso vaccines, and it is not clear which zzso present in these vaccines actually elicits the protective immune zzso To improve type C vaccines, it would be helpful to assess the contribution of each toxin present in type C zzso to zzso To address this issue, we surveyed a large collection of type C zzso to determine their zzso zzso When zzso zzso culture zzso were analyzed by quantitative Western zzso or activity zzso most type C zzso produced at least three lethal zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso O, and several zzso also produced zzso zzso In the mouse intravenous injection model, beta toxin was identified as the main lethal factor present in type C zzso culture zzso This conclusion was based on zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso analyses in which the levels of alpha zzso beta zzso zzso O, and zzso toxin production were compared with zzso zzso our results highlight the importance of beta toxin for type zzso zzso
