zzso acid zzso is involved in the regulation of host immunity in zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso has an important role in resistance to rice bacterial blight caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we report that many volatile compounds accumulate in response to zzso application of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso treatment with zzso induced resistance to zzso and transgenic rice plants zzso zzso zzso were more resistance to zzso presumably due to the zzso of zzso genes in the absence of any zzso zzso zzso of zzso was regulated by zzso a rice zzso zzso protein involving the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level, suggesting that zzso plays an important role in zzso resistance to zzso in zzso
