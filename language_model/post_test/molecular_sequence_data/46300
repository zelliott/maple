zzso against cell death zzso genes are known to function as negative regulators of cell death in zzso In plants, zzso zzso are zzso but their role in cell death regulation is not well zzso Here, we report the characterization of the zzso gene in zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso contains typical structural features of zzso zzso including a signal zzso three zzso regions, and a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso were detected in wheat leaves, zzso roots, zzso and zzso The expression level of zzso was reduced in the initial contact with the stripe rust zzso subsequently induced and peaked at 18 h zzso zzso gradually reduced at 24 to 48 zzso and restored to control level at 72 to 120 zzso In addition, zzso exhibited positive zzso responses to zzso stresses after the initial reduction at 1 zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco leaves inhibited cell zzso Furthermore, knocking down zzso expression by zzso gene zzso enhanced the zzso of wheat zzso zzso to zzso race zzso and reduced zzso area at the infection zzso These results indicate that zzso may function as a zzso of cell death in the early stages of zzso rust fungus zzso However, it is zzso for or plays an opposite role in hypersensitive response or cell death triggered by an zzso race of stripe rust fungus at zzso zzso
