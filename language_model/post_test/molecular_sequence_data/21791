zzso zzso zzso is well known as a plant zzso zzso however, zzso analysis using the zzso zzso gene and four zzso genes indicated that this strain forms a zzso group with the zzso zzso complex, which is composed of several species of plant zzso On the basis of these sequence zzso we suggest that zzso zzso zzso be zzso as zzso zzso zzso To compare the ecological roles of zzso zzso zzso with its close relatives zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated their ability to cause disease and promote plant zzso When introduced on tobacco or tomato leaves, zzso zzso zzso was unable to elicit a hypersensitive response or cause disease, which are characteristic responses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor were type III zzso system genes required for zzso detected in zzso zzso zzso by zzso or DNA zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso neither of the zzso was able to promote root growth when zzso onto canola zzso Although zzso and zzso have been reported among the strains of the zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and a zzso
