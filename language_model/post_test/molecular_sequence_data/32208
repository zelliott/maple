We found that synthetic peptides in the form of zzso become resistant to zzso To determine the molecular basis of this resistance, different zzso peptides were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso form and incubated with human plasma and zzso zzso resistance of zzso zzso sequences was compared to that of the same peptides zzso as zzso linear zzso zzso peptides and zzso sequences were detected by high pressure liquid zzso and mass zzso An increase in zzso copies did not increase zzso resistance in linear zzso zzso whereas zzso progressively enhanced zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso A zzso hypothesis of zzso zzso resistance to zzso by zzso is zzso
