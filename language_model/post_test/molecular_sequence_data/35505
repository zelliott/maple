zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso of the giant zzso and can cause severe zzso in both wild and captive giant zzso Previous studies of the giant zzso indicated that this population is genetically zzso zzso the presence of a new zzso Based on the zzso between the zzso and the host, the aim of this study was to investigate the genetic differentiation in the zzso zzso population collected from giant zzso inhabiting different mountain zzso and further to identify whether the evolution of this zzso zzso with the evolution of giant zzso 

In this study, 48 zzso zzso were collected from 28 wild giant zzso inhabiting the zzso zzso and zzso mountain ranges in zzso The complete sequence of the zzso zzso b zzso gene was amplified by zzso and the corresponding population genetic diversity of the three mountain populations was zzso In addition, we discussed the evolutionary relationship between zzso zzso and its host giant zzso 

For the DNA zzso insignificant zzso values and a zzso high level of gene flow were detected among the three mountain populations of zzso zzso and high genetic variation within populations and a low genetic distance were zzso Both zzso analyses and network mapping of the 16 zzso revealed a dispersed pattern and an absence of branches strictly corresponding to the three mountain range sampling zzso zzso tests and mismatch analysis indicated that zzso zzso experienced a population expansion in the zzso 

Taken together, the dispersed zzso map, extremely high gene flow among the three populations of zzso zzso low genetic structure and rapid evolutionary rate suggest that the zzso zzso populations did not follow a pattern of isolation by distance, indicating the existence of physical connections before these populations became geographically zzso
