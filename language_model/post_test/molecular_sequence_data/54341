zzso of zzso during zzso is a highly regulated process which requires the concerted action of several zzso Traditionally, it has been stated that the dismantling process of the zzso zzso begins with a zzso step, followed by zzso removal and other breakdown zzso Recently, new evidence suggests the possibility of a zzso in the first two steps of this process, occurring zzso removal prior to the loss of the zzso side zzso With the purpose of zzso to the real sequential order of these reactions and to assess if zzso occurs on intact zzso by zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression of both genes was analyzed in broccoli tissue during zzso zzso of broccoli zzso treated with plant hormones, such as zzso and zzso were zzso as to assess the effect of such compounds on the expression of these zzso zzso showed that zzso expression did not correlate to typical expression patterns for genes related to zzso since a decrease in expression during zzso was found for one of the two zzso genes zzso and the zzso effects on gene expression did not match those observed on zzso content for both zzso zzso zzso expression patterns, on the other hand, displayed an increase in the first 3 days of induced zzso followed by lower expression values towards the end of the zzso zzso subjected to zzso treatments mostly showed an zzso of zzso zzso especially in samples in which degradation of zzso had been zzso These results suggest that zzso expression zzso to the visual manifestation of zzso treatments, supporting the possibility that this zzso is responsible for the zzso step in zzso zzso
