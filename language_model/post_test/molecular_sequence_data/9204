Fusion of the human zzso virus zzso with target cells is zzso by the zzso zzso of the envelope zzso zzso and deletion studies within the zzso domain zzso of intact zzso influenced its fusion zzso In addition, current models suggest that the zzso is in proximity with the fusion zzso zzso at the late fusion zzso but there are no direct experimental data to support this zzso Here, we investigated the zzso focusing on two zzso the zzso containing the zzso motif and the zzso containing the zzso zzso which is zzso among the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso Studies utilizing the zzso expression system combined with synthetic peptides and their fluorescent zzso derived from zzso revealed that the zzso motif is important for zzso zzso whereas the zzso region is for its zzso with zzso zzso all three zzso peptides induced zzso mixing that was enhanced significantly upon mixing with zzso Furthermore, the zzso peptides inhibited zzso fusion apparently through their interaction with their zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso (in the zzso was significantly less potent than the two zzso Overall, our findings provide experimental evidence that zzso zzso contributes to membrane assembly and function of the zzso zzso zzso to similarities between functional zzso within zzso these findings suggest that the zzso and zzso may contribute similarly in other viruses as zzso
