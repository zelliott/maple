The zzso zzso which codes for the zzso factor zzso is essential in zzso zzso yet previous analyses failed to reveal a zzso in assembly of zzso or in zzso zzso associated with its zzso We generated 11 zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in the corresponding gene and analyzed their zzso While all zzso were blocked in the formation of commitment complex 2 zzso at zzso and zzso temperature, the zzso zzso showed no zzso in zzso formation and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was defective in zzso formation, but residual zzso activity could be zzso In zzso zzso of reporters carrying zzso weakened by zzso in the zzso zzso site and/or in the zzso region was affected in all zzso zzso leakage to the zzso was strongly increased (up to zzso in the zzso A combination of zzso zzso with a disruption of zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso resulted in a specific synthetic growth zzso suggesting that the essential function of zzso in zzso could be related to the retention of zzso in the zzso
