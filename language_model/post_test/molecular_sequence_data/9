zzso a zzso snake zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso and is zzso to a zzso and zzso zzso family zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso can easily zzso to release a stable protein named zzso which contains zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we determined the crystal structure of zzso and investigated the zzso zzso Based on the structure of zzso and the results from zzso experiments, we present a new model for target recognition in which two protein molecules form a functional unit, and the DC domain of one zzso is used for target recognition while the zzso of the other is used for target zzso Our results shed new light on the mechanism of target recognition and processing in zzso family zzso
