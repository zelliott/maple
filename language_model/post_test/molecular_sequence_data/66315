Advances in mass zzso zzso have yielded a substantial mapping of the zzso zzso and thus provided an important step toward a systematic analysis of zzso signaling networks in higher zzso In this study we zzso an zzso zzso data set of zzso unique zzso zzso peptides by sequence similarity to known zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso binding zzso zzso From 20 clusters we extracted 16 known and four new interaction zzso Using quantitative mass zzso we pulled down zzso binding partners for peptides corresponding to the extracted zzso We confirmed numerous previously known interaction motifs and found 15 new interactions zzso by zzso not previously known to bind zzso or zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso motif zzso was identified and validated as a binding motif for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our decomposition of the in zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that two-thirds of the zzso sites mediate interaction, whereas the remaining third govern processes such as zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso
