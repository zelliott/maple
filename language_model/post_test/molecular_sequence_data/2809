The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso 3 of cucumber mosaic virus strain O zzso was zzso Two open reading frames were identified, zzso a 3A protein zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso region and a coat protein zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of the coat protein C zzso was determined directly from zzso zzso and confirmed the presence of the coat protein open reading frame in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences and zzso acid sequences of zzso strains O, zzso D and Y indicated the close relationship between these zzso A zzso structure could be adopted by the 3' zzso region, and this resembled a similar structure in zzso in spite of zzso zzso or zzso
