The zzso zzso factor zzso regulates expression of the zzso gene zzso in a cell zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso is restricted to late M and early G zzso of the zzso cell zzso We show here that this nuclear zzso is directly associated with regulation of zzso zzso Using a version of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso we show that the protein is excluded from the nucleus of cells during most zzso of the zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso in which one zzso and two zzso zzso which are candidate zzso sites, were replaced by zzso (to mimic zzso zzso is zzso in the nucleus throughout the cell zzso The mechanism of zzso of zzso therefore involves regulation of its zzso state, and closely resembles that used by the zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso zzso protein associates with zzso in zzso suggesting this may be the zzso that mediates the zzso zzso The stability of the protein is greatly reduced in a zzso that is zzso zzso to the nucleus, but is restored in a deletion zzso which remains in the zzso zzso is therefore controlled throughout the cell cycle at three zzso transcription, nuclear zzso and zzso
