We previously established a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which zzso with the heat shock protein 60 zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as with other bacterial and human zzso To determine the importance of a zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso mapping of an zzso on zzso zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso G responses of patients with or without zzso zzso infection to its zzso region, and zzso studies of the protective effect of zzso with its zzso region on zzso zzso infection in zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso zzso was mapped to the sequence of zzso acids 189 to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso It was confirmed that the zzso zzso designated zzso was recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that patients with zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower zzso of zzso zzso than did zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but this was not the case with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso or zzso human zzso In zzso mice zzso with the zzso zzso with zzso complete zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso organisms colonizing the stomach was significantly lower than that in mice zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso only zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the immune response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso is unique and might be associated with protection against zzso zzso zzso
