A protein toxic to mice was isolated from the zzso of the Mexican beaded zzso zzso zzso zzso by a combination of gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso (both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso component has an apparent zzso zzso of zzso and is composed of approximately 220 zzso acid zzso It has an zzso point zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso acid sequence was shown to be: zzso zzso The sequence has no significant similarity with any other protein previously reported in the zzso zzso activities such as zzso zzso and zzso commonly present in zzso could not be demonstrated in this zzso zzso experiments conducted with excitable zzso show no effects on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Among the constant zzso effects observed in mice injected with this toxin are zzso partial paralysis of rear limbs and lowering of body temperature, suggesting that it might be a zzso zzso We propose calling this toxin zzso
