zzso zzso and zzso are usually zzso because they extensively invade surrounding brain zzso Here, we report the expression and function of a zzso on many zzso that may alter both the zzso and invasive potential of these zzso Signal regulatory protein zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that is normally expressed in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of many cell types with zzso including zzso has been shown to inhibit their proliferation in response to a range of growth zzso Furthermore, the expression of a zzso zzso zzso has been shown to enhance cell zzso and initial cell spreading but to inhibit cell extension and zzso The zzso portion of zzso binds zzso zzso zzso although this interaction is not required for zzso zzso of zzso On zzso zzso recruits the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are important in its zzso Although zzso is uniquely expressed on zzso cells, zzso is zzso zzso so that zzso has the potential to function in many cell types, including zzso Because zzso regulates cell functions that may contribute to the zzso of these tumors, we examined the expression of zzso in zzso cell lines by flow zzso using a zzso zzso against all zzso zzso of nine cell lines revealed clear cell surface expression of zzso on five cell lines, whereas Northern zzso for zzso transcripts showed zzso present in eight of nine cell zzso All nine cell lines expressed the zzso for zzso zzso To further examine the expression and function of zzso we studied the zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, both of which express zzso in greater zzso zzso transcripts in these cells are identical in sequence to zzso The expressed zzso protein is the same size as zzso but in the zzso cells, it is zzso compared with zzso produced in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso It is nonetheless still capable of binding soluble zzso Moreover, zzso in each of the two cell lines recruited zzso on zzso and zzso zzso in cultured cells is zzso zzso Finally, examination of frozen sections from 10 primary brain tumor zzso by zzso revealed expression of zzso on seven of the zzso some of which expressed high levels of zzso Most of the tumors also expressed zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso can express zzso Given the known role of zzso in regulating cell zzso and responses to zzso growth factors, the expression of zzso on zzso may be of considerable importance in brain tumor biology, and it offers the potential of a new avenue for therapeutic zzso
