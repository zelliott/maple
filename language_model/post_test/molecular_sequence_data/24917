In zzso zzso signaling before zzso suppresses neural zzso Later in development, zzso signaling specifies a zzso and zzso fate in the zzso and zzso fate in the spinal zzso It is therefore possible that a change in the competence of the zzso to respond to zzso signaling occurs at some point in zzso We report that exposure of the anterior neural plate to zzso before zzso causes suppression of all neural markers zzso To determine the effects of zzso after zzso we zzso zzso using a zzso promoter zzso in transgenic zzso zzso and implanted beads soaked in zzso in the anterior neural zzso zzso of most anterior neural markers was zzso We conclude that most neural genes continue to require suppression of zzso signaling into the zzso zzso Additionally, we report that zzso and zzso are abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso stage zzso This poses the paradox of how the expression of most neural genes is maintained if they can be inhibited by zzso zzso We show that at least one gene in the anterior neural plate suppresses the response of the zzso to zzso zzso We propose that the zzso effect of zzso signaling on the expression of neural genes coupled with localized zzso of zzso signaling result in the zzso of gene expression in the anterior neural zzso
