zzso is a zzso genetic element indigenous to the zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso can undergo zzso and subsequent zzso integration into the zzso of recipient zzso We report here the zzso zzso zzso and initial characterization of the genes zzso these zzso zzso A region of zzso adjacent to the previously identified site of integration, zzso was found to be sufficient to promote zzso integration of an unrelated zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of a zzso segment of this region reveals two open reading frames that are adjacent to and transcribed toward the zzso zzso One of these, the zzso zzso gene of zzso encodes a predicted zzso basic protein having substantial zzso acid sequence similarity to a family of zzso zzso that includes the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in the zzso end of the cloned zzso gene prevents integration, indicating that zzso is essential for promoting zzso An open reading frame zzso lying immediately zzso to zzso encodes a predicted zzso basic zzso showing limited sequence similarity to the zzso zzso genes of other zzso zzso zzso
