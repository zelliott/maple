zzso proteins zzso 1 and 2 are zzso zzso proteins that bind to specific zzso structures, termed zzso elements zzso that are located in the untranslated regions of specific zzso zzso proteins involved in iron zzso The binding of zzso to zzso regulates either translation or stabilization of zzso Although zzso and zzso are similar proteins in that they are zzso expressed and are zzso regulated by iron, they are regulated by iron by different zzso zzso the zzso zzso in cells, is a zzso protein exhibiting either zzso activity when cellular iron is abundant or zzso activity when cellular iron is zzso In contrast, zzso lacks zzso zzso activity and functions exclusively as an zzso zzso To study and compare the zzso characteristics of zzso and zzso we expressed zzso and zzso rat zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso bind the zzso zzso with high zzso resulting in the zzso of translation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking a 73 zzso acid domain unique to zzso and a zzso zzso containing an zzso of this domain bound zzso but lacked zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the presence of this domain prevents zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso activity of zzso was sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso contains a zzso that is zzso necessary for zzso zzso However, unlike zzso where zzso of the zzso cluster resulted in a loss in zzso activity, the zzso activity of zzso was unaffected using the same iron zzso These data suggested that zzso does not contain a zzso cluster similar to the cluster in zzso indicating that they sense iron by different zzso
