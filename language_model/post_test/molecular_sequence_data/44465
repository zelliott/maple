In zzso zzso a zzso zzso the synthesis of a stress protein called zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 18 zzso was greatly induced after heat zzso degrees zzso acid zzso 3) or zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso protein synthesis was induced in stationary growth phase and was detected for a long time (30 zzso during this growth zzso zzso identity was found between the zzso parts of the zzso protein and the zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that zzso protein belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
