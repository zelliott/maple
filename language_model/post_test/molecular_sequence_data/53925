zzso sequence extending zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso was previously analyzed and the two genes were present in the order of zzso preceded by a promoter from zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso sequence located downstream of the zzso gene was analyzed to have three open reading frames zzso that are designated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of the zzso were preceded by each zzso sequence of zzso zzso or zzso However, no zzso sequence and zzso zzso sequence were found in the analyzed region, downstream of zzso zzso zzso the gene cluster appeared to be present in the order of zzso as an zzso which is unique organization characterized so far in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was composed of zzso base pairs which can zzso a zzso of molecular weight zzso containing 405 zzso acid zzso A deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product exhibited zzso identity with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was composed of zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was composed of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso of molecular weight zzso containing 338 zzso acid zzso A deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product exhibited zzso identity with that of a zzso zzso zzso
