zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso generates zzso zzso zzso peptides associated with zzso disease zzso whereas zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso product zzso functions as an inhibitor of zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain zzso within zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso site, contributes to this negative regulation because deleting or masking this domain turns zzso into a better zzso for zzso Moreover, zzso zzso can zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso is observed in both in zzso and cellular zzso This work reveals an unforeseen role for zzso in generating an zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso the production of zzso zzso of this feedback mechanism may contribute to the zzso of zzso
