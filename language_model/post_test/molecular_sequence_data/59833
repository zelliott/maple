A clone containing a zzso zzso zzso assumed to zzso the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified by sequence zzso with zzso and zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence showed a high degree of identity to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso from pig zzso and the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The G + C content of the zzso zzso coding sequence zzso was considerably higher than that of the zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso as has been observed for other genes from zzso zzso The zzso usage pattern was zzso with only 34 zzso used and a strong preference for a zzso zzso in the third positions of the zzso The coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned in an zzso coli expression zzso zzso a zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso by affinity binding and used to produce zzso zzso The zzso zzso serum recognized a 45 zzso protein from a zzso zzso fraction enriched for zzso and similar zzso in two related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso zzso for zzso activity in native zzso gels revealed a band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 330 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso sequence was devoid of the typical targeting signals identified so far in zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso uses a different signal for sorting zzso into zzso Based on comparisons with other proteins we propose a putative zzso targeting signal for zzso zzso of zzso zzso that shows some of the features of zzso targeting zzso
