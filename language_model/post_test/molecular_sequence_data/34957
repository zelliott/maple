Data about the genetic structure can help to understand the evolutionary process of natural populations as well as to drive strategies of zzso zzso zzso an endemic Brazilian zzso has been found in 2 areas of zzso zzso zzso One is a legal preservation unit zzso State Park) and the other an unprotected area zzso zzso The 2 areas belong to the zzso Mountain Range zzso both are characterized by steep relief with high zzso and by zzso vegetation formed by a mosaic of rocky fields and forest zzso According to International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria, zzso zzso is designated as zzso We examined the genetic zzso and population structure of 70 individuals (3 zzso of zzso zzso using 16 zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is considered a rare species, the estimated genetic diversity was found to be relatively high zzso index zzso zzso percentage of zzso bands zzso zzso The populations were found not to be structured zzso test, zzso zzso zzso probably due to the zzso Based on zzso analysis, this species includes one cluster containing the populations from zzso State Park and another cluster including the population from zzso zzso This information will help determine strategies to maintain the genetic zzso of these zzso
