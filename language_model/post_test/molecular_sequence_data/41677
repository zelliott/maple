Four zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated in the USA were examined to understand the mechanisms of zzso resistance including screening for the presence of an zzso sequence upstream of the zzso zzso which could be involved in the control and expression of the zzso zzso We observed that the main mechanisms of zzso resistance were the result of the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso both of which had the presence of zzso upstream of the zzso The importance of this element was shown by zzso zzso zzso strains that had lost the zzso with the zzso genes but during that same process also lost the zzso zzso element present upstream of the zzso zzso A zzso decrease in minimum zzso concentration of zzso and an zzso decrease in the minimum zzso concentration of zzso were seen in the zzso strains that lost the zzso The study presents the first report of zzso simultaneously governing the zzso gene and the zzso gene expression and also highlights the importance of this element in zzso zzso zzso which were once zzso zzso
