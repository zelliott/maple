Like humans, the living zzso are unusual among zzso in being sparsely covered with zzso Relative to extant elephants, the extinct zzso zzso zzso zzso had a dense hair cover and extremely long hair, which likely were adaptations to its zzso zzso The zzso growth factor 5 zzso gene affects hair length in a diverse set of zzso zzso zzso in zzso lead to zzso long hair zzso in mice, dogs, and zzso and the gene has been implicated in hair length variation in zzso Thus, zzso represents a leading candidate gene for the zzso differences in hair length notable between extant zzso and the zzso zzso We therefore zzso the three zzso (except for the 3' zzso and a portion of the promoter of zzso from the living zzso species zzso African zzso and African forest zzso and, using protocols for ancient DNA, from a zzso zzso 

Between the extant zzso and the zzso two single base zzso were observed in zzso neither of which alters the zzso acid zzso Modeling of the protein structure suggests that the zzso proteins fold similarly to the human zzso zzso zzso analyses and DNA sequencing of another locus that has been implicated in hair cover in humans, type I hair zzso zzso zzso also yielded negative zzso Interestingly, zzso is a zzso in zzso as in humans (although fully functional in zzso zzso 

The data suggest that the coding sequence of the zzso gene is not the critical zzso of hair length differences among zzso The results are discussed in the context of zzso among zzso and in terms of the potential impact of large body size, zzso conditions, and an aquatic zzso on hair cover in the zzso
