To search for zzso in the zzso gene zzso in Chinese patients with familial zzso zzso zzso and to delineate the zzso clinical zzso 

Forty-eight Chinese patients with zzso and 100 unrelated control subjects were recruited and had complete zzso examinations zzso The coding regions of zzso were screened for zzso by zzso chain reaction and direct zzso Multiple sequence alignment was conducted to evaluate the conservation of zzso among different zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso correlations were also zzso 

Twelve putative zzso zzso were identified in total, 9 of which were zzso 1 deletion zzso 1 nonsense zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three reported zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 patients who zzso compound zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso had a more severe zzso zzso than carriers of a single zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were responsible for zzso in 15 of 48 Chinese patients zzso in this study, similar to other ethnic zzso This study supports the highly zzso nature of zzso with a differential zzso profile in the Chinese zzso 

The profile of the zzso obtained in zzso further illustrates the complexity of zzso and provides a better understanding of the zzso zzso
