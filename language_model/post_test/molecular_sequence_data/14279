The sterile alpha motif and HD zzso zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso cells by human and related zzso zzso viruses zzso and zzso This potent zzso is zzso by the zzso accessory zzso factor of zzso zzso which targets zzso for zzso degradation, by zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso recruitment of human zzso onto the zzso and the molecular zzso on the respective molecules have not been zzso Here, we show that human zzso is recruited to the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso No stable association is zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the interaction is a short zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso domain and requires the presence of zzso for stable zzso This zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso recruitment to zzso and zzso when fused to zzso zzso The precise zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso among zzso proteins from different zzso species, explaining selective zzso of human zzso levels by zzso Critical zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso involved in the zzso interaction were identified by zzso Our findings show that the N zzso of zzso bound to zzso recruits zzso via its C zzso to zzso in a zzso manner for zzso zzso
