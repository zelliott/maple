zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso In skin, zzso expression is limited to zzso in the upper layers of the zzso To investigate regulation of cell zzso expression of zzso we cloned the zzso of the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso encompassing the zzso region, first zzso and first zzso was localized on human zzso 14 zzso Two major zzso initiation sites identified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, primer extension, and zzso zzso zzso were located approximately 650 base pairs upstream from the translation start zzso The human zzso zzso promoter region lacks zzso zzso and zzso boxes and zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso region displayed zzso promoter zzso This promoter was active in human zzso but not human skin zzso in zzso with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis revealed the presence of adjacent regulatory regions containing zzso and zzso elements located zzso base pairs and zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter rendered the zzso element zzso Both the zzso and zzso elements regulated zzso promoters in zzso but not zzso zzso mobility shift analysis demonstrated specific protein binding to zzso shock factor and zzso zzso consensus sequences in the zzso and zzso regions, zzso zzso of the zzso shock factor binding sites caused loss of functional zzso zzso These data zzso zzso regulation and zzso expression of the zzso zzso
