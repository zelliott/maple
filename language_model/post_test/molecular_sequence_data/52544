zzso evidence indicates that zzso activates collagen synthesis in zzso To explore the molecular mechanism of zzso we screened genes that are zzso or zzso by zzso zzso isolated from fetal rat lung were cultured under zzso zzso display technique showed that the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso an active zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso increased zzso after an zzso exposure to zzso This elevated level was maintained over 40 h and returned to the zzso level after zzso The zzso rate, protein level, and zzso content (an indicator of the zzso zzso were all elevated by hypoxic zzso Analysis of the zzso region of zzso gene indicated that a motif similar to zzso element zzso of zzso genes such as erythropoietin, was identified within a zzso pair sequence upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso reporter zzso and zzso analysis showed that a site similar to the zzso in this motif is functionally essential to hypoxic zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso zzso was zzso and bound to the zzso zzso upon hypoxic zzso Our results indicate that zzso an essential zzso for collagen zzso is a target gene for zzso zzso
