Single zzso zzso zzso are zzso natural sequence variations in zzso They are considered to be the major genetic source of zzso zzso within a given species and serve as excellent genetic zzso zzso are useful in identifying candidate genes that contribute to disease and zzso zzso In zzso organisms, the application of zzso has been zzso because of the expense and technical difficulties entailed in currently available zzso isolation zzso In the present study, we have developed a rapid and effective method to isolate zzso throughout the zzso zzso The DNA fragments containing zzso could be isolated efficiently from background zzso We analyzed ten isolated DNA fragments with this method in zzso tongue sole zzso zzso newly exploited and commercially important cultured marine zzso in zzso found that nine of the fragments contained zzso The findings were confirmed successfully in different zzso The method presented here is cost-effective and zzso to essentially any zzso
