The family of G zzso receptors that includes receptors for zzso zzso and growth hormone zzso has substantial potential importance as drug zzso zzso of the molecular basis of hormone binding and zzso zzso should provide insights that are helpful in the development of such zzso We previously examined the unique second zzso loop domain of the zzso zzso identifying key zzso in zzso locations at each end of this long loop zzso zzso zzso zzso and Miller, zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have extended that work, examining the other predicted zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by using sequential deletions of segments ranging from one to six zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso replacement zzso zzso Each construct was zzso expressed in zzso cells, and characterized for zzso and zzso zzso calcium responses and zzso zzso zzso Only those zzso segments that included key zzso zzso in positions 25, 30, and 111 or zzso regions at the ends of the zzso zzso and the first and third zzso zzso disrupted zzso biological zzso Each of these zzso deletions also disrupted action of zzso zzso replacements for each of the potentially important zzso acid zzso in the zzso segments revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the selective negative impact on zzso biological activity, while responding normally to zzso These results support the presence of functionally important zzso bonds in the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that the structural zzso for binding and biological activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso with a broad zzso zzso base contributing to normal zzso zzso
