zzso protein interaction zzso are typically selective for zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso have also been zzso The zzso domain from the cell polarity protein zzso binds zzso zzso and an internal sequence from the protein zzso The structure of the zzso zzso complex reveals that the zzso zzso site is zzso to allow for internal zzso Whereas binding of the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso domain adjacent to the zzso zzso regulates binding of zzso zzso the zzso change that occurs upon binding of zzso renders its binding independent of zzso These results suggest a mechanism by which the requirement for a C zzso can be readily zzso by zzso zzso and reveal a complex set of cooperative and competitive interactions in zzso that are likely to be important for cell polarity zzso
