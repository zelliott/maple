We determined approximately 215 zzso of DNA sequence from the zzso region zzso of 240 cloned zzso zzso elements isolated from 22 species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences were sorted into different zzso zzso and zzso zzso to them were zzso to zzso DNA of various zzso From the distribution of the zzso zzso in the various species, we zzso the partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso The four zzso species comprise a zzso zzso separate from a zzso cluster that contains the two zzso and four zzso zzso The zzso zzso in turn, shares a zzso with the zzso that contains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The evolutionary relationships that we deduced agree with and significantly extend the zzso of zzso zzso zzso established by other molecular zzso Furthermore, the zzso amplification events scored here produced a unique zzso tree, that is, in no case did a character (a given zzso amplification zzso appear on more than one zzso The lack of zzso found in this study supports the zzso of zzso amplification events as zzso markers for the study of zzso zzso
