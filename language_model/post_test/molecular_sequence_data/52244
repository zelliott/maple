zzso clones containing the full coding sequences of the two zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library using highly zzso human zzso zzso Three clones zzso a zzso protein whose sequence is zzso identical to that of human zzso B, the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso The coding sequences of the zzso and human zzso B genes are zzso zzso zzso zzso B is the product of a single zzso gene located at position zzso on the X zzso zzso zzso clones zzso a highly zzso region of zzso A, the zzso zzso of zzso were used to locate the zzso A gene at position 21 zzso on the second zzso of zzso and to isolate zzso A zzso clones from a zzso embryonic zzso zzso The structure of the zzso A gene was determined by comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso Twelve zzso spread over a total of zzso zzso were found to zzso a zzso protein zzso identical to either human zzso A alpha or zzso At the zzso level zzso zzso A zzso is 67 and zzso identical to human zzso A alpha and beta zzso zzso Major differences between human and zzso zzso A are restricted to the zzso and zzso zzso including two stretches of repetitive sequences in the zzso third of the zzso zzso zzso characteristic of the putative zzso centers of protein zzso and zzso and zzso are almost perfectly zzso The zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of all zzso zzso A, are also zzso A remarkable feature of the zzso A gene is the location of the zzso junctions at the boundaries of the functional zzso and the apparent conservation of the zzso junctions from zzso to zzso
