Within the broad zzso region for bipolar disorder on the zzso portion of zzso 18, the highest zzso sharing in our zzso series has been found in markers mapping to zzso Studies by other investigators on independently zzso zzso have also shown increased sharing in this region, making zzso a plausible site for a candidate gene zzso We found expressed sequence tags zzso mapping within this area that are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso Since zzso has been proposed to be the potential target of lithium, a drug commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, we proceeded to characterize the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis detected a major transcript of zzso zzso with abundant expression in adult and fetal zzso but minimal expression in whole zzso In zzso brain regions, however, substantial levels of transcript were zzso most prominently in the zzso We have isolated and zzso the full-length zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed approximately zzso identity with an existing human zzso which we found mapped to zzso 8, and zzso of other zzso The sequence also included motifs characteristic of the zzso gene zzso To provide a more precise location of this zzso mapping with a panel of radiation hybrids zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis placed the gene between zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso zzso therefore, designated this novel gene as zzso The physical position and possible function suggest that zzso is an important candidate gene for bipolar zzso
