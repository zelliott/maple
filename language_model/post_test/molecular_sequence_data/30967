Two zzso fragments from the right-hand terminal region of the zzso virus zzso have been zzso The bulk of the zzso terminal repetition zzso sequence is contained within these fragments and makes up zzso zzso of the zzso sequence zzso The overall base composition of the larger sequence is zzso G + C and of the zzso zzso G + zzso An extremely zzso zzso block of sequence was found spanning the zzso sequence zzso The bulk of the zzso could be divided into three blocks of directly repeated zzso One block begins about 250 zzso from the zzso and is a direct repeat 15 zzso long, repeated 14 zzso The other blocks contain seven sequence sets ranging from 16 to 36 zzso which are repeated 2 to 4 times, zzso with one another, interrelated in zzso and sometimes separated by unique zzso Eight open reading frames zzso each with the potential to code for zzso of 50 zzso or more, were zzso Three were found within the zzso four spanned the zzso sequence junction and one was found outside the zzso A search for putative zzso zzso control signals indicated that three of the eight zzso are likely to be transcribed early, all in the same direction toward the right end of the zzso zzso of the type zzso were found only twice in the sequence and only one preceded an zzso
