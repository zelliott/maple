To investigate the distribution of different zzso of major zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

This study was performed in Clinical zzso Research Center, zzso University of Medical Sciences, zzso Iran, during November 2004 to October zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 from patients with gastric zzso zzso disease) and 35 from patients with zzso zzso disease) were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso to investigate the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The amplified fragments were then zzso with the restriction zzso zzso (for zzso zzso (for zzso and zzso (for zzso 

We found a significantly higher prevalence of zzso strains in zzso disease zzso than that in zzso disease zzso patients zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis revealed 2 different patterns for zzso zzso The prevalence of pattern beta with 3 bands was significantly higher in both groups of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a strictly homogeneous pattern for zzso of the zzso strains isolated from the patients with zzso This pattern was significantly associated with zzso status zzso The zzso zzso analysis revealed 10 distinguishable DNA zzso patterns among them the pattern named zzso zzso was the most prevalent zzso in all zzso No association between a specific DNA pattern and clinical disease was observed for zzso and zzso zzso 

It seems that in our patients, the presence of zzso gene may not necessarily be a risk factor for zzso disease, while a zzso zzso of zzso appears to be associated with an increase risk of zzso zzso Lastly, despite the existence of a high degree of zzso zzso within zzso zzso DNA zzso profiles are distributed in our zzso
