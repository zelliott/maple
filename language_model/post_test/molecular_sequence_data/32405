zzso zzso zzso is a well-known human zzso recognized by the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on zzso Currently, most zzso studies in populations are concerned with drinking water and occupational zzso In zzso province, zzso caused by the burning of coal in zzso indoor stoves is an unusual type of zzso Because the poisoning mechanism involved in zzso is as yet unknown and no effective therapy exists, progress has been slow on the prevention and therapy of zzso 

We examined the relationship between zzso zzso exposure from the burning of coal in zzso indoor stoves and genetic damage in humans, using cellular and molecular zzso We selected villagers from zzso zzso zzso province, China, who had been exposed to zzso levels of As daily via food and air contaminated by the burning of zzso coal in zzso indoor zzso 

The zzso subjects from zzso were divided into four groups according to skin zzso zzso zzso mild, zzso and severe zzso Another 53 villagers from a town 12 zzso from zzso were recruited as the external control zzso In the four groups of exposed subjects, As zzso in urine and hair were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These values were higher than those in the external control group, which had As zzso of 46 zzso for urine and zzso zzso for zzso We measured sister zzso exchange and zzso aberrations to determine human zzso damage, and for DNA damage, we measured DNA zzso breaks and zzso zzso All zzso were higher in the four exposed groups compared with the external control zzso DNA repair was impaired by As exposure, as indicated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso X-ray repair zzso defective repair in Chinese zzso cells 1 zzso and, to a lesser extent, by the mismatch repair gene zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso increased with zzso of zzso symptoms, whereas the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso at a frequency of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso was found in zzso although deletion was zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso groups, zzso 

The results showed that long-term As exposure may be associated with damage of zzso and DNA, gene zzso gene zzso and zzso of DNA synthesis and repair zzso
