A specific type of gene zzso affecting the LDL zzso has been found in many Finnish patients with familial zzso zzso The zzso zzso is characterized by a zzso deletion extending from zzso 15 to zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of a zzso segment corresponding to the deleted zzso indicated that the zzso zzso differs radically from the normal one because of loss of the zzso zzso by zzso 16, 17, and zzso The zzso portion of the normal zzso zzso the zzso acids zzso has been replaced by an unrelated stretch of 55 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to occur in 23 zzso of 46 unrelated FH patients with an established functional zzso in the LDL zzso In cultured zzso from the FH patients with the zzso zzso both zzso binding and zzso of zzso were lower than normal, the former, on average, by zzso and the latter, on average, by zzso This combined functional zzso probably results from both impaired attachment and impaired zzso of the zzso zzso It remains to be investigated whether this Finnish type of LDL zzso gene zzso here designated zzso occurs in other ethnic zzso
