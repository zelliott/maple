The complete zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from four species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by automated zzso degradation of the entire zzso proteins and of the peptides obtained by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of these four zzso differed from each other by zzso whereas zzso differences have been observed among zzso from plants in the same zzso and zzso differences were seen between different zzso This suggests that these zzso plants are zzso related to each other zzso
