The zzso transfer of the terminal zzso group from zzso to an zzso zzso is an important reaction in a wide variety of biological zzso I demonstrate here the essential function of an zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso expression library by zzso with zzso raised against the recently characterized zzso zzso from the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a coding region of zzso zzso The alignment of the two zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows zzso zzso By gene disruption and zzso analysis it is demonstrated that zzso is absolutely essential for cell zzso This is in contrast to the zzso gene of zzso zzso the deletion of which was shown to lead to a slower cell growth rate rather than to a lethal zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso deletion strain restored normal cell growth, demonstrating that zzso and zzso are functionally zzso However, despite lack of absolute zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso could not complement the loss of function of the zzso zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, thus highlighting the functional uniqueness of each zzso zzso zzso Using suitable expression zzso large amounts of active zzso zzso were produced in either zzso species and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibits a high preference for zzso zzso with zzso being a 10 times more efficient zzso donor than zzso
