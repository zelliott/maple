G zzso receptors are zzso zzso membrane proteins that undergo zzso changes on zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the zzso member of this zzso Here, we provide the first evidence that zzso in zzso may involve differential dynamic properties of zzso versus backbone zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso revealed large backbone motions in the inactive dark zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso showed well zzso equally intense zzso signals, suggesting restriction to a single specific zzso
