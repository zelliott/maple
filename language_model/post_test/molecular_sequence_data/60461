A key problem in evolutionary biology has been distinguishing the contributions of current and historical processes to the maintenance of genetic zzso Because zzso at zzso genes are under balancing selection, they exhibit extended residence times in populations and thus may provide unique insight into population demographic zzso However, evidence for balancing selection and extended residence times has almost exclusively depended on identification of zzso zzso zzso retained in populations through zzso zzso We present a broadly zzso approach for detecting balancing selection and apply it to the zzso mating type gene in the mushroom fungus zzso zzso The comparison of neutral molecular variation within and between zzso classes was used to directly estimate the strength of balancing zzso Different zzso classes are defined as zzso different mating zzso types and are thus potentially subject to balancing zzso Variation within an zzso class, where all zzso have the same mating zzso type, provided an internal standard of neutral zzso zzso zzso in this zzso is determined by the complex A mating type zzso and zzso is one of several zzso functioning zzso zzso we conducted zzso simulations of a model with two zzso and varying levels of zzso to show that balancing selection should operate at each zzso zzso data show that strong balancing selection has indeed occurred at the zzso zzso The widespread geographic distribution of identical zzso zzso suggests that their association with differing A mating types is the result of recent zzso zzso
