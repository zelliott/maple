Based on the previous finding that certain zzso zzso zzso zzso having particular zzso zzso sequences could induce zzso and zzso and enhance natural killer activity, the present study was carried out to clarify the entire relationship between the activity and the sequence of zzso zzso The results indicated that the activity depended critically on the presence of particular zzso sequences including the zzso zzso The size and the number of zzso as well as the zzso sequences also influenced the zzso An zzso with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences showed the strongest activity among the zzso zzso
