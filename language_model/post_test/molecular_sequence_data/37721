The mouse p locus encodes a gene that functions in normal zzso We have characterized a zzso zzso zzso of the mouse p locus that is associated with a zzso syndrome, in addition to diminished zzso Mice zzso for this zzso zzso zzso show delayed growth and die within 2 zzso after zzso We have discovered that the zzso mice develop progressive zzso heart block and significant zzso changes in both cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso These observations are common characteristics described in human zzso The zzso of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso is associated with a zzso 7 zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso zzso inversion zzso both the p gene and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression has been examined by Northern zzso analysis and was found most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle in adult mouse zzso suggesting an involvement of zzso in muscle zzso The zzso zzso is thus a useful animal model in the zzso of zzso at the molecular zzso
