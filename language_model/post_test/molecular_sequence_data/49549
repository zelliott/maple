zzso T cells zzso the magnitude and durability of zzso responses in zzso and may serve as potent zzso cells within the tumor zzso The current study was undertaken to define novel zzso from the broadly expressed tumor zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso T zzso We have combined the use of a zzso binding zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify four zzso sequences derived from the zzso protein that served as zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients with active melanoma or zzso cell zzso failed to zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso whereas both normal donors and cancer patients with no current evidence of disease were responsive, particularly after short-term in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells also recognized zzso tumor cells that zzso expressed the zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso T cells that reacted against individual zzso zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso could serve as useful vaccine candidate components and may provide an zzso index of clinically important zzso immunity in patients with zzso cell zzso or zzso
