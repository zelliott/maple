zzso of the liver zzso of bovine zzso c zzso is reported to be zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso exist in the zzso regions for transcripts zzso these liver zzso suggesting that these regions may be involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso To explore this possibility, several bovine tissue zzso were zzso for any zzso factors that recognized the transcript zzso the liver zzso of zzso VIII zzso Such a protein factor zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in liver, zzso and lung tissue and was shown to require free zzso groups for zzso No binding activity, however, was found in zzso zzso Furthermore, this binding protein also recognized the zzso zzso transcript but was unable to associate with the zzso zzso the heart zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso distribution of zzso activity parallels the presence of the liver zzso in the mature zzso zzso It is therefore suggested that zzso may mediate the zzso regulation of zzso c zzso liver zzso zzso zzso
