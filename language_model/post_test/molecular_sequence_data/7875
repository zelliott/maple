The zzso gene zzso zzso replication initiation at the zzso coli origin, zzso zzso is also essential for zzso which acts at zzso and the zzso promoter to ensure that replication initiation occurs exactly once per zzso per cell zzso zzso is promoted by full zzso of zzso sites clustered in zzso zzso is specific to the zzso forms generated by zzso zzso protein zzso and DNA binding are zzso zzso interacts with fully zzso zzso strongly and zzso This reaction requires multiple molecules of zzso and zzso throughout zzso including segments involved in open complex zzso zzso interacts more strongly with zzso zzso in this case, zzso and zzso sequences are bound zzso Also, binding of zzso zzso by membrane zzso is due to zzso zzso interaction of zzso protein with the replication origin is likely to be involved in both replication initiation and zzso
