zzso genetic codes reported in zzso share the same zzso one zzso or two zzso of the three zzso stop zzso are translated into one particular zzso zzso In many zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are translated into zzso zzso is translated into zzso in zzso or into zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso translate zzso into zzso and that at least zzso in zzso zzso is zzso through a zzso zzso zzso This kind of genetic code has never been reported for any living zzso zzso analysis with zzso sequences corroborates that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a zzso group zzso zzso The differential translation zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso and the common evolutionary origin of zzso and zzso suggest that zzso genetic codes of zzso zzso could have the same zzso
