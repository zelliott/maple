In our previous study, zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso within 5 days zzso in zzso artificial freshwater zzso containing several zzso bacteria in addition to zzso Fourteen days after the zzso zzso zzso become zzso Here, we revealed that these zzso were not zzso zzso but zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso displayed more rapid initiation of zzso degradation than the parent strain zzso The zzso were unable to degrade zzso due to a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso zzso which was overcome by their transformation with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso genes was comparable in both parent and zzso zzso The deletion zzso became dominant in the artificial water zzso The zzso caused zzso to accumulate instead of zzso a toxic compound for the parent strain, and may be beneficial to host survival in artificial zzso
