The green fluorescent protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has recently attracted great interest as the first example of a cloned reporter protein that is zzso zzso Although successful in some organisms, zzso expression of zzso has not always been straight zzso In particular, expression of zzso in cells that require incubation temperatures around 37 degrees C has been zzso 

We have carried out a screen for zzso forms of zzso that zzso more intensely than the zzso protein when expressed in zzso coli at 37 degrees zzso We have characterized a bright zzso zzso with reduced sensitivity to temperature in both bacteria and zzso and have shown that the zzso acids zzso in zzso act by preventing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso can be manipulated by zzso zzso without disturbing its improved folding zzso and have produced a zzso folding zzso zzso that can be efficiently excited using either zzso ultraviolet or blue zzso zzso of zzso results in greatly improved levels of zzso in both microbial and zzso cells cultured at 37 degrees zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso greatly improve the sensitivity of the protein as a visible reporter zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of these zzso can be manipulated by further zzso without zzso affecting their improved folding zzso so it may be possible to engineer a range of spectral zzso with improved tolerance to zzso Such a range of sensitive reporter proteins will greatly improve the prospects for zzso applications in cells that require relatively high incubation zzso
