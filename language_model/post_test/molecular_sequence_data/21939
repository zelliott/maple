A novel zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to a high degree of molecular zzso using a combination of molecular exclusion and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso presented a molecular mass of 68 zzso and zzso estimated in zzso which were determined by two-dimensional zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso presented a high zzso acid sequence similarities with other zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso behavior with a zzso of zzso zzso and an optimum pH for zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso zzso which was abolished by zzso and inhibited by zzso and zzso These results suggest that the production of zzso is involved in subsequent zzso of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the bacterial growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessments of both bacterial strains suggest that the hydrogen zzso produced by zzso induce bacterial membrane zzso and consequently loss of zzso zzso This zzso exhibited a high zzso activity against the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso its activity was dependent on the production of hydrogen zzso and the 50% zzso concentration was estimated in zzso zzso
