We zzso that zzso was processed in accordance with zzso changes occurring in a zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned the novel putative zzso gene from zzso zzso via screening of a zzso zzso zzso library with a zzso gene zzso of zzso probe from zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso which encodes for an zzso acid zzso The cloned gene expression was observed in the neck and zzso zzso via Northern zzso using cloned zzso zzso as zzso but the clone was not expressed in any of other zzso We suggest that this gene may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso during normal tissue development and differentiation in zzso zzso
