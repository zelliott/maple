zzso species generally lack distinguishing zzso traits, and consequently, molecular methods are commonly used for zzso zzso Various methods for zzso identification have been proposed, each with their advantages and zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso simple and cost-effective method for the identification of zzso species and zzso Species could be readily differentiated based on the zzso mobility of amplified zzso zzso gene zzso zzso that differed by zzso zzso could be distinguished on zzso zzso zzso of species known to have zzso copies of zzso zzso gene contained multiple zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso confirmed that these multiple zzso represented type A and type B zzso zzso gene zzso zzso provides a reliable and sensitive analysis for zzso studies, environmental detection and diversity zzso
