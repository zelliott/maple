We analyzed the zzso and zzso relationships zzso of 181 zzso of zzso zzso New Jersey virus zzso causing disease in Mexico and the United States zzso from 2005 through zzso We detail the emergence of a genetic lineage in southern Mexico causing outbreaks in central Mexico spreading into northern Mexico and eventually into the zzso That emerging lineage showed higher zzso sequence identity zzso than that observed for multiple lineages circulating zzso in southern Mexico zzso Additionally, we identified 58 zzso from Mexico that, unlike previous zzso from Mexico, grouped with northern Central America zzso II zzso This study provides the first direct evidence for the emergence and zzso migration of a specific zzso genetic lineage from endemic areas in Mexico causing VS outbreaks in the zzso In addition we document the emergence of a Central American zzso genetic lineage moving zzso and causing outbreaks in central zzso
