zzso zzso type II zzso is a rare zzso disorder that is characterized by a lack of the zzso that zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso and the zzso of zzso to zzso The disease is characterized by an elevated urinary zzso of zzso and zzso The increased zzso zzso can cause zzso and zzso and can, in some cases, result in zzso failure and systemic zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone from a human liver expressed sequence tag zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis identified a zzso zzso clone that zzso a zzso zzso open reading zzso The open reading frame encodes a predicted zzso zzso acid protein with a mass of 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clone into zzso cells verified that it zzso an zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Database analysis of human zzso reveals widespread tissue zzso indicating that the zzso may have a previously zzso role in zzso The zzso structure of the human zzso gene was determined and contains nine zzso and eight zzso and spans approximately 9 zzso zzso on zzso zzso Four zzso patients representing two pairs of siblings from two unrelated families were analyzed for zzso in zzso by single strand zzso zzso zzso All four patients were zzso for a single zzso deletion at zzso 35 in zzso 2, resulting in a premature stop zzso at zzso zzso The zzso that we have identified represents the first characterization of an animal zzso zzso The data we present will facilitate future genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis of zzso These data will also facilitate zzso testing and prenatal testing in families affected with zzso to aid in genetic zzso
