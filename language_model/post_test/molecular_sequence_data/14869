Many species of pocket zzso and their zzso chewing zzso have broadly zzso zzso indicating a history of frequent zzso For a variety of reasons, zzso of zzso hosts and zzso are expected to be less zzso for more recently zzso zzso This study is the first of its scale in the pocket zzso and chewing zzso system, with its focus entirely on comparisons among populations within a single species of host and 3 chewing zzso species in the zzso zzso species zzso We examined zzso DNA from a total of 46 specimens of zzso zzso collected from 11 populations of the pocket zzso host, zzso zzso We also examined nuclear DNA from a subset of these chewing zzso zzso zzso were compared with a published pocket zzso zzso zzso to expectations, we observed a statistically significant degree of parallel zzso in these closely related hosts and their zzso We also observed a higher rate of evolution in chewing zzso lineages than in their corresponding pocket zzso zzso In addition, we found that 1 zzso species zzso zzso may not be a valid species, that subspecies within zzso zzso are not zzso zzso and that zzso and genetic evidence support recognition of a new species of zzso zzso zzso
