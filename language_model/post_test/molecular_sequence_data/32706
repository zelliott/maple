Recent experiments have identified peptides that adhere to zzso and zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso Carlo simulations with implicit zzso to investigate the behavior in zzso solution of four such zzso all with 12 zzso At room temperature, we find that all four peptides are largely zzso which is consistent with experimental zzso At the same time, we find that one of the peptides is structurally different and more flexible, as compared to the zzso This finding points at structural differences as a possible explanation for differences in zzso properties among these zzso By also analyzing designed zzso of two of the zzso an experimental test of this hypothesis is zzso
