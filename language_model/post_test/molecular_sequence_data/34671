zzso bacteria of zzso zzso are common human zzso and urinary tract zzso In the zzso zzso there are four clinically important named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and three unnamed zzso zzso 4, 5, and zzso The clinical significance of zzso zzso described in 1982 as a new species, is poorly zzso The aim of this work is zzso characterization and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain isolated from a 34-year-old patient with zzso zzso In this characterization we will also include a zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso isolated from the same patient after 12 days' treatment with zzso and other zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were obtained against these two strains and zzso and zzso zzso were extracted from the bacterial mass of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso investigations the following tests were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso passive zzso zzso zzso of these tests, zzso of rabbit zzso with the respective zzso and repeated zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

The zzso studies of the zzso extracted from both zzso zzso strains showed the identity of both preparations of zzso from zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso four different types of zzso were described and zzso 

Both investigated zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains were classified to the zzso zzso zzso
