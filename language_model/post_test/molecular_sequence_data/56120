zzso of zzso zzso zzso switch spontaneously and frequently between a white and an opaque zzso Recently, an zzso zzso zzso was cloned and was demonstrated to code for a zzso By using a differential zzso screen, a second zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and its corresponding gene has been zzso zzso is zzso regulated with zzso but resides on a different zzso During zzso mass conversion from opaque to white, zzso of zzso and zzso is immediately inhibited by the increase in temperature, but zzso of both genes can be rapidly zzso by a zzso in temperature prior to zzso zzso However, the capacity to rapidly induce both zzso and zzso is lost coincidentally with the second zzso round of cell division and zzso commitment during mass zzso zzso shows no significant base or zzso acid sequence zzso with a known gene or zzso zzso However, the deduced zzso protein exhibits several interesting zzso including a zzso zzso zzso with 26 zzso zzso a zzso of zzso for the last 100 zzso zzso two zzso repeats adjacent to zzso repeats, and the potential for zzso zzso within the zzso zzso No zzso reorganization was evident in the proximity of zzso during zzso zzso and zzso accompanying the zzso zzso
