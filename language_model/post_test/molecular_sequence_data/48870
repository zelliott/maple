A zzso study was conducted on strain zzso isolated from a zzso sample of the East Sea, Republic of zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analyses showed that strain zzso belongs to the family zzso and is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso and the major respiratory zzso was zzso The polar lipids of zzso were zzso two unidentified zzso and two unidentified zzso zzso zzso data indicated that strain zzso represented a distinct species, separate from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso : 0, zzso : 1 G and zzso : 0 zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso The isolate was zzso strictly zzso short zzso and zzso by zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso pH zzso zzso zzso and with zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso The overall zzso features of strain zzso were very similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso but only strain zzso had nitrate zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso is proposed to represent a novel species, zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso
