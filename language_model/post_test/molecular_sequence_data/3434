zzso zzso DNA sequences were characterized for five members of the wheat high molecular weight zzso zzso gene family to understand more of the structure, control, and evolution of these zzso Analysis revealed more sequence conservation among zzso regions than between zzso regions, with differences mainly zzso to zzso events involving putative zzso and several miniature zzso zzso elements zzso Both zzso long terminal repeat zzso and zzso zzso sequences are represented in the zzso zzso One of the zzso is a novel class, but another zzso is related to the zzso zzso family and is widely represented in zzso express sequence tags zzso zzso DNA of the longest zzso a 20 zzso zzso including and surrounding the zzso zzso zzso showed additional cereal zzso sequences both immediately zzso and 3' to the zzso coding zzso The zzso activities of sequences related to these zzso putative genes and the zzso regions were indicated by matches to wheat and other zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso and several zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate potential zzso immediately zzso each of the zzso zzso binding activity in the predicted regions was confirmed for two of the zzso zzso
