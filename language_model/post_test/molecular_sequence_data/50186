zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso cells revealed two zzso of which only one is sensitive to zzso transformation by zzso The corresponding tumors produce zzso and grow in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso In the present investigation, zzso gene regulation was compared in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that upon expression of zzso zzso clones but not zzso clones express low levels of zzso zzso as detected by reverse zzso chain zzso Treatment with zzso a calcium zzso induced high levels of zzso expression only in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell fusion between the zzso clone 20 and the zzso zzso line zzso led to zzso of zzso expression and to the requirement for zzso zzso for in zzso growth and tumor zzso In contrast, zzso clone 15 lacked zzso activity and failed to zzso zzso expression in zzso hybrids which grew in zzso without added zzso Our results indicate that zzso gene expression is a critical zzso for the generation of zzso mast cell tumors and show that disturbances in zzso gene regulation can be detected already at the zzso level in zzso zzso zzso
