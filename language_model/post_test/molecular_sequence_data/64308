A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso sample of zzso the Korean tidal zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence analyses indicated a moderate relationship to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso % zzso Depending on the zzso zzso used, the isolate either formed a zzso zzso with zzso zzso or was recovered as a sister group of a class containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso features of the zzso isolate were similar to those of zzso zzso but several zzso and zzso properties, including nitrate reduction, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 13 carbon sources, distinguished strain zzso from zzso zzso The zzso data presented in this study indicate that the isolate should be classified as a novel species in the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore proposed for the zzso zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
